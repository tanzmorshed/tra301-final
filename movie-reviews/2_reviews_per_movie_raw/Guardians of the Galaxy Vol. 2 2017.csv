"Platypuschow","9","57","78","25 March 2018"," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Exceeds already high expectations
","Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.<br/><br/>I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.<br/><br/>Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.<br/><br/>Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.<br/><br/>Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.<br/><br/>This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.<br/><br/>With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.<br/><br/>This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Cast are great again<br/><br/>Charm returns<br/><br/>Excellent nostalgic soundtrack<br/><br/>Looks amazing<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Only one movie with Baby Groot? Noooo!<br/><br/>They seem to have dropped Drax's taking everything literal jokes away<br/><br/>Michael Rosenbaum was wasted<br/><br/>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br/><br/>Batista should have skipped over wrestling and just been an actor"
"crberme","8","43","64","20 August 2017"," Great sequel overall
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a great movie, and I would say better than the recent superhero movies. I'm afraid thought that the first movie set the expectations so high that is not crazy to doubt if this one was able to keep up.<br/><br/>Visually is as good as the first one, the acting is on point and the soundtrack is dope. The plot is fine, although it falls under the ""knowing better the characters and realizing their sad and deep feelings"" clich√©. It leaves me with the feeling that the first one was innovative and fresh, wherever this one just reused the formula.<br/><br/>Apart from that, this is an entertaining and fun movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who is into superhero or science fiction movies. It doesn't disappoint."
"Harun_Karali","7","218","372","24 April 2017"," Almost as funny and charming as the first
","As someone who was floored by the first film, I was eager to see how the second installment in Gunn's trilogy(yes, it's a trilogy now) would pan out. To be honest, I was a bit anxious, as we are familiar with Hollywoods track record when it comes to sequels. However there are rare moments when the sequel lives up to it's predecessor. As is the case here, as Gunn delivers the same charm, humor and emotion as the first film. The big difference is the focus on Peter's story, As our heroin meets his long lost father Ego(brilliantly played by Kurt Russell), who shows up at the knick of time, as Rocket pisses off Ayesha(Elizabeth Debicki) who sends a space armada after them. To add the cherry on top of this pie is the soundtrack(Sam Cooke's Bring it on Home to Me), that was meticulously chosen. If you were a fan of the first, don't doubt, Gunn delivers a space opera that lives up to it's hype. I have high hopes for the future of the MCU, it's clear that the studio let Gunn's creativity speak for itself and boy did he have a lot to say."
"MichaelNontonMulu","9","182","310","27 April 2017"," The Sequel to Those Unusual Marvel Superhero in the Galaxy
","This movie was a very fun superhero film. It did not provide us with very heavy storyline, the premise was quite simple and best of it all, it was having lots and lots of funny moments. My wife and I truly enjoyed this movie as we had laughs all over the movie and there were even some emotional moments as well which was very lovely to see at the end (and made my wife very emotional). I love the chemistry among the Guardians, and I loved Baby Groot's very cute and adorable behavior. I also loved the opening scene which I think was very cool.<br/><br/>In addition to the good chemistry among the stars, I also felt that Mantis' character was fun to see, especially whenever she was interacting with Drax. In this sequel, it was also surprising to see Drax' very funny characterization and his comments. Both Yondu and Nebula also had larger important role in this movie compared to Volume 1. There was even a surprise new character played by Sylvester Stallone whom I understand would be having larger role in future Marvel movies.<br/><br/>Apart from those fun interactions and the nice light story, the movie itself was not the type of full of action scenes. Mostly it was done in the early stage, middle part and the ending part. The sound effects were good, the effects involving Baby Groot and Rocket were awesome, but I felt the CGI effects were not that nice, especially during the scenes in the Ego planet where it really looked computerized. However, it was not really a bothering scene. One thing that was quite curious for me is the trailer to this movie was already showing Kurt Russel portraying Peter's father, which I thought would be best kept hidden to avoid spoiler. But then as we continued watching it, I realized that it was more like a part that was supposed to intrigue us.<br/><br/>I personally felt that this movie was better than Volume 1, in term of the story and characterizations. And for those of you who knew that Marvel's movies would have some end credit scenes, better wait till the very end, since this film had got not 1, not 2 not even 3, but 5 post credit scenes altogether.<br/><br/>So if you enjoyed the first volume, you would enjoy this one even better. I would recommend you to watch the first one before seeing this one to have a better understanding on the movie. Though I am pretty sure that most likely you would have seen it. Now if you are a fan of a much heavier superhero movie, than this one may not suit your thirst, but I am confident that you would still be entertained watching this one."
"imdb2-5","5","247","432","28 May 2017"," Must disengage brain entirely to enjoy
","With so much talent in this film, it's so disappointing that the writers were right . Don't waste a dime on developing a sensible plot because the hordes of fans will eat this crap up like it was a 5 star meal. Hence the 8.1 star rating which reflects a demographic with time on their hands and a studio with plenty of marketing budget.<br/><br/>On the bright side - the CGI is great. The sets are beautiful. There are some very funny moments. The cast still has some chemistry with each other. And I've seen movies that were much worse and unwatchable than this one. But I wouldn't be honest if I didn't give this a very generous 5 because of the horrendous, deficient plot. And after this film I'd have to say that I've about had enough with this series. We've heard the story, had some fun with the characters and it's clear that what was fun, fresh and original is what it should have been - a one film wonder leaving Hollywood to develop another story. <br/><br/>Without giving away the big reveal or true spoilers, I'll explain the problem that are evident throughout the entire film:<br/><br/>(1) Repeated jokes as if we're supposed to be warmed to it, e.g. how dumb and oblivious baby Groot is (except when he needs not to be.) Funny at the opening moment and gets more difficult to stomach as we make our way through.<br/><br/>(2) The fact that our heroes are never really in danger. They are always somehow able to avoid dangers of the most extreme kind for prolonged periods while they joke during the encounter and then you know they will be saved by some unknown force to be named shortly.<br/><br/>(3) The abject stupidity of supremely smart characters. Because we need those whose level of intelligence is off the charts to continue to do some really stupid or missing the obvious for a prolonged period of time but just enough for our heroes to have the time to do something to save themselves and the galaxy from certain destruction.<br/><br/>(4) The explanation of the villain's plan made absolutely no sense. It was the usual pseudo-brilliant but amorphous hogwash that only made sense when you were 5 years old in the world of make believe without having to think about whether there was any logic.<br/><br/>(5) Occasional product placement. Fedex anyone? It's one thing to have a ""special moment"" and another to believe we're too stupid to understand why it happened. And then there is Baby Groot who exists and will continue to exist solely for merchandising... Too cute to kill off. ;)"
"rocketdog-74335","4","311","554","2 May 2017"," Very disappointing
","I have to start by saying the first film was my favourite film of the last few years and I'm a huge fan.<br/><br/>But let's be honest, this was a huuuge let down of a sequel after an amazing first film. The first had a good story, fleshed out characters, believable villains, genuine affection, drama, tension and a soundtrack that was original and used brilliantly.<br/><br/>This film had a weak, bloated story. Almost every scene filled with forced, cheap gags. Unbelievable and disappointing bad guys who tried to wise crack their through and lost any menace. Acting was poor apart from Yondu and Nebula who was woefully underused.<br/><br/>This was was like a comedy parody of the first film. A goofy, TV sequel that had none of the magic of the original blockbuster.<br/><br/>At one point Drax wisecracks that he does big turds. I'd venture none as big as this one.<br/><br/>Avoid"
"Reno-Rangan","8","29","44","13 October 2017"," Guardians' date with the creator.
","The first film was the most unexpected. That was one of the most colourfull space films I have ever seen. Youthful, energetic, fantastic visuals and so the same followed in this sequel as well. Not the same good, but stood to the expectation of the first film's success. This story does not have a great adventure in the galaxy. A simple quest, but a thrilling action-adventure. Now this accidental space gang is set to meet the creator.<br/><br/>It's time for Peter to meet his father, Ego. As he still upset with his mother's death, his encounter with his father was not as expectedly smooth. On the other side of the story, Rocket, Yandu, Baby Groot make their escape from the captivity. They all end up on the Ego's planet where the rest of the film going to take place. Being the guardians of the galaxy, their fight against the whoever threaten the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team.<br/><br/>James Gunn did it again. And I'm confident that he's going to do the same for next as well. All the actors were fantastic like the previous film. This time, little fun with little Groot. Anybody who loved the first would love it too. Being a franchise from Marvel universe, it is yet to join the 'Avengers'. So far so good. I'm now expecting one of the best of best trilogies. Bring it on the volume 3.<br/><br/>8/10"
"immanuelwilliams1982","10","77","129","8 May 2017"," Open Mindedly Exploring the Chauvinistic Celestial Domain
","This story has a philosophically intriguing and imaginative theme. If a person lived forever and for millions of years, what would be his psychology. What if he is also able to manifest his physical body and his world through his thoughts. This movie presents a picture where this person becomes extremely egoistic. There is no 'she' to this 'him' and I think that's what went wrong with this guy.<br/><br/>He creates a wonderful planet and then to get rid of his loneliness goes around looking for other life in the universe. He finds many women, makes love to them and plants his seed on every planet he went so that he could take over the universe. He is able to destroy other beings and planets. This makes him think he could just destroy them whenever he wanted and walk away from the crime scene. But his son proves him wrong.<br/><br/>Although it is nowhere close, this story does remind of god the father and Jesus the son and another story where it all went biblical. So the son in the story realizes who is father is, and who his real daddy is, and the difference between the two.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of the story was the relationship between two sisters. Gamora and Nebula who were brought up by an abusive parent. Gamora remained beautiful because of her sister's sacrifices. I like the part where Gamora realizes this fact and starts appreciating her sister. Nebula was at the verge of killing her sister because she felt she had had enough. Love renders us weak and sacrifice has its limits. But in the end honest communication works its magic. The importance of role of communication in personal relationships comes to forefront altogether.<br/><br/>There are many other intriguing things like Yondu looking into Rocket's eyes and saying a magical phrase. Totally amazing movie. A must watch."
"drgrozozo","4","99","173","7 August 2017"," Here's how not to do a sequel
","OMG, what a terrible sequel to one of the best movies of the decade...<br/><br/>Shallow, unfunny, clich√©d, predictable and often pathetic, in many places poorly acted and directed, with overabundance of cheesy fake-looking rainbow effects.<br/><br/>It's like writers read all viewer comments to Vol.1 then added whatever people liked 100 times over into Vol.2. So the lovely 80s music vignette now becomes massive bore shoveled into every scene, complex Yondu-Peter relationship gets butchered into cheesy pathos, Yondu's character gets reduced to repeating Vol.1 whistling scene over and over, Rocket goes boring with highlights being Vol.1 repeats, Gamora/Nebula relation - again repeats, Groot no development at all beyond Vol.1 ending cute cgi.<br/><br/>The only character that actually gets improved is Drax, his lines are written and get delivered in the best manner of the first movie, unfortunately that can't keep this wreck afloat."

","*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*<br/><br/>As a huge fan of the first film, I went to watch the movie as soon as it came out. And I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all.<br/><br/>Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Offers so much thrills and an awesome cinematic experience, The action starts right from the opening scene and it doesn't end until the last 2 seconds of the film. The people behind the movie just knew how to not make the audience bored, and they succeeded at that.<br/><br/>I have to say that 3D ticket here is worth the additional price, because honestly, if any movie deserved to be really watched in 3D it's this one,It adds so much depth to the scenes and makes the movie alive.<br/><br/>The plot is interesting enough to keep you engaged and the pacing never really drags even with the movie's long duration.<br/><br/>The soundtrack just fits right into its place and it really helped the background quality, providing the best classic songs. The movie is also really humorous and I found it as funny as the first.<br/><br/>Due to the movie's high budget, the scenery is Amazing! The movie feels like a very entertaining roller coaster, it was a joy and all the crowd were very pleased.<br/><br/>In the end, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Is a MUST-SEE for fans of the first one and a VERY ENJOYABLE ride for everyone else. It's simply one of these movies that are always fun to watch."
"keal","10","195","359","7 May 2017"," Laugh out loud funny movie filled with many touching moments that will make you cry!
","Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is such a glorious celebration of all that's enjoyable about going to the movies. It makes you feel you've gotten your money's worth, from the ticket price to all the expensive food and drink items. Everyone in the theater walked out chatting and laughing about the movie. I can't think of a way to make a more enjoyable movie than GOTG 2.<br/><br/>From the beginning, the MARVEL STUDIOS logo has changed. While it's slowly creeping on screen, we used to see comic pages flipping. That's now replaced with movie footage, and the music is now epic, making the MS logo feel more classy and majestic.<br/><br/>The opening credits scene is just so creative, and a scene like that could very well be one of the best ending scenes in another movie. But in GOTG 2, it's just the opening! Looking back on the entire film, I can't believe in this age where we're all so used to seeing flashy space and combat action scenes, everything gets better and better as this movie rolls along towards the ending.<br/><br/>This is a really character-driven movie, and every single main actor gets fantastic screen time. No one is in the background. They all shine. Jokes are non-stop, and there are WAY more jokes in this sequel. Some of the humor is so unexpected and wacky that you'll just burst out loud laughing! You'll hear other people in the theater continue to laugh as the movie rolls on and you'll laugh again just thinking about what happened on screen.<br/><br/>As funny as this movie gets, you'll be pleasantly blindsided with some extremely heartwarming scenes between characters. How can a movie make people laugh so hard, then the next minute have everyone sobbing, or at least fighting back tears? If you're the type of movie-goer who likes to brag that you didn't cry through an emotional scene, prepare to get tested. GOTG 2 has many emotional scenes, and they happen at the weirdest, most unexpected times. My bet is, you WILL cry at least once. There's just too many good scenes coming at you and you'll stumble. This movie is such a rare roller-coaster of emotional ups and downs. Enjoy the ride! <br/><br/>The end credits are filled with things to keep you sitting in your chair. Don't make the mistake of walking out. There are something like 5 or 6 end scenes dispersed through the credits. You'll see people in the theater standing to leave, then sitting. Standing again, then sitting down. There's just so much going on in the end credits!<br/><br/>From start to finish, this movie has everything and the kitchen sink thrown in. It's all bigger, better, funnier and way more emotional than the first GOTG, and easily the most entertaining thing you might witness this year in the theater. Don't miss this movie!"
"tdevil9","1","287","538","1 May 2017"," A flashy production with no substance
","At the time of writing, there are only 7 out of 120 user reviewers that did not like the movie. I know I will receive a multitude of unhelpful votes for voicing my honest feedback about this movie. However, I hope that my feedback will be helpful for people who are able to judge a film in an objective manner so that they, at least, will be able to save their hard earned cash.<br/><br/>Firstly, the main antagonist is a Marvel character that has been completely changed for this movie. It bears no background similarity to the character in the comics whatsoever. I understand that the Marvel movies are all about making a spin on the comic book story arcs, but this difference was far too large for me to accept.<br/><br/>Whilst watching the movie, I had to ponder whether I had stepped into a Marvel Superhero version of ""Fast and Furious"". There was a continuous message that family is important and how the protagonists became who they were due to disenfranchised childhoods. Whilst this is a valid point, I do not feel that it belongs in a superhero action movie as it serves no purpose. Worse was when the message contradicted itself when we see Peter Quill betrayed by his Father. The clumsiness of this contradiction did nothing to alleviate the sickly sweet message that the movie was trying to convey. I get that James Gunn is trying to send out a message to the younger generation but I would think that kids go to watch a superhero movie for the action, and will not really appreciate or acknowledge the message that he is driving.<br/><br/>Unlike the first movie, there was a distinct lack of character focus and their abilities. It could easily have been an action movie without superheroes. In fact, the movie seemed to be focused on two characters when it came to showcasing their abilities. One of these had a sequence that was inspired by the Quicksilver scenes in the X-Men movies. The other was extremely underwhelming and was defeated far too incredibly when you consider the differences in age and experiences. None of the characters were interesting with the exception of Nebula and Mantis. However, Pom Klementieff played her role like a stuttering female cyborg that I even thought the role was played by an East Asian actress before I checked the cast members. The actors paid to play the new characters were miscast in my opinion. Sylvester Stallone's performance reminded me of his Judge Dredd and not in a good way.<br/><br/>It was clear that the popular factors in the first movie were taken and overdone in the second movie. Drax was made to look like a dumb fool once again but even more than in the first movie. While the CGI effects were good, the cuteness factor of Baby Groot served only to market the movie to kids and geek girls, and to rake in merchandise profit. There was also constant mention and focus on the cassette mix which was totally unnecessary (again, for merchandise promotion).<br/><br/>With the exception of Captain America and the first two Avengers and Thor movies, why do the Marvel movies have to be over-saturated with humor? It's one thing to market the movies to a wider audience but it's totally another thing when it's taken too far, and the humor becomes so clich√©d."
"stormryder_thomas","8","218","404","24 April 2017"," The Guardians Strike Back
","I was lucky enough to see this on 20/4 at an industry screening which allowed me to sit on the film for a few days before I gave a review. I can safely say GotG Volume 2 absolutely wowed me. I can't believe these bunch of lovable misfit a-holes made one of the most MATURE themed films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is visually gorgeous. The use of colour, design and the straight up imagination of the source material outstand any MCU film prior. The action is glorious and astonishing. One scene in particular, I was jaw-dropped in its entirety as direction, action-choreography and music all came together so harmoniously. And THE MUSIC! What an eargasmic soundtrack. The songs are more poetic this time around and fit the subtext of the film perfectly. The trailers gave me the feel of the first movie; a straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy with a simple point A to B plot. GotGV2 is so much MORE than this! This film is patient with its characters and there is an emphasis on growth and family. It manages to balance 7-8 characters and gives almost all of them a satisfactory emotional arc. There is so much to chew on here with the issues and motifs felt by certain characters and I applaud that! This film is vastly different and I'm glad because I just love these characters so much! They are still so fun and energetic. It's great to see the team again and how their dynamic transforms. Also I forget to mention, the film is laugh-out-loud funny! All thanks to Drax who is by far the most comedic character and put me stitches.<br/><br/>Overall, this was both (I can't believe I'm saying this about the Guardians of the Galaxy) an emotionally dense and exciting blast. If Guardians 1 is the fast-paced Sci-Fi adventure like Star Wars was in 1977, then Vol. 2 is the deeper & richer film that takes its time to expand our beloved characters; just like Empire Strikes Back."
"luzm88","9","51","86","5 June 2017"," Great Adventure
","My main criticism was that I don't feel like you needed to have seen the previous movie to really get/enjoy this one. You would have missed out on the bonding of the team and the backstory of Nebula and Gamora, but overall you'd be fine. <br/><br/>Overall, though it was a great movie, it felt more like a side story in the many adventures of the Guardians of the Galaxy and less like an actual continuation of their main story. Why? Well, we did have that wonderful cameo of great actors who portrayed the original Guardians. We had our Stan Lee cameo. And, we had Peter Quill's backstory explained. Other then that, I don't yet see how any of this advanced the main plot of Thanos or of any big threat to the Galaxy. <br/><br/>My favorite parts of the movie were Rocket and Yondu's character growth. I felt tears in my eyes when Yondu died. Such a powerful message that parentage and parents can be such distinct things. Also, Gamora and Nebula's sister bonding and reconciliation. Their scenes were so much of what it is to be a sister. One cannot hate in such a way without there being love in the mix.<br/><br/>The only truly plot advancing potential that I saw in this movie were the after-credit scenes. Especially the one with Adam. Only time will tell if any more of this will have an effect on the Marvel Universe. Regardless, this was a great story to tell."

"BiiivAL","8","95","174","5 June 2018"," Family cosmagogue
","Today I dedicated to the Guardians of the Galaxy. I remembered the contents of the first film and got acquainted with the second part, which placed a great emphasis on the drama of characters and family values. With this text, I will try to orient you to watching this movie, because despite the fact that the film, though done by the templates of the first part, even stylistically and graphically turns out to be the ideological continuer of the first film. James Gunn stayed at the role of the project to revive the popularity of forgotten heroes, which by two thousand and fourteen already no one remembered. The second series promised to be bigger in many ways, but could it? Let's understand!<br/><br/>Guardians of the galaxy angered the sovereignty of the Sovereign, their heads are hunted by space pirates, the ship is broken, and the team nearly cried to death. But there is no evil without good: The Star Lord met a long-lost father named Ego and learned the story of his origin. Because of which the Guardians again have to save this galaxy ... Synopsis is good, catching and logically coming out of the first film. The main question disturbing many: the second part was better or worse than the original. And here already from which side to look.<br/><br/>""Guardians 2"" are made at the same high level as the first part. They are as spectacular and funny and, perhaps, even more ambitious and touching. There is everything that should be in the film about the Guardians: a lot of humor, space battles, dizzying action scenes and music from the seventies. And, of course, Stan Lee's cameo and Howard's ducks.<br/><br/>But what's in the continuation there, so this is at least something fundamentally new, at least some serious differences from the original. ""Guardians 2"" is not a sequel like ""Terminator 2"" or ""Aliens"", raising the series to a new level, but just another portion of adventure in a familiar style. It can be compared with the next episode of the series, which is no better and no worse than the previous one. And he loses only because he is not the first.
Still, the first ""Guardians of the galaxy"" was a terrific surprise. Nobody knew what to expect from the film about little-known heroes from the comic books Marvel. Nobody expected that a talking raccoon and not quite speaking tree would become symbols of 2014. And what to expect from the second ""Sentinels"", everyone knew, and this is what they give: ""Pirates of the Caribbean Space."" Parallels between the two Disney franchises and the truth is a lot. Space pirates behave exactly like the team of the ""Black Pearl"", and the Raccoon raccoon with its antics makes us remember Jack Sparrow. Well, Peter Quill reminds Will Turner, who finally found his lost father. And absolutely not how I expected.<br/><br/>James Gunn did not deceive, saying that the main theme in the film would be the theme of the family. She touched not only Peter, but also each of the Guardians. Gamora finds out the relationship with her sister Nebula and serves as a caring ""mommy"" for dunces-muzhiks. The rocket (do not call it raccoon!) Actually becomes a father for Little Grunt. Even Drax the Destroyer, which in the first film seemed almost superfluous, was revealed due to the fact that he found himself a pair. He flirts in a friendly way with the fragile empathic Mantis, and their joint scenes have come out touchingly awkward and comical.<br/><br/>Characters and parallel lines in the sequel became more. To the cast was added Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone (and David Hasselhoff flashed into the cameo). The composition of the Guardians themselves grows, and they will look more than the Avengers. It is felt that it is harder for Gann to come up with memorable remarks for everyone and from time to time he gives slack. This is especially noticeable in jokes: sometimes they roll down to humor below the belt, and not an adult, as in ""Deadpool"", but some school. When a raccoon threatens to throw a fecal to a friend, when the great Kurt Russell has to joke about his huge penis, it does not cause laughter, but awkwardness. Such moments can spoil the impression from the first half of the film.
t is better where the director succeeds in the scenes, where humor is born from the action itself. As an example, any scene dedicated to Little Gruda is suitable. He does not say much, but everything he does, whether it's trying to get friends out of captivity, dancing during a battle or careless handling of a bomb, turns out touching and hilarious. If the slogan of the first part was ""Especially the raccoon"", then the second would come up with the slogan ""Especially Little Grut"".<br/><br/>In ""Guardians 2"" there is already no magic spark of novelty, which caused such enthusiasm in the first part. But this is a competent and qualitative continuation. The scale has grown, the characters are better exposed, and jokes and memorable scenes would be enough for a few more films.<br/><br/>Verdicting: The movie turned out to be excellent, it has a smart picture, intelligent thoughts (the dialogue between Drax and Mantis about love of freaks and beautiful ones was remembered) and moments of non-stop dynamics with colorful explosions and blasters, in the best traditions of the new ""Star Trek"". Of the merits: Yonda, Drax and Little Groot are well exposed, they really experience for them throughout the whole film, enchanting spectacle and jokes above the belt that have a place to be. From not very successful: jokes below the belt, ill-conceived villain and lack of novelty, but about the last point you forget completely, because you are immersed in the cinema with your head, because it tightens. I advise you to watch two films at once - the picture is more complete. All good and pleasant viewing!"

","James Gunn is clearly a fan of the work, and his love for the material shows through out the movie. Such a weird and bizarre universe so beautifully adapted to the screen.<br/><br/>This time around, part2 concentrates more on character development rather than being a plot driven movie. It concentrates on building the team dynamics and their relationships with each other. This enriches the movie's universe and is a decision with long term considerations for the series. <br/><br/>Even if you miss out on the amount of plot, you will be easily distracted by the great humor. The jokes are well written through out the running time. I haven't had so many laughs in a movie since Deadpool.<br/><br/>The plot is well written and the extra character development time raises the stakes and our attachment to the characters during action scenes. The actions scenes are visually incredible, in fact the entire universe is colorful and beautiful to behold.<br/><br/>I had a blast watching this movie, and I think you will too."

","It's not often you wanted to hear side B of a tape. Unless you were too lazy to rewind it. I'm not sure how they did it but side B aka Vol. 2 is a greatest hits album. It went double Vibranuim. The cast stays in complete character only improving by letting the audience get to know and love them. Even Drax's absurd laugh was necessary. They did not drag you through the beef between sisters, x gang affiliates or father and son. They only produced an appropriate outcome for each situation that leaves the studio wide open for Vol. 3. The soundtrack is really its own character making even the most rhythmically challenged viewers feeling comfortable bobbing their heads. I don't watch trailers so hearing a familiar voice in a film that already had it all was the bonus track with features artist."
"urthpainter","3","163","315","8 July 2017"," Guardians of the what?
","The most astonishing thing about this movie to me is how fast I forgot the entire experience.<br/><br/>I kinda remember that cool opening scene with Groot - but after that? Guardians of the Galaxy 2 moves from one action scene to the next with a bunch of random banter about an extended family... which is completely contradicted in the final 15 minutes.<br/><br/>I also remember a bunch of absurd happenings during the action scenes. Improbable results, luck, weird environments that do not follow any known physics and characters screaming at one another over the ambient sound.<br/><br/>To paraphrase someones wisdom - the script wasn't the result of time, hard work, skill and craftsmanship. Things happen on the screen because the screen writers say so. This is what many superhero films have become: glorified CG cartoons that feel like really long TV episodes.<br/><br/>Ironic too - in an age of great TV writing, many blockbuster movies have been reduced to mass world wide appeal instead of any unique writer/director vision.<br/><br/>I really didn't like this movie 3/10"

"sjo-50785","10","64","116","4 May 2017"," The First Was My Favourite Film. This One Tops It.
","I adored the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Like many, I was blown away having gone in with no expectations, and laughed and grinned through the entire thing. It became my favourite film, on its own until Denis Villeneuve's masterpiece Arrival profoundly moved me, and so the stakes were high for the sequel that I arrived to with Baby Groot bobble-head in hand (bringing my cardboard cut-out was logistically impractical).<br/><br/>When I went to the midnight screening (28th of April in the UK), I loved it. Everyone in the room did. From the very first scene where the rich visuals filled my eyes, to the following scene, which made, and continues to make, me grin from ear to ear and is my favourite scene in cinema. to the laughs and action and thoughtful moments that made up the rest of this film; they managed to take all that was great about the first and ramp it up.<br/><br/>So yes, I exited the cinema at something past 2 in the morning, utterly delighted. I wanted to go again. And that I did. In the first five days of the film being open in the UK, I watched it four times (at three separate cinemas), and I have to say that I have been delighted with it every single time.<br/><br/>Standout performances in this film must go to Drax, Rocket and Yondu‚Äîwith the former taking the lead in laugh-out-loud moments in this film‚Äîwhile Kurt Russell has an absolute ball as Ego.<br/><br/>One of the many, many things that I loved about this film (whose soundtrack, I would argue‚Äîhaving had it on hard rotation for this last week‚Äîsurpasses the first's) is the fact that James Gunn's work is self- aware. We saw some of this in Deadpool, as Ryan Reynolds spent his time making fun of 'superhero landing's and similar superhero movie tropes, despite falling into a number of those, itself. In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, we see a step up from this. Instead of making fun of the clich√©s that come along with this sort of film, they embrace them and ramp it up at times, having the duel effect of accepting that there are certain hoops that need to be jumped through while also retaining the sense of fun and ham for which the first was so lauded. Additionally, this also means that any sentimental message is passed on, while also you're aware that the tongue is rooted firmly in cheek: much akin to somebody who uses hyperbole to tell their partner that they physically radiate beauty- although the manner of delivery isn't meant to be taken seriously, the message is still genuine. <br/><br/>Chris Pratt does this very well; I'm convinced he's not a very good dramatist, he's just such a charismatic and funny person that he gets away with it, which works perfectly well in situations like this, as he makes comments that plainly point towards motifs within the film which, in a Shawshank or a film of that ilk would seem out of place and stilted, but work brilliantly in the context. (Disclaimer: I haven't seen Passengers and so don't know whether his performance here proves wrong my theory about his acting chops)<br/><br/>There are moments throughout the film that are surprisingly brutal for a Marvel film, definitely a high-end 12A, but not out of place, and there is a general joy that easily balances this out. <br/><br/>If you go to see Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, you should absolutely love it. Admittedly, I went in with a lot vested in the film being good, but I have been to see it thrice more after that, and it still holds up for me. What I would say, as was the case with my brother, is that going a second time may help because this film is chocked full (both in the sense of the story-line and visually) and going multiple times allows you to notice little moments throughout‚Äîwith there easter eggs galore for the Marvel fan, including references to the previous film. Also, I would recommend going to see it in 2D on your first showing: I went in 2D for my first two viewings, then IMAX 3D and then 2D again, and‚Äîalthough the 3D has some absolutely beautiful moments and really is striking‚ÄîI found that it distracted from the film at times and I spent time looking at the film, rather than watching it. <br/><br/>So yes, I could not recommend this film highly enough. James Gunn does a fantastic job of giving us a film that helps us learn more about these characters; care more about them; see them in battle and, most importantly, meet Baby Groot, who is a complete and utter delight. Bar one moment of slightly choppy editing (although this may just be my four viewings showing an over-analysis that most people won't notice) I could not fault it for the way it was put together, mixing light moments with dark brilliantly and keeping an excellent pace, and all of the cast are thoroughly watchable, with it a joy to be back in this gang's company.<br/><br/>Now, if you don't mind me, I'm going to go and re-watch the original, before, potentially, going back to the cinema this weekend. I am Groot."
"simonaortale","3","103","194","26 May 2017"," So disappointed
","I watched the first movie I believe at least 50 times, one of my favourite movie since the last 10 years; however this Vol. 2 really disappointed me. I think it's a goofy movie for kids, a bit different from the first one. The ""funny"" scenes have been dramatized too much, so much that they became stupid jokes. The movie itself is too long, no funny movie should ever be so long. You cannot keep people laughing for more than 2 hours...even if the movie was a REALLY funny movie (which it was not). I was expecting coming out this Vol. 2 for so long...I guess I created too many expectations for it. Go to watch the movie thinking that would be ""just OK"", my 2 cents."
"sojourner_the_traveller","1","108","205","28 May 2017"," 2+ hours of my life wasted

Ridiculous waste of time. <br/><br/>The first movie was witty, sharply written, original. This one - exactly the opposite. Nothing witty, nothing original, just so much ""cuteness"" I wanted to stick my fingers down my throat and barf.<br/><br/>Save your money, but more importantly save your time, and skip this horrendous so-called movie."
"AdmrlLocke","10","54","97","8 May 2017"," The Least Little Spoilers for an Outstanding Movie!
","Prior to seeing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, I said that it would have a hard time equaling the perfect blend of humor and action that the first Guardians achieved. After seeing Vol. 2, however, I have to say that it achieved a perfect balance of humor, action and even tear-jerking drama. Although I would hardly have believed it possible, I enjoyed Vol. 2 a bit more even than the first Guardians movie.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt does such a brilliant job of conveying dry, understated humor that it's easy to take for his performance for granted, but when I, and the rest of the theater, laughed over and over, it served as a good reminder just what great comedic talent he brings to what are genuinely serious superhero movies. Not to be outdone, Kurt Russell‚Äîa talented actor of whom I just haven't seen enough in recent years‚Äîdid a brilliant job of making Star Lord's father completely believable, even relatable, at the same time he turns totally creepy on us.<br/><br/>I have to give a shout out to Zoe Saldana, who some of you might know as Uhura in the Kelvin timeline Star Trek movies. It's hard for anyone to reprise the role brought so lovingly to life by Nichelle Nichols in original Star Trek, and I didn't even recognize Zoe under all that green makeup in the first Guardians movie. Knowing who she was in Vol. 2, however, I was impressed by her range as an actress, as she made Gamora completely and unrecognizably different than her Uhura. <br/><br/>Another talented actress I didn't recognize under all her makeup (or prosthetics) was Karen Gillian, who some of you might know as the red-haired beauty who played Amy Pond in 36 episodes of Doctor Who. Once again, her range as an actress made her character, Nebula, completely and utterly different from her Amy.<br/><br/>Sean Gunn, perhaps a less-familiar actor, unless you, like me, happen to enjoy both superhero movies and ""chick"" shows, brought the same sort of lovably bumbling humor to the character of Kraglin in the movie that he brought so enjoyably most weeks on the Gilmore Girls TV series. Gunn's performance contributed greatly to the movie's ability to make the entire audience laugh even when Chris Pratt wasn't on the screen.<br/><br/>Once you've seen Vol. 2‚Äîand definitely not before‚Äîtake a gander in the Internet Movie Database at the movie's cast, and you may be surprised to see several other talented actors playing roles either openly (but not advertised beforehand) or hidden behind makeup or CGI. Some of them you'll have already happily recognized during the movie, but the list of others that you probably didn't recognize might well delight you as did me. Let me warn you again though: if you haven't seen the movie yet, do NOT look at IMDb.<br/><br/>I would be remiss if I didn't mention the movie's absolutely outstanding use of 1970s music. Someone on the production crew grew up at the same time I did, and I have to give him or her credit for choosing some great songs from our youth that fit the events of the movie perfectly. The first movie had good period music too, but I have to say that when it comes to the appropriate use of 1970s music, the filmmakers might accurately have titled the Vol. 2 movie Guardians Beyond.<br/><br/>If you do go see Guardians Vol. 2‚Äîand I've tried my best to gush about the movie without giving away a single darned spoiler‚Äîmake sure you sit through the closing credits to the very, absolutely final, last second. Don't just wait patiently, either, for during-credits or after-credits scenes, but really, really, really try to pay attention to both the words and the images in the credits themselves, and you will be richly rewarded with even more humor.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 represents another unqualified cinematic triumph for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and sets the stage for what could well end up being at least two more. As a major DC Comics fan for more than half a century, I have to say that I wish the DC Expanded Universe movies had even a quarter as much talent putting together live-action DC superhero movies. Is there any chance that Warner Brothers might borrow some of the leading creative lights of Disney's Marvel Studios for at least one superhero movie?!"

Now, we all knew that Baby Groot is adorable and predictably he'll stole the show, but man...Drax, Rocket, Gamora, Nebula, Yondu even Mantis they're all awesome in their way.

","The first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was a welcome surprise, with engaging characters, funny lines, and a great portrayal of friendship in the most unexpected places. Times goes on, and relationships evolve and deepen in most cases. So in the end, there's plenty of action, back stories are connected, and it sort of makes sense.<br/><br/>The gang is at the center of mess started by Rocket when he steals some valuable items from their employers. Retaliation promptly involves a gang of thugs in pursue of our gang, and things become more complicated with the arrival of Peter's long lost father. This results in a series of interesting moments between father and son, but there's a nagging feeling that something doesn't fit, or that the whole truth is not out being told. The mystery keeps the story going, until the explosive revelations in the last section of the film.<br/><br/>The same elements that made the original successful are back, with everyone still displaying affection for each other in their own peculiar way. Rocket is rough at the edges but can't hide his soft side. There's plenty of cuteness in Baby Groot, and Saldana and Pratt are still working out the ""unspoken"" aspects of their relationship.<br/><br/>One should enjoy the visuals for most of the film, and the story unfolding with the best coupling of pop music and a story line since ""Mamma Mia"". There's a sense of nostalgia that wasn't present in the first film, and using some obscure pieces makes their success even more interesting.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this works well, and we're looking forward to Groot's next growing phase."

","The first Guardians was great. It was unexpected, fresh, funny, with exciting characters and a decent story. For the sequel they kept the characters, but the jokes were forced (I only had a few laughs), the characters, although they were the same, became much less likable, and there was hardly any story. It was boring, and after the first hour or so, I was eagerly waiting for the movie to end. While in the first film the old school music was a clever tool to create a unique atmosphere, in this one it quickly became tired, as the movie was too heavily relying on it. Also, they used waaaaay too much exposition. Almost everything you learn about the characters, their backstories and the plot itself, they tell you through dialogue. (That's poor writing.) One more thing that really bothered me (among many other things) was Sean Gunn. He is clearly not a good actor, but for some reason (probably because he's the director's brother) he got much more screen time than in the first film. And it didn't work. Just like most of the movie.<br/><br/>3/10"

The aforementioned acting was weak, not only did the story lack substance, but practically every interaction is inevitably guided towards infantile, unintelligent humor. The CGI/Animation were not up to the standard that we are accustomed to from Marvel, it was just flashy and all over the place. I usually try not to write any negative reviews, but this was just too much to handle. I am a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I was in awe as to how awful this movie was. Marvel movies have silly humor here and there but a good portion of the jokes are well placed in their movies, they can even be intelligent and memorable; but this... whatever this was... horrendous writing.

","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is less smart ass than the original and all heart. ""Guardians 2"" is all about family. ""Vol. 2"" is the movie rarity‚Äîthe sequel greater than the original. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" retains its whimsical irreverence and funnier than thou swag with stunning visuals. From the opening sequence the Guardians hilariously thrash and get thrashed by a galactic serpent on some distant planet. Their mission is to recover some invaluable unpronounceable energy batteries for the elitist Sovereign race. Director and Writer James Gunn establishes the veiled narrative thread, and the movie is warp speed ahead.<br/><br/>Incredible action and wisecracks aside what creates ""Guardians 2"" as special is family. I was moved and inspired as Chris Pratt's Peter confesses, ""Sometimes, the thing you've been looking for your whole life is right there beside you all along."" From the first ""Guardians"" we recall the deadly rivalry of the sisters Gamora, played by strong nurturing Zoe Saldana, and Nebula, played by suffering and poignant Karen Gillan. After fighting nearly to the death, Nebula cries to her sister, ""You're the one who wanted to win! I wanted a sister!"" Saldana and Gillan are amazing. ""Guardians 2"" fiercely dares to touch your heart.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt impressively chiseled his body to play Peter Quill. He admirably helms the action star mantle. He makes ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" greater as a whole. He does charming smart ass whether he is clumsily romancing beautiful Saldana's Gamora or delivering throwaway on-liners. Pratt's humanity distinguishes him as a true star. Peter discovers his father Ego, played by charismatic Kurt Russell. Ego is the Celestial-- literally a god, who left Peter's dying Mother. Peter asks his Father if she was the love of his life, why he left her. Peter says, ""I had to watch her die!"" <br/><br/>Michael Rooker's Ravager thief Yondu was the one who raised Peter in Ego's absence. All is not what it seems. Rooker's nobility and compassion resonates the profound conflict of Peter's Fathers. Ego tells Peter that he loves him, having finally found him after all these years. He wants to share his legacy and power with his son. James Gunn brilliantly orchestrates the interstellar action, wisecracks, and tragedy. He fearlessly evokes his version of Shakespeare in this comic book tale. ""Guardians 2"" is wildly entertaining with the great soul. <br/><br/>Hysterical mercenary Rocket, the cybernetic raccoon voiced by sarcastic Bradley Cooper, steals some of the Sovereign batteries as lovely parting gifts from the arrogant golden skinned jerks. Humorless Queen Ayesha, played by wonderfully zealous Elizabeth Debicki, sends her 'gamer' operated space fleet upon the Guardians in retaliation. Fortunately, Ego and his companion Mantis, played by whimsical beauty Pom Klementieff, save our heroes from destruction. <br/><br/>Ego tells Peter that he is his father. Peter, Gamora, and Drax, played by brutishly funny Dave Bautista, agree to accompany his Father to his home planet Ego‚Äîthe planet he created. The visual images of Ego are idyllic and serene. Russell's Ego is both omnipotent and the great enigma. Mantis is the gifted empath, who helps him sleep and protects his secrets. Ego welcomes his son home, revealing his destiny. Ego doesn't necessarily add up. Is this what Peter wished for?<br/><br/>Director Gunn's ""Guardians 2"" invents the narrative spectrum of David Hasselhoff jokes, cool retro '70s rock, kick ass martial arts, galactic ship battles, and quirky charming relationships. With Gunn's direction all his stars give their best. Bautista's hulking tatted blue warrior Drax is crude, brave, and soulful. Klementieff's Mantis is mesmerizing charm. She is genuinely kind, crushing on Big Drax. Saldana is awesome. She has a commanding and calming screen presence. Gunn could have leveraged more romance in Gamora and Peter's love story. Throughout Pratt and Saldana generate authentic chemistry. The narrative focus is on Peter's bond with his fathers, and Gamora's reconcile with estranged sister Nebula. Saldana is radiant and noble with Gillan's surprising Nebula. Gillan's humanity emerges as we empathize for her desire to be loved. <br/><br/>I think ""Guardians 2"" becomes the story of the Fathers and their son ‚Äîof love and destiny. All is not what it appears. Russell and Rooker are eloquently polarizing forces. Pratt embodies courage and fearless vulnerability as Peter boldly defines the man he wants to be. ""Guardians 2"" is touchingly, tearfully about unconditional love and choice. Considering the grand design of the movie that is the wondrous surprise. Simple and sweet. I loved ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2""."

And for this reason Marvel makes tons of $$$ without any quality improvement or originality, because as drones, we all just gobble it up. It's like we have been given a command: ""This year you will see the following movies and not hold them to any standard, kapeesh!!"" <br/><br/>Marvel movie story lines have been declining while at the same time special effects and better actors getting hired has been increasing. Like how winning an Oscar now lands you a role in a super hero/big budget production rather than another artistic role: Brie Larson in Captain Marvel (and the horrible Kong), Lupita Nyong'o in Star Wars (ok, that's not Marvel, but still a huge franchise.), Jared Leto as the Joker (DC, I know), but you get the picture. This creates a conundrum in our heads: good acting, great special effects, bad story writing, so, hmmmm.......does this mean that I liked it? Should I go with the flow and say I liked it, because critics aren't gonna diss a movie that's sure to make $$$ and I don't wanna seem like a killjoy or shame myself in front of my firends? You know, I'll see the next Marvel movie and then decide.<br/><br/>And so this year, the cycle begins with us giving our money to Guardians of the Galaxy V2. Expect nothing more than what the trailer has to offer. Or see the first one again and it'll be the same as seeing V2, you'll just save money. The story does advance with Kurt Russell starring as Starlord's dad. Kind of a rehash of ""No/Luke....I am your father."" It's good when they hire good actors. Make-up and special effects are great. But in all, I wouldn't use the words ""enjoyable"" or ""exciting."" I'll just say, ""Ritual completed, onto the next superhero movie.""<br/><br/>Hey I'm a victim here nonetheless. I'm not criticizing people for seeing Guardians, as I also did, but I'm getting to get critical of us who every year, dish out our money for these superhero movies, which are in fact not becoming any better in quality, and studio execs thinking that they are creating masterpieces because of the gross $$$, hence thereforth making no extra effort to make a better movie. <br/><br/>So see it, or stay at home and stare at the wall...it's up to you.

"scandinavianmail","4","79","149","28 April 2017"," Joyless and contrived
","Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is clearly the least of the whole Marvel pack so far. It tries very hard to recreate the joyful nonsense of the first volume, but fails consistently, rather targeting one-off jokes than investing in its characters that jump, fall and evade bombs, bullets and lasers like Tom and Jerry in space, with no sense of tread whatsoever. Star-Lord himself, while still central to the ""plot"", seems strangely impersonal, dutifully reacting to events around him rather than guiding the action. The movie takes forever to end and offers no surprises on the way.<br/><br/>At the end you realize that it has all been nothing but a setup for the next volume, like a cut from an endless Marvel sausage, served shinier than ever but with not much taste."

","The Autistic Reviewers have been waiting for this movie to come out for ages now. The biggest question is: Was it worth the wait? You bet it was! ""Set to the backdrop of Awesome Mixtape #2, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' continues the team's adventures as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage."" It picks exactly where the last one left off. The moment the film starts off you know you are in for the ride of your life. The intro is easily one of the most memorable, hilarious and action packed things you'll see in a superhero movie. The sequel never loses its touch with the humor the first one provided. It also had really nice touches of emotion/sadness to it. it's also filled with twists and turns that you'll never see coming.<br/><br/>All the cast from the first one return. We have brand new characters in the movie such as Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone), Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), and Ego (Kurt Russel). Kurt Russel really steals a lot of the show as soon as he is on screen. What's surprising is Yondu. He has way more screen time in this one than he does in the first one. Michael Rooker plays him so well. But once again it's Rocket (Bradley Cooper) who gets most of the humor in this one.<br/><br/>It's action packed, it's never boring, it's hilarious and it's very emotional in loads of scenes with loads of twists and turns. What's not to love? Jay gives this 4.5/5 where as Nick gives this a 5/5 stars. Really check us out on facebook or Instagram! The Autistic Reviewers."

First minutes and I already think that it is, so beautiful and creative, funny and with some life. You look and live there on screens and feel all that fells Guardian team. Of course, director and screenwriter are great guys and other production team that in such nice way filmed that. Aah, music, make a big job there, great songs, they are beautiful and like to listening them, they make some deep emotions into movie with fun and sadness at same time. Oh, and actors, already knowing old retro-guy Kurt Russell and I don't know about Sylvester Stallone and was very surprised when I see him on screen, he is great, oh nostalgia. Beautiful Gamora, charismatic Peter Quill, love this character, MAN, and crazy Drax, reactive Rocket and cute kid Groot, and story around Yondu warmed my heart. It is funny and nice that they put a lot of different stories about each other, they have stories and a lot to say, in one move where interweave in one and one end, that was lovely to tears, exactly, tears, I have cried and was proud and happy. This family and friendship such strong, and so nice to be part of that team, to see and to be there, even if a little time. And proud as well that I can see Guardians of the Galaxy and know more about. Maybe you can even write something more deep and great, some wham, bam shang-a-lang and a sha-la-la-la-la-la review things, but that's all about this movie - wham bam shang-a-lang and more!"

Nothing I didn't like about this movie to be honest so rated a perfect 10.

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the 15th in the Marvel Universe (i wonder how the studio hasn't ran out of ideas). This film focuses on the guardians and how they must fight off the gold people after stealing something of theirs, while Star Lord discovers his father and discovers the truth about him. That is one of the things i loved about this movie, so many things are going on and it is not distracting at all. It still manages to stay fresh and funny. The actors are still pretty good and some have improved over the last movie like Drax and Yondu. I also thought Ego(star lord's father) was a fantastic character. The dialogue is funny and very creative. As always the CGI is very good and the movie just looked beautiful. As far as action goes, i thought this was a great improvement. In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the best movie i have seen all year so far, as it improves with the characters, plot, action sequences, and comedy. A+ or 10/10. AHHH MY NIPPLES!-Drax"

","I went into the movie blind, I expected something OK-ish but Vol.3 might actually be better then the first one!<br/><br/>The movie focuses more on developing the characters and shedding some light on their back stories making them more solid as people... well almost everyone, oddly enough there is just one character in the whole movie that doesn't gain any depth and yet manages to steal every single scene he's in and that's Drax (played by he of the infectious laugh Dave Bautista)<br/><br/>Fast paced and action filled what really shines in this flick is oddly enough it's comedic timing and choice of sound track, The humor here comes at you from left field (or from Drax, just him laughing will tickle your funny bone!) so it's never expected. <br/><br/>They try to push baby groot's cuteness a bit much for my taste and I did end up liking the rougher characters more (Rocket, Yondu and Drax) which more then made up for it. This was the first movie that made me want to run and get the sound track, I think the music here is even better then the first one.<br/><br/>10/10 from me, I'd recommend it to the whole family, even though there is violence in the movie it's done in a tongue and cheek way and never ""too"" grotesque,,, it's hard to think ""oh dear he killed everyone"" when you're laughing so hard!"

"alva3901","7","28","48","28 April 2017"," A compelling and funny sequel
","James Gunn returns with the sequel to the Guardians of the Galaxy with a movie that brings back many of the things that made the original so great. Is it greater than the first though? It is hard to rank one above the other, but I still believe the first installment (in what is now going to be a trilogy) deserves the nod. Led by the continuously likable and charismatic Chris Pratt as Star-Lord, we join the Guardians on a journey across the planets and galaxies. <br/><br/>Vol. 2 introduces many new characters such as Mantis and Peter Quill aka Star Lord's father, Ego, the latter played by Kurt Russell. The characters of Drax and Rocket were hilarious as usual, Drax especially in many scenes. We learn more of the intense relationship between the sisters Gamora and Nebula, but there were two who really stood out for me: Baby Groot and (surprisingly) Yondu. Baby Groots time on camera created many laughs, not just for his sheer cuteness, but for his interactions with the other characters. Yondu in this movie was given far more story to deal with, and it certainly paid off. It made you really care for him on an emotional level, which does sound quite unusual given he is a ravager. And last but not least, Star-Lord, and being the lead character, deserved all the attention because he was great. <br/><br/>The movie was another great entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and has created more anticipation for Avengers: Infinity Wars where we will see the Avengers team up with the Guardians. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 will provide more laughs, more emotion and more action for any movie viewer, led by a great director and cast."
"milk-carton-reviews","7","17","27","7 June 2017"," a great, entertaining sequel to a great movie
","I had my doubts about this one while going to the cinema, because I am a big fan of the first one and was genuinely worried that this one wouldn't live up to it's predecessor. While I do believe that the first one was a better movie, this one is what I would consider a perfect sequel. <br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 does the right thing by letting us get to know the characters a bit better. What I was most surprised by, however, was the choice to focus more on the character of Yondu than that of Chris Pratt's Star Lord. I thought it was a brilliant choice; Michael Rooker really shines in this role and is by far the best character in the movie. There are also some really cool action scenes with his arrow. Star Lord gets thrown to the side a bit, which is good since we already know pretty much everything about him except for who his dad is, which we do find out in this movie. All in all, the action was fun, the characters were great, the colors were great, it was much funnier than the first one (this movie is very much a comedy with some absolutely hilarious one-liners, mostly from Drax) and just overall a delightful experience. It definitely exceeded my expectations. <br/><br/>That being said, I do have just a few problems with this movie. They don't ruin the movie for me and they're not that bothersome, but still. We all know about the recent trend in big superhero movies such as this one, which is bad villains. And, honestly, all of my problems start with the villains. The Guardians are being followed throughout the movie by these golden people, which ultimately serve no purpose in the movie other than being ""villains"", I guess. I say ""villains"" because it's very much debatable what their motivations are and even who they are, and we just don't know enough about them to care. Everything they do is pretty ridiculous and over the top. The other problem I have is with Kurt Russel's character. Now, I love Kurt Russel and I was excited to see him play Peter Quill's dad, but his character just feels like a big exposition machine and, not to get too spoilery, goes the typical clich√© route. His motivations are clear, but very much overused and he's basically in the movie as a plot device. These two things, though, aren't that big of a problem to me because they were just devices for the movie to give Star Lord something to do (of course, a movie needs conflict), and they were background things working around the jokes, fun, and the adventure the characters we love were on. And the ending does get quite emotional.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think fans of the first movie will have no problems enjoying this one as well and I believe it has done everything right as a sequel. Let's just hope Marvel continues down this path of movies that know what they are and are just plain fun."

","The only redeeming part of this film is that it allows you to think about how fun the first movie was. <br/><br/>Two possible theories for why it is so bad:<br/><br/>1. they found a group of high school drama students with no creativity to write the screenplay, and all they had was a list of generic plot and character devices to use for ideas.<br/><br/>2. the writers purposely wrote in all the canned, tear jerking, feel good plot/character plays they could as a contest to see how good ratings they could get for something they whipped off in an afternoon and knew was garbage.<br/><br/>Just horrific if you are looking for anything remotely creative or interesting.

"cruise01","10","43","78","6 May 2017"," Guardians is back and has plenty of visuals and action. A great second chapter in GotG.
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is back and flashy as ever when it comes to its visual style of action, soundtrack, a fun cast, and the laughable humor. Usually sequels can be a let down after its predecessor set the standards high. And the build up momentum for the sequels is easily forgotten. Writer/Director James Gunn manages to continue what worked on the first movie and expand further with the characters he brought together. Yes, it is a ragtag of misfits that try to be a team and argue to each other with their own personal issues. In the end, they see each other not as friends but family. <br/><br/>The plot follows Peter (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) are tasked at fighting away a giant monster and protecting valuable batteries. Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) the leader of the sovereign race, who needed the guardians help for the task. After a dispute, leaving the guardians on the run away from Ayesha and her army of drones chasing them away. The guardians crash on a planet, where they come across Ego (Kurt Russell) who is Peter's father. Ego takes Peter, Gamora, and Drax to his planet. Meanwhile, Rocket, Groot, and Nebula (Karen Gillan) stay behind their wrecked ship, only to come across the Ravagers led by Yondu (Michael Rooker). Trying to claim the bounty on the guardians that is set by Ayesha. <br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy 2 has everything you can expect. It has plenty of action and the visual effects were colorful, and impressive. When Peter and his team visit Ego's planet. The visual effects were astonishing. The set pieces were great too. It does have its fun share of humor. It is fun to see a dysfunctional team trying to get along; you have Peter and Rocket with their arrogant cocky self. Nebula and Gamora personal conflict that keeps them fighting each other. The one thing that always drives Peter and his team is how they see each other as family. Also, there is baby groot which is always a scene stealer. Groot is small and cute, even from the opening moment of him dancing and needing music playing as the guardians are fighting against a giant monster. <br/><br/>The villains are usually what worry me, as several Marvel movies later. They all have that same motive and have that clich√É¬© routine. I was worried for a second in this film about who and what the villain was. Without giving away spoilers or details. This film villain is by far better compared to the first movie. Definitely, the villain does not show until later. It definitely leads the direction into a big climax with the guardians trying to save the galaxy yet again. <br/><br/>The guardians are tested personally as Peter, Gamora, and Drax are separated from Groot and Rocket being with Yondu. Gunn never lets a single moment become dull. There are easter eggs, celebrity cameos, etc. Also, there are five mid/post credit scenes that are worth checking out unlike the first movie end scene of Howard the Duck that was a waste. <br/><br/>Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a visually exciting sequel that surpasses the original. It has a fun cast and characters, the soundtrack is awesome, the visual effects and action is exciting, the villain is an interesting one, and James Gunn's fun direction makes it a flashy fun movie."
"curtismkeller","3","41","74","8 August 2017"," Marvel's First Turd (real person review)
","After reading through the sea of effusively positive reviews, I feel compelled to add to the short list of those who actually seemed to have watched the movie. This movie was a complete and utter disaster. I actually rank the first GOTG as my favorite of the Marvel franchise (and easily the most watched at around 20 times), so I was very excited to see this one. I can honestly say I've never before been disappointed by a Marvel production (modern era), and I have actually thought aloud on more than one occasion that Marvel just seems to know how to get it right. It seemed they were infallible, incapable of putting out a bad movie. Unfortunately, they finally got it wrong. The best word I've seen used is forced. Everything feels forced. The plot, the acting, the action, the jokes, the emotion....all of it. With all other Marvel movies, you immerse into the story, you live the plot. While watching this, I gradually become less and less immersed and became increasingly aware of how awful the movie was. I finished it, hoping for a rebound, but it just gets worse, like a turd rolling down hill. By the end, its like a Gatlin gun of turd pellets being shot from the screen, a run of bad jokes, bad acting, bad dialogue, bad plot, and just plain bad experience. I'm truly just dumbfounded that Marvel could screw up at all, and especially this badly. How is this even the same director as the first? Did he have a stroke since the first film? I feel like I've gone through all of the stages of grief except acceptance, and I never will accept this Kentucky Klondike Bar of a movie. Go home GOTG2, you're drunk. Go back and try again."
"georgeskoufezis","9","59","111","25 April 2017"," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Review
","SPOILER FREE REVIEW: 25/04/2017 GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2<br/><br/>Last night I made an impulse decision to book myself a ticket at the cinema to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and I'm thankful I decided to do so. Last night's particular session had quite a few online bookings and as always there was along queue full of people on the night. I got in early (as usual) to guarantee a premium position for such a movie. Movies that I am willing to pre-book need to be viewed in the best seating or the overall experience and satisfaction will be hindered.<br/><br/>Like with any movie that is associated with Marvel Studios, comes its inherited ""hype"" and ""excitement"" with this film being no different. Director James Gunn has really made a name for himself directing the previous Guardians of the Galaxy and a confirmed sequel to this year's second iteration. His cinematic career does not have a large array of successful movies by his name but the Guardians of the Galaxy movies remain the pinnacle of Gunn's directing career and that is nothing to be ashamed of (they're great movies!)<br/><br/>I cannot lie, based off the movie trailer and my experience with the first film I was expecting Gunn and Marvel Studios to follow suite with a fun, humour filled experience and it did just that. From the very outset we were provided a little bit more on the history of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and exactly how he came about his existence. The first film I felt deliberately hid from the fact he was only half human, not informing the public to his other heritage. It felt great to finally uncover the mystery and secrets behind Quill's upbringing and rightful ""biological"" father.<br/><br/>Immediately after that opening scene we are thrusted straight into a familiar line-up and setting with fellow Guardians: Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and (Vin Diesel) Baby Groot joining Quill in tackling an inter-dimensional being, as their duty. Accompanied by some soothing and scene setting 80's music the battle takes place, but the focus not on the fight but rather refreshing the viewers on the character's relationships and chemistry. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie we are re-acquainted with Nebula (Karen Gillan) and Yondu (Michael Rooker) and may I say I'm so glad that in GOTG2 they were given more screen time and backstory, absolutely loved their characters in the first film. We are also greeted by cameo appearances from Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone that add to the prestige and class of this movie. Director Gunn chose to include explaining the complex relationship that transpired between sisters Gamora and Nebula; foreshadowing a larger turn of events in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) perhaps? Time will tell all, but nonetheless I appreciated that it was explained in more detail. <br/><br/>The fun factor and humour; because there was a lot of it was included definitely at the right times. Drax and Mantis (played by Marvel newcomer Pom Klementieff) had a playful connection at trying to understand one another and as always Rocket and Quill clashing with one another made for good viewing. Baby Groot's adorable inclusion meant for many scenes showcasing exactly how innocent and cute saving the galaxy can be and Marvel did well at portraying Groot in such a light. After the movie reached its conclusion it was so disappointing seeing so many ""fans"" walking out upon the beginning of the credits! Almost as if they hadn't realized this was a Marvel movie which, appreciates their post-production scenes and there were a massive 5 in this movie! That's right folks, 5 different scenes and one very interesting in particular setting the scene for the next installment. My only surprise was no visual mention of infamous destroyer, Thanos (Josh Brolin) although there were many verbal exchanges featuring the character. <br/><br/>Do I think this movie will go on to win awards and accolades? I think so. Do I think this movie was an awesome and appropriate sequel to the first? Absolutely!<br/><br/>Therefore my score for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a:<br/><br/>9/10"
"danne_gl","1","56","105","16 May 2017"," Cringey and gooey

The action scenes take too much time and leaves little room for the story to become great.

","When going to watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 the main thing I was looking for was to have fun, and on that account this film sure does deliver. The characters we know and love are still just as great and a couple of new people are introduced too. However, Gamora is still the most boring character out of the Guardians, and unfortunately, Drax doesn't really do a lot except tell jokes, which are very funny admittedly. Baby Groot makes up for this and is great, if not just a little worse than the last incarnation of him we saw in the last movie. Once again the villain is not great, but he is better than Ronan in the last movie. The real flaw with this movie is that it simply isn't as good as the first one. Number 1 captured lightning in a bottle and this one attempts that and comes pretty close, but in the end, doesn't. This does not make it a bad film, however. It is still hilarious, action packed and a great deal of fun improving on some elements of the original and I recommend it to any fans of Guardians of the Galaxy. Just remember to keep your expectations in check. 8/10"

","Let me start by saying that I'm still unsure how I feel about this movie. And before I tell you about the movie, I feel compelled to tell you that I went to watch this movie with 15 excited fans of the first movie - 5 of which were comic book readers and the rest (you do the math) had watched the first one and couldn't wait to watch the sequel, but are not comic book readers. Now, remember this, because I'm going to give you some of their reactions at the end of the review. <br/><br/>OK, now let us begin with the actual review. If I'm to put it in one sentence, I'll say that it was fun, but not that much and that it was a one time watch. Star Lord and the gang start off with the usual shenanigans that have you laughing, sipping your coke, eating your popcorn happily and adoring little Groot. The beginning of the movie is pretty much what the trailer shows us. James Gunn made us fall in love with the GoTG in the first film and in this film, he gives us more reasons to care about them as we delve into each of their pasts. The not-so-subtle theme of family is cute, but at times forced and feels like...and I quote one of my fellow movie-goer friends - ""Fast and the Furious in space"". For me this movie was driven solely by the characters and not by the story. While watching the movie, I realised that all of THIS would be better as a TV show. At one point in the movie I was like, yeah this is great, I'm laughing, but where is this going? It all seemed pointless some 45 minutes-1 hr into the movie. I had a Batman v Superman Deja Vu (only this Deja Vu was shorter and colourful). The movie suffers greatly due to the lack of a good villain and forced cheesy dialogues. Towards the end, I was like ""Man! This is Flash and Arrow level of whining."" Fortunately, the characters keep you interested and for my Rocket is the real MVP of the whole movie. I friggin loved every line he said. Drax was awesome as ever, Groot was bloody adorable. Gamora was under-utilised, Quill was funny (that's it). Amongst the other characters, Peters dad was decent, Yondu was great and Mantis was good in the limited role she had. <br/><br/>Im sure there will be others who will reach the point i reached in the movie when i thought it was going nowhere, but might be happy with the movie overall all as there is a big emotional payback in the end of the movie. For me, that was not enough to hide it's short-comings. Loved the END (the proper end, not the villain fight - I thought that was okayish and predictable, but funny nonetheless). All in all, a decent, funny movie, that is led down by the weak writing. It doesn't quite live up to the benchmark set by the first part. Oh and out of the 5 post credits scene, the 4th one is the important one. <br/><br/>Ratings - 6.5/10 <br/><br/>PS - Here are few of the reactions from my friends - <br/><br/>Comic book reader friend 1 - ""That was so much fun"" <br/><br/>Comic book reader friend 2 - ""I liked it, but could've been better"" <br/><br/>Comic book reader friend 3 - ""So funny"" <br/><br/>Non-Comic book reader friend 1 - ""Bro, you didn't tell me we were watching Fast and the Furious in space"" <br/><br/>Non-Comic book reader friend 2 - ""Garbage"" <br/><br/>Non-Comic book reader friend 3 - ""One time watch"""

It had some good jokes at times. As a superhero movie,action movie - it was just crap.Nothing happens for more than one hour and when it does it's just CGI. Characters do not show any superpowers, they are just for making jokes, there are no real fights or good action sequences. Not to mention the story is terrible. I really don't understand why everyone was so impressed by this movie. It's like anything that Marvel throws at us is amazing, when clearly we should have higher standards...."
"mcknz20","6","87","174","24 April 2017"," As good as the first?
","When you hear the words 'as good as the first' it is often met with skeptical ears, however, I think your friends will be pushing for you to go with them again to see Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 as it is definitely as entertaining as the first, if not better (shh don't tell). With the intense action scenes, met with the classic one liners, tied in with the classic soundtrack your dad would dance awkwardly too, this film is definitely one for your friends and family to rave about. The acting was in parts a bit over the top and a little try-hard-like with the humor and some characters had grown a somewhat over the top personality since Vol. 1, but the hilarious lead acting of Chris Pratt as Peter and the bad*SS support of Zoe Saldana as Gamora made you not care about previously stated issues. Marvel continues to pump out the action-packed blockbusters that kill at the box office and Guardians vol. 2 will definitely follow those steps. Compliments to director James Gunn! Be right back queuing again.....<br/><br/>9/10"
"phanthinga","9","35","64","29 April 2017"," It not surpass the first one but still a fun sequel
","I guess after the incredible successful of the first movie Marvel finally gave James Gunn all the right to create his own superheroes movie and the result is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 not only a fun movie sequel but also a big pop culture Easter eggs.The movie is fill with enough iconic figures of the late 80s and 90s that guarantee to make you have a nostalgic blast from start to finish.The humor of the movie is still there with many scene that make the audience laugh out loud involving The Guardians especially Rocket and baby Groot but sometime does get a little over head.The chemistry between characters is as strong as ever when this time they not only have to save the galaxy one again but also have to face off with their own problem and learn how to work not as a team but as a family.Because family is the main topic of this movie so you have to expect there a lot of cheesy speech about family that kinda awkward and ridiculous at first but in the end it managed to make me almost cried.One last thing you guys seriously need to check out Awesome mix vol 2 it freaking kick ass"

","I saw the pre-release and it was even better than the first one, which is hard to do. More laugh-out-loud jokes, more character development, and even broke a tear at the end. I would rate this the best of all of the Marvel movies, ever. Disney and Pepperdine Univ. gave me 4 tickets for the pre-screening, so big thank you to them. My family had a great time. I glanced over to the side and saw all of them laughing hard. It was great."

","It is hard for me to justify 4 out of 10 for this movie. I thought part one was refreshing and different from other superhero movies. However, this one felt forced at everything that part one excelled at. I thought there was just too much music, visuals reminded me of transformers, and story-telling was just that story-telling. It also felt like they tried cramming in too many characters' and their back stories. You get Yondu, Mantis, Nebula, Ego. I would advise waiting for DVD."

"skeletornumber70","10","30","54","5 May 2017"," Awesome Mix, Volume 2
","When I first saw Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014, I had never heard of the team before and was only watching it because I was a Marvel fan. Ironically, 3 years later Guardians is about the only MCU series I even bother keeping up with any more(not that I don't like the others, I just kind of got burnt out after 15+ films all trying to tie in). I was nervous, because what made the first film so memorable to me was how much it's quality and humor surprised me, something which I was sure Vol. 2 would try and fail to recreate, as many sequels to surprise smash hits tend to do. However, director James Gunn has surprised me once again, taking the Guardians into new territory in a film filled with top notch action, impressive visuals, and gut splitting humor in a storyline that is refreshingly original.<br/><br/>I was worried after seeing the trailers that this would ultimately be an attempt to catch lightning twice by basically repeating the first film with new jokes. But the trailers are pretty misleading(which is always a good thing with sequels) because the plot that they reveal is really only the first act of the film, including the spoiler character reveal at the end of the last trailer. This is where the viewers I think will be polarized, because after the fairly conventional first act Vol. 2 becomes a very different film than the original. I won't go into the villains, of which the film has multiple, because it's unclear who will be the main antagonist until the plot reveals it, bringing the film's multiple threads together.<br/><br/>Although the plot was well written, what truly makes this movie work, much like the first, is the characters. In true sequel fashion, we see the core group split up for a large portion of the film, but the side characters are so well written that it is just as enjoyable to see our team interact with them as it is when they interact with each other. It also allows each character to expand their arc rather than just playing their respective parts on the team. The humor is excellent throughout, and it seems to have gotten even more adult oriented this time around, with many hilarious, not so subtle sexual innuendos making the audience laugh out loud. <br/><br/>All in all, if you enjoyed the first film then I cannot see how the second part could be any less entertaining to you. With top notch humor, an engaging story, and beautiful special effects, Guardians 2 provides a great escape to a pop culture savvy corner of the Galaxy that we all wish to visit again and again.<br/><br/>P.S. if you enjoyed Michael Rooker's hilarious redneck space pirate Yondu the first time around, I'll go as far as saying he's the MVP in this installment."

Plot of the movies was already seen but it do the job. And villain is pretty cool as well.<br/><br/>On the other hand, The problem I had with movie is that it tried too much to be funny the whole time, some jokes are forced and unnecessary, There are scenes where they really cross the line and made it too goofy.

"AnishMisra","8","9","13","9 August 2017"," GOG 2 review
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is a film written and directed by James Gunn. This film is again a part of the very famous MCU franchise. I hadn't seen the trailers, so I didn't actually know what to expect out of the film. I liked the first one a lot. And I ended up liking this one too.<br/><br/>Plot: The Guardians run away from the Sovereign after they steal something from them. Meanwhile, Peter gets to know something about his heritage.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This film (and the previous part too) basically reminds you of those 1980's buddy cop action films where people just are banded together for one common cause and they also share a love-hate relation with each other. I like many of those kind of films. Because of which I have a special connection with this film too. Within the first few minutes, I was liking the film. The jokes were quite good (This part has some adult jokes too). Then by the time I got towards the climax and the main crux of the story I began to think ""Was actually the Sovereign necessary??"" I thought that it wasn't necessary. It felt very forced. Also, there was a small part where fast and furious was mentioned (please remember the ""family"" part that Drax says). If more focus would have been given on some characters like Rocket or Gamorra, I would have loved the film. Also even though I liked the jokes, I felt that the jokes were a bit on the too much side. The emotional quotient was quite missing. That is what made this film less likable than the first part. But the VFX and sets were quite massive and great. Also some of the stunts were awesome. Also this is I guess the first film in the MCU, where we had some 4 post credit scenes. Keep Up the good job, MCU.<br/><br/>Acting: Chris Pratt was again rocking as the Star Lord. I couldn't replace him with any other actor. Zoe Saldana was also bad-ass as Gamorra. Dave Bautista showed another side of his character Drax (the comic side), which although was in quite excess but was enjoyable. Micheal Rooker was also great as Yondu (will quite miss him in the future parts). Pom Klementieff was a great addition to the cast as Mantis. Sylvester Stallone was not necessary for the film. I still didn't understand why he signed for the film. Kurt Russell was great as Ego.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: I guess it would be the very same as the first part. Yondu using his fin to control the arrow. This time the scene ran for quite a long time. And we see Yondu, Rocket and Groot walking down the road. I mean that scene had a different level of awesomeness in it.<br/><br/>Verdict: Although not as great as the first installment, this film is still good. It was vibrant and enjoyable for me. Can't wait for their crossover with The Avengers and in GOG 3.<br/><br/>I am going to go with an 8/10"

","lets starts with the positives - the guardians are amazing as a family and it's so good to see how close they have gotten and I love the idea to split the team up it made up for a better movie me, baby groot is perfect his dance scene at the start was super cute and wonderful defo one of my fave characters, this movies characters had me in love but my 2 fave were drax and rocket because they were to funny, the villain is defo one of marvels best when he got mad he was menacing and aggressive, and his reveal about Killing peters mum was one of my fave scenes in all of cinema history. <br/><br/>The negative - the gold people were annoying it showed they didn't have much of a plot to make the movie long enough but luckily it still came out a good movie, there's probably a good 7 jokes that make me think they over done it and it wasn't like this in the first one, Peter quill mastering his power and easily defeating his father even though it was epic and one more thing Peter losing his power it really ups the stakes for infinity war but imagine if it Peter had those powers when fighting thanos it would be so cool <br/><br/>Overall it's a great movie it's not on marvel average good list it's on their amazing list and it's not better than the first 8.5/10"

Between Yondu, his surrogate father, and Ego, his real father, he's got his share of problems. The rest of his team have family issues as well, and director James Gunn manages to work on each of them. In the process, he deftly sidesteps the issues that have plagued previous MCU sequels, while also reminding us of the menace that is Thanos which lurks just off-screen despite not launching the plot of this film into a larger tie-in with the rest of the MCU.<br/><br/>The movie is fun, funny, and whenever Baby Groot is around, simply adorable. The chemistry between the actors is obvious, and helps elevate the overall product even more.

","Of course the first one came completely from out of nowhere. Well not in a sense that no one knew the movie was being made or came out in the cinema. But no one expected anything from it. And it became this larger than life thing. With characters so well written and with just enough swagger and good dialog/one-liners, it's almost crazy that no one expected this would be great.<br/><br/>So now it is expected, so how does it fair? Pretty good I'd say. We have established the characters, we know their traits and we can have fun. Even with conventions in general, breaking fourth walls and all (when it comes to love relationships for example). Of course if you haven't seen the first one, you may have issues with the movie. I've seen a couple of reviews where it was clear, they hadn't seen the first one. And while I do think this does work as a standalone, I'd say it may be risky when it comes to you liking this or not.<br/><br/>The humor is there though and as we come to understand in the Marvel Universe, there are added scenes in and after the credits. Five in total to be exact! So sit back and enjoy them - if you had a good time watching the movie that is. Fantasy and comedy mixed with this great outcome: it's almost like you have to love it for it. Not to mention all the cameos"

","Let me start by saying I am not a superhero or comic book fan. I ONLY went to this movie because the company I was in wanted to. I was reluctant, but was assured I would enjoy it. I was so skeptical and really had a negative outlook. I am SO HAPPY that I chose to go. I was very nicely surprised.<br/><br/>This is an incredible journey that shows the ties of friendships and families and good vs. evil. Very well written, directed and acted. Characters and story line were well developed. The movie was paced perfectly, nothing felt rushed and nothing felt like it was dragging, even with the movie being on the long side. The movie did not follow the always boring, somewhat predictable path. Riveting moments come at the least expected times. There are plenty of emotional scenes.<br/><br/>This movie is wonderfully entertaining. The scenery is exceptional. I would have never imagined a Marvel movie to be beautiful, lighthearted, poignant, hysterically funny, intelligent, sad, happy and a just over all very satisfying. I laughed, I cried, I was drawn in and mesmerized. I left with a smile, feeling very satisfied - but wanting more. I really couldn't be happier.<br/><br/>I actually had not seen the first GOTG. I was so entertained by this one that I had to go borrow that one from a friend to watch. I like them both a lot. Most of the time a sequel is not as good as the first. IMHO, that is not the case in this trilogy. The second is just as good (maybe a tad better) than the first.<br/><br/>Well worth the watch. Super enjoyable!"

","With the second installment into the inter-galactic world of the marvel universe we had already come to love from the first Guardians of the Galaxy, James Gunn proves himself wisely in his second approach, meeting as much anticipation as the fans of the world had expected. James Gunn takes us on a thrilling action adventure that is as humorous as it is exciting. You should approach the film expecting to be constantly laughing through almost every, if not every single scene. And you will also be surprised not to come short on the more alternate of emotions as well, as this turns into one of Marvels most emotionally breathtaking films to date. This riveting sequel is not one to leave it's fans walking out of the cinema with their heads hanging down in disappointment. But rather left glued to their seats wanting more, even after the commencement of the five post-credit scenes.<br/><br/>The films highs: <br/><br/>-Provided as much retro beats dominated action sequences we all once again hoped for, after such success from the first films feel worthy approach. <br/><br/>-Brought us countless laughs and non-stop humor throughout the films entire run. <br/><br/>-Great character development proved significant to the story lines success. <br/><br/>-Turned an action comedy into a nightmare thriller in a matter of a few suspenseful sequences.
 
-Feels us with sympathy and countless emotion for the characters.
 
-The climax proved exceptional and will please much fans, as James Gunn forces us to feel apart of the Guardians family he has remarkably transferred from page to screen. <br/><br/>-Phenomenal acting all around. Especially Chris Pratt as usual. Also a great performance from Kurt Russel, sending us many suspenseful thrills in the process. And don't forget the rest of the main cast in Zoe, Dave, Bradley, Michael and Vin, as there'd be no proper Guardians of the Galaxy without them.<br/><br/>-Oh, and once again...awesome soundtrack! (Kudos to Tyler Bates on his fine work).<br/><br/>The films lows:<br/><br/>-Apart from the humorously action-packed, giggle worthy introduction from our little dear friend Baby Groot...The film takes on a bit of a slow start in terms of pace. Too much talking, and conversations going for slightly longer than expected, just hurt the movies initial opening feel. -A few small editing woes that can slightly annoy high standard movie analyzers.<br/><br/>-Too much CGI at times when it wasn't needed. Don't get me wrong, the film has one of the finest computer-generated graphics universes ever. But some scenes just went a little over board in terms of laziness, as even some couches were left to be decorated and stylized by the art of technology. Still awesome work though.<br/><br/>I hope my review has further influenced you to go into the screening with high hopes. As on behalf of James Gunn, I promise you'll rather glue yourself to the theater seat with a head held high from an overwhelmingly enjoying experience, than leave with a head held low from a poor one.<br/><br/>My official rating: 7.9/10<br/><br/>Thanks for reading and I hope I helped, Peace out!"

I mean yes the jokes were kinda funny, yes the cgi was kinda good, yes the makeup has some high details (although you can see the makeup in gamora's eye pretty much faded in the film.) But other than that, the movie is awful;. The plot was horrible. I mean why does Ego revealed that he killed Peter's mom??? It's not like that he is stupid enough to do that. If you have lived for thousands of years, you shouldn't be that dumb. Also, why do Ego takes form of the human in the first place??? And why does he mate with other species with that human form??? (You can see it in the statues in Ego's castle). Another bad thing from this movie is the actor's expressions. Whenever they are sad, or mad or something like that, i don't see it in their faces. For example, when ego stupidly tells peter that he killed her mother, you can see peter screaming, but the expression, the scream, its just don't feel realistic. I almost thought that he was an amateur stuntman or something like that. Another thing, some people considers this movie is the most mature film MCU made (some review said that) but it's not. Only because you have some sexual jokes doesn't mean that it's mature. It's just darkly funny for adults that can understand it, kids wouldn't understand it. Anyway, that's what i think if this movie. Still, i thought this would be a great movie."

","***MAJOR Spoilers Ahead Regarding The Film's Story***<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is one of the MCU's most important chapters: the most important since Captain America: Civil War. The galaxy is at a tipping point since the Guardians saved Xandar from Ronan the Accuser, and in THIS chapter Peter Jason 'StarLord' Quill finds out who his father is: 'Ego: The Living Planet'. Just like with The Empire Strikes Back, the themes of family and chaos and darkness affecting the world are very prominent ones playing throughout the film's story.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy is probably Marvel's most insane franchise yet: James Gunn's zaniness is unsurpassed yet he loves taking years-old characters and changing parts of their backstory and chemistry. Peter finds out that Ego the living planet has been 'planting seeds' across the universe both in the form of ACTUAL seeds and impregnating several beings across the universe. Unfortunately, Ego is the villain of the film. He wants to cleanse the universe of everything but himself. And he wants his 'pure' son to be the one to realise his vision once and for all. Only one problem though: Ego killed Peter's mother, by planting a tumour in her head resulting in her death at the start of the first movie. And Peter decides that his own father is a threat to the universe and must stop him. During the final act, StarLord gets the help of Yondu Udonta and Rocket, Drax, Gamora, Groot Mantis and even Nebula to help take him down during the film's ambitious (though overstuffed) finale.<br/><br/>I give Gunn extra points for the fantastic send-off he gave Yondu. The Star Trek echoes are obvious but I really liked the emotional nods to The Wrath of Khan.<br/><br/>I liked how Guardians Volume 2 took the stagnant 'Marvel villain' formula and decided to freshen it up a bit by making the villain have an already pre-established effect on the world of the film. And Ego is no Ultron here; no, he's one that has direct importance to StarLord being his father and all. But the revelation that Peter was basically a tool to realise his father's plan reflects the baddie's actual impact on this film alone.<br/><br/>So, all in all, Guardians Vol. 2 is definitely worth a trip to the cinema.<br/><br/>I give Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 10/10.<br/><br/>Oh: by the way, The Watcher is in this movie! Could it be that The Fantastic Four is back at Disney already? I REALLY hope so!"
"bpbartholdy","4","28","52","9 May 2017"," Not nearly as good as the first one
","Like I said, not nearly as good as the first movie.. which I loved! I was really excited to see vol. 2, but was thoroughly disappointed. Of course it was visually impressive, but such is the standard these days and it's no longer enough. While the first movie was cheesy in a charming way, this one was just cheesy. The dialogue was dragged out and seemed forced, while the action scenes were few and far between (which is a shame because the action was quite good). Overall not really worth watching."
"henrik-olof-erik-nilsson","1","64","131","30 April 2017"," Torture
","Another blockbuster 300 million budget flick with 99% CGI effects. 1 dollar spent on the script. Painful to watch for the above average intelligent viewer. <br/><br/>I actually liked the first Guardians of the Galaxy. It doesn't hold much rewatch value, but it was a good cinema experience. Jokes were cheesy but still with good timing and precision. <br/><br/>GotG 2 on the other hand tries to be a comedy, but without any comical talent. Imagine the script being written by Sarah Silverman and Amy Schumer. All jokes seem to want to want to mimic real comedians but fail at every attempt. It makes it extremely boring and cringe-worthy. <br/><br/>If you are 14, go for it. If you have a mind. Don't."
"bratxja","6","27","50","28 May 2017"," Sequel? Oh, no!
","One word - disappointment <br/><br/>Never being fan of comics I liked the first Guardians. It was unexpected discovery - characters, humor and space entourage. So my first thought was ""Hey, when is the sequel?"". Yes, I know that sequels are often worse than the original. But there are exceptions. And this is not the case. <br/><br/>Two words - so stretched <br/><br/>The main problem is that this isn't the first part. At all. There are the same main characters, there are lots of jokes, some adventures... But this is different movie by its behavior. <br/><br/>In the first part we have comedy adventure with blotches of some serious things. Characters act because, because... well, I can't remember, why they acting. They wanted money and in some point BOOM! And they are saviors of the galaxy. In Vol.2 heroes are actually heroes. They act like heroes, although have some non-heroic habits. <br/><br/>For me the movie is too long. Somewhere near the middle, the film began to sag. At that moment you must understand main plot and, if you over six and watched several movies in your life, understand who is the main villain. Also at the middle I have such a feeling ""Boring!"". I even thought, that director want to make some kind of thriller scenes (in the middle of the film!).<br/><br/>Three words - the sly plan <br/><br/>But, I need to admit it, the plot is interesting and there are many references to comics about the Guardians. Even I, person that don't know anything about world of comics of the Guardians, understood it. Joy for the fans. <br/><br/>The bad thing is - do you remember the story of the first part? Forget it. Villains from the first movie on vacation now, sorry. But we have new villain and new sly plan to conquer the galactic. Generally, interesting. <br/><br/>Four words - where is the raccoon??? <br/><br/>Our favorite characters come back with several others not so beloved. And if Yondu (guy with blue skin) is interesting as a character, the other one - Nebula (Gamora's sister) is looking awkward. <br/><br/>Yondu comes to the fore and this is a good decision. You should see the film for scenes with him. But Nebula... This is stereotyped character: I hate you! Oh, you didn't hit me? I don't hate you! And I'll help you. This is all you need to know about Nebula. And new member of the Guardians team - Mantic. Cute. Can't said more. <br/><br/>But we have problem with the main characters. Throughout the film I felt that Star-Lord and Gamora are more important. Yes, the plot is concentrated on Star-Lord's parentage. But Rocket, Drax and Groot... feels like heroes of the second plan. Yondu has more charisma and he is more interesting. If I wasn't watching first movie I can think that this is Star-Lord and his team, but not the Guardians. <br/><br/>Even so, this is the good film. Not so good as first part. If you don't expect too much or if you are fan - can see."
"Neos_back","6","32","61","12 May 2017"," Mindless entertainment, boring storyline
","OK, this is not a bad movie, but it is by no means good.<br/><br/>The vibe you get from this is that it was aimed at children with comdey moments for adults.<br/><br/>The story deviated MASSIVELY from the comics, and while I generally don't mind so long as it's done well... this isn't.<br/><br/>In the comic Peter Quill's dad is J'son, Emperor of the Spartoi Empir (kind of like the Shi'ar), not a celestial. The movie version has fabricated a completely different and much worse story for this iteration.<br/><br/>All in, its a solid 6... but no more than that. This is aimed at people who don't really care about a story and simply want visual effects with a few comedy moments.<br/><br/>Hopefully they get back to the Thanos Infinity stone saga now that they are done with this deviation."
"Samuel-Shovel","5","21","38","20 May 2017"," Fun To Look At, Grating To Listen To
","Just got out of the theater and here are my initial thoughts: stunning visuals and CGI-work, a sub-par plot with forced jokes, and a lack of an emotional payoff.<br/><br/>I probably wouldn't have seen this one if I wasn't forced into it in a group setting (I'm really starting to suffer from Marvel fatigue) but I went into it with an open mind. I was shocked that the first one was so well received, I thought it was average; all the fuss over it always really confused me. You'd imagine my surprise when I click over to Vol. 2's IMDb page and find it above an 8!<br/><br/>Vol. 2 is definitely worse than it's predecessor. The plot is convoluted and never really feels like it has high stakes. What exactly is the villain's motivation in all this? I don't really understand. The wrinkle involving the villain being his dad had the potential to be great but was done improperly. In order for that to work, you'd need your main character to have some type of emotional struggle as lines are drawn in the sand between choosing his ""family"" and choosing his father. Instead, Kurt Russell almost immediately and inexplicably tells his son that he killed his mother. WHY?! This ultra-intelligent demigod had to have known how poor of an idea it was to tell him this.<br/><br/>Speaking of poor plot, what was that whole subplot between Rocket and Yondu? ""We're both jerks so we share a common bond."" Okay movie, whatever you say. This movie's over 2 hours, this subplot is completely unnecessary. I'm already checking my watch.<br/><br/>Now to my biggest problem: the humor. While the 80's nostalgia references from the original felt fun and organic, all of it in here felt forced and dull. No one in a serious argument should be dropping ""Cheers"" references to someone they must surely know has no idea what you're talking about. I was not expecting all the potty humor either. I don't mind that kind of stuff if it's done well but all of it in here was extremely cringe-worthy. <br/><br/>Groot's remission back to a tiny twig just screamed of toy development. Marvel's going to be making Baby Groot merchandise until they milk that river dry. I was rolling my eyes at the opening credit sequence involving him. What are we doing, Marvel? A lot of this felt targeted to a far younger audience than last time.<br/><br/>As far as positives go, it's all about the visuals. There are some stunning shots in this movie (the overhead shot of the arrow whistling around the ship immediately comes to mind). Marvel always does a good job at doing that so, at the very least, you can walk out of a theater remembering some pretty cool cinematography.<br/><br/>Finally the conclusion, it felt like a dud. I'm suppose to feel emotionally attached to this Yondu bandit that kidnapped our protagonist and was a villain for over half the duration of these movies? He said it himself, he hasn't done a good deed his entire life. Because he changes his tune in the last ten minutes and dies like a martyr I'm suppose to sympathize with this fella? I just can't. Maybe we're meant to vicariously sympathize through Quill since he sees Yondu as a father figure but I just couldn't buy into it.<br/><br/>I've lost more and more interest in the Marvel movies and this maybe the last straw. I'm hanging them up for a while. It was a good run."
"joke-57741","8","7","10","19 May 2017"," A Good Clich√©
","The movie begins with a cute dance by baby Groot that has the audience laughing and awwwwing at the same time, a great way to do the into titles and actually sets up the movie rather than being dead space like so many other films. While time has passed since the last movie the main characters seem suddenly much closer to each other than at the end of the last movie, making the audience wonder how that is. <br/><br/>This movie had beautiful visual effects and a plot that kept a pace which had the audience hanging on the edge of their seats. The script had some room for improvement, mainly in the exchanges between Peter and his father. His fathers monologues were clich√© at best, and left me wanting more from the writers. An attempt was made to make soundtrack that would equal the one we all loved from the first movie, but they fell short. While it had many good songs on it, it wont be the hit the last one was.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie felt like a story told for character development purposes, but it was a good story nonetheless. Criticisms aside, it was a great film, and left me excited to see the next one."
"adean81","8","7","10","16 May 2017"," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Review
","Welcome to the guardians of the frickin' galaxy, and enter dancing baby Groot. The opening scene during the credits was super fun, and baby Groot is just so adorable. While not every character gets a great character arc there are several great moments for each character. Drax played by Dave Bautista provides most of the comic relief, when Groot and Rocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper) are not on screen. Some of the humor takes things a bit too far, but for the most part, the comedy has been up'd in this sequel. <br/><br/>All of the Marvel movies have great visual effects and this one is no different. The opening scene with a young Kurt Russell looks very believable. The movie knows how to use color to great effect. The setting for the gold people, known as the Sovergn, looks spectacular, with the bright gold and bold blue and white backdrop. Considering the movie has lots of characters of all different colors, each of them seemed to stand out beautifully.<br/><br/>Now, even though I like Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana's characters, Peter Quill and Gamora, the standout characters by far were Michael Rooker's, Yondu and Karen Gillan's, Nebula. Two characters I thought were ""okay"" in the first movie, get more backstory and character motivation in this movie. It humanizes them to make them sympathetic characters that can be redeemed. <br/><br/>One thing that wasn't as good as the first movie is the use of music. The opening song with baby Groot dancing around was great, but some of the other songs seemed just there in the background and didn't add anything to the scene. Unlike the first movie where the songs would enhance the scenes, only a few moments in Vol.2 do that well. <br/><br/>Without spoiling who the villain is, I will just say, this is one of the better villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and vastly better than the first movie's villain, Ronan. I understand the villain's plan and completely believe that they believe in what they are doing. There were a couple of very well done and horrifying moments that are unsettling to make the audience hate the villain. The best thing is that the villain provides more than a physical threat but an emotional one as well. Also providing insight into the relationships between several of the other characters. <br/><br/>Overall, I would say that I enjoy Vol.2 more than the first movie, but that does not mean that it is perfect or better. While the movie has enhanced certain characters, it also adds more to the plot and takes a too much time trying to bring the Guardians back together for the final battle. However, I really liked Kurt Russell's character, Ego, I love baby Groot and the best line of the movie is Yondu's, ""I'm Mary Poppins, ya'll!"" Truly awesome."
"jakobwerling","8","7","10","10 May 2017"," This is a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","THEY'RE BACK WITH TEN TIMES THE VISUAL SPLENDOR, TEN TIMES THE ACTION, AND TEN TIMES THE FUN A Movie review by: Jake Werling (may contain spoilers) <br/><br/>Statistics: Release: May 5th, 2017, Runtime: 2 h and 16 min, Genre: Sci-fi/adventure/action, Studio: Marvel studios/Walt Disney pictures, Directed by: James Gunn, Starring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Coper, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Kurt Russell, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Pom Klmentieff, Elizabeth Debicki, Chris Sullivan, and Sean Gunn. Rated PG-13 for Sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language, and brief suggestive content. <br/><br/>Back in the Summer of 2014, the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie surprised both audiences and critics alike, At the time, the movie was probably based-off of the least known Marvel comic book. It wasn't a comic that a random person would instantly recognize like Spider-Man or Iron Man. but the film surprisingly picked up two Oscar nominations and pleased both critics, Marvel junkies, and plain audiences alike. But this new sequel has all of the visual craziness, infectious cast antics, irreverent humor, and old seventies music that the first had and maybe even delvers a little more. This new story follows the music-loving mask wearing former thief Peter Quill a.k.a. Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), the green skinned daughter of Thanos and former assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the foul-mouthed mechanics genius raccoon-like creature Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper), the tattooed lunatic who cannot understand metaphors Drax (Dave Bautista), and the vocabulary-limited tree mutant who is currently regrowing Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) as they continue their adventures. But a brief encounter with Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), the leader of the gold-skinned alien race the Sovereigns leads the mot start looking for the truth behind Peter's true parentage. Along the way they encounter Gamora's cyborg half-sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) who is seemingly hellbent on killing Gamora but has other motivations as well, the blue arrow wielding leader of the pirate gang the ravagers Yondu (Michael Rooker) and his Ravager accomplice Kraglin (Sean Gunn), and the mysterious but wacky living planet Ego (Kurt Russell), a god-like figure who claims to be Peter's father and his antenna-harboring empathetic naive servant Mantis (Pom Klementieff). This sequel keeps it up with both insane special effects with the spaceship warping scenes and space dogfights clearly showing that, crazy makeup (almost every character has some on especially Gamora and Nebula), beautiful cinematography with Ego's planet being a source of great beauty. Villains also appear as well, with the Ravagers new oddly-named heavily bearded leader Taserface (Chris Sullivan) and his new more elite version of the Ravagers being a source of great problem for the Guardians and the Sovereigns also want them dead too after Rocket offends them in a big way. Dark secrets surrounding Star-Lord's parents are also revealed. This film also has plenty of irreverent humor with jokes about Drax having famously huge turds and Baby Groot setting up speakers while all the other Guardians are fighting a intergalactic monster. An awesome seventies soundtrack also follows as the movie is set to the backdrop of Awesome Mixtape Vol. 2. The same old cast and all of the new additions also burst with chemistry with all the members being well-chosen. All of these features overcome the mild villain problem this movie harbors with slight timing problems being produced when the main villain comes along. Overall, this sequel will plead audiences and Marvel junkies alike, is a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is worth checking out."
"tinjo23","8","36","71","25 April 2017"," As expected, GoTG vol. 2 is entertainment central.
","The team are back and, as expected, there is no shortage in confidence or creativity. James Gunn knows how to enthral his audience. He shoots for fun and delivers it with style. It's structure fumbles, but collectively, is pretty unconventional. Which for a blockbuster is always a welcome. <br/><br/>Where the 'Space Avengers' are lacking this time around, is in it's humour and it's character's emotional arks/developments, that made the first so heart warming. There are plenty of laughs, don't be fooled. The best come from the always dependable Rocket and Groot relationship. With Yondu of all characters, playing a part in the duo's (and perhaps the movies) biggest laugh. However, many jokes just don't land. It doesn't stifle the fun, but you may wish for a few more fresher yuks in the script. <br/><br/>Along side that are the character motivations, which are often unconvincing and sometimes, unearned. One too many, sentimental back-story beats, that feel forced more than poignant, lower the drama. There's nothing here to match Quills relationship with his mother's final gift.<br/><br/>Nevertheless. The team are a delight to watch, all involved are clearly having a blast (allowing us to have a blast with them) and with vol. 3 in the cards, this could prove to be one of the Marvel franchise's best trilogies."

","This may be the funniest and darkest marvel movie that stays with the PG-13 rating. Before you curse out this review and say this was just to make money and to make people who grew up reading the comics happy. This addresses some of the darkest elements a human or in this case an alien like creature can go through. There is domestic abuse, bullying, self-esteem issues, abandonment, disappointment, regret, anger, murder, and countless other major things addressed. However, this movie still manages to be one of the funniest movies I have literally ever seen with a PG-13 rating and that isn't directly called a comedy. In my opinion, the first volume was funny but they balanced it with enough serious acting and themes to make it an action movie more than a comedy. In this one, they have built on the teams' chemistry and have managed to mix this a lot better and make the movie address huge issues and still make you walk out in a happy mood. Overall this is by far my favorite marvel film with a PG-13 rating."
"Impsman","10","8","12","30 April 2017"," Anything other than a famously large turd
","The original Guardians of the Galaxy is still my favourite of all the Marvel films, so a sequel to it was always going to be something to look forward to but also with some trepidation in case something goes horribly wrong which spoils the first film.<br/><br/>Thankfully the film is a delight from the very start, and I do mean the very start. After a brief prologue you get the battle with the big snarly flying space octopus thingy with big teeth which has been heavily featured in the trailers played out over the credits. However your eyes are fixed only upon baby Groot dancing to ELO's Mr Blue Sky whilst chaos reigns in the background. If you don't have a huge smile at this intro you might as well stop going to the cinema! That smile stays with you throughout the film with genuine laugh out loud moments coming thick and fast.<br/><br/>All the main five Guardians play out their parts brilliantly, with extended roles for Nebula and especially Yondu which adds to the delight. New characters such as Mantis and Ego are really well cast and played, and it is clear that what initially look like very small parts are intended for further things either within the Guardians films or as off-shoots.<br/><br/>You will have to have seen the first film to really get this, though it doesn't need any real knowledge of the other films in the Marvel cannon. Marvel geeks ( I hold my hands up to that) will also love all the references that abound. I'm sure that there are some that I missed on first viewing. I may have even imagined some expecting them to be there, such as a distinct Dark Star vibe to Ego's first entry on top of his spacecraft ( possibly a John Carpenter nod, but again maybe something I have over thought)<br/><br/>Okay it doesn't have that freshness of the original but it's a sequel so what do you expect. Fabulous from start to finish. Go see it and come out of the cinema with a smile"

","When a sequel is released following in the footsteps of a popular and well-loved movie the bar is set high by any and all going to see it. Expectations are high and if the follow up doesn't equal that of the first film it could result in the end of a series or low box office figures. Termed the ""sophomore slump"" more than one second film has fallen prey to this occurring.<br/><br/>I've loved all of the Marvel Universe films (and Netflix series) to date, more so than any that DC has released where only WONDER WOMAN has succeeded. I enjoyed GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY immensely, a perfect combination of action, comic book love, special effects and humor. When the sequel, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 came out I was there the first week to see it. I left disappointed feeling it hadn't lived up to my expectations. So I was anxious for it to come out on disc so I could watch it again and see it through different eyes, eyes not filled with expectations of the previous film. I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>The movie starts in the distant past as Peter Quill's mother Meredith rides down the road in an open topped convertible singing ""Brandy"" as her handsome young beau (Kurt Russell) drives. They end up in a woods where he shows her something he has planted in the ground and both convey their love for one another. Fast forward to outer space.<br/><br/>The Guardians have been hired by the Sovereign to protect their all-important batteries from a marauding inter-dimensional monster. As it arrives the battle begins as does my favorite part of the film. Baby Groot hooks up a sound system to play music, something Peter aka Star Lord (Chris Pratt) enjoys. With the tune ""Mr. Blue Sky"" blaring from the speakers baby Groot dances across the battlefield oblivious to the raging fight taking place around him. If it doesn't make your heart dance with joy to see him you have no heart.<br/><br/>The team is victorious and get their reward ‚Äì Nebula (Karen Gillan) Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) sister. Peter warns them to be cautious as the Sovereign are an easily offended group which of course results in Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) cracking wise at their expense. Heading out into space they are then attacked by the Sovereign, looking for the batteries stolen by Rocket which he failed to mention. As things appear to be at their worst another spaceship shows up with a man on top who obliterates the remaining Sovereign ships.<br/><br/>Crash landing and beginning repairs that same spaceship lands and out walks a man known as Ego who informs Peter that he is his father. Here before him is the man he's been searching for all these years. A man who has been searching for Peter as well. While Rocket and Groot remain behind to fix the ship, with Nebula still a prisoner, the rest go with Ego to his planet at the far edge of the galaxy. But what is it that he really wants? This will become the problem all face eventually.<br/><br/>As this unfolds we also find out what has become of Yondu (Michael Rooker), Peter's once father figure and the man who was tracking him down in the first film. We learn that his particular group of Ravagers were exiled because of his taking Peter years ago. At his lowest he is approached by the Sovereign to find the Guardians and retrieve their batteries.<br/><br/>Two themes run throughout this film. The first is that of family and fathers in particular. The Guardians are more than just a rag tag group of adventurers. Each has lost something or someone in their past and they have bonded together as a family in their time together. And each father figure has some flaw that makes them not the father they could have been but all attempt to redeem themselves for the most part save one. This presents a much deeper film than one would expect from a comic based movie.<br/><br/>The movie entertains on all levels from the stunning special effects visuals to the story telling itself. The acting is amazing when you consider that beneath the bluster and wise cracking heroics on display is that search for answers to familial matters. This includes not just fathers but sisters as well with Nebula and Gamora trying to find their own answers. In addition to that there are some belly busting funny moments as well, nearly all involving Drax (Dave Batista) who does a fantastic job with them.<br/><br/>On second viewing, without preconceived ideas in mind, I loved this movie. It might not be equal to the first but it is very close. The concepts that run through this film strike at the heart which is never a bad thing when handled well. Here it is handled exceptionally well. This is a movie to be added to any and all collections and watched more than once."

James Gunn's Volume 2 sequel is creative, fun, wacky, action-packed, and extremely entertaining. <br/><br/>Because it's Volume 2, there are 2 times the action, 2 times the explosions, 2 times the gags and laughs.<br/><br/>As Groot says, ""Welcome to the frickin Guardians Of The Galaxy!""

I desired meaning."" ‚Äì Ego (Kurt Russell) You need to dance more. Family isn't always just what you are born into.

That's what I'm talking about! What a way to start the ride. Groot! Oh my gosh, he's soooooo awesome! Chris Pratt sure has come a long way since his flubby days on Parks and Recreation: The Complete Series. Female fans even get to enjoy his new six-pack abs when he takes his shirt off. Kurt Russell! Nice job on the scenes in the opening of the movie when he was younger. Harpulary Batteries. Ha ha We learn so much more about Rocket and his motivations in this one. Sylvester Stallone! The music soundtrack Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is a lot of fun and plays an important role in the story, like in the first flick. As expected, a lot of slow motion shots. Hilarious. Epic. Talk about a sister feud. Jeez. I love that Marvel always puts Stan Lee in their movies. He actually shows up twice this time in Volume 2. Really great special effects. The talented cast includes Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Michael Rooker, and Kurt Russell. Taserface.

You're not friends."" ‚Äì Nebula (Karen Gillan) ""You're right. We're family."" ‚Äì Drax ""When you're ugly and someone loves you, you know they love you for who you are. Beautiful people never know who they can trust."" ‚Äì Drax <br/><br/>Funny lines: ""So, we're really saving the galaxy again?"" ‚Äì Rocket (Bradley Cooper) ""I guess!"" ‚Äì Peter Quill/Star-Lord ""Awesome! We're really going to be able to jack up our prices for 2 times galaxy savers!"" ‚Äì Rocket ""Yes, I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way."" ‚Äì Peter Quill/Star-Lord ""I'm sorry.

","I give it a three but its more like 2.5ish, and I am being very generous. Its only because of the quality of special effects and baby Groot. That said, there is nothing in this movie to be excited about. Bad dialogues, bad dialogue delivery. Weird sense of timing on bad jokes. No Script whatsoever. I could stand the movie for abt 5 mins tops. Then I got bored. so I had to watch it in 5-10 mins intervals hoping it would get better but it didn't. The whole premise in the movie is a direct take over(COPY in lay Mans terms) from every space movie Hollywood has made. The scene where Kurt Russel explains his origins to StarLord seems directly taken from the MAN Of Steel, but seems very stupid. The Space creatures are Gross. The only feeling I had at times while watching it is a feeling of PUKE(As opposed to some users here who felt Joyous). Sly Stallone is wasted, Kurt Russell is stupidly wasted and I can go on and on.<br/><br/>Marvel must really be paying a bomb to all those critics, Marvel Fans and IMDb credit dispatchers(One who give the stars) to give it such a good rating.<br/><br/>All I see in this movie is a bunch of C***. Glad I did not waste my money to see it in the theater."

I'd rather be mortal than a godlike omnipotent force humans ftw trope. Product placement made me gag. Too many pop culture references. Possibly more than Deadpool, if that's possible which it may not be but probably is in this case. Career bad guy immortalized as a good guy for doing one good thing. Metaphor for death bed conversion? Not sure but it was lame. If your sister is a homicidal maniac that tries to kill you it's perfectly okay to forgive her when the plot requires it. OverDaxilized Drax. Nothing is subtle in this film. Everything is delivered with a sledgehammer.

There are worse ways to waste $20. GotG2 is just another by the numbers superhero flick. It's fine if you like CGI out the wazoo.<br/><br/>The only character that really captured my attention was Nebula. She was fairly well developed. We understand the origin of her rage, what she felt she lost because of her circumstances and what she plans to do about it. The spin off/sequel set up is heavy handed but the actress played her very well with the exception of one dialog snippet which wasn't well executed.<br/><br/>Just another day at the office for everyone else.<br/><br/>+1 star for the legendary Hasselhoff.<br/><br/>Verdict: wait for the DVD/bluray."

","The only reason I watched this was down to be it being something of event cinema. I do vaguely remember seeing the original GOTG and it wasn't until after seeing Volume 2 that I revisited my review to find that I didn't like the original movie and not liking that one I didn't like this one either <br/><br/>""Hey Theo , do you want to elaborate ? "" <br/><br/>Hmmm okay then . I'll say this comment continues more thought than James Gunn has put in to the plotting of his screenplay. There's little in the way of plot. Some nice characters get kidnapped by bad characters but end up escaping from bad characters. Bad character tries to kill good character but fails. Different species of nice characters talk then along comes bad characters to spoil these quiet moments. Oh and there's few quite moments in the overlong runtime because this is a noisy, plot less mess of a blockbuster <br/><br/>I also have a bit of a problem with wondering who it's marketed for. It has Russell and Stallone who are legends from the 1980s along with references to KNIGHT RIDER and David Hassellhoff which will mean absolutely nothing to younger audiences and the nature of the film means more discerning mature audiences like myself will be bored by the constant noise and bluster. It also contains a bit too much profanity to work as family friendly fare. I guess this indicates it's a movie that has something for everyone and tries to appeal to everybody on some level . I'm afraid it didn't appeal to me"

"bob the moo","Null","4","5","26 August 2017"," Tries to do a bit much that doesn't work so well, but the core strengths are there
","The original Guardians of the Galaxy was quite a fresh entry in the crowded world of Marvel. With so many famous characters we at least have heard of, and so many films all crashing into one another with cross-overs, references, solo films, and so on, the arrival of a nostalgia soaked film which had a great sense of humor, fun, and a lack of 'big important things' made for great entertainment. Accordingly it was a big hit, which puts pressure on it as a sequel and (more importantly) as a franchise and part of a bigger product. In short though, it does manage to deliver on the same strengths that the first film had ‚Äì although that is not the whole story.<br/><br/>The second film opens with confirmation of that silly fun ‚Äì an epic battle against a space monster plays out to the background of Groot dancing, and only becomes the focus to allow for other characters to show themselves again and join the fun. This sense of silly fun, combined with funny dialogue, is the core of the film and it is consistent throughout. Add to that the music, the action, and the overblown nature of it and it is a continuation of the strengths of the first film. There is other content in here too. There are themes of family in 3 different threads, with emotional content between characters and factions. Not all of this works, and it does make it feel a bit heavier than it can bear at times. That said, while it doesn't totally work, it is still well judged since less time on it would have lost a lot in the film, while more time would have tipped the balanced too much in that direction ‚Äì although these individual moments of the film don't totally sit easily with the humor or pace.<br/><br/>The effects and action look good and, while frantic and busy, I didn't find that they overwhelmed with empty noise in the way that can easily happen with these things. The cast are all good when it comes to the comedy elements, although not all so well when the emotional stuff comes around (Saldana/Gillan I thought didn't work so well ‚Äì although Rooker/Cooper did). Pratt likewise is best when asked to be fun, and less effective when processing a lot about his father. Bautista stands out as the best I think ‚Äì perhaps because so much of his material was heavily 'fun' focused. The many famous faces in small roles add to the weight of the film (not in a good way), and although they do add value, they also distract and fill out space.<br/><br/>Although it does try to do a bit too much, and doesn't stay away from areas where it is weaker, the sequel plays to its strengths enough to please fans of the first film, and to carry it through the moments and aspects which do not work as well as the core."

","The first thing that went through my mind after I left the theater was:<br/><br/>Too. Much. CGI.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: I love some epic battles, but here it just felt constant to the point of nausea. Where's the suspense if our heroes survive a score of against-the-odds fights? Yes, we all know the hero(es) must win one of those in a any of these movies. But half a dozen or so? Come on. At some point nothing feels like a threat anymore. And certainly the CGI doesn't help. Yes it's pretty, but it feels pointless despite (or maybe just because of) its obvious over-prettiness. It's one 'oh golly' scene after another. When will Hollywood learn that that doesn't work?<br/><br/>On the positive side: What we do get are some good moments from Nebula and Gamora, Yondu and Rocket - and of course Baby Groot steals the show (not a good sign when your best character is a CGI creature with only one line of dialogue). The other characters (including Pratt's lead and Russel's villain) came off as very superficial (I know that Drax is supposed to be that - but his kind of cringe/toilet humor just doesn't do it for me).<br/><br/>Speaking of humor: I dunno. The first movie seemed to have this down better. It's like they were trying too hard this time around. The 'duct tape' scene was genuinely funny, though, I'll give them that.<br/><br/>The music: Also very forgettable. Is this the best they could scrounge up for an 80's mix tape? I didn't recognize a single song (and yes, I grew up in that time period).<br/><br/>So is it a good movie? No. It's passable. A textbook example of a sequel. Something that will either be forgotten if the third installment is good, or will be marked as the point when the franchise went downhill. <br/><br/>Do I want to watch a sequel? Probably not. What I would totally watch is a spin-off featuring Stallone's Ravager's, though!"

I was eagerly waiting for the sequel.<br/><br/>The funny moments are always the best parts, but are some dramatic moments also, but never over shadow the funny parts. Our favorite hero team of misfits get into more trouble and find more adventures. Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana really shine again as Star Lord and Gamora. So does Rocket and Groot once again voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Michael Rooker is quite the scene steal er as Yondu. And Karen Gillan is memorable as Nebula. Kurt Russell really comes alive as Star Lords dad. The effects are pretty good for a space adventure, one scene I felt paid homage to The Empire Strikes Back(1980).

"Jared_Andrews","7","13","23","11 June 2017"," A Movie Filled with ""Whys?""
","The Guardians of the Galaxy 2 tried to one-up the first movie in many ways, which is great. It also failed to one-up the first movie in each of those ways, which is less great.<br/><br/>I don't want to seem like I am simply dumping all over this movie because I genuinely enjoyed parts of it. To avoid that, I will discuss some things that I didn't like, followed by some things that I liked, and then I will end with a few things that I didn't like and give a brief recap. Sound good? Cool. Here we go.<br/><br/>The Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is funny, but not as funny as the first one. The second one may have had more independent jokes that made me laugh, but the jokes didn't fit naturally the way they did in the first movie. I imagine I could probably pluck jokes from a given scene in Guardians 2 and place them in other scenes and they it wouldn't really change anything. They already felt out of place, so they wouldn't feel any more out of place if inserted elsewhere. Most of the jokes in Guardians 2 halted scenes in an awkward way that was especially noticeable when they failed to get a laugh. That wasn't the case in Guardians 1.<br/><br/>The star of the movie, since Pratt was stolen by his dad, was Dave Bautista playing Drax. His laugh alone should win him some kind of award. He also had many of the movies best jokes and began a fun, if not unusual, romance with a new ""disgusting bug lady,"" as he would call her. Shouts to Drax. He's the movie MVP. Sorry, Baby Groot. You're still adorable.<br/><br/>Sequels are tricky. They need to walk a fine line between remaining true to the original without falling into the trap of cheaply ripping it off. Guardians 2 was not quite sure how to do that. It tried to add additional layers to the story by making the audience feel for the characters. <br/><br/>It tried to make the one-dimensional characters deep and sympathetic. This isn't a terrible idea, but it resulted about 50 too many mentions of ""family"" in the cheesy heartfelt conversations and an unnecessary overarching theme of daddy issues. Missteps like this make Guardians 1 ostensibly superior.<br/><br/>I know I shouldn't dissect this movie so thoroughly. It's not meant for that. Yet I couldn't help noticing the movie's flaws.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a zany, fun time at the theaters involving little to no thought, this movie may work for you. If you plan on asking questions or thinking about the plot, you should probably watch something else."

","I have to review this movie because it might be the worst movie ever. In fact, just as I was thinking that it may have topped Howard the Duck in that category, Howard made a cameo! No joke, he's in this movie, but he plays no part so this is no spoiler. He's just hanging out.<br/><br/>Within the first 30 seconds of the movie, it became painful to watch. The lackluster banter between characters reminded me of a bad Seinfeld episode. Within a minute of the film, I was wondering if it might be the biggest loser ever. In all honesty, I don't know because I left about 45 minutes in. All I know for sure is that I was completely disappointed, especially because I loved the fist Guardians so much.<br/><br/>This is just cashing in, and the writing is absolute trash. There is no way this movie will maintain a score over 6.0 in the long run. If you were extremely eager to see it like I was, change that frame of mind and forget this movie. Maybe then when it hits cable you'll be able to enjoy a few scenes in it as if they were outtakes from the first. Lower your expectations to their lowest possible point, and you might get a chuckle.

"PyroSikTh","9","12","21","29 April 2017"," Funny, Emotional, Smart, Characterful, Beautiful, not as good as Vol.1
","I'll get this out of the way first; Vol. 2 doesn't beat it's predecessor, in fact it may not even equal it. Guardians of the Galaxy was a pure masterpiece of a Space Opera, and Vol. 2 never quite meets the same nigh-perfection of the first film. But I won't waste this review comparing the two movies, because the only result of that is a negative impression of Vol. 2, and that's not the impression I want to paint at all.<br/><br/>Vol. 2 is a Guardians movie through-and-through, utilising the same charm of the first movie to re-create it's unique footprint in the moviescape. It's bright and colourful, it's filled to the brim with a unique brand of humour, it touches on a deeper, more emotional core, it's soundtrack is made up of classic rock and pop from the 70s, and it puts it's characters before story or action. Nonetheless it does feel painfully aware of where it's come from and attempting to recapture that same feeling of the first, to the point where it can sometimes feel a little forced or unnatural.<br/><br/>The story, in an Empire Strikes Back kind of way, splits the team up, gives the ""main"" character a father figure, and brings them all together at the end. Fatherhood and family is a massive theme that permeates almost every conversation in the movie. Starlord finally gets to meet his father after nearly thirty years, while Drax continues to struggle with the loss of his wife and daughter, and Gamora and Nebula come to terms with the awful treatment they suffered from their father. Yondu and Rocket share a heartbreaking moment when they realise their loss of any kind of family gives them more in common than they ever thought as well. The Guardians are starting to turn into the space-faring version of Dom Toretto's team in the Fast and Furious franchise, but arguably do it better and touch at the emotional core of family better than any Fast and Furious movie ever could.<br/><br/>Vol. 2 is probably the funniest movie in the entire MCU so far, but that's not necessarily a good thing. I mean, yeah, it is. It's full to the brim with jokes, gags, one- liners, and running humour. It's easily the funniest movie I've seen in a long time, and remains quotable long after the credits have rolled. However when it comes to jokes, it just seems to keep chucking them at the screen in the hopes that most of them stick. Unfortunately a lot of them don't. Some of the gags feel forced in and ruin the already shaky pacing of the movie. One prominent example being a cool 360 montage of the team assembled and ready to take on the villain, except it's ruined by a rock knocking one of them over in the name of laughs. It was a cool moment, it didn't need comedy to make it more enjoyable than it already was.<br/><br/>The same criticism applies to the film's emotional moments. I'm not going to lie, Vol. 2 is surprisingly emotional, balancing out the overabundance of humour with some really serious, heartbreaking moments that offer a true insight into the deeper characters of the cast. But again it felt like some of it was forced in. As mentioned, Yondu and Rocket's exchange is really good, and Nebula's desperation to ""win"" over her sister has a sad tinge to it, but it never quite reaches the complete gut-wrenching emotion of the first film (yeah, I'm sorry, I had to use the comparison here). Vol. 1 has the second most tearjerking opening of any movie, and learning about Drax and Rocket's past was a genuine punch to the gut when you realise how far they've fallen from pure loneliness and lack of love and family. Vol. 2 never quite hits it despite it's numerous attempts. The closest it gets is the funeral at very the end.<br/><br/>Finally (yes, finally) the soundtrack is unsurprisingly great; full of 70s classics from the likes of Fleetwood Mac to Cat Stevens, Electric Light Orchestra to Parliament, Sam Cooke to George Harrison. Sometimes they serve a narrative purpose in the movie, sometimes they're used to create a juxtaposition to what's going on on-screen, and sometimes they're just used really well as part of the soundtrack's core sound. The score by Tyler Bates is also pretty good, but falls into the forgettable nature most Marvel scores suffer from. That said the Avengers theme does protrude on more than one occasion which was a really nice touch, tying what is ultimately an added extra in the MCU to the wider universe.<br/><br/>Vol. 2 does not compare favourably to the first one three years ago, but as Vol. 1 was a near masterpiece, that's not saying a whole lot. On it's own merits, or even compared to other Marvel movies, Vol. 2 is still pretty great. It has Marvel's most engaging villain since Loki, the most emotional resonance since Vol. 1, and is likely the funniest movie so far. It's largest downfall is trying too hard to recapture the charm of the original rather than forging it's own path. It throws in a lot of attempts to build up the Cosmic side of Marvel, and a lot of them work really well, but it sometimes detracted from the main story a little. The Sovereign's role in the climax was used as little more than motivation to come back in Vol. 3 and introduce a fan-favourite, for instance. I give Vol. 2 a low 9/10; not as good as Vol. 1, or even Winter Soldier (2014 is still Marvel's best year by far), but it's still up there with the best of them; a solid superhero movie, a solid space opera. Bring on Ragnarok later in the year when the line between Avengers and Cosmic is blurred even further!"

"cybergel-193-516257","3","27","55","30 April 2017"," A Vacuous and vapid offering from MCU
","Admittingly, I was not a fan of the original. I found the first film an eye-candied substandard science fiction yarn only suitable for a Saturday afternoon. Obviously emboldened by unexpected box office gold, director James Gunn decided to ramp up the volume to an '11' for this sequel.<br/><br/>(Spoilers!) Aiming for a grandiose villain this time, Ego the Living Planet, as played by Kurt Russell is a toothless tiger. We are treated yet again to another end-of-the-world or better yet, end-of- the-universe scenario complete with sub-par special effects that threatens a total of three planets in the whole universe (I counted three, and that includes Missouri, USA, representing Earth). With Dr Strange anticlimactic ending alongside this anticlimactic last third act, one wonders if Marvel Studios is cutting corners when it comes to effects.<br/><br/>This time round infantile jokes revolving round adolescent concept of fornication are abound. They are only worth a chuckle once and repetitive reiterations only serve to reveal Gunn's sense of humour. Since he's contract-bound by Disney's kid-friendly ratings, most of the jokes fell flat. To put it bluntly, if you want to tell sex jokes, go all the way like the American Pie movies. <br/><br/>As other review sites have noted, the first act is the most energetic, providing a shot in the arm only for the first 15 minutes. The second act which lasts around an hour drags as there are only two settings: Yondu's Ravager's ship and Ego's planet. One couldn't care less about Chris Pratt's absentee Dad's hangups. Spielberg does it better than Gunn in his earlier movies. It was so dull that I actually dozed off more than a couple of times.<br/><br/>The preposterous third act recalls Batman Vs Superman's ""Martha"" resolution to the said conflict. But since everyone who fervently follows MCU's episodic TV serial-like movies have a short memory span, they would probably forgive James Gunn for being such a genius when he uses basically the same plot device to snap Peter Quill out of his hypnosis. Superheroes do have a soft spot for their mothers...<br/><br/>The Ego/Peter Quill fight scene recalls the now dated and badly- rendered fight scene between Neo and Agent Smith in Matrix Revolutions. I groaned at the Pac-Man transformation scene. I know many people like the 70s/80s pop cultural references but this scene is bordering on being ridiculous. If one wants a nostalgic trip down memory lane, 'Boogie Nights' offers a more superior experience. Then again, the target audience for this film would not be old enough to view that fine film.<br/><br/>Taken in totality, this film is more banal than ""Civil War"", many of the jokes were unfunny and falls flat. The whole film is filled with so much colour palettes, it hurts the eyes. To summarise bluntly, watching this film is akin to binging on fizzy drinks to a whole new diabetic level."

","Like the first round, it appears it is always smart to keep the original formula together and keep going. James Gunn writes and directs this one, the same as the first one. A lot of the original cast is back too. It is done with jut a much fun and spirit as the first one.<br/><br/>The formula is to mix up the characters into action using as much comedy as possible and then getting things rolling with a great soundtrack. This film does that tons more. The soundtrack is so well chosen a mix that by itself it is a great sounding film. The songs seem to fit every part of the film so well.<br/><br/>The list of classic songs - 1. Mr. Blue Sky ‚Äì Electric Light Orchestra 2. Fox on the Run ‚Äì Sweet 3. Lake Shore Drive ‚Äì Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah 4. The Chain ‚Äì Fleetwood Mac 5. Bring it On Home to Me ‚Äì Sam Cooke 6. Southern Nights ‚Äì Glen Campbell 7. My Sweet Lord ‚Äì George Harrison 8. Brandy You're a Fine Girl ‚Äì Looking Glass 9. Come a Little Bit Closer ‚Äì Jay and the Americans 10. Wham Bang Shang-A-Lang ‚Äì Silver 11. Surrender ‚Äì Cheap Trick 12. Father and Son ‚Äì Yusuf / Cat Stevens 13. Flashlight ‚Äì Parliament 14. Guardians Inferno ‚Äì The Sneepers feat. David Hasselhoff<br/><br/>There is a whole lot of Brandy, which is a great old song whose lyrics are worked into the plot lots. Of course Goldie Hawns husband, Kurt Rusell gets quite a bit of work here. Sly Stallone is not as busy but keeps himself relevant. The 4 women- Zoey, Pom, Karen, and Elizabeth keep things lively with the rival sisters and more. <br/><br/>Stan Lee makes another cameo and is having more fun than anyone should be allowed to enjoy from his own creation. The plot will always be the same. This time, Ego (Russell) is one of 3 threats to the Galaxy, and is trying to enlist his son Peter Quill /Star Lord (Chris Pratt) to team up to build their own Galaxy as EGO has built himself a planet. There is also a Queen chasing Quill and there are some others and a step father who are involved.<br/><br/>The plot is not what is important here. It is the comedy, the action, and the music. The film scores on all 3 points. At about 2 hours and 16 minutes it is long but not too long. Make sure as always to watch the credits for some strange stuff and clues to where the next Vol. 3 is headed. This one is a fun time, for sure."

","I loved it! It was funny and witty and had all the ingredients to make this one of the best Marvel films so far. <br/><br/>It was not a perfect film, as some parts were a bit clich√©ic and a few lines were there just to fill the time and did nothing good for the film. Yet, the characters are better shaped than in the previous film, their inner side is shown to the public so well it is really impossible not to like them even more and overall, the directing and editing were right on spot. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the carousel of feelings I had during this film. And the background music/soundtrack was perfectly in sync with them. <br/><br/>It is worth watching the Guardians of the Galaxy 2! I will probably watch it again pretty soon. :)"
"jyanta-00655","9","8","13","7 May 2017"," Enjoyable movie that continued from the first
","There are a few minor spoilers. I will try to not have many.<br/><br/>So I got to see the movie over the first weekend and this is what I got out of it:<br/><br/>1. Fun special effects - like what others have said there was a lot of color and interesting effects throughout the movie. They took a lot of the similar effects from Dr. Strange and put them in (making the universe more connected).<br/><br/>2. Nebula, Yondu, Drax - You got a lot more back story of all these characters. It was great to see why Yondu was an outlaw ravager and why Nebula had such hate for Gamora. It also set up for the infinity gauntlet story where in the comic Nebula was VERY important so I wonder if they movies are also going that way. Drax was very interesting to me. You got to see his softer side, him becoming more fun, and his willingness to protect others and family. I though DB played Drax very well and he stole a lot of scenes from the others.<br/><br/>3. Better bad guy - I liked having Ego as the ""bad guy"". Instead of being bad he was just well Egotistic. His Ego is what drove him and not something more evil. I liked that. Now the Sovereign race I did not like. They were killing them just because they wanted to kill them. That whole story line was too throw away. The Outlaw Ravagers also were 'mehhh' as they only setup the redemption of Yondu. If they somehow combined the Sovereign and Outlaw Ravagers into a single enemy it might of been better. I really don't think they were needed.<br/><br/>4. Soundtrack - Being from the 70s-80s I loved the music. The combination of music and action in scenes were very well put together. The opening scene with Mr. Blue Sky from ELO was excellent.<br/><br/>5. Lots of emotions - They really were working on many different emotions that could affect many different people in different ways. Like one of my friends had a older brother and had a similar relationship to what Nebula and Gamora had. They had just opened up about 2 months ago and so this part of the movie really affected him. It was good seeing a movie affect people in different ways.<br/><br/>6. Too many characters, too little time - like with any movie there is only so much screen time you can devote to characters. Sometimes it felt jumpy because they kept going from one character to another.<br/><br/>7. Still setting up the next movies - Just like the comic books the movies are in that trap of always setting up the next so that you get the next comic and see what happens. No true ending like a Soap Opera.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed the movie. It had a lot of what was in the first movie but improved on some things. if you had never seen the first movie I think this movie would of been even better because it would of been a surprise but since we know all the characters and the director we were more entertained instead of surprised (which is what I see a lot of critics are saying). I do think this is a better movie then the first (I think the villain was better, the story was better, and connected more with the audience)."
"samueljglyn","5","14","26","1 July 2017"," Well...it tried
","The newest contribution to the famous MCU, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 attempts to recreate the witty, touching and clever film that came out in 2014. It also tries to stand on its own without relying on cameos from the Avengers or other superheroes, which I appreciate. However, although it tries, it doesn't quite succeed, with many jokes that fall VERY flat, plot points and twists that are strange at best and completely out of nowhere at worst and character development that leads nowhere. That is my biggest problem with the film, that it spends so much time on trying to develop characters like Yondu or Rocket and yet do it so poorly that it ends up being a waste of time. We have already established their characters in the first film, but rather than expand on it the writer chooses instead to focus on the aspects we already knew and occasionally throw in a trait that makes no sense. Drax's personality almost completely changes, we get some awkward romantic banter and the rest of the film is throwing one-liners at the audience hoping that one of them is funny. Don't get me wrong. There are good things, like the effects, acting, action, and some jokes do hit home. Also, you can tell they really tried. Unfortunately, the direction they chose to go in was not, I think, the correct one."

Usually sequels are lame but this was just as good as the first. I will definitely be seeing this again in theaters. Marvel does it again"
"wouterdrummen","8","6","9","17 May 2017"," ''I'm a fan y'all!''
","Let me start by saying that I am no die-hard fan of either Marvel or DC Comics. Maybe that is also due to the fact that there's been an overkill of superhero flicks these last couple of years, but even then, most movie viewers have already chosen a side. I personally never knew if I preferred the light-headed and fun Marvel superhero movies or if I would rather go for the darker, grittier and more realistic DC movies. Then again, I have always done my best to like a DC movie, trying to convince myself that it was a good movie even when it was actually a disappointment (maybe because of my immense love for Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy, but ever since the quality has drastically dropped). And although I never speak too highly of the Marvel superheroes either, I almost always enjoy myself, each and every time. But oh boy, did I love Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2! <br/><br/>Volume 2 opens with one of the best CGI battles I have seen in any superhero movie, with the camera focusing on baby Groot, who dances on ELO's ''Mr. Blue Sky'', while the rest of the team fights against a kraken-like alien. From the beginning on it is clear that we are in for one groovy, swinging and fun movie, just like the first chapter. The movie doesn't take itself all too serious, but aims to be entertaining, which I believe is one of Marvel's major qualities anyway. But even the few flaws volume 1 had, they are mostly dealt with in volume 2.<br/><br/>While Chris Pratt's Starlord/Peter Quill was without doubt the big star in the first movie, every other main character gets almost as much screen time as Starlord this time. They all get their moment to shine in vol. 2. Saldana's Gamora has established herself as the leader and the brains of the group, while Bautista's Drax is a clumsy but most amusing character. Cooper's Rocket is also phenomenal and knows how to kick ass, while Diesel's Baby Groot¬Ö Well, it doesn't seem like an all too difficult job for Diesel, who only has to say 3 words throughout the entire movie, but what is there not to love about Groot? In the eyes of many, Groot only became a ''baby'' to maximize the merchandise sales, but you don't hear me complain. He certainly is more fun than he was in volume 1, and I am looking forward to finding out what shape he will have in the next chapter. Every character also gets more depth, which is very rare in most superhero movies.<br/><br/>I can't say that I enjoyed every Marvel movie or character; when they killed off characters like Agent Coulson, Quicksilver and even at one given point Jackon's Nick Fury (even if it was only momentarily) I couldn't really care. Most of these characters were pretty shallow and their deaths or disappearances had few impact, if any at all. It's also pretty clear that some of the Avengers, like Iron Man and Captain America, are way more important than for instance Thor or Hawkeye. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 doesn't make this same mistake; they are a bunch of misfits that complete one another. Secondary characters, such as Gillian's Nebula or Rooker's Yondu, also play important and interesting roles, while in the first chapter they simply seemed like mere additions. Even newcomer Mantis, played by Klementieff, also plays an interesting part in volume 2, although I hope she can keep me entertained in the next movie, if she is still in it that is.<br/><br/>While the Fast and Furious franchise always pretends to be all about family, after 8 movies, I still haven't grown attached to them and I don't think I ever will. But after only 2 Guardians movies, I am rooting for each and every one of them, and if one of them would leave the group for any reason, I would certainly regret it and miss the character's unique presence. Gunn has planned it extremely well, developing every character in the best possible way because you start to care for them. Even Kurt Russel's portrayal as the mysterious bad-guy is one of the better ones in the MCU (then again, that's not very difficult, seen the other Marvel villains¬Ö) Where Ronan was defeated in a pretty lame dancing contest in Guardians 1, here we witness a truly epic battle, at the same time bad-ass and funny. The aging technique they used on him early on in the movie is also remarkably well done, while in Rogue One the same effect was used on Princess Leia and Governor Tarkin, but here it felt quite artificial and looked fake from time to time. In Guardians 2, the CGI is remarkably well done, every single scene in the film is a feast to watch. The attention to detail is incredible (with many Easter-eggs!), and I cannot recall any scene which I didn't enjoy.<br/><br/>In my eyes it is certainly one of the best, maybe even the best Marvel movie I have seen. Entertaining, funny and even moving at some moments, I am looking forward to returning to this amazing universe. Just like Starlord, I don't need no living planet, just give me a Volume 3 which is as good as its predecessor and I'll be more than happy."
"groomeschase12","9","6","9","16 May 2017"," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)
","What hurt Marvel's ""Iron Man 2""? Their ""Thor: The Dark World""? A host of problems, some small and others not so much. Marvel Studios has a negative stigma attached to itself in terms of villains. The sequels to ""Iron Man"" and ""Thor"" suffered from this perhaps the worst, as well as an overall struggle to fit within their newly built universe. Both movies juggled tone and had a difficult time building on what was built in terms of character and the events that happened to them - nothing was gained or placed in real stakes. Thus, these are mostly disregarded entries in this now still growing series.<br/><br/>James Gunn created the first, biggest Marvel sleeper hit since ""Iron Man"". His movie shared the year with the ever-serious but tremendously made and highly anticipated ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". In Gunn's film, he gave the audience a group of characters that didn't have the luxury of being as well known or established as Captain America or Hulk. Gunn had a Han Solo-type lead from earth, an alien warrioress who leans on the colder side, an emotionless almost gladiator type who's obsessed with fighting, a generally angry raccoon, and a tree-man who can only say three words. This was the group who lead the now fan-favorite ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". Naturally some side characters got a bit of the cold shoulder treatment and with such a vast world it mostly laid unexplored. Overwhelmingly, the film was filled with an effective use of its soundtrack, interesting dialogue, and fulfilling character moments. So naturally, a sequel was needed. <br/><br/>""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" understood what it needed to do, what it needed to fix, and it what needed to address, in mostly satisfying ways. In the sequel, we take what we've learned from the previous film and jump right on the train a canon three months after our first adventure. ""Guardians 2"" chose not to do the thing it would've been easy to do - ditch the beloved dialogue that set the characters and their motivations up in favor of bright, loud action scenes for 2 hours that didn't further any of our previous knowledge or love of the universe. Instead, we were given a reason for the events that take place. From the start, the dialogue is back, along with a soundtrack that kicks in about like another member of the team. These characters don't necessarily always agree or get along but their chemistry is always felt when it needs to be. The best parts of ""Guardians 2"" aren't a major confrontation, an action scene, they're moments of character building and use of dialogue (a shot of Gamora sitting in a field alone contemplating the things that've just happened just may be my favorite). We see the group as a whole learn about each other, understand each other. We see them talk, laugh, get angry, and most importantly we see them take action on their established beliefs. These small, and sometimes longer, moments launch these characters from just funny and exciting characters to genuinely interesting and believable ones.<br/><br/>While ""Guardians 2"" isn't perfect (there's a lot of stating the obvious and a good bit of action movie clich√©s, along with some questionable CGI at times), it succeeds on its goals and ambitions. In the sequel, we get a wonderful whirlwind effect of what made the original so much fun and so refreshing. ""Guardians 2"" offers so much beyond simple entertainment, while there is a great deal. Not since Jon Favreau's first ""Iron Man"" have the action scenes in Marvel fallen so much secondary to the moments of dialogue and lingering scenes. It expands the universe in ways we had yet to see, and it takes what were minor characters and elevates them as equals, giving them time and choices to make that make them fit in all the more and define them going forward. Every single scene has weight, every moment someone has a choice to make, someone to save, something to do. Every scene is a way of showing why each character is so vital to the story and how true their connections are and how important their tasks are that they've now been given.<br/><br/>""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" was a tremendous success with a lot of boxes it had to check, and mostly it checked them. The good in ""Guardians 2"" was the type of stuff you go to movies for, and the bad was too few and far between to really detract from it overall. ""Guardians 2"" is an achievement in Marvel's universe, and will without a doubt be one of the most fun and enjoyable movies of the year, just as its former was."

"FelipeCarrillo","8","7","11","11 August 2017"," Will the price increase to save the galaxy for the second time?
","The inaugural chapter of the most irreverent galactic mercenaries from Marvel was a gigantic turning point in the path set by superhero movies. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was one of the best ‚Äî and completely fortuitous‚Äîproposals in 2014, a carefree sci-fi film that divorced in full from the general storyline that, by requirement, has to follow regarding the super longed final outcome called ""IW"". The massive success was mainly due to inexorable features as the different and unusual‚Äîat that time‚Äîhumor types present in the characters, the visuals as artificial as extraordinary or a soundtrack based on the 80's Walkman, which were developed with ease on the three true foundations: Story (screenplay), actors (performances) and director (decisions). From all, that colorful and hilarious mix comes the expected ""Vol. 2 "", which remains stable in relation to the first one and satisfies the enormous expectation that was on the shoulders of the guardians.<br/><br/>If the creative outbursts of the writer seemed eccentric in the first film by virtue of the composition of apparently nothing correlated tones and genres, in this one, James Gunn is fully unleashed from any impediment in a story of living planets, hybrids between deities and humans and allusions to Mary Poppins. The director preserves his characteristic flame innovating and relating exotic formulas even in the opening since later in the astonishing 80's introduction, the initial sequence ratifies a cosmic and comical aura almost equal to its the predecessor, orchestrated by multi-functional Gunn.<br/><br/>Here, the triad of elements, that were as original as refreshing in the first installment, are strengthened, getting the same heart with a similar wrapper, it's really a continuation, not a clone. The most important pillar is the story, the plot around which the movie will have to be meant. Before it was about setting up a dysfunctional family, now, it's about being a dysfunctional family. With a general structure established, its writer, who is also a director, chooses to explore and clarify the past of his pieces, since due to its dazzling introduction was possibly a wide and amusing deepening of its roots. In addition, this study is applied to the introduction of new Guardians: Mantis, Yondu, and Nebula, who arrive to transform the quintet into an octet of light hearted fun, finding in them a new breath to irreverence of the core stars. Likewise, within that sea of fabulous inclusions, the scriptwriters insinuate and strengthen what they have been announcing for some time: Independent of the appearances in ""Infinity War"" or future movies, the story of the Guardians will have three films, nothing more, nothing less, however, the filmmaker has insinuated that although the official closing of the cycle of Stard-Lord and his gang ends with the longed for third one, we could see more movies, in the distant future, of the Guardians, but... Of who? With great feasibility may be referring to the ancestors of Gamora and Groot<br/><br/>It happens with very few motion pictures, ""Guardians"" is in that strange but thankful section. Even though humans will always get swept up in visuals, seeing is believing, James Gun's film, like its predecessor presents an authentic, nostalgic and a maddening musical compendium from the late 1970s/early 1980s, hits enhancing the scenes with regard to the seen ones in the universe. While ""Mr. Blue Sky"" by Electric Light Orchestra provides the best and most monumental opening for a Marvel movie,""The Chain"" by Fleetwood Mac orchestrates one of the most mind-blowing sequences that Phase 3 of the MCU has been able to set up, to this mix of yesteryear, we can add it a few songs that are right on target in the dramatic moments, which also make way for the best of Marvel. <br/><br/>Do you want an appetizer? See the teaser trailer. Another extra? See the official trailer. But in case you are still overcome by doubts, another one? Delight yourself with the opening sequence. The pictures are sickeningly sweet like a visit to a candy shop, prevailing and vigorous like the guilty pleasure of entering the shop. The range of colors is phenomenal, and its application boosts greatly that feeling, moreover, the way to sort the components in the scene is beautiful, colorful; a harmony vis-√†-vis with each character. However, they episodically fail in the well-known ""more is less"" proverb, even thought Ego's planet is paradisiacal, the screen is crowded of pigments and dizzying gadgets for the spectator, tarnishing the beauty of photography, from superhero world newcomer Henry Braham. It's worth highlighting the remarkable work in the editing room, that in addition to vivify scenes, produce mind-boggling IMAX and 3D screenings, that will leave you astounded. Also, it's meritorious to applaud the exact length of the film, those two hours and eighteen minutes don't feel unused at all.<br/><br/>And Gunn keeps on to inscribe rules for upcoming superhero movie directors. The filmmaker concludes his feature film, his work, his son, his beloved in an intimate and melancholy way, producing a breath of hope and affliction at the same time, something that, at first glance, doesn't fit into the atmosphere of the story, but that after following the crazy adventures of our guardians for two hours feels phenomenally effective. A smile and a goodbye hurt more than hundreds of blows and Gunn has shown (also) to know how to handle it. He's a peculiar director, that has pros and cons like any other man‚Äîbut more pros‚Äî, the priority for music, the character design, the importance of comedy and drama, the tidiness imposed on frames and a few hazards crossing their minds. It seems Marvel will continue at the service of the demands and ideas of this talented man and his squad of characters, demonstrating in this installment more of everything, duplicating what we liked about the first one, but giving it personality to a film as fun as tear-producing simultaneously."

Really I saw the first movie and I like it so much that I didn't want to lose the second, I was so skeptical about the second if is going to be the same good as the first.... but it is amazing! They make me write a review on IMDb normally I only rate the move if casually I find it after a while searching for a review for other movies.... Just amazing I want to say big thanks for those 2 amazing hours of impeccable entrainment! Really Thanks out loud! (p.s normally I don't exaggerate too much but now I'm not exaggerating)"

","I'm a bad cinema goer. No matter how good a movie is, I would doze off. I dunno. <br/><br/>But for the first time, after so many good movies this year, I didn't fall asleep nor I looked forward to the ending with Guardians Vol. 2. <br/><br/>No, that's not because I so love Baby Groot with all his tantrums and 3- word dialogues; it's probably because the movie is entertaining from that first scene with Kurt Russel looking like a dashing 35-year old, up to the epic post-credit scenes. <br/><br/>What makes Guardian Vol 2 that entertaining? Was it the storyline? The plot? The new enigmatic characters such as Mantis and what's that villain name? Taserface? I like him, too. He's such a character. <br/><br/>I love the overall choreography of action, well-timed comedy, necessary soap-ish drama, the mention of David Hasselhoff (har-har- har) and metaphoric lines (""... I dunno why they're chasing us. This is such a mystery..."") that would leave anyone's laughing their brains out.<br/><br/>And for those reasons alone, I'm gonna watch GOTG again for the 4th, 5th, 6th time or probably until the cinemas here don't show it anymore..."

","Up until the day yesterday we have debated if we wanted to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) in the theaters or if we were gonna just wait to watch it on Amazon. Many things made us wait though most importantly the thing that made us so stand-offish was the trailer and marketing.<br/><br/>The marketing pushed the film as hard as they tend to do for films that need that extra push because it will fall short in the theater, we've seen many of those films; though this was not the case in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Turns out that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) is one of those rare cases that the sequel was quite possibly better than the first, they did an amazing job with this film.<br/><br/>As usual, we won't give any spoilers and we will only focus on what makes this films good. The acting is exactly what you'd expect though a few cameo's in the film I do think they should've left the falling stars out of it, but what's done is done. The story itself we think was better put together than the first though part one will always be in our favorites. The action scenes and the effects were off the charts and extremely humorous, this film is filled with pure entertaining fun; it's a must watch and a great film."
"noomenka","9","7","11","16 May 2017"," Reasons why I enjoyed the movie
","I rated this movie 9 out of 10 because it's the kind of movie that I would want to go and see. I went to see it on a class field trip so it wasn't my choice to see it in the first place but I already saw the fist movie so I was wanting to see the second one anyways. The story line is amazing in my opinion how a random little boy becomes a star lord and fights off bad people and find friends who become his family along the way. One part that really took me was when Yondu turns out to being a hero in the movie and saves the main character when the first movie and most of the second one he was thought to want to find Peter and kill him. Finding Peters dad and figuring out he was the bad guy in the movie was a huge turning point in the movie and gets you on the edge of your seat wondering how they will take down someone as strong as Peters dad. Great movie over all and I cant wait for the next one to come out."
"alex_howells92","8","7","11","15 May 2017"," Not as Fresh as the First Time but Equally as Fun
","Picking up not too long after the events of the first film the Guardians of the Galaxy are taking the role as Heroes for Hire for jobs no one else wants to deal with. In this sequel i found it was a very self contained story and doesn't act as a extended trailer for Guardians 3 or Avengers: Infinity War which i quite enjoyed since most Marvel films seem to be following that formula recently to sell you the next film before this one is even over. Guardians 1 is a very joke heavy film so it seems obvious that they would stick with the same thing second time around which i find worked quite well even though i would say some jokes didn't feel as funny or original as the first films. Another thing i loved about this film was the soundtrack that lives up to Vol.1 pretty well, Each song is used perfectly in there scenes, personally Fleetwood Mac's 'The Chain' and Jay and the Americans 'Come a Little Bit Closer' worked brilliantly.<br/><br/>There isn't much i didn't like about this film except that the plot probably isn't the strongest among some of the other Marvel films but as the film goes on i find this film definitely works on its character development instead of expanding the universe. <br/><br/>Each Guardian hold their own pretty well in this film, some better than others, Star-Lord and Ego have great chemistry on screen and i really felt Kurt Russell was a great addition to the Marvel Universe. I felt Gamora didn't really have much of an input in this movie but she has her own heart felt moments with her sister Nebula, Drax has his funny moments with Mantis and Rocket begins to connect more with Yondu as they realise they have more in common than initially thought, I really enjoyed Yondu's parts in this film and thought fleshing him out more works very well this time around instead of him just being a secondary character. Baby Groot is adorable throughout the film from star to finish and brings very funny moments to the movie. <br/><br/>Overall i do feel this film is a solid sequel to a brilliant first instalment and hold its own very high among the other Marvel films. I am looking forward to seeing them interact with the Avengers in Infinity War and after the 5 end credit scenes which all were enjoyable i am looking forward to Guardians 3"

","Yes, they did it. After the first movie i've been waiting for this episode and it didn't make unsatisfied. This part was all about building the characters. We get know more about their past and family and who they were before this. In the beginning i found Drax a little bit boring, because all of his jokes were all about yelling and laughing loudly but during the story he became funnier. The thread of Yondu was so good I think. The message of the film is very simple but there's no problem with it, because it fits in them story. It's so hard to put a villain into the movie because of it's plot, but they could handle it.

","'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The highly anticipated sequel to the blockbuster 2014 superhero flick 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY', based on the Marvel comic book of the same name. The film is once again written and directed by James Gunn, and all of the original's starring cast return as well; including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Sean Gunn, and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. They're joined this time around by Kurt Russell, Elizabeth Debicki, Pom Kelmentieff, Chris Sullivan and Sylvester Stallone. The story this time deals with the Guardians helping Peter Quill learn more about his father, who he meets for the first time. The movie has received mostly positive reviews from critics (just like the first) and it's a blockbuster at the Box Office so far as well (just like the first). I loved it.<br/><br/>The story begins in 2014, when Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord (Pratt), and his friends, are now all well known (across the cosmos) as 'The Guardians of the Galaxy'. They're hired by the Sovereign race to protect valuable batteries from a giant space monster. In exchange they're given Gamora's (Saldana) sister Nebula (Gillan); who was trying to steal the batteries for herself. Upon leaving, Rocket (Cooper) also steals some of the batteries, for no apparent reason, and the Sovereign race hunt the Guardians down for it. They crash on a planet close by, after being rescued by Peter's father Ego (Russell). The Guardians then help Quill get to know his dad, for the first time. Things are not all as they seem though.<br/><br/>The movie is once again full of colorful characters and visuals. It's also full of witty jokes, decent performances (which are all very well cast once again), exciting action scenes, and an awesome soundtrack (featuring Brandy, by the Looking Glass, which is a karaoke song I've done hundreds of times before). The film, this time around, is not quite as original, creative, action-packed or as hilarious as the original though; it does all of those things well, but just not quite as well as the first film. It is once again filled with great character development though (including a lot of psychology and family drama), and very touching dramatic scenes; this is where this sequel actually outdoes the original (I cried more times in this movie than in it's predecessor). Gunn gives it his all once again, and he definitely delivers (it is a near perfect film). When the original is as classic as it is though, it's almost impossible to top the second time around. I still give the movie 5 stars though, and it is one of the very best films so far this year (that's for sure).<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/rLEEz_CHZwo"

Drax has a more active role, which I enjoyed. Baby Groot was a highlight as most would expect. The whole story seemed to answer many questions from the first movie. The first movie made them a family and this one showed what a family has to go through. The script and cast did a great job with entertaining the audience. Usually, when the audience is leaving with smiles, laughter and feeling entertained, you figure they enjoyed themselves and it was money well spent to sit through the movie.

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues with the adventures of Peter Quill/Star-Lord(Chris Pratt), Gamora(Zoe Saldana), Drax(Dave Bautista), Baby Groot(Vin Diesel) & Rocket(Bradley Cooper). This film takes place, a couple of months after the events of Guardians of the Galaxy(2014). Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Baby Groot & Rocket have made it a habit of saving, the various planets of the galaxy from imminent threats. Soon, Star-Lord & the rest of the guardians meet a mysterious man named Ego(Kurt Russell) & Mantis(Pom Klementieff). These two new characters might be the key to discovering, the truth about Peter Quill's father. <br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an incredible movie. Script writer & director James Gunn has definitely kicked things up a notch & has given us, a funnier & more epic sequel. The soundtrack is unforgettable. All the songs on Awesome Mix Tape Vol. 2 are foot-tapping & melodious. The humor in the movie is on par with & even surpasses the humor of the original. The visual effects are mind blowing. This film is a treat for the eyes. All the new planets shown in the movie are gorgeous & you just can't tell that they're all created using CGI. The 3D is awesome, with the majority of the film utilizing the technology, that is a norm for almost all big-budget movies these days. The highlights of the film are the performances & Baby Groot, of course. Chris Pratt is spectacular as Peter Quill/Star-Lord. Pratt expands on his character, adding more depth to his portrayal of Quill. Zoe Saldana is brilliant as Gamora. Saldana also explores new avenues of her character. Dave Bautista is outstanding as Drax. Bautista's portrayal is commendable as he delivers all the best zingers of the movie, to hilarious effect. Vin Diesel is adorable as the voice of Baby Groot. One look at Baby Groot in the beginning of the film & your heart will just melt. Bradley Cooper is excellent as the voice of Rocket. Cooper's portrayal repeats what worked so well the first time, with the anthropomorphic raccoon. Michael Rooker is fantastic as Yondu. Karen Gillan is great as Nebula. Pom Klementieff is funny & super cute as Mantis. Kurt Russell is superb as Ego. Elizabeth Debicki, Chris Sullivan, Sean Gunn & Sylvester Stallone are impressive as Ayesha, Taserface, Kraglin/On-Set Rocket & Stakar Ogord. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a must watch. I can't wait for the next movie in Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe!"
"janetch","10","7","11","6 May 2017"," It's hard to make a sequel as good as the first, but they pulled it off
","Saw the movie today and was thoroughly entertained. The characters we love are all back, plus some new characters who offer some great casting surprises. I purposely hadn't read the reviews, so did not know those particular actors were a part of this movie. I though it was well cast and everyone did a great job. The special effects sometimes were the usual Hollywood over-the-top, but overall they didn't detract from the movie. And, as usual, Stan Lee's cameo was hilarious.<br/><br/>The story itself could have been unassuming and so-so, but the addition of truly emotional and ""get's ya' right here"" moments upped the ante, making the entire movie all the better. Even Baby Groot, whom I expected to be too kitschy and clich√© (*cough* JarJar *cough*) was a great addition. His tiny character was entertaining, funny, and touching.<br/><br/>Comic space operas aren't supposed to be tear jerkers, but I wasn't the only one in the theater swiping a cheek near the end. No spoilers here -- just go see it for yourself. But if you have even a half-cell's worth of emotion in you, you might want to tuck a tissue into your pocket. <br/><br/>And be SURE to stay through the credits to get a peak at the future."
"glennmeerten06","8","20","40","28 April 2017"," Guardians of the Sequel
","Guardians of the Galaxy delivered a fantastic modern space opera which captured the hearts of audiences and critics alike. The pressure was on for James Gunn and his team to avoid the curse of the terrible sequels. Was Gunn's aim on point or did he overshoot the target and put a bullet in this awesome ensemble?<br/><br/>THE PLOT <br/><br/>The long-awaited continuation of the Awesome Mix Vol 1. regroups us with The Guardians of the Galaxy, who survive by doing some good, some bad and a bit of both throughout the universes. On their journey through space they help others out of trouble and more often than not, work themselves into trouble. When they are met by Ego, a mysterious and powerful being, the future of this unlikely bunch of misfits is all but certain. What purpose does Ego have in mind for our beloved Star- Lord? What will become of the Guardians? How does an iconic 80's action movie- star have a place in this film? Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. will provide overall satisfying answers. <br/><br/>THE POSITIVES <br/><br/>The tone and humor which got so many people hooked on the original, is preserved for its sequel. Thank Gunn for that! James Gunn managed to recapture that tone and sense of humor almost perfectly a second time over. All of the Guardians have their distinct personalities and fitting sense of humor but are given a lot more character development in Volume 2. The characters Gunn chose to reintroduce, are interesting due to compelling backstories and some creative, touching and funny character moments. Watching action scenes featuring characters you love and care about, adds so much drama and weight to the action and makes the movie all the more enjoyable. The action itself is creative, fun and often times hilariously over the top. <br/><br/>With any great superhero film, there comes the need for a compelling villain. MARVEL doesn't have an amazing track record as far as villains go. Remember the villain of Thor: The Dark World, or his plan? No, me neither... Or what about the incredible emotional depth that was given to that bald guy from Ant-Man... Oh wait. With great relief I can say that the Guardians face off against a much more compelling and interesting villain in Vol 2. than in the original. His plan and motivation could be considered abstract and pretty vague. But to its credit, the movie does take its time to set up the big bad plan reveal and by that point you're on board with it. Volume 2 takes a lot of time to develop a lot of characters. All this time and effort pays off at the end with an incredible final act and an emotional ending which left me in tears.<br/><br/>Finally, a special mention needs to be made for Baby Groot, who steals every scene he's in. He's adorable, funny, bad-ass and oh so very charming! An absolute fan favorite and a toy-seller for sure. Also, Yondu gets some genuine great development. His character arch is so touching, so unexpected and emotional. It elevated the entire film. <br/><br/>As far as the actual Awesome Mix Vol 2. goes, I can happily say it's amazing! With a lot of upbeat classics and heartwarming ballads, this soundtrack is a must-own. <br/><br/>THE NEGATIVES <br/><br/>One of the reasons Guardians of the Galaxy is so beloved is because of its tight story. It is based in the same universe as The Avengers and its heroes but didn't need to tie in to the other films so firmly. Just an infinity stone and a cameo by Thanos were enough to establish the connection. What we got was a solid stand-alone film that had a compact story with colorful characters that didn't need to set up six other films. Can you name another MARVEL film that had the exact same advantage? Because of the fact that Volume 2 pays so much attention to character development for a lot more characters than just the Guardians, the story loses focus and a firm grip on the plot. Although the backstories given to our characters, are pretty cool and interesting, it's the way they are conveyed that makes the film lose some steam. There's a lot of exposition and not all of it through well written dialogue. I would've preferred some tight flashback scenes. A lot more ""Show"", a lot less ""Tell"". <br/><br/>Then there's the unfortunate need to set up plot-points and characters for future Guardians- films. All this makes for a bit of a messy film with some pacing issues. Gunn clearly tried to balance all these character and plot-points and hasn't come unscathed out of the ordeal. It's weird he went down this route because story-wise, this film is even more disconnected from the Infinity War than the fist one. So setting up so much material for a sequel, is an odd choice because it feels so unnecessary. <br/><br/>THE VERDICT <br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, slightly bends under the weight of its predecessor but still manages to deliver a fun Space adventure and some much appreciated character development. Even though Gunn and his gang, incorporated a lot more exposition and sequel setups, Volume 2 is still an Awesome Mix of fun, action, drama and colorful characters. With a fantastic ending, I can't wait to see the Guardians return!"
"themist-59225","4","13","24","8 July 2017"," Disappointed
","I don't know but it appears to me this movie was rushed into production. Seems like certain story elements were sacrificed for the sake of comedy. This film just tries too hard to be funny with some of the jokes missing the mark. The sophomoric humor really grew old after the first 20 minutes of the film. Whenever the writer(s) of a movie have to resort to penis jokes, you know they're grasping at comedic straws.<br/><br/>The first movie had a good Sci-Fi story interspersed with well timed moments of humor which I enjoyed. This film, in contrast, was laced with one lame joke after another that I've seen time and time again in other movies. I wasn't sure if I was watching a comedy trying to be a Sci-Fi film or vice versa.<br/><br/>I'm going to be reluctant to see the 3rd installment based on this experience."

","Bleechhh!!! That was the sound of me vomiting as I tried to digest this awful piece of garbage. After watching the first Guardians movie I truly thought that Marvel Productions could go no lower, but I was wrong. This movie is a complete insult to any fan of Marvel Comics from the Silver Age (70's and 80's) which was arguably the most artistic, and well written era for comic productions,especially for Marvel. This movie franchise has nothing to do with the original story line, and the campy bullsh_t they pull off is an atrocity to the seriousness of the Marvel Universe of the silver era, all to a cheesy 70's mix tape. Absolute gag. Of course all of that means nothing to 99% of modern movie goers, so if you just want to pay your ticket price and line up with the other sheep and keep the corporate giants in Depends Undergarments, please do so.

","The Guardians of the Galaxy are back at it. Who would have known that the existence of life would be protected, once again, by a group of idiots.<br/><br/>This was one of the funniest movies put out by Marvel. Baby Groot had me laughing the entire time. He was unpredictable in his actions. His conversations were intriguing. His dancing was creative and entertaining.<br/><br/>Drax the Destroyer, played by Dave Batista, could not have been any more literal with his presence. He was not as uptight as he was in the first installment of Guardians of the Galaxy. This made him more appealing in a comedic fashion, and it was awesome!<br/><br/>The story started off in such a powerful way, it made me think that the rest of the movie was going to build to a monumental finish. But unfortunately, that was not the case. After the main opening scene, the rest of the movie did not match the benchmark that was set earlier. The way the middle of the movie was put together, it made the villain unclear in regards to who he or she was. Ego the Living Planet, played by Kurt Russell, was not as good of a villain as what should have been present in the movie. In the first Guardians of the Galaxy, Ronan the Accuser was an incredible and suitable challenge for the Guardians of the Galaxy. Although Ego the Living Planet is more powerful than Ronan the Accuser, his presence in the movie was weak and it did not leave an impact like it should have. I believe if Ego the Living Planet could have been introduced much better, and he could have been a greater threat to the Guardians of the Galaxy to make for a better story.<br/><br/>Despite my disagreement with Ego the Living Planet's role in the movie, the rest was suitable. Overall, this is still a good movie to see."

He is a baby for d**n sake it's even in the title yet there is a scene where a lot of pirates are gathered around kicking him like a ball. No wonder he acts like he is retarded. I didn't find him endearing at all I found him sad. He talks and walks yet he can't identify objects. Where is the sense in that?<br/><br/>And the whole love dance I love you but you don't love me was just overused and pathetic.

","Guardians vol. 2 by far has the best opening of all the marvel movies. I could watch the opening for two hours and be totally content. The set pieces and colors are so clever and beautiful. The design of characters is fine art. The humor is stronger than the first mostly, sometimes the balance between dark drama and humor feels a little mismatched. And dare I say even the soundtrack is improved. All the characters feel like your friends, like you know them personally. And of course, acting legend Kurt Russel is a marvel villain force to be reckoned with. Shoot, Yondu proves to be one of the greatest marvel characters of all time here.
The great thing about this film is it's not so worried about setting up anything but just telling a story. Telling a story about the characters and letting you learn about them more and give you more of an emotional connection. James Gunn went all out on his trademark weirdness on this film, he truly claims it. It's even stranger than Doctor Strange. AND you get Sylvester Stallone in the marvel universe.

","Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is a really good sequel. I like how the story focuses a lot more the on characters. This movie is really funny and heartfelt just like the first one. The writing is also pretty good and the effects are great. However this film can be predictable at times. And sometimes the pacing is slow. But overall, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is a great sequel but not as good as the first."
"lmathc","9","2","2","16 June 2019"," The Terminator 2 of the Guardians Franchise
","I loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy. It was unexpected, hilarious, full of loveable characters, and somehow outdid the other MCU films for its wit and heart. Needless to say, my expectations were high for the sequel. After having watched this movie several times, I can say with full confidence that they were met and obliterated.<br/><br/>GotG2 is every bit as colorful, humorous, action-packed, and endearing as the first one. The characters introduced in the first film are brought back with expanded character arcs and deeper connections. The 70's music keeps the retro vibe as well but doesn't detract from the experience like so many other movies that go overboard on popular song use. Some characters that seemed to be pretty one-dimensional in the predecessor are deepened also in this movie. In short, this movie does everything and more.<br/><br/>The one who steals the show above all others is Drax. Every character in this movie is likeable and relatable, but Drax's humor and comedic timing are unparalleled. Nebula and Yondu also get more time to shine but aren't retconned, just explained with more depth. Mantis, making her first appearance in this movie, is a fine addition to the team and plays well off Drax's personality.<br/><br/>Flaws? Not many, but I would say there are a couple of jokes done with an alien race of gold people that seem to come off as forced or uncomfortable. It doesn't happen often, but there are a few moments with Ayesha in particular that I could do without.<br/><br/>Summary: This could very well be my favorite MCU movie. It combines all the great things of the Marvel movies without falling for the mistakes and cliches of most others. It is fantastic. Without a doubt. Come and get your love."
"bethlehemfarmva","10","2","2","12 June 2019"," BEST. MOVIE. EVER.
","When I say that this is the best movie ever, I don't say it lightly. Everything in this movie is well done, polished, and extremely moving. I can't say that I've ever been so emotionally affected by a scene in a movie like the way I was with Yondu's death scene at the end. That scene alone is worth watching the whole movie.<br/><br/>I'm so glad James Gunn gets to do Vol. 3. We are all blessed for that."

","The first movie was a hit and was full of entertainment.It was the most amazing space film I have ever seen but this is full of crap.. It is a waste of time!!
This is the worst movie in the Marvel Universe. But if you want to know WHO STAR LORD REALLY IS ,you should give it a try!"
"jacoblegobatman","10","2","2","8 September 2018"," Why Volume 2 is a perfect sequel.
","When the first Guardians came out it was a massive hit. Expanding the Marvel Cinematic Universe further. Making some obscure characters into pop culture legends. With great actors, soundtrack and a wonderful sense of humour. So three years later, they returned. <br/><br/>Volume 2 takes place a few months after Volume 1, and tells the story of Starlord's father. Let's start with the best feature of the film, soundtrack. Now in most films the script gets written, shooting, then the music super visors select music in it. But instead, Gunn made a list out of what songs to put in the film, and based it around it. Similar to what Edgar Wright did for Baby Driver. And the song selection was brilliant. From Mr Blue Sky while a battle of chaos is going on, to Cat Stevens' Farther And Son during Yondu's funeral. The songs are a great through to previous artist, who might have fallen into obscurity without Volume 2.<br/><br/>Another is how smart this film is. Let's take the songs for example. Come A Little Bit Closer- the song Yondu and Rocket are killing to on the ship- is about man who falls in love with a woman, who's in a relationship with man who's going to kick the mans butt. And that implies to this scene too. Yondu killing his crew for betraying him. These songs have meaning if you look a bit closer.<br/><br/>James Gunn wanted the film to look different than the first film. And if I had- and by had i mean of course i have to- say what that was is rainbow. There's a lot of rainbows in this film. A rainbow breathing squid thing to Yondu being insinuated in rainbow flames. This film feels like reading a 60's comic. Bright and colourful weird piece of media. <br/><br/>And the acting... Where do I begin? Everyone is so talented and portray their characters excellently. You can feel like these people have been around each other for a long time. <br/><br/>This all makes up my favourite MCU film. And one that should be a classic."
"lasttimeisaw","7","2","2","17 April 2018"," A thoroughly delightful sequel, cunningly light on the plot renovation but wigged out in brimful hilarity and brainwaves
","All psyched up to the forthcoming AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, there is some missing link for this reviewer to catch up on, James Gunn's Vol.2 of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, the most retro-kaleidoscopic, and least geocentric Marvel enterprise, is a tremendously gladsome popcorn escapade amped up its predecessor's winning formula.<br/><br/>The grand design is Peter Quill aka. Star-Lord (Pratt, whose less tested dramatic aptitude catches up with him when the crunch arrives, pales into playacting compared to Robert Downey Jr., with whom he shares a similar rakish flair in the MCU) to discover his demi-god (with a minuscule ""g"" for the sake of humility) origin and comes to terms with his ""daddy issues"" heightened by a doughty bereavement, thankfully, the rest of the pack is exuberantly driven by rah-rah and esprit de corps, the plot cunningly divvies up some unfinished/new business for them to resolve: the flickering romance between Peter and Gamora (Saldanna); Nebula (Gillan) and Gamora's sibling conciliation; Drax the Destroyer (Bautista)'s bantering with a new member Mantis (Klementieff), a maladroit alien empath; Rocket (voiced by Cooper) gangs up with an unexpected ally, Yondu Udonta (Rooker), exiled by the Ravagers league, experiencing a foes-to-friends rapport, among others. <br/><br/>The most thankless designation is as always, its antagonist, which falls on the shoulders of Kurt Russell's Ego, the living planet, an idea ingeniously derived from the Boltzmann brain, who is Peter's biological father, but his transcendence cannot mask the egocentric, self-centered, callous timber befitting a lonesome demiurge, imperiled by immortality and a dearth of empathy, and some infelicity (why slipping up the real cause of death of Peter's mother when you try so eager to get him on board?).<br/><br/>A new eclectic compilation mixtape of vintage hits is par for the course, and is set into motion to garnish the action set pieces right from its ingenious opening, which leaves the monster-battling clich√© in the periphery and allows a capering Baby Groot (voiced by Diesel) to melt our hearts instead; a mid-point highlight comes with Yondu's dazzling whistle-arrow massacre, which splendidly wields its visual √©lan to tone down the scene's grimness; and in the end, it is in the company of Cat Stevens' FATHER AND SON, that the film reaches its emotional crescendo of both sadness and elation, Rooker is terrific in Yondo's hard-earned send-off.<br/><br/>A thoroughly delightful sequel, cunningly light on the plot renovation but wigged out in brimful hilarity and brainwaves, consolidates James Dunn's resolution of doing something dissimilar from other more earthbound MCU juggernauts and prior space opera paragons, a franchise finally merits its fanboy's hot-to-trot anticipation."

I loved the first one so much and i didn't think that this one would be as good as the first one (that's how good it was) but I was completely wrong. This movie is fantastically made, I think the cast in this movie was amazing as well. Baby Groot was the cutest/ coolest thing in the movie. Star-Lord...who's that again?:) He was amazing. Gamora, cool as always. Drax, just fantastic- very funny in this movie, and Rocket, just amazing- also very funny in the movie. This is a movie that you have to go see in theaters.

","Well, I have just seen Gotg 2 this morning and I have got to say: It's awesome=))Though it did not match its predecessor, but it did come close and in fact, better at some aspects.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: -More surprises:Ego,Peter's father, is the bad guy.Yes,he is a living planet that wanted to turn the entire universe into...himself???And Peter is also a Half-God.Man,I think I should see the film again to understand more about Ego.Also,The Ravagers betrayed Yondu. -Characters:Oh this is probably the best part about the movie.Drax and Groot were just awesome=))Drax is hilarious and Groot is...just Groot.Yondu and Mantis were also great,especially Yondu.And don't forget the Taser Face guy.Other characters did a good job,and none were better the other. -Visuals and Action Sequences:Way better than the first one.Don't wanna spoil this part so go see the movie now.One thing:Pac-man is a cameo... -Extremely hilarious:This is probably the funniest MCU film so far.In fact,it only lose to Fox's Deadpool. -Music:Loved it.Each person has a different music taste,so I don't want to talk too much about this part.But the song in the last fighting sequence is just awesome.Forgot the name,but I think is the song from the second trailer.<br/><br/>THE BAD: -EGO???Yes,Ego was the biggest surprise,but quite a let down for me.And I am talking about the planet,not the guy.The film kind of focused too much on the planet,which makes the film less adventurous than Gotg 1. -Too funny???Much as I loved the humour of this movie,I think it might have been too much.If GOTG 2 had been a bit more serious,it would have been perfect.<br/><br/>Rating:9/10.I also gave the first film 9/10,but it was actually 9,5.Loved it anyway,waiting for the third."
"joshbarton15","10","14","27","25 April 2017"," Prepare to, once again, get hooked on a feeling
","Three years ago, Marvel Studios and James Gunn introduced us to the Guardians of the Galaxy, a superhero team of outcasts and misfits who resembled more of a dysfunctional family than a cohesive unit setting out to save the galaxy. It's safe to say the world fell in love with them right there and then, and now they're back in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the fifteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>With the Guardians of the Galaxy, consisting of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel), renowned as heroes and hired to defend the galaxy, it's not long before they find themselves on the run again. The trials and tribulations they face along the way pushes their relationships to new limits, all while Quill discovers the truth behind his parentage.<br/><br/>While others moan that the MCU is becoming quite tiresome, I can't help but feel that it seems fresher than ever, particularly when they can break away to something as different as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. While it may not spring as much of a surprise on its audience as the first film this sequel doesn't try to be a carbon copy, exceeding any expectations I had going in.<br/><br/>Going from one of Marvel Studios' biggest gambles to one of their most profitable properties is some achievement for Guardians of the Galaxy, and a lot of the success they've had has to go down to James Gunn. Gunn's work on the first film drew a lot of Star Wars comparisons with the whole space opera ideology and in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Gunn has made his Empire Strikes Back, with a strong sequel full of adventure, fractured relationships and a narrative that even comes with the father/son elements.<br/><br/>The film is much funnier than its predecessor, the jokes coming thick and fast, with Drax and Baby Groot getting the lions share of them, and Gunn really does knock it out of the park with both the visual and verbal pop culture references. That doesn't mean the film's narrative is sacrificed in any shape or form mind, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 going on to become one of the more personal and emotional films within the MCU. <br/><br/>One of the best things about the first film was the awesome soundtrack the film played out to. Like I've said already though, this isn't a carbon copy so they don't just pick random songs because they sound cool alongside an action sequence. The songs really do excel the film at times, Come A Little Bit Closer, Father and Son and The Chain being the stand-outs this time round. Oh, and Mr. Blue Sky deserves a special mention for playing over the best opening title sequences ever, and you'll find it hard to disagree when you see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees the fine ensemble cast return along with the addition of some very welcome new cast members. Chris Pratt leads the cast with copious amounts of charisma as Peter Quill embarks on a journey into his parentage, Zoe Saldana really does hone in on the fierceness of Gamora whenever she feels like it, Dave Bautista is, once again, hilarious as Drax, his laugh being one of the most infectious you'll hear in any film and the stellar vocal performance from Bradley Cooper as Rocket is one of the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>Michael Rooker and Karen Gillan return as Yondu and Nebula respectively, getting more to sink their teeth into this time round and each of them provides the film with some of its more prevalent heartbeats. There's also the new additions to the cast that come in the shape of Kurt Russell as Ego, a cosmic being and Quill's father, and Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Ego's empathic assistant. Russell just oozes the same charisma as Pratt so no surprise they seem to go hand-in-hand as father and son, and Klementieff does a great job in selling the innocence of Mantis as well as showing fine comedic qualities, mainly in her scenes alongside Bautista.<br/><br/>As expected with these big budget superhero films now, the visual effects look stunning and in the case of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, they play a major part in making these films feel so detached from the rest of the MCU. The vibrant colours add even more energy to the already electric action sequences, turning the film into even more of a thrilling ride in the process. <br/><br/>I could honestly sit and type for hours on end regarding how much I loved Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 but rather than do that, I'll just go and see the film again and again because this film has so much to give. I'm certainly hooked on a feeling again and I'm sure it won't be long before the rest of the world follows suit."
"spikespace","6","10","18","28 May 2017"," More action and spectacle = fun and thrilling ride, but disappointing in comparison to its predecessor.
","It was definitely inferior to the original. The CG was great, the action was cool but there was nothing original. It was the same as the first one, except less creative and unique. The biggest problem was that it wasn't funny - I laughed out loud 3 times and the rest of the audience was silent. All the best jokes were used in the trailers, and if you don't find it funny or original, then there's not much else to take away. The final fight scene was cool, but most of the movie was a bit boring - but entertaining none-the-less and worth the trip out. I'd rather be watching 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' or the first Guardians. 'Logan' is still the 2017 blockbuster to beat."
"sujanfaster","9","10","18","11 May 2017"," Intergalactic fun ride filled with emotions
","Marvel successfully introduced their lesser known comic book characters with the Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014. It went on to become a blockbuster and also was highly appreciated by the critics. Following its predecessor's success, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 released with much higher expectations than the first part. Director James Gunn not only manages to live up to the expectations and delivers a near perfect fantasy adventure. <br/><br/>After saving Xandar, the Guardians of the Galaxy continue to work as a team and are on a mission to protect the valuable batteries of Sovereign race from an interdimensional monster. After the successful mission, team ends up being attacked by the Sovereign due to Rocket's misadventures. During their escape they encounter Peter Quill's father who takes them to the planet Ego to reveal his origins and his purpose. While Quill and Gamora fight their own personal battles, Rocket, Drax and Groot end up making new allies and strengthen their bonds. The movie is about how Guardians work together again as a team (or should we say family) for saving the Galaxy, again. <br/><br/>Vol. 2 is a bit different and more emotional than the first movie. It is also not short of any humour as promised in the trailer. Once again the choice of music is on point which almost make this movie seem as a musical even in intense action sequences. The visual effects are handled brilliantly just like any other Marvel movie. Funny one liners, stupid humour and loads of cuteness with everyone's favorite character Baby Groot makes this movie an enjoyable experience for all age groups. The movie seems a bit out of place in certain scenes, but apart from that it is thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt as Peter Quill has a meaty role in this one as the story revolves around him. While Zoe Saldana and many others cakewalk through their roles, it is Dave Bautista as Drax who steals the show with his funny act. The character if Drax the destroyer has taken a U turn compared to what it was in the first part. Dave Bautista sidelines the fellow funny character Rocket which was the show stealer in the first movie. The character Baby Groot has been so well written and executed so that it is impossible to hate. Even the Ravagers in the movie find it, ""Too adorable to kill"". While veteran actor Kurt Russel plays Ego, Quill's father, Michael Rooker as Yondu has a very significant role as well. Special mention to the actor Sean Gunn as Kraglin whose character is unintentionally funny. Watch out for special appearances in the movie serves as icing on the cake. <br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is yet another fitting piece in the Marvel cinematic universe. It is thoroughly enjoyable, meaningful and emotionally sound."

","I can see many think that Vol2 was as good as the first but I'm afraid I disagree. I was really looking forward to this as the first GOTG is almost my favourite (after Deadpool, of course!)<br/><br/>We saw this last night and quite honestly, I thought it had been directed by someone different: I was honestly quite shocked to see it hadn't! The first GOTG took a cast of great characters and told a great story with them, effortlessly peppering that story with humour. This one just seemed to want to pack the cheap gags in, often at the cost of the characters or the story. While the first seemed to just have the formula right, this one seemed to be just trying to stick to the right formula. As a result it was overall that much more superficial an experience. It wasn't just me either, the whole family shifted uncomfortably at the end, nobody really wanting to be the first to say they were disappointed - but unfortunately we all were.<br/><br/>I don't know how many times I've seen the first GOTG. Usually, I'll be trying to express to someone why it's worth seeing, then put it on to show them 'just a bit of it' and we end up watching the whole blimmin thing. Don't get me wrong; I didn't hate Vol2 and I don't regret watching it. It's just that I can't imagine wanting to see it again. GOTG = classic! GOTG V2 = meh..."

In general as a sequel was on part with the first film, thought not all the jokes were on point and the soundtrack wasn't so memorable as with the first one.<br/><br/>Over all the film had amazing visuals ,excellent computer animation and ,in all that ,we got a in-depth look in to the psychology of each character. And it was done in a funny, enjoyable and ""normal"" way (we talking about a space film, with a talking raccoon, a living tree and gold aliens ,the term normal ,we have to take him with a grain of salt). To be more precise all the main characters (apart from Groot )face trauma due to their up bringing and this team ,these Guardians aren't just a team, is their closest to a family.<br/><br/>But what I got of film is that all the misadventures of all the player in the film come out of their actions. They acted foolishly and got in to trouble, basically karma.

"lbk99-geo","8","9","16","8 May 2017"," Good movie with some questionable choices (spoilers only at the bottom of the review)
","A movie sequel is inevitably compared to its predecessor, with most suffering in comparison. This is particularly true when the first far exceeds expectations as the first Guardians movie was. Guardians 2 does not quite measure up, but was still a mostly fun movie to watch, with some surprisingly touching moments.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a lighthearted battle scene in which the Guardians are fighting an alien monster, while Groot (baby sized and with a personality to match in this movie), is playing and dancing to music. Rocket manages to alienate their employers, causing much havoc. The team later is forced to split into two groups as they deal with Peter's new found father, a broken ship, and troubles with the Ravagers. In the midst of this two of the more interesting supporting characters, Yondu and Nebula, become involved, both of which have considerably more depth added to their characters.<br/><br/>The special effects are generally well done, as is the acting, with Chris Pratt (Star Lord/Peter Quill) having some compelling scenes with a lot of screen time, but others including Zoe Saldana (Gamora), and Bradley Cooper (Rocket) also having some nice moments. The violence is amped up a bit, with a quite one battle having a very high body count (all bloodless to keep it PG-13). There were some genuinely funny lines and scenes, but some of the humor was forced, and dived down occasionally onto a level that was more middle school level , with ""bathroom"" humor that I did not personally enjoy.<br/><br/>Given some of the content, I was surprised how touching the movie was at times as it explored (superficially of course) ideas of family and of acceptance of others, including a new view into the relationship between Gamora and Nebula. Partly because of this, as well as some great action scenes and the occasional good humor, I did end up enjoying the move quite a bit, though nowhere near as much as the first Guardians movie. If you liked the first movie, chances are you have already seen this one, and if not you will likely enjoy it when you do. <br/><br/>**** Below are details on Peter's father and a comparison to some Christian themes, it contain spoilers **** *** ** *<br/><br/>This will be far deeper than I usually go, but this movie surprisingly got me thinking a long these lines:<br/><br/>Peter's father turns out to be the ""living planet"" Ego. He describes himself, in a rare and unconvincing moment of humility, as a god, ""with a small g"". In this he is accurate, as he is a Celestial, a being in the fictional Marvel Universe with immense, ""godlike"" powers. He has taken on a ""real"" human form, supposedly to allow himself to meet other lifeforms. Ultimately, he reveals he was deeply disappointed in what he found, and decide to mate with females from many species in an attempt to produce another celestial. His purpose is to join with that other celestial so that with their joint power they can convert all inhabited planets to become like Ego's planet, with no living life other than Ego himself (and his co-celestial).<br/><br/>Naturally, with this concept of a ""god"" who takes on human form, I thought of the version of this found recorded in the New Testament in which God (large G this time) the Son, takes on human form. The Guardians 2 movie envisions a ""god"" who has limited knowledge, takes on human form, is disappointed in what he finds, and decides to remake the universe until every living thing in it is only an extension of himself. In huge contrast, the New Testament speaks of a ""God"" who having unlimited knowledge already knew the sinfulness and weakness of humans, yet still took on human form, with the purpose of revealing the love and holiness of God, then of willingly dying to redeem people so that one day He could share the universe with many others who He loves. Full disclosure, I am far from objective as I make these comparisons, since though a Jew by birth (and still very proud of that heritage), I myself came to accept Jesus as the promised Messiah and my savior, a long story I would be happy to share with anyone who asks me to.<br/><br/>* ** *** ********* Above this line are spoilers that you may or may not wish to read *************"
"quincytheodore","8","9","16","26 April 2017"," Family lesson from space pirates
","When the first Guardians of Galaxy ended with high note, specifically with ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", I was thoroughly blown away. Volume 2 is just a tad shy from that magical moment, yet it's an entertaining barrage of visual, music and humor of its own right. This time the space odyssey shines unexpectedly bright from the excellent supporting characters and their openly dysfunctional relationships while keeping the core charm from the original.<br/><br/>The main story follows Quill and his newfound father Ego (Kurt Russell). It's a self-discovery and family ties plot device that for most parts work well enough, but it does feel too safe and follows the same footsteps of other Marvel movies. This tends to veer into the realm of godhood and while it possesses a few twists, the sense of novelty is reduced from the first movie.<br/><br/>Still, it's not by any means a bad showing and luckily, the rest of the crew more than perform beyond their call of duty. Yondu (Michael Rooker) is a rock star of Mary Poppins' caliber. Not only he has one of the best action scenes in Marvel universe with the flying arrow, his character brings scruffy emotional depth as he interacts with Rocket and ultimately Quill.<br/><br/>Nebula (Karen Gillan) has a very intense love-hate relationship with Gamora (Zoe Saldana). The two trades bullets and blows almost every time they meet. Nebula is much darker than the rest of the characters, a contrast the movie doesn't shy away from. The elegant part of this unhinged mentality is how her emotions are seeping through her metallic visage, just barely enough. It's, in an odd way, humanize both sisters exquisitely.<br/><br/>Humor is abundance, tightly woven in even the direst situation. If you come for childish antic your adult self is trying to suppress, this will be nothing less than a gleeful escapade. The use of humor is especially useful in introducing a few more characters while expanding on what already a diverse cast. Nothing charms the audience better than characters that can make them giggle and smile, and in Volume 2 that's practically everyone.<br/><br/>Volume 2 is visually more colorful than the original, taking advantage of the setting as well as robust action sequences. The first tracing shot alone makes it clear that this is smoother experience even in chaotic world the characters often find themselves into. Retro music makes an expected return, production knows the power of the soundtracks, thus trying to fit them into the story. This should never change.<br/><br/>Imagine a moving painting of faraway world, serenaded by song from decades ago, where all the residents are partially broken inside and partially juvenile, yet manage to be so fricking lovable. Add David Hasselhoff and you get Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2."

I'd heard the name thrown around a few times in conversation with hardcore comic- book fans but didn't really know anything about them before the film was released. I really liked it. I thought it was a great departure from the standard MCU formula (as much of a departure as can be had while still being part of the universe, anyway) and a genuinely exciting film with fresh characters and a fun tone.<br/><br/>With this sequel, it feels as if the filmmakers recognised that audiences were pleasantly surprised by the first and so decided to see what else they could get away with. Something new had to be done, something that built upon the characters established by the first. Sadly, the charm of the original was lost somewhere along the way.<br/><br/>We begin with the Guardians seemingly earning their way by working as mercenaries. Returning are Star-Lord (Chris Pratt being Chris Pratt, which is entirely fine by me), Gamora (Zoe Saldana is underutilised), Drax (Dave Bautista is hilarious, if a little one-note), Rocket (Bradley Cooper does his best with some very poor dialogue) and Groot (Fun, but would many people have even noticed if they got someone other than Vin Diesel to voice child-Groot?). After a member of this team crosses a client, they're chased across the stars before being rescued by a powerful entity who reveals himself to be Star-Lord's father (played by Kurt Russell, who channels Pratt and does a great job in doing so). We also get a scene of young Russell, which was probably the best implementation of digital deaging that I've seen in film, and yet I still couldn't help finding it a little weird. Until I can't tell at all that it's computer-generated, I don't think I like it. The ultimate unnecessity (Is that a word? Should be) of said scene didn't help matters.<br/><br/>On the topic of necessity, it really is quite frustrating when filmmakers explain a joke to the audience after telling it. It's insulting and redundant. You can understand it when Star-Lord makes a reference to Earth pop-culture and then needs to explain it to his alien friends, and you can understand where Drax, who does not understand the concept of metaphor, is concerned. Do we really need all of the other jokes to be explained to us as well, though? Ironically, the film doesn't bother explaining things that actually have importance to the plot, especially in its third act where multiple revelations are had.<br/><br/>Other complaints? Lazy exposition, especially early on. Jokes taken way too far. Multiple instances of toilet-humour, and not cleverly done, either. Some weird line deliveries with emphasis in all the wrong places. Annoying illogic (how come space-suits can be taken off without issue, but later on a character can't get theirs off? How come one character witnesses another pinned and uses that moment to shoot at them until they fall a few metres and are pinned again, and the character this time goes to save them? What changed in the last five seconds? The situation is identical). Also some truly cringe-worthy cheesiness towards the end of the film, some of which was supposed to be sad and some funny. It wasn't at all earned. The ""sad"" stuff, specifically, was crammed so tightly into the end of the film that it barely had time to register before being capitalised upon. The worst offender, though, was a scene in which certain characters travel faster-than-light for longer than they are supposed to, resulting in what I assume was supposed to be amusing screams, facial-distortions and eye-bulges¬Ö for a while. Very Looney Tunes. And then we cut back to it, multiple times. It's really silly, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>There are some fantastic elements and moments. The dynamic between Drax and new character Mantis is hilarious. Most of the dialogue, sans- toilet-humour, is great. The opening titles are excellent, and got my hopes up for the rest of the film (whoops). Performances are solid, music is fun, and there were some awesome shots in there. There was even a subtle 47-reference. When it comes down to it, Guardians 2 isn't a bad movie. It just isn't a good one.<br/><br/>Five post-credits scenes (not exaggerating) is probably a little much, too.<br/><br/>http://alexfalzon.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/ - for spoilers (and more reviews)"
"icemike-77749","5","12","23","30 May 2017"," Not quite the original
","Good movie, but lacking the originality of the first. Not to be overly critical, but a little less CGI, a better soundtrack and a few changes to the plot could have made it great. Very solid sequel, but not the masterpiece marvel fanboys claim it to be. I love marvel, but the truth must be told."
"Bottlebrush","10","12","23","4 May 2017"," Excellent film!
","I don't particularly like Marvel films generally ‚Äì they all appear the same, with by-the-numbers, easily forgettable plots. However, Guardians 2 is different, like the first film was.<br/><br/>My favourite things about the film are:<br/><br/>¬ï The characterizations. Rocket (he's very well done and even more expressive than he was in Guardians 1) and Baby Groot. All the characters are pretty good, especially the two leads, and Drax comes into his own more in Guardians 2 than he did in the first film. Yondu did very well here, too. I like the mixture of fun and emotion, including sadness.<br/><br/>¬ï The visuals. The colours and the depictions of environments and outer space.<br/><br/>¬ï The plot, especially due to great characterization.<br/><br/>Making a film that equalled the first one was a difficult thing to pull off, and I think the director did a great job.<br/><br/>I hope the Guardians stay as a unit and are not sucked into the rest of the Marvel 'universe'. They are different and much more quirky than the characters in the other films. Trying to integrate them with the other films would be a mistake, in my view, and would be a turn-off (for me, anyway)."
"alexsalmon","10","12","23","3 May 2017"," Abolute Brilliance
","Well when I went to see this film the day after its release i had high expectations and I can safely say it blew any expectations out of the water with a captivating story line, stunning visuals, uplifting soundtrack and top class humour at every turn. Guardians of the galaxy 1 and 2 are a must see for anyone and everyone."
"Delrvich","10","12","23","30 April 2017"," Gave this one some thought
","I had originally not made it past 15 minutes in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) before walking out because of too many clich√©s at once (eg classics used in soundtrack, dance while you work, the choreographed fight scenes, precise long shots like ""throwing a dagger 30 feet, hitting, and knocking an orb out of someone's hand as the ran away"".) and given it a 1.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) coming out prompted me to see them both and it was almost as hard to get through the first one again, but, I enjoyed it. ""I am Groot"" was wearing thin then came the credit scenes.<br/><br/>Then I started Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) and more of the same kind of initial revulsion with the opening scene. But, then, in short, I concluded that these movies shouldn't be judged harshly as I've seen almost all the classics and some turkeys. Sure, GOTG 1 and 2 has elements of both, and a few clich√©s, but, with so many movies coming out of Hollywood, there's going to be some repetition and imitation.<br/><br/>This movie gives Disney storytelling image a much need boost with the help of current and not so current culture. Sure, I don't like most comic book movies but, this one makes the short list of ones I really do like. I even upped my GOTG (2014) rating from 1 to 8."
"nikola17","10","12","23","26 April 2017"," Guardians of The Galaxy Are Back with More Laughs With More Acton With More Cast
","this is one of hell of better sequel then first film never hated the first film i enjoyed the first film i really enjoyed but this is big sequel ever has been made with a lot more funny staff in film makes more laugh then first film, a lot more action in it, a lot of Guardians in film, a lot of story i am not going to write because you have to go and see the film for yourself if your big fan of First film and a lot famous actors playing Cameo's a lot of them i Enjoyed Cool Staff What's in Film the Sequel a lot actors I love cameo actors in it Plot is Always Simple I loved Plot it was very Interesting it shows back story not a lot back story but it shows before 8 years before Peter mother died of cancer in (1980) Ego (Kurt Russell) Escape from New York, The Thing,Tango Cash Ego was in love with Peter mother Meredith Quill encounters Ego who shows her an alien seedling he planted in the woods of Missouri in woods in Kurt Russell i am not going to write what type of character he is because of spoilers i will just keep that way he's performance was good in film not best character in my opinion but he did good in film he looked like he is having fun i liked him in film he did fine. story follows to present day they had action in start with the Guardians of the Galaxy ‚Äì Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), (Zoe Saldana) Gamora,(Dave Bautista) Drax, (Bradley Cooper) Rocket, and baby Groot still is (Vin Diesel) character steals the show ‚Äì are renowned as heroes after defeating Ronan the Accuser They are tasked by Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) leader of the Sovereign race, to defend a cache of valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional monster called the Abilisk. i would say her character is boring theirs noting to her character at all it's character you will hate to death she is pretty annoying character but you have funny moments when Rocket<br/><br/>Tease's her it is so Hilarious funny things to her.The Guardians accept and complete the job in exchange for Nebula (Karen Gillan) Gamora sister, who was captured by the Sovereign following the Battle of Xandar from First Guardians of Galaxy film. When it's discovered that Rocket secretly stole several batteries for himself, the Sovereign send a fleet of drones to attack the Guardians' ship, the Milano. Drax going at back of ship shooting enemy's little drones that's great action scene giving Bautista something to do more he is in the all film but in fist he hasn't got much action scenes to do but anyway he does a lot in this film. I Like that Action Scene a lot more it was fun, they crashed into some planet nearby planet, where Ego (Kurt Russell) character appears in all movie with along side with new character Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and single-handed destroys all the drones. After revealing himself as his father, Ego invites Quill accompanied by Gamora and Drax, to his home In Moments you have Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) we all know he is Pain in butt in first film but in this they changed his character better in moment scene with Stakar Ogord / Starhawk (Sylvester Stallone) one of my Favorite Actors of all time. him and Michael Rooker Played each another Cliffhanger(1993) but in this film they both have scene together about A lifelong, high-ranking Ravager who has a history with Yondu In past with him and Starhawk sold him out he doesn't want him anymore. i am not going to share that detail what i liked about scene its strong performance i just really wish they got Sly & Michael in longer scene it's Strange because in my opinion Stallone doesn't suit for role for Guardians of Galaxy film not his type but he is their for paycheck he is not really in it maybe Director or writer's didn't give him much to do witch it's shame. About more to do and making more acting performance in film give sly to do more action alongside with Michael Rooker character i really wish that could happened. give Sly and Kurt acting again in this film they all played In One Film They Never Met Each Another Characters never did noting with them it would be cool if they scene with Sly and Kurt in this film have action fight scene or something or acting scene but anyway it doesn't happen. there were a lot of funny moments So you have many funny moments with Groot its so funny makes you laugh more. and this sequel i would say a lot more better not just because new characters or just because its new sequel all that it was just better and it was more fast Paced film it was Guardians are together the first film is great. idea of Michael Rooker Character more of good guy and he becomes character you hate in first film but in this you start to like him a lot great funny jokes makes you laugh out of you ass out of seat. there is something you should not miss towards at end of film there mid post-credit scenes and ending to it never miss something i never wanted to share. 10 out 10 its worth fun watching sequel of all of time i would say its a lot more better first film."
"Jesse_Ung","7","12","23","26 April 2017"," A solidly entertaining - if uneven sequel
","The first Guardians of the Galaxy was a welcome breath of fresh air. After being swamped with comic-movies obsessed with the end of the world and setting up whatever was to come in the next 80 movies or so - here was a movie dedicated to giving audiences something unique and fresh and entertaining for entertainment's sake (this coming from a viewer who has recently come to resenting the comic-book movie genre as a whole, mind you).<br/><br/>For the most part, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 retains the fun of the original. The special effects are dazzling, the humor is sharp, and the set-pieces are exhilarating. The opening action sequence over the credits alone is terrific. So off the top it's pretty great. The expansion of the Guardians' world allows for a wealth of truly inventive design.<br/><br/>However, the film spends a lot of time answering questions raised in the first film, rather than telling a unique story with its characters (which I thought the first film did beautifully). Peter Quill isn't given a whole lot to do in the film, and funnily enough, his journey throughout the film feels the most underdeveloped. As far as the plot is concerned, not to get into spoilers, Quill almost feels like an afterthought - simply because there is so much going on. Rooker and Cooper as Yondu and Rocket, respectively, steal the show - providing some of the most entertaining moments of the film as well as probably the most emotionally engaging relationship of the many. The cast are game and give it their all, and their energy really breathe life into their characters, but it's hard for the film to convey the notion of a rag-tag bunch of misfits becoming a family when they're all apart from each other for so much of the film.<br/><br/>Although, not to get into spoilers, the film ends on a rather somber note - which I didn't expect and I admire the film for doing so. It commits wholeheartedly to a certain character beat and makes it work for the story. That's all I'll say.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is by no means a bad film - not even average. It's solid. Truly. But coming off the heels of the original, it narrowly misses it's mark. Our hero isn't given much of an arc, the characters are separated from each other for the bulk of the film, and it's a little too concerned with addressing unanswered questions from the original. That being said, the film retains the briskness, the fun, edge and unusual sense of humor that made the previous film so memorable - just enough that most is forgiven."
"moneyboy","6","19","40","26 April 2017"," Meanderers of the Galaxy
","Missing a lot of the fun that the first Guardians had. Felt the story meandered and plodded along for the most part.<br/><br/>Had a few moments, but felt more like it was filmed as an omnibus TV episode than a fully realised block-buster.<br/><br/>The underlying father motif gave the film a little more weight in the feels department(there was a woman further down my row who was balling her eyes out, a complete blubbering mess), but it all seemed a little uneven in the way it played out and the way the story was handled.<br/><br/>Not terrible, but not great either. A bit meh. A mixed bag for me.<br/><br/>6 ‚Äì 6.5 trash pandas."
"konaglen","3","21","45","6 May 2017"," Not even a close match to the first one
","The first installment had all the great elements of Sci-fi and comedy. It also did it in a way that you wanted to see it over and over. I have seen the first one about 10 times, but doubt if I see this again more than once. It has all the special effects that everyone is use to, but I found it boring to a point that I did drowse. There were only one or two funny lines compared to the first one, which I loved. Good actors, of course, but the material this time wasn't great."
"cardinals123","10","8","14","14 May 2017"," Perfect mix of comedy and action for all ages
","I'm going to try to keep this short as there is a lot to say about this film. Never again will ""the sequel is always worse"" come out of my mouth. Both films in this series have received 10/10 reviews from me. However, I do believe the second installment was a more enjoyable experience than the first. That is no slight to the first movie as I had considered it my all time favourite super hero movie... until now. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 offers the perfect blend of comedy and action for all ages to enjoy. <br/><br/>The comedy in the film is appropriate enough that you could take your 12 year old child to see the movie, but also has more than enough edgy humour to keep the parents laughing for a majority of the film. Although most of the main cast brings their own unique humour to the table, Dave Bautista's character, Drax the Destroyer, steals the show with his brutal honesty towards the rest of the Guardians. <br/><br/>The action scenes in this movie were perfectly done. With amazing special effects, this film provides mind blowing action scenes even more extreme than the first film. The violence is kept to a low enough level that it is appropriate for young people, while still delivering an enjoyable experience for the older crowd.<br/><br/>I could write all day about how much I enjoyed this film, instead I simply recommend you go watch it. I guarantee anyone who enjoyed the first film will be more than pleased with Vol. 2."
"jdwaste-791-425796","10","8","14","12 May 2017"," Great follow up to the first Vol.
","This movie was definitely worth watching. I enjoyed all of the comedic scenes throughout. I loved all of the little easter eggs and look forward to watching this movie again and again when I own it on Digital. This movie seemed to give more of the spotlight to Drax in regards to many of the comedy scenes which I loved every minute of. Baby Groot was also a riot to watch, and you could almost understand his lines. ""I am Groot."" The only complaint that I have is that Cosmo the Dog was not featured more in the movie. If you watch it you will see what I mean and understand why I am being so vague. Can't wait to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 already. Two Thumbs way way up from this guy."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","8","14","8 May 2017"," The best characters/action team in movies today makes ""Vol. 2"" hard not to enjoy
","Marvel Studios and writer/director James Gunn proved with 2014's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" that superhero movies don't need to feature familiar (usually white, male, special suit-wearing) characters saving Earth; they just need to be fun, dynamic and easy to relate to. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" doubles down on its investment in Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) among others, and it pays off.<br/><br/>It turns out great characters that have interesting, often-hilarious and sometimes even sentimental interactions with each other can cover up a plot lacking any kind of direction. The film doesn't have a story so much as a few inciting incidents that create complicated scenarios for the characters to navigate. So the best one-sentence plot description is: After completing a job for the snooty, gold- embalmed Sovereign race and ensuing complications, the Guardians discover the truth about Quill's parentage.<br/><br/>Gunn sews the movie's story lines into the character dynamics. The Quill-Gamora unspoken romance, the difference in attitude between Quill and Rocket, the animosity between Gamora and Nebula (Karen Gillan) ‚Äì whom they pick up as a prisoner from the Sovereign ‚Äî in addition to the verbal sparring between everyone. It's enough, because the characters already won audiences over the first time, and those same audiences will come out of this film even more invested in them.<br/><br/>Although Groot, especially in baby form, will have the most fans, Rocket in particular emerges as the Guardians' most fascinating character. This movie is so overrun by CGI, but he feels as real as any of the actors. The character also gets a wider range to work with and Cooper absolutely delivers. Bautista also gets to show even more comedic range as Drax, who becomes more multi-note than simply the proud warrior who doesn't understand figures of speech.<br/><br/>The script is so funny, so clever and so focused on blissful sci-fi action moments colored by '70s and '80s music that the finer details of the story are immaterial. The entertainment value is through the roof from start to finish despite the ways the plot seems to lack the appropriate stakes. It survives joke to joke, song to song even when this pattern starts to become a little predictable.<br/><br/>So this sequel succeeds in ways that good sequels succeed and struggles with the challenges most of these sequels face. Gunn and Marvel Studios have identified precisely what made the first movie great and bring it even more to the forefront, while the same old conundrum of what situations to put them in plagues this story. So the story takes the form of mostly arbitrary scenarios whose sole job is to set up the characters, humor and soundtrack for success. <br/><br/>To evaluate the action sequences would also lose sight of what this movie is. The action isn't interesting; it's more about the character dynamics that play into it and the moments of levity. No moment articulates this better than the opening credit sequence, which features a camera exclusively following baby Groot dancing about as the other Guardians fight a giant space beast in the background. There's a beauty in the way the movie pulls itself away from the noise that so many action movies bombard audiences with, assuming we just can't get enough of it. But if the action is going to be kind of low-stakes like it is here, better to turn it into about something more than just action.<br/><br/>If it was close before, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" beats out ""The Avengers"" for best super-team after this one. In fact, they're probably the best ensemble of characters in any action franchise in the modern era. Each of them brings something unique and consequential to the film. Blockbusters just aren't doing enough of that, and it makes the flaws of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" effortless to overlook.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Saw this movie in iMax 3D format, blew my mind clean, absolute amazing designs, colors and action. If you one day feel like you want your action cask strength with not a drop of water, you are in for a treat with this one. I grew up in the 70-80:ies, which means I really loved the colors, reminding me of those classic marvel comics. Im a bit fed up with dark marvel, marvel was almost never dark in its original, it was packed with bright color and humor and irony and amazing adventures, much like this movie.

"etiennestories","2","13","26","15 May 2017"," Dull, silly, and stupid
","The first Guardians movie was fresh, funny, and clever. Sadly, the new one is just the opposite, dull, silly, and stupid. It's hard to believe that the same creative team is responsible for both. We came close to walking out of the theater and demanding a refund, given the high cost of seeing films in IMAX 3-D, but we stuck it out to the bitter end, hoping against hope that it would get better. It didn't."
"Optimuszor","6","17","36","1 May 2017"," Nowhere close to the first one!
","I was so hyped for this movie since I LOVED the first one! But coming out of the cinema I just felt ripped off and let down. <br/><br/>This movie has the core of the first one, the CGI effects, blending visuals, humor and great characters. The problem is how they are utilized cause it all felt so forced! The humor was so cringe worthy at times and pretty obvious. There are two scenes, one in the beginning and one in the end that are so overly done that it makes you laugh at how BAD they are. They sort of want a reaction from the audience, but it's not a good one. At my cinema it was all silence so one could hear the crickets in the first scene.<br/><br/>The plot is also all over the place, pretty much a filler with no substance. Suddenly Peters father shows up, whom is regarded as one the most powerful beings in the universe. His purpose is sort of just latched on without any meaning other than having a second movie. Also, the movie does not tie into the other MCU movies besides mentioning the infinity stones just once.<br/><br/>I think those who have not seen the first one will love this, but for us who have, it's just another filler episode of the Marvel franchise."
"gillespiesan","9","7","12","21 May 2017"," Better than first movie? Maybe. Better than anything else currently playing? Absolutely...
","Look, over the last week or so I've read a lot of nonsense about how GOTG2 treads the same water as the first movie, that it's lazy film making, that the jokes are wearing thin...all of it utter crap! The first movie was a breath of fresh air in the same way that Deadpool was. Without the violence and the profanities, sure, but something new all the same. This is what can be done with what is starting to become a slightly tired formula. A new template, if you will...<br/><br/>Well, guess what? The second GOTG movie is more of the same...only bigger, louder, more colourful and maybe even more fun. That's a pretty crucial word just there, fun. I'm pretty sure I sat through the entire movie with a big, dumb smile on my face. If I didn't, then I should have. If you loved the first movie, you'll love this one even more. If you didn't see the first movie, you should do something about that post haste and then get along and have some fun with Volume 2."
"barbagvido","10","7","12","20 May 2017"," I'm surprised. This is my favorite MCU movie after Captain America:Civil War.
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a 15th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Time flies, huh? With all bigger comic book movies coming out in 2017 I was actually the least hyped for this one. There were some reasons to worry. Usually when a sequel tries to outdo the original by going bigger, it turns into a mess. And I'm happy to say that wasn't the case with this one.<br/><br/>The plot is actually rather straightforward but it's how it's done that matters here. The characters are all likable and well fleshed-out, the dialogue is witty and well-written (except for a few cringy jokes, but those tiny parts are easy to forget), the actors give their best in their roles and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! First one was also entertaining, but it just didn't really feel as good as this one, you don't have that sense of a team and friendship in the first one because they were still introducing to each other and getting together. Here, the chemistry is real. And now that you know the characters, it's a lot easier to relate and feel for them. The emotions are strong with this one, trust me. Also, if you're looking for answers you didn't get in the first one, you will get them here. And finally, another great villain. Not forgettable like in many MCU movies.<br/><br/>So, in short, I said everything I wanted about this movie. The plot may be simpler than the predecessor's but this one is so much more enjoyable, heartwarming and emotional. You will want to come back to this one more than the first one. At least I know I will."

","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 where do I start except saying that was one killer movie that you need to see if you have not seen it yet. Chris Pratt did a great job once again as Star Lord and Vin Diesel did a fantastic job as Baby Groot and Bradley Cooper did a great job as Rocket. This movie was one of those where you know it is going to be great but it is better then you thought it was going to be.<br/><br/>Parents to be honest yes this movie is PG-13 but besides the violence I don't see why it is PG-13. The film will take you on a wonderful journey that you will want not to end it is by far the best Marvel movie so far. This is just not an action movie but it is also super funny I mean Baby Groot I love him he made me laugh and laugh every time he was on the screen this is just a great movie.<br/><br/>My score 10/10"
"SeakDub","10","7","12","19 May 2017"," Another Awesome Ride With the Guardians!
","As good as Vol. 1? I believe so. This movie came out just as wonderful as the first. A perfect 10/10 again. From all the Marvel films, Guardians of the Galaxy takes the win and favorite. If you have not yet seen either of the two, I strongly recommend them.<br/><br/>Following our favorite bad mouthing heroes, Starlord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and probably everyone's favorite baby Groot. This time though we get to learn some back story's and most importantly who Starlord's father really is. An emotional but funny space journey. Hats off to James Gunn again pulling off another incredible film. From start to finish we get to learn more about these heroes which was left out of the first volume. And with doing so, great jokes and some intense action. <br/><br/>One of the reasons I love Guardians so much is the music/soundtrack. Beautiful music that of course comes from Starlord which gives it a much more deep element than just random thrown in music. It is who he is. And glad of the song choices they picked this time round. You almost want to jump up and start dancing. <br/><br/>In the first volume, Starlord stuck out and believe you loved him the most. Whereas this one I praise James Gunn on Drax, Dave Bautista who plays him. This character will have you on the edge of your seat laughing. Probably the best jokes come from him. But what is also beautiful is just how kids actually enjoy him much more. Baby Groot of course takes some of the cake for his cuteness. Each character has their own little world which fits perfectly. With new faces to get to know as well. But I also have to mention Michael Rooker's character, Yondu. Again another character who stuck out in this film with more of a backstory and such a step up. An awesome character that is downright B.A. In the comics he is one of the original Guardians but for the film is a Ravager. But how Rooker plays Yondu is absolutely brilliant. I would go as far to say that he deserves an award for such a talented performance along with Bautista.<br/><br/>The only downside I saw with this film is how it takes awhile before the story/plot come into play. You sort of wonder where it's going, but by the end of the film, it all comes together. You'll appreciate the way they do it. Otherwise I can't say anything I didn't like about it. Maybe some of the jokes weren't the best, but nowadays movies aren't funny. You will get some great laughs from this film and some great emotions from these characters. Don't miss ""Awesome Mix Vol. 2!"" Or in other words, Guardians of the Galaxy!<br/><br/>And don't forget to stay after the credits! Five post credit scenes!"
"combsjo","9","7","12","18 May 2017"," The movie was great, the playlists truly make them what they are.
","Bodyguards of Samsung aka Guardians of the Galaxy...S8<br/><br/>Do you like action movies? Do you like comedic movies? Do you like unspoken romance that's there but not there but still there? Well I just saw ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" which had all of what was said before. I'd like to give my opinion on this amazing movie.<br/><br/>In this movie the Guardians, Starlord, Gamora, Baby Groot, Drax, and Rocket, save the batteries of the Sovereign from the space monster and then battle it out later with the Sovereign due to the Guardians being neither good nor bad. This takes place all over the galaxy. They jump from planet to planet in the ship. <br/><br/>I liked the movie because of the dynamic of the characters and also the playlist. The characters work good together with Starlord being very funny and silly and Drax is very serious and literal. The one thing I didn't like about the movie was that it ended. I learned that you shouldn't trust some random guy who says he is your dad and was gone for 26 years. i also think that people can change.<br/><br/>Groups of all age will love this movie. The humor can be mature but it wont be inappropriate to the younger crowd. I recommend everyone comes and watches this movie because it isn't too mature or too immature. The MPAA rating of the movie is PG-13. I think this movie is really good and I would give it a 9/10."
"aciessi","8","7","12","15 May 2017"," Space Oddity
","The Guardians are back. Bigger, badder, crazier and funnier than ever. However, how does this one size up the original? A film that surprised filmgoers everywhere and took the Marvel empire by storm as an August sleeper hit, three years ago. You can only capture that sense of discovery once, I suppose, but does that really matter in the end? Isn't the whole idea of this franchise to be a goofy, popcorn action flick that gives you more bang for your buck than most multiplexes serve up in a month? Guardians Vol. 2 does that in spades. It's unbelievable fun.<br/><br/>All the returning characters have a real sense of longevity as to how likable and hilarious they all are. Like a family reunion, you're amazed by how much you missed them and how much they've grown. The story may seem choppy, but you're having too much fun to notice. The non-stop action made me cackle with glee. The jokes are timed perfectly. The emotional aspect of the drama scenes hit you out of nowhere, and surprisingly, moved me even more than the opening scene in the first one.<br/><br/>Let's not forget all the little things that tie the whole thing together. Like the adorable Baby Groot's kiddy antics, cameos by Marvel legends and another blast from the past from Peter's mixtape. Chances are, if you're a millennial, you've never heard of the songs featured here. Let this be the eye opening moment, where you realize that today's music is total garbage."

"CANpatbuck3664","9","7","12","13 May 2017"," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Continues the Great Run of Marvel's Most Unconventional Team
","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We briefly join Meredith Quill (Laura Haddock) as she's having a joyride with her boyfriend Ego (a CG version of Kurt Russell). They pull in at a Dairy Queen but Ego takes her down the hill behind it to show here an extraterrestrial flower he's planted in the ground. They hug and Meredith remarks how she fell in love with a spaceman.<br/><br/>A lot is expected from this movie. When you serve up an excellent and memorable movie the first time around, you not only have to meet that expectation but surpass it. James Gunn and the crew had an enormous amount of pressure and I think they expanded on the Guardians universe about as well as they could have. This movie is even more impressive visually, the colours explode around the characters. They create an even more vibrant and fun galaxy to exist in. The makeup is just as good if not better. I love the fact that they did the makeup practically on characters like Yondu, Drax, Gamora, Ayesha and Nebula; it just looks better with how much CGI we're getting nowadays. They also travel to new and interesting environments and it's good they weren't content just to recycle the CGI locations. I think this is an even better looking movie than the first one and considering the first one was no slouch in that department, that's high praise.<br/><br/>The first Guardians really launched a few careers besides Gunn as a blockbuster filmmaker. Chris Pratt took a risk doing the first one and it payed off handsomely. He's consistent as Peter Quill and continues doing excellent work. Zoe's a sci-fi vet and she gets a more complete arc to work with here. She never gets her due and she's good here. Dave Bautista as Drax was even funnier and he continues to grow as an actor. Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper lend some more solid voice work. Several supporting characters get bigger chunks of screen time. Michael Rooker shines as Yondu, Karen Gillian gives Nebula some more dimension and I liked that Sean Gunn had a bigger role. Kurt Russell was perfect and he stole the show for me. He sells his emotional beats as Ego and you want to believe in his growing relationship with Peter. Pom Klementieff was decent even if I was kind of so-so on her character and I liked Elizabeth Debicki a lot. She's an underrated actress and she's pretty versatile.<br/><br/>I think the only real weakness in the first movie is that Ronan makes for a forgettable villain. It wasn't Lee Pace's fault, it just seems to be a weakness that most of the Marvel movies share. Guardians Vol. 2 obscures the major threat to our heroes for a lot longer in the movie than it normally takes. I had an inkling on who would step forward but I think the movie did a really great job of creating a well rounded character to put in that spot. They develop a strong and personal relationship with one of the Guardians and you want to believe that they're going to be best friends forever. Even though if you pay attention, you can see the bread crumbs being dropped. So Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 even pulled off a rare feat for Marvel, an excellent villain to match up against the hero.<br/><br/>This movie excels at being funny and it has some very emotional moments. The only real criticism of this movie that I have (other than comparing it to the first one) is that some of the moments feel a little forced. They make a concerted effort to give each of the characters their proper time and normally that's a good thing. But I felt like the movie was a little pushy in getting some of the emotional beats across. I don't want to come across as a nit-picker but they seemed less organic and a little overstuffed because everyone had to have a character arc. Perfect balance is hard to achieve and while this movie didn't fail, it didn't perfect it either.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy was not only one of the best Marvel entries of the past couple of years but one of the best of Marvel's complete run as a movie production company. It completely blew me away, I love sci-fi adventure and while it fit in the larger Marvel cinematic universe, the movie wasn't afraid to deliver something off-beat and fresh. It gave us new Marvel characters that were different and took us to new places that we wouldn't see in other Marvel films. It was extremely funny but it had the plot and characters to back it up. I'm praising the first entry so thoroughly because one of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 unfortunate short-comings is that it doesn't come across as being as fresh or as inventive. It's not really fair because once you've already been introduced to something, you can't be re-introduced to it. So this movie really needed to do something amazing to replicate that feeling and while it more than justified itself as a sequel, I can't put it on the first one's level. It shored up certain minor short-comings from the first entry (delivering a genuinely memorable villain and adding interesting character development across the board) but it didn't hit that high benchmark. I still really dug it though, it would be more of an 8.5/10 but I don't feel bad rounding it up to a 9."

","There isn't much to say about 2017's ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" that probably hasn't been said already, so I'm just going to try to break it down into a few pointers/highlights.<br/><br/><ul><li>Writer/director James Gunn. I am continually impressed by this jokey, enthusiastic former Troma alumnus who has certainly come a long way SINCE his Troma days, and the gross-out horror of ""Slither"" (2006) and his first superhero effort, the black comedy ""Super"" (2010). You can tell that the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" series for Marvel are probably the films he's been wanting to make for the longest time.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>James Gunn, again. Gunn is a true smart-aleck, and his film is rife with witty one-liners and clever dialogue that shows that while his budgets have increased ten-fold, he still retains his smart-aleck sense of humor that characterized much of his earlier, smaller-budgeted work. And he makes his laughs, and the timing of those laughs, count.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The cast - Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (pro wrestler Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). What can I say? The central themes of this sequel are family, and the ties that bind. While Gunn's script kind of hits us over the head with this, it is clear that a cinematic family of sorts has been formed, amongst these hard-luck losers of petty crooks and fugitives-turned-mercenaries-for-hire, and they all appear to be having a blast in their roles - especially Chris Pratt, who before ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was known primarily for his role on ""Parks and Recreation"" and has lost a considerable amount of weight, beefed up, and shaped himself into a capable leading man.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The music. The film has a score by Tyler Bates, but its main soundtrack is comprised of old-school hits primarily from the 1970s, which gives ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" a kind of self-knowing retro-hipness that shows that while it's set in outer space and in another galaxy, its roots are firmly in the distant past, in far simpler times that Our Hero Star-Lord clings to desperately even as he embraces his new role as the leader of a mis-matched group of interstellar heroes.</li></ul><br/><br/>That's all that I really have to say about ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"" which is an even more Awesome Mix than the first.<br/><br/>10/10"

One thing that most people need to realise...not always is possible to adapt from books/comics, etc...exactly as it is on them. So the first and this part are absolutely awesome!!! I'm sure you won't be disappointed! Made me want to see other Marvel movies even more! Star Lord and Co. continue as the whited gang as they are and with a great mix of comedy, action and visual effects to boot! I still prefer the first one but the chemistry of the cast on Vol. 2 is still present and Drax's honesty is hilarious in most parts of his dialogues. You can't please everyone and there will be negative reviews but my opinion is simple...go and watch it and make your own mind on what you think."

","The Guardians are back and they surely do not disappoint.The MCU creates an emotional,really entertaining and important film.It is not as good as the first one,but deserves to be watched.Just imagine Baby Groot dancing like crazy while the other members are trying to fight a huge monster in one of the first scenes.How better can it get?<br/><br/>One thing that I really liked in this film is that it is deeper that the first and has an emotional tone,something that we rarely see in superhero films.It shows the real meaning of family and friendship and emphasizes on team work and sacrifice.It makes the audience move to tears and feel the particular film.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was PERFECT!I loved Mr.Blue Sky,The Chain,Fox on the Run,Father and Son!It was energetic and it was combined perfectly with the scenes.<br/><br/>Another advantage of the film was the character development.Yondu/Mary Poppins was maybe the best character of the film,because he was funny,cool and at the end proved that he's is a hero and a great daddy!Star Lord and Rocket were cool.Gamora and Nebula developed a great relationship with each other.Dax was really cool!He was funny,emotional and did exactly what he needed to do as a character.Baby Groot was really entertaining and cute,but he could have had a more important role in this film.Mantis,one of the new characters had a clever power and I liked the way they designed her look.<br/><br/>The only character that I did not particularly liked was Ego,Star-Lord's Father.He was not the appropriate villain for the film and the idea that he was a planet and person at the same time was clever but over-fleshed.<br/><br/>Except from Ego's character,I thought that the plot was a little weak and that the Guardian's story was less important than the first one.Although it had a great introduction and the movie included a lot of impressive action scenes,the story did not fully capture the guardian's greatness.<br/><br/>The film provides great humor,touching scenes,cool characters and it has the same style as the first one.I especially liked the emotional ending.A perfect funeral.Fireworks all around the galaxy.Father and Son.How can you not cry?<br/><br/>All in all,the guardians strike back in a powerful way and they do not only kick butt.They show to us that when we drop the ego whether it's our personal ego or our crazy planet god father named Ego then we can learn to value life and be with the more important things that could already be standing right next to us.

","James Gunn is back writing and directing the sequel to his surprise 2014 summer hit. And it might be a fresh mix tape slammed into the Walkman, but it's much of the same again. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>In terms of the story, it's almost a remake of the worst Star Trek film ever made! However, this time its all done for 'laffs' and so works much, much better. We join Quill (Chris Pratt, ""Jurassic World""), Gamora (Zoe Saldana, ""Star Trek Beyond""), Drax (Dave Bautista, ""Spectre"") and Rocket (the voice of Bradley Cooper) 'ever ready' (LOL) to save the priceless Anulax batteries of their current employees, the Sovereigns, from the ravages of some multi-dimensional being. 'Helping' them is Baby Groot, a twig off the old branch from the first film, again voiced (in what must be the easiest money in Hollywood) by Vin Diesel (""Fast and Furious 8"").<br/><br/>The Sovereign's High Priestess (Elizabeth Debicki, ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."") provides payment to Gamora in the form of her chained-up evil sister Nebula (a deliciously sulky Karen Gillen, ""Dr Who"", ""Oculus"") but is then less than impressed when the mercenary Rocket pockets a knapsack full of the batteries. So starts a chase across the galaxy leading Quill to meet Ego (Kurt Russell, ""The Hateful 8"") on the planet Ego (LOL) at the very base of his family tree.<br/><br/>The great thing about these films is that they don't even TRY to be realistic. Characters get towed behind crashing spaceships and - literally- dragged through a wood backwards; others fall hundreds of feet to certain death... no, sorry, a ""superhero landing""; and planets and characters are painted with a garishness never ever to be found in nature. You'll even believe Kurt Russell is 18 again - oh that these effects were available on the British NHS! <br/><br/>But the other saving grace for this film is the soundtrack, put together by Tyler Bates as an ode to the 80's, with wonderful tracks by ELO, Fleetwood Mac, Cat Stevens and a host of others. The film matches the music with the action superbly. <br/><br/>I won't bother commenting on the acting... who cares with this sort of film! But everyone seems to have fun with Michael Rooker (""Cliffhanger"") being particularly good in reprising his role of Yondu. There are also a wealth of memorable cameos, some of them being laugh out loud moments. While some of the pop culture references might go over a younger audience's heads, there are still enough great one- liners and comic moments to provide general appeal. Bad guys silhouetted against the moon, ET style, was particularly memorable. <br/><br/>One criticism I would have though is that it's just too darn long for an ""action comedy"". The original film just about scraped into my good books by coming in under the two hour curfew. The sequel however adds another 15 minutes, which should have found its way either onto the cutting room floor or onto the ""Blu Ray collector's edition"". In particular, the final never-ending showdown of CGI manicness went on too long for my liking. <br/><br/>Looking back at the original 2014 review, I gave it a rather stingy 6* rating, which in retrospect I think was a bit mean given its novelty. This time the novelty has worn off, but if anything this is an even more enjoyable romp that the first outing. <br/><br/>James Gunn be warned though: I am unlikely to be so generous with ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3"" (as threatened) which in my view might be a trip too far for this franchise. My advice would be to take a leaf out of Peter Kay's ""Car Share"" book and quit while you're ahead.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com.

It was funny, witty, well scripted - it was all pieced together very well. While the sequel did have its good moments, it seemed to want to ride on the first film's coattails; rather than make an effort to be a great movie on it's own. Grut's character especially seemed overdone and a bit forced on this one. This franchise really deserves a better sequel.

But it could be I'm just jaded, at least one of the boys loved the whole ""Tazerface"" gag. And a planet called ""Ego"", ugh-o. Unspoken love that gets spoken?

I mean I'll cry at some commercials, but even the Cats Steven's ""Father and Son"" missed its mark by a Hallmark card.

Character development was good no to fast no to slow. I think in this one the importance of the movie were in making a connection with each other.<br/><br/>But Since I am talking about family and character development, Ego of the Living Planet(Kurt Russel) I am going to be honest I had my doubts about him and this character. At first I was reluctant to like him but as the movies when alone I star surprise liking his character more and more, I like that development it was just the right touch and the big empty space that our dear star lord has always had about his dear daddy. But not everything is in a sweet dream, as the drama and comedy when alone I kind find my self wondering how was the Villain in this story but I would never ever even imagined that it was going to be him I knew that he want to dominated the Universe and make them bee as his imagine but I never though he would have kill Peter Mother's come one. I think that twist make the final touch to James Gunn, he did really catch me out in this one.<br/><br/>Gamora and Nebula relationship as sister when I even beyond death, I think that development of this two was good, we know for sure that there would be more of this two in a future movies.<br/><br/>I like Yondu in the first movie but in this movies I even like him more and more that I could even like. Yondu show us the principal value of sacrifice yourself for those that you love most and he did. he show us that no matter how many things wrong you have do wrong there is always around to make up.<br/><br/>The concept that James Gunn brought thru the movie not only shows to people like me and younger audience that Family and friendship are very important.<br/><br/>Overall it was a excellent movie the comedy and sarcasms was just in point , it was just as a roller-coaster ups and down but with a define beautiful end Cannot wait for Guardians VOL 3"

","I enjoyed the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie. I really did. Its humor and authenticity made for a wonderful film, as did its feel-good warmth.<br/><br/>However, its sequel lacks that human touch and replaces it with a grab- bag of Hollywood tropes. Every action that anyone takes is driven by desire for ""family"" which they insist on explaining on screen in length. Showing and not telling has apparently been forgotten since the first ""Guardians"" movie. <br/><br/>Ego's complicated motivations for destroying all life in the universe are given way too much screen time given how confusing they are, and the subplot about the Ravagers that culminates in the final fight is ham- fisted, though it is the most amusing part of the movie. That clumsiness is shared with that of Gamora, whose role in the movie is eminently forgettable. <br/><br/>The movie isn't totally boring, and the 80s flashbacks are fun as always. I had expected better though from both Marvel and the ""Guardians"" franchise. Hopefully the next movie will be more like the first than the second. <br/><br/>(I saw this on a plane on September 17, 2017.)"

While escaping from a team of bounty hunters, they come across Star-lord's father, Ego, and discover the powers that he holds and what Star- Lord was destined to do.<br/><br/>Now I didn't watch the original Guardians of the Galaxy, but from what I had heard, it was supposed to be incredible. Because of this, I expected this movie to be that way too.<br/><br/>To an extent, I was pretty pleasantly surprised by the movie. The characters held the same charm that they did in the original movie with the heroes being flawed yet still very lovable. The movie gives our main character Starlord some more depth, which is something that I really appreciated. Somehow, I found the new Baby Groot even more charming than Groot from the original film. He provides the comedy and gives some of the more intense scenes such as the intro a more light hearted feel. The movie has a lot of funny moments. The Awesome Mix was also really good with many great classic songs as well.<br/><br/>If there's one complaint I have with this movie, it's that it wasn't quite as fresh as the original Guardians of the Galaxy, as it holds a heavy focus on the relationship between Starlord and Ego.

"raa-55017","8","6","10","14 May 2017"," Colorful, Loud, and Fun
","It's almost impossible for a sequel to out-preform it's predecessor, although it has been accomplished more than once in recent years (The Winter Soldier, The Dark Knight, etc.). The first Guardians of the Galaxy was, and still is, one of my favorite movies of 2014. Knowing this, I went into GOTG2 with lowered expectations, yet eager to see what fun eye candy the director, James Gunn, had in store this second time around. Needless to say I came out pleased and satisfied with what I had gotten. Is it as good as the first? No. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 does not quite capture the magic of the first film, but it delivers the same laughs and action that we know and love. The very opening scene with Baby Groot dancing to ELO's ""Mr. Blue Sky"" while a huge inter- dimensional space monster battle rages behind him delivers the tone of the movie perfectly: it's fun. The main reason so many fell in love with the first Guardians was how fun and joyful it all was. This sequel certainly captures that same feel, while delivering more on the humor as well. You notice an attempted effort to include lots more jokes and laughter into this second movie, and while some jokes don't hit as they intended, most do. So why isn't Guardians of the Galaxy 2 as good as the first? The plot. The first 30 to 45 minutes are spent without a real purpose, and it isn't until around halfway through the movie when an actual goal comes to fruition. Star Lord, played magnificently once again by Chris Pratt, finds his long lost father, Ego. While this seems compelling, many scenes in the beginning parts of the movie don't flow very well. Contrast this to the first film where every scene flawlessly fit into place one cut after another. Some scenes between the first and second act feel a little disjointed and choppy, but the movie soon picks up for a spectacular third act. Overall, this movie is a fun escape (with an excellent soundtrack) that will please most, despite not quite capturing the extraordinary feel of the original."
"secretzfan","8","6","10","7 May 2017"," James Gun holds strong by breaking the formula
","This film is amazing in so many ways. This film does push away from some of the ensemble feel of the first one making this film not feel as strong as the first one did by giving more development to other areas in the world that Guardians inhabit. It is amazing what James Gun manages to accomplish in this film. In this short he has managed to capture all the most important parts of the original making it more interesting and dynamic. <br/><br/>The first Guardians of the Galaxy was pretty much a 10 for me. I thought it was one of the funnest movies I had seen. Only being outdone by the Oscar wining film known as Birdman (which I watch once ever year). It is very naturally written and paced also extremely well. It was such a great film that was always going to be nearly impossible to outdo. <br/><br/>And in some ways it is better. <br/><br/>Vol 2 manages to give development to one of the lesser characters in the last film known as Yondu Making him a lot more interesting and a lot more dynamic as well. You come to care foe Yondu as a person. <br/><br/>The relationship between Peter and his father is also very well done and has a lot of heart. <br/><br/>And for the first time ever the Marvel movies actually manage to make a really amazing and captivating villain who matters!! This film also has a legitimate death in it. James Gun has done it people. He has broken the Marvel formula!!!<br/><br/>Sadly it is still to the defeat of the ensemble feel of the first one as the rest of the cast while still great and fun aren't being as highlighted as they were in the first one. <br/><br/>The jokes are more like Age of Ultron jokes with a few being really funny. <br/><br/>And the final act of the film feels like every superhero movie ever. <br/><br/>Overall though Guardians of the Galaxy is still a fun movie that you will still very much enjoy despite some of its flaws."

Watching this film was like watching a Skittles commercial whilst overdosing on cocaine in an LCD induced fever dream. <br/><br/>The action is nothing but over the top, sledge hammer to the brain, mayhemic, CGI diarrhea. Gone is the disarming charm of the first film, replaced with something that feels like it was written by a Disney AI, and cobbled together as a result of strict focus group fan polling of the memorable moments from the first film. Remember dancing Baby Groot? Of course you do!! Now we get an Entire SEQUENCE of that!! Great, right?!?!?!<br/><br/>No joke, I need to wrack my brain just to find anything to praise in this. Zoe Saldana is sleep walking through this whole thing, and Chris Pratt barely seems to care. Bautista is the only one that actually looked like he was having fun, but then he's reduced to being nothing more than a glorified background character. Seriously, his name is Drax the Destroyer, and he does no destroying in the film. He just kind of tags along, cracking the same kind of jokes over and over again (FYI, he's a big guy who does big turds√Ç‚Ä¶ yes, this is an actual joke in the film.) <br/><br/>The fact this film received any praise whatsoever is absolute confirmation that Marvel bias is a thing (if that weren't already obvious.) Seriously, if Michael Bay had directed this mess of a film, then one. hundred. percent, the internet would be tearing it to pieces. As it is, enthusiasm for the first film is clouding people's ability to judge. <br/><br/>More jokes, more humour, more action, more CGI, more explosions, more characters, more 80's references, and yet this is a lesser film than the first in every conceivable way. GoTG 1 was easily one of Marvel's best, this is straight up their worst. 7.9 out of 10 score for this film is a crime against humanity."
"jameskidac","8","9","17","9 May 2017"," James Gunn displayed his big guns and iron back
","This movie should have been terrible, because of the time limit, the lack of good material to work with and a fatigue of rag tag team genre. However, that being said, Mister Gunn brought out the big guns in writing, in direction, in keeping the team together and it shows in a great adventure, something out of the playbook of a space opera wildhogs. There is a great sense of being in the moment and each time we thought the magic would fade, it strengthens just a little. This is by no means the only story Mister Gunn wanted to say, because we can tell from it his great passion for the arts, but it was one that was still pretty awesome. The cast retained their great chemistry and flaws and that is pretty neat, given we are normally washed down with generic characters with blandness of a overbearing sense of perfection. There is none of that here, and the sense of vulnerability was good. The plethora of legit human emotions make me confident in vol.3 and the music was still good, so lets believe in the next ride because it will probably be the same given the dreaded sequel was not blowing up in the flames of first film's own initial success. Love!"
"javi-y-se-acabo","7","9","17","28 April 2017"," Awesome Mix Vol. 2
","I went to see this movie expecting something similar to the first one, full of action, special effects and so on. In many aspects, this is up to the first one with many spectacular action sequences, full of jokes (sometimes unnecessary jokes, but it's Marvel, and I say that as no offense, don't get me wrong, but sometimes they feel like a bit off- place).<br/><br/>One of the best things of this movie compared to the first one, is the character development of many of the characters (specially the secondary ones of the first movie). Okay, it's not a very big development but we get to know a bit more of the past lives of all the guardians. I liked the introduction of Nebula again because it gave some emotional moments with her relationship with Gamora. Also one of the best improvements is the character of Yondu. At the beginning you feel like he won't do anything special, just kill a few people with his flying arrow, but when he goes to rescue Peter to the planet of his father, you start to like him, and at the end you feel like he is the real father of Peter, not his monstrous planet-destroyer father.<br/><br/>The other great thing, as the same as the first one, is the Awesome Mix of songs used in the soundtrack. Not only the great main theme which was used, but also all the songs that we hear in the Awesome Mix Vol. 2 of the mix tape of Peter. The music makes you feel. From the first hilarious scene, with Baby Groot dancing around, to the final emotional scene with all the ships shooting the fireworks in the funeral. About this I have to add that is the first time that a Marvel-Disney movie gives a character such an emotional end, that actually makes you care about him.<br/><br/>One of the things I felt were down to the original is, obviously, the surprise. If you have watched the first one, you know how it is, and in this movie you are expecting something similar so in this aspect, there were parts that felt like a bit the same as the first one. Also there are some characters that are a bit useless. Sylvester Stallone in fact doesn't do anything that is worth for his presence but it doesen't bother too much. Also this is similar with Elizabeth Debicki, who I feel that in some parts was great but a bit unnecessary in others, and I think she has been introduced here for the sequel. You know what I mean if you stay in all the end credits, and believe me, it's worth the wait.<br/><br/>In general, in some aspects is very similar to the first one, but not in every moments that means a bad thing. Overall this provides a very good entertainment movie full of action and emotion with a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>Recommended to every Marvel, superhero, space or action movie fan."
"MrDHWong","8","9","17","27 April 2017"," Still retains most of the fun and action that made the original such a hit
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the sequel to the 2014 film and the third entry into Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Based on the Marvel Comics characters, this film still retains most of the fun and action that made the original such a hit.<br/><br/>A short time after the events of the first film, the Guardians of the Galaxy, lead by Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), are still travelling through space on their usual adventures. One day, after escaping from a barrage of enemies, the Guardians meet a mysterious man named Ego (Kurt Russell), who claims to be Peter's true father. Ego takes Peter to his homeworld, where he intends to live with and be a true father to him. However, the rest of the Guardians feel something doesn't seem right and investigate what Ego's true intentions really are.<br/><br/>Filled to the brim with dry humour, great action, a catchy soundtrack, a funny Stan Lee cameo, and the rest of the Marvel film staples, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a worthy follow-up, although it does lack some of the freshness and surprise that was in the 2014 original. I particularly enjoyed the extended character development given to characters Drax (Dave Bautista) and Yondu (Michael Rooker). Once again, though, it is Vin Diesel as (Baby) Groot who steals the show in just about every scene he is in. As to be expected, there are some post-credits scenes to stay back for, five of them to be precise.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10"
"paulijcalderon","7","9","17","26 April 2017"," Hooked on this feeling? The answer is Yes and with extra surprises
","I don't know if I like this one more or less than the first one. The story felt scaled down if you think about how ""Vol. 1"" was. Or maybe I shouldn't say scaled down. It was more centered on one thing. So, don't go in expecting a sequel that's more epic or just bigger/grander in general. Sure, the spectacle and the humor is still there. You will get your money's worth because of those things. But, the actual story line is a little different and not very common with these type of films. It might be disappointing for some or it might be great for others. I had a good time with it though.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting the movie to go to some places and the surprises were pretty good. I love the characters. Baby Groot was the one I wasn't completely sold on. I'm not the biggest fan of the idea that he is a baby in this one. Most of the jokes hit home, some minor ones felt a little too much. Don't worry, there are more good jokes than bad ones. I did laugh plenty of times. Drax was really good in this and so was Michael Rooker's Yondu. Chris Pratt delivers. He gets to have more of a dramatic role, but he still doesn't forget to have fun. I felt that Zoe Saldana's Gamora didn't stand out so much this time around. She was still playing the character well though. Mantis was one of the stand outs this time. The humor and charisma she brings to the table was fantastic. Stallone was underutilized. It was weird seeing him in it at first. It was like, ""What's he doing in this movie?"". But, he was fine as a supporting character. Now how was Kurt Russell? Well, I will not spoil anything, but he was pretty much Kurt Russell. Meaning he basically played himself. But, hey! It worked. The movie is already vibrant and funny enough that having Russell in it makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>I admire the fact that James Gunn just goes for it and makes movies that feel personal. I like that it wasn't just entirely for the laughs and that there were some serious scenes. Most of them were good, because they dared to do some unexpected things. They also helped explore the characters even better. Although those serious/dramatic scenes usually followed up a scene that was ridiculous and fun, so the transition didn't feel smooth enough. I hope you understand what I mean. For example; We get a pop song and everyone's firing blasters and then the next second the music gets very melodramatic and someone is talking about sad feelings. What I'm trying to say is that the tones were very jumpy sometimes. There's of course the ""Fast & Furious"" thing about them stating they're a family. I didn't buy it actually. As friends? Yes, of course. But, saying they are a family is stretching it. That's probably my biggest negative. And the finale wasn't the greatest. I missed the presence of a lot of characters from the first movie. Maybe they'll show up in a sequel down the line.<br/><br/>I may have worded this review out too much by now. I'm sorry about that. Basic point is that the Marvel Cinematic Universe hasn't hit a dead spot yet. They are still bringing us entertaining and surprisingly fresh stories. This is a pretty easy watch and the plus is that you might get some nice emotional parts here and there. Go in with a fresh mind. It's weird, I know. But, the characters all feel alive in this strange galaxy. Check it out!"
"nigel-431-811649","9","9","17","25 April 2017"," Superbly Crafted sequel that fails not to disappoint!
","GOTG2. Just simply does what it was hoped and expected to do. It has built on a wonderful, tongue in cheek and yet surprisingly refreshing original. The original I approached with skepticism, a raccoon, a tree, a blue woman, a pale hulk and a rising ""chisel jawed"" A-lister, amalgamating to save the universe. I own that mistake, for as we all know now it was one of the most refreshing films in the Marvel cinematic experience. This skepticism for the original was almost echoed by knowing the apparently insurmountable objective of expanding the original concept without it parodying itself into oblivion. Once again I was surprised, if not elated at the achievement of the direction, story, the cast and visuals. It is as hammed up as a Christmas pantomime, yet the humour, blatantly obvious at times treats you to almost audience participation. It feels as if you are turning the page of your favourite comic, hoping that you know the next panel in the storyboard and being relieved, at the satisfaction of the well-conceived twist and turn or equally satisfied by the predicted character nuance based response. These are family, you are a guardian of the galaxy recruit. The tongue firmly planted in the proverbial cheek for most assaults on the emotions, it manages to largely avoid groans of soft story writing and delivery by well timed obtuse interjections. Just when you are about to groan at some saccharine infused moment you find are laughing out loud as someone blows the sentimentality out of the water. Prepare to laugh, and laugh a lot which serves to put you off guard for the inevitable emotional polarity shifts, when the rewards for great character development gives rise to losses and strains. You probably can guess the story, you probably will be three comic pages away from knowing the story, but it is with satisfaction these unveil themselves in the crafted art, complimented but not obscured by stunning visuals, amazing special effects and fantastically incorporated soundtrack. Let's face it! It is a must see for those that immerse themselves in the Marvel universe it will satisfy all your hopes for it. For the easter egg hunters. Happy bountiful Easter! For the not so familiar with the comic genre experience on screen. BUY GOTG1, watch it and enjoy and see this before it leaves the big screen. I almost forgave Stallone for attempting to wreck Dredd because he was OK in this, but that's another story. See it and enjoy!"

I loved vol 1, and couldn't wait to see vol 2, but you couldn't pay me to watch it again. I guess, sooner or later, Marvel was bound to fail, I just didn't think they would fail so badly. This film makes the DCU films look like Iron Man. This film adds zero to the larger Marvel universe, and it a total waste of time. Save yourself! Avoid this junk for your own good."
"niaz_islam","3","8","15","30 September 2017"," Senseless Story
","Marvel did it again; spent a loads of money on CGI and brought in lots of unnecessary characters for no good reason to make a blockbuster and completely ignore the script in the process.<br/><br/>The story is full of plot holes. It was written very poorly and lacks basic logic. The film does not make any sense altogether. But I do have to give credit to the dialogues of Drax (Dave Bautista); they were extremely funny. Those are the only things I find entertaining in the entire film.<br/><br/>Despite high ratings and metascore this film is a below average film with a crappy script.<br/><br/>Not Recommended."
"tretyakovazoya","10","8","15","23 May 2017"," I am Groot
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a whole heap of fun. The film really gives you enjoyment. American superhero film based on a comic book by Marvel comics. The film was directed by James Gunn, who is known as the screenwriter of the film Scooby Doo. Legendary actors such as Bradley Cooper, Chris Pratt, Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell starred in this film. The atmosphere of the film is really amazing. Guardians of the Galaxy continue to explore the space while helping Peter Quillen to learn more about its true origin. The film captures the hearts of millions of people with baby Groot (this is so cute). Once again, we hear the music of the eighties that sends us to the past. Incredible visual effects and production design allow us to take in the film. A well-crafted plot makes no odds to leave without a smile after watching the movie. In the film, we find out who's the father and who's just a dad¬Ö I fell in love with this movie. I believe it will be one of the most successful movies by Marvel. Good luck, enjoy! I am Groot."
"GomezAddams666","8","8","15","27 April 2017"," Can you catch lightning twice?
","I think that when you have such a phenomenon like Guardians of The Galaxy it is really hard to duplicate its awesomeness, it's almost like catching lightning in a bottle, and the attempt to do it again without exploding. And that's why with a few exceptions most movie sequels tend to suck. Now, this movie didn't suck, in fact it was pretty good!<br/><br/>And, tho the first act was a bit prolonged it laid the foundations to one of the greatest story lines I have seen in Comic Book Movies as of yet, James Gunn takes us to a journey where he is not afraid to show us the silly and incredibly side of the Comic Books. A couple of easter eggs will take your breath away, but the story line is really smart and remarkably emotional at times, this felt almost as a conclusion to GoTG so I can't dare to think what the hell are they going to do for Guardians of The Galaxy Vol 3.<br/><br/>As you can see I'm not talking about the plot, and I'm not going to do so as I would not want to rob you from the roller coaster of emotions you are bound to experience when watching this outstanding movie, but I will say this: You thought they turned Comic Book Movies ""grounded"" feeling upside down in the first one with a walking tree and a gun wielding raccoon? Just wait to see what they do with a character called ""Ego the Living Planet.""<br/><br/>Was it as good as the first one? In all honesty it was probably not, but it did not disappoint either. My rating is 8/10. And tho it goes without saying... stay until the credits have stopped rolling."

If you want a comedy film then this is probably a good choice but if you want a superhero movie then this is one to avoid..."
"ritera1","8","4","6","18 September 2017"," Much better than the first one
","A lot of stuff that you've seen very much before, including saving the universe yet again that bore a striking resemblance to the end of Dr. Strange. But eh, I paid $1.75.<br/><br/>Not that Marvel or DC is listening to me, but gets very redundant that not just the Earth but the universe is saved about every six months.<br/><br/>Very good on humor, pace, story, and characters. Dave Bautista's Dax has improved tremendously and was the best of them all. Rocket was entertaining and Zoe Saldana was serviceable. Kurt Russel was good. I'm still baffled why Vin Diesel is top billed for three words, over and over. Not like he's questioning such a big paycheck for nothing.<br/><br/>But I don't get Chris Pratt. He's not bad but the role needs a Harrison Ford and he ain't it. Dax Sheppard is much closer, though, but still not perfect.<br/><br/>A lot of good writing and humor. Absurd story line but actually worked. Lapses of opportunities in the direction. Missed several of those ""moments."" Great opening.<br/><br/>Some really good visuals along with some pretty poor visuals (in the backstory of Ego and those bad mannequins). The spaceship stuff was good. The Ego planet was a bit colorful and the ending had a series of cheap-looking shots."

"alex-klein2424","8","4","6","13 June 2017"," A Welcome Return to Space
","Well here it is. Here is what you were all waiting for. My first Marvel Cinematic Universe movie review. You won't believe the amount of calls and texts I have received. The letters are just pouring in as my many many fans are rioting outside my home asking me ""what did you think?"". I've had to barricade myself in my closet so I am writing this by candle light as I hear the loud cheers and cries from outside. Now there are those that call me beholden. There are some that say Marvel bribed me to write the following review. There are some that say it doesn't matter how bad the movie was I will give it a good review. To them I say that is called mystique. The world is a wild and weird place and in the state this country currently is in, I'd say that this review is not only timely, but necessary.<br/><br/>That morning I woke up bright eyed and bushy tailed as I put my Marvel comic vans on, my best Marvel polo and headed to work. I don't know how it happened but the hours flew by and suddenly I was going faster than I have ever driven in my Prius, 75mph, which is the speed limit, as I raced in eager desperation. We arrived at the theater a little early, I'd like to point out that the town that I live in is pretty big but when it comes to premieres there are not a lot of people but you NEVER KNOW. So I think I was justified in arriving almost two hours before hand and sitting in front of the door as I listened to Boss Baby play in the theater next to me. <br/><br/>It was at this point that my breath became very short. I could feel the air around me, it was crisp. The AMC attendant came by and looked at me like she had seen a ghost. She clearly didn't understand dedication but I don't expect it from anyone but myself. She said I could go in and so I alerted my family and we raced in and got the perfect seats. As the trailers began I got more and more excited for movies like Spider- Man and Thor and even Star Wars, although I've already seen those trailers a dozen times. Suddenly the Marvel Studios logo came on the screen and the theater hushed. It was at that point that I was abducted by movie magic and taken to the far end of the universe for one of the most wild and exciting movies I've seen all year.<br/><br/>Guardians was hilarious on all accounts. So many of the jokes just had me cracking up both because they were so well written but also because we had come to love these characters. Sure some of them fell flat to me and you could tell they were trying to hard but that was few and far between. The colors and sounds and shots were just beautiful and made me wish I had seen it in IMAX 3D (which I plan to now do). Baby Groot was both completely adorable and kind of annoying. You could tell that Marvel really wanted to capitalize on that from the ending of the first movie and to really, I'm assuming, push those toy sales. The problem is that he was still so darn cute that it made sense. It's that same feeling when the super cool and famous kid in high school is also super smart and just won both a track award, violin award, and a full ride to any college he wanted. Of course he deserved it but COME ON. Rocket was feisty as ever and what really impressed me was some moments he shares with Yondu. With that said, it was the relationships and interactions that won the day for me. Pairings of characters and the rapport between them. The villains in the movie were also amazing, way better than what the MCU has pumped out in terms of being fleshed out with high stakes and purpose. The soundtrack was great, nothing like the magic of the first movie but still nothing to make you annoyed at.<br/><br/>The point is: go see this freaking movie. This is the kind of movie you wait all year for. This movie is perfect for friends and family and relatives you've never met. This is a movie that will bring strangers together. It is a movie that should be seen on the big screen. You should be reading this review as you are waiting in line for this movie thinking, ""I made a good choice today""."

"StregaAsuka","7","4","6","17 May 2017"," We are Groot
","Guardians of the Galaxy was a fresh story that we knew nothing about (unless you are a Marvel fan, the you knew almost everything). Now we know these characters and the story continuous keeping the same style of the first movie, but with more laughs than ever.<br/><br/>We find our heroes together some time after the first movie, doing their businesses, and for this movie the main plot it's Star-Lords origins, which of course they might not be as they look like. While his background story is interesting, there is a lack of magic like in the first movie, of course it was something new back then and now we have the same. But the movie lacks the kind of action and story that the first had. Plus, this one is really a stand alone movie, not connected at all with the MCU (for the moment). If the movie wasn't there, maybe we wouldn't miss anything of the whole story arcs.<br/><br/>Yes, you cannot stop laughing, because let's be clear, more than an action film it looks like a comedy one. Specially with the pair that Racoon and Groot are, once again they steal the show, specially baby Groot. But it's not only Star-Lords parentage that we learn about, we also learn the other backgrounds, which is good, as there were many questions unanswered in the first movie and in this one we get them.<br/><br/>As always, the movie is pure a visual effect, which nowadays we are really used to watch, but maybe one of the best scenes is the opening sequence. Then, another detail that this movie has as its predecessor it's the music, that 80s style is really present through the whole movie, and personally one of my favorite ones is during the rolling of the credits, so stay tuned. And don't forget to stay seated until the very end of the movie, as there are not one, nor, two, nor three, nor four, but five post-credit scenes. Yes, a bit of an overload, but there are a couple that looks really interesting..<br/><br/>Remember: #WeAreGroot"

Though the end credits for GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, VOL. 2 exercise some wishful thinking by implying that Marvel's sagging franchise MIGHT have even more pale sequels and spin-offs up their withered sleeves, one hates to think of what dying products from the previous century will be content to risk a few hundred bucks to hawk their cob-webbed wares with a Big Screen Last Hurrah. Preparation H, perhaps? (This might be a good fit for Stakar Ogord.) Drax may appreciate some Alka-Seltzer after a hard day of belly-diving.

","Three years ago James Gunn proved to the world a number of things; 1) You can make a great superhero movie based off heroes that aren't already household names, 2) The 1980's had a lot of awesome songs that you didn't know where awesome back then, 3) you can get a good acting performance from a wrestler who isn't the Rock. And finally, 4) you can turn the funny fat guy from Parks and Recreation into a freaking sex symbol. It's fair to say Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has quite a tough act to follow... Fortunately, Gunn follows up his space epic as best he realistically could, with a film that feels even more 80's than its predecessor.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is a fun, escapist action movie that is very reminiscent of the action films of the 1980's. In fact, I view this film as James Gunn's attempt at making a light hearted, super cheesy and clich√©d 80's action blockbuster, in an age where all blockbusters are dark and super serious. Hell Sly Stallone and Kurt Russell are in this film, how much more 80's action can you get? I commend Gunn for attempting to expand what the soundtrack of his last film achieved, and for giving the audience some good quality, escapist fun.<br/><br/>Of course, this film looks beautiful. The visual effects, costume, makeup, production design and everyone else who helped bring this galaxy to life really outdoes themselves. I honestly found myself suspending utter disbelief, thanks in large part to the realistic detail put into everything on screen. I also praise James Gunn again for making a very stylistic film that although is far from original, still manages to somehow feel fresh.<br/><br/>But what about the team we have all come to love I hear you cry? They are all back, yes even Vin Diesel, and they haven't changed a bit. Chris Pratt plays the very Chris Pratt like Star Lord, who is just as Chris Pratt like as ever. Zoe Saldana is still your least favourite and Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel return also to voice act Rocket and Groot, as previously confirmed, yes, Vin Diesel is credited for this. Personally, my favourite actor and Guardian in this film has to be Dave Bautista as Drax. Bautista nails the character and every line he is given like a goddamn Batista Bomb. He is absolutely hilarious in this film, and thankfully saves James Gunn's rather unfunny script with his excellent comedic delivery.<br/><br/>Speaking of Gunn's script, lets get into some of the issues shall we? This film is filled with a lot of one liners and jokes, which is fine if they are either; A) funny and frequent or B) Unfunny and infrequent. The jokes in Vol.2 are unfortunately unfunny and far too frequent, I've heard people refer to this film as more of a comedy with action than an action film with comedy, to which personally I believe this should be the latter. Gunn really needed to hold back with the jokes in this film, I understand why they're there as I read this as an 80's action film made in 2017, but lots of these jokes feel really forced to the point where it's almost like Gunn is exclaiming ""laugh god damn you!"" The film is also very predictable, this isn't the issue for me as again it fits with the 80's aesthetic. My problem is with the different plots going on at once and how they remain, for the most part, disjointed for the majority of the films run time. It makes this film drag on a little bit longer than you would wish. Also the fact that Pratt, Saldana and Bautista don't really do anything for 80% of the film, and more or less wait around on Planet Dad for the finale to happen. This was annoying if you ask me. I almost wanted to poke them with a stick and say ""shoot something.""<br/><br/>All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is the best possible follow up Gunn could have crafted, in my opinion. The film is visually stunning but the script could have done a bit more with its story and a little less with its attempts at humour, just cut to Drax or Groot and laughter is guaranteed. This film is far from original but finds other ways of staying fresh and fun. The Guardians trilogy looks to compete for the best MCU trilogy yet. Will Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 be as good, if not better than the first two, and surpass Captain America as the best MCU trilogy? Tune in next time as the Guardians of the Galaxy will return."
"rs403404","8","4","6","11 May 2017"," A Lot of Fun, but Falls Short of the Original
","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is another entry in a continuing trend of disappointing superhero movies. I'm starting to feel like a scratched record. ""Doctor Strange"" was a very good movie, but disappointing in how it missed its inherent potential. ""Logan"" was a very good movie, but disappointing how it missed its inherent potential. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is very good but...you catch my drift.<br/><br/>Each movie takes a different path to accomplish its misfire. ""Doctor Strange"" never went as dark as it should have. ""Logan"" perhaps went too dark and failed to develop the core relationship of the film. ""Guardians Vol. 2"" is filled with a cast of mesmerizing returning characters, but this time in an inconsistent story that has a tendency to lurch around with either too little or too much buildup.<br/><br/>The most prominent story problem is the lack of a coherent antagonist for the first half of the film. The closest we get is a Ravenger named Taserface whose name is enough to throw Rocket into fits of laughter making him seem less antagonist and more comic relief.<br/><br/>That's not to say this film lack a good villain. On the contrary, Ronan from Guardians Vol. 1 pales in comparison (making it one of the very few aspects wherein Vol. 2 tops Vol. 1). It's only that the movie takes it's own sweet time establishing the villain, which leaves the audience wondering what are the Guardians guarding. It's cumbersome to invest in a movie with little to no stakes. Eventually, when all is revealed, the movie almost seems to lunge over the finish line like a runner trying to come from behind.<br/><br/>Despite all this, the movie is still a solid enough piece of entertainment, largely due to the interpersonal chemistry between the heroes. They are the reason this film works. It's not even that the story is bad. More that the story spends too much time establishing itself and not nearly enough letting the audience appreciate where the story has gone.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the original movie, then you're pretty much guaranteed an enjoyable experience. The returning cast is just as delightfully watchable as they were before. The new cast are all welcome additions, even Sylvester Stallone whose appearance might only be foreshadowing of a spin off or sequel. Music is employed with the same effervescence as the Vol. 1 (Groot dancing to ELO's ""Mr. Blue Sky"" stands out). James Gunn's direction of action is as entertaining as ever. In general, this movie is a lot of fun. Unfortunately, just not as much fun as the original."

"sarastro7","4","14","31","26 April 2017"," Clearly the least impressive of the MCU movies so far
","I'm a huge Marvel fan and comics collector, and I basically love every single MCU movie. All of them have been rated at least 8 stars out of 10 by me (except ""The Incredible Hulk"", which was a 7 - and so was ""Captain America: Civil War"", which I had a number of problems with). The first GOTG movie was a visual feast, but it did have a weakness: the story wasn't strong. However, what it lacked in story it made up for in world-building, action and sheer visual spectacle and splendor.<br/><br/>GOTGv2 sadly could not live up to the first movie, and at 4 stars it is, for me, the worst MCU movie yet. The main problem with it was its story: it barely had any. They meet Ego, he turns out to be a bad guy, and they fight him. That's the story. No particular nuances, no significant subplots, nothing much that made any kind of sense. It was this really thin story, and the rest of the movie was held together by gags (of very varying quality), clich√©s and no tape. Sure, there was a string of brief fan service moments, but that's not enough to make a movie good.<br/><br/>In this movie I wanted to see more characters. I expected a crammed movie, but there were about *one* new character: Mantis, and she had very little to do. They spent too much time on Yondu, for the wrong reasons (not because the story demanded it, but because Rooker is such a respected actor), far too much time on his deadly arrow which got way over-used here (it should have been saved for a really important moment), and although the sibling rivalry between Gamora and Nebula was my favorite part of the movie, Gamora generally had a very tiny role and was almost reduced to a mere love interest.<br/><br/>We didn't land on any interesting planets (besides Ego), and the universe was not expanded. Ego says he came into existence alone, but also says he is a Celestial. Sadly, we are not told what Celestials are and how he can be one of them and be a unique and lonely being at the same time. The golden people from The Sovereign were a bunch of one-track a-holes. Why would they want to kill the GOTG when they've just saved the galaxy (them included) from Ego? No, most of what was in this movie just made no sense at all. Such a shame. I also dislike much of the humor, because it is too vulgar. James Gunn clearly has the gutter-mind of a 9-year-old (and yeah, this was also a problem in the first movie. Joss Whedon has some of the blame, as he encouraged Gunn to put more of his own humorous taste in the movies).<br/><br/>So, only 4 stars out of 10. Lots of things to look at, and several funny and touching moments. But, this is the tongue-in-cheek village idiot of the MCU, and I really wish it were more serious. In this sequel we basically just get more low-brow jokes, more guffaws from Drax, more distinctly unheroic sadism from Rocket, etc. We get more of what was popular in the first movie, but less of what actually worked."

So, I'm just going to offer a bit of friendly advice:<br/><br/><ul><li>See it in IMAX. It's gorgeous. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Be prepared for another fantastic soundtrack. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The cast gels just as well as they did the first time, even with the new editions.

(And to the guy who sat in front of me...I'm sorry.) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>You're going to feel feelings, especially during the spectacular ending. Tissues are advised.</li></ul><br/><br/>Guardians Vol. 2 gets a 5 out of 5, but that was a given. The real question is, is it better than Vol. 1? Personally, I think it's VERY close, but I'm leaning towards Vol. 2. Maybe I need to go back and watch Vol. 1 again for some clarity, but one thing is for certain, both movies are good enough to warrant the debate. I liked the soundtrack to Vol. 1 a little better, but that's just an issue of personal taste. I also think Vol. 2 was a bit funnier. Both endings were great, but Vol. 2's final act really gave me goose bumps, and I legitimately sat on the edge of my seat, pulling for everyone to make it out alive. <br/><br/>So, again...5 out of 5. Gold star. 100%. 27 thumbs up. Whatever you need to hear for you to make the decision. It shouldn't have been a question in the first place. Get your tickets now. Go see it. Twice."

","I've never reviewed a movie here before because I've always kind of trusted the average reviewer, but the scores for this one are just SO off that i had to give my 2 cents. I loved the first one and gave it a 9/10 BTW.<br/><br/>This movie just took everything that was right with the first movie and overdid it and brought it to the ground. The acting was not bad though, the soundtrack was unimpressive (big downer) and the script was incredibly bad, like Fast and Furious bad, but I wasn't really expecting a good script here anyways, just a fun superhero flick.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this movie was the overdone, i mean OVERDONE, repetitive and misplaced comedy, that most of the time felt forced and was overall brainless. There was a nipple joke that was done twice by the same character that was just the lowest point of the movie. Even Groot, who could be adorable, felt boring in the end.<br/><br/>The new characters were also pretty bad. Mantis felt dull, with most of her screen time being used in poor jokes with Drax, and Ego wasn't really captivating overall, with the daddy issues and how under powered he felt in the end of the movie really bringing him down. Also, the golden aliens (i forgot what they were called) were just the worst thing I've ever seen in any Marvel movie to date.<br/><br/>I just didn't give it a 1/10 because there were some good jokes in the end, like the Mary Poppins joke and the post-credit scene with Teenage Groot, but they don't save this movie from being a mess. Also an honorable mention to Rocket (Cooper) and Yondu (Rooker), which were IMO the only two characters with some decent development on this one.<br/><br/>Concluison: Don't waste your time on this one. Stick with the great first one. 2/10"
"corraoryan","3","10","21","7 May 2017"," I came for a superhero movie, received a comedy...
","When I say this movie was funny, I mean it was hilarious. It was one of the funnier movies that I've seen in recent years, and I can't fault the comedy for being somewhat cheesy and a bit forced because it was SO good.<br/><br/>However, the movie had too many jokes. I felt like every 5 minutes it would change tones from serious, to emotional, to sarcastic and funny. I never really knew what the story wanted me to feel. I would constantly be confused as to whether or not I should take something seriously. For example, Peter brings up his mother's brain cancer as a cause for her craziness and I laughed hysterically. However, the rest of the audience glared at me. I just felt confused about the tone of the movie. Also, Drax develops a sense of humor not previously seen in the other movie, just bothered me. <br/><br/>The movie also strayed from it's roots about being somewhat realistic. Now obviously the movie isn't realistic in the slightest, but it adhered to it's own physics and rules. I just felt that Ego should've been more powerful because in a sense he is literally a god. One of the scenes where Gamora was hanging on to Drax with a tow cable was somewhat disappointing and didn't drive the narrative in anyway. Just felt like an unnecessary scene to draw up unneeded conflict. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm being to critical, but I seriously left this movie more disappointed than I was happy. My friends criticized me for my opinion, but I was hoping the movie was going to be a superhero movie and not a comedy. Just my opinion though."

"dbcint","6","11","24","27 April 2017"," The MCU suffers a case of ""sequel-itis""
","In 1997's Scream 2, movie buff Randy Meeks spelled out the ""rules"" for a sequel. While he was specifically talking about horror movies, the basic principles of these rules could easily be applied to other genres. More characters, more action pieces, higher stakes, and some kind of added wrinkle to the expected story.<br/><br/>And what do most sequels from that era also seem to have in common? A lot of them were not well received by audiences. ""Sequels suck"" has been a popular school of thought for as long as I can remember. These days, the popularity of sequels has started trending upwards, but sometimes we still get one that follows the same old rules.<br/><br/>Thus, we get Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.<br/><br/>That story starts with the Guardians ‚Äì Peter Quill / Starlord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) ‚Äì as mercenaries for hire. After doing a job for a race of people called The Sovereign, the Guardians find themselves in trouble when Rocket steals from The Sovereign. After a chase scene straight out of The Empire Strikes Back, the Guardians ‚Äì now with Nebula (Karen Gillan) in tow ‚Äì find themselves stranded while Rocket makes repairs to their ship. This is where Peter's father, Ego (Kurt Russel) and his assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff) finally catch up with the Guardians. Ego whisks Peter, Drax, and Gamora away so Peter can learn of his true lineage. Meanwhile, Yondu (Michael Rooker) has been disgraced by The Ravagers, and accepts a job from Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), head of The Sovereign to track down the Guardians and bring them to justice.<br/><br/>As for the stakes the Guardians are up against this time, it was always going to be difficult to top the Infinity Stone story from the last movie, and it first it doesn't look like they're going to. The majority of Vol. 2 feels like a smaller and more personal story (which, keeping in mind that I haven't seen Iron Fist yet, Marvel seems to have found decent success with on their Netflix shows), but later turns out to have ramifications for the whole galaxy. I'd have preferred it if they had kept it small and focused on the family the Guardians are becoming. Especially given that the final battle scene feels overly long and drawn out for no particular reason. Not only that, but the Sovereign are among Marvel's worst villains. They're not evil, they're just pompous douchebags who only go after the Guardians because Rocket stole from them. <br/><br/>That's actually quite a shame, as the rest of the battle scenes are a lot of fun. Peter's music collection again provides the backdrop, and there's something whimsical about seeing explosions and bodies falling while you're listening to some classic pop music from the '70s and '80s. The best of these is perhaps a scene where Yondu effortlessly takes out a number of mooks with a flying arrow that he seems to control by whistling.<br/><br/>While all the Guardians ‚Äì except Groot ‚Äì get some great character moments here, the focus is really on Peter, Gamora, and the new additions to the team. Mantis was an absolute delight, and her budding relationship with Drax is something that deserves a lot more screen time come Vol. 3. Karen Gillan gives perhaps the movie's best performance as Nebula, who is dealing with issues from her childhood thanks to her relationships with Thanos and Gamora. I spent the movie hoping she'd find the peace she was looking for, but knowing that if she did, it wasn't going to come in the way she clearly wanted it to.<br/><br/>The weak link in the acting, surprisingly, is Kurt Russel. Ego's entire story gives him a whole range of emotions to go through, and Russel just doesn't convince me on any of it. From a man I know is capable of so much better, this felt like him just cashing a paycheck. <br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fun movie, overall, and if that's all you're looking for from it ‚Äì if all you want is an amusing space adventure with characters you (mostly) already know, with some great action and musical sequences ‚Äì then you're probably going to have a great time with this movie. But if you were hoping it would recapture the magic of the first movie, or show a little something more, you'll probably come out feeling somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>For my full review of this and other movies, visit my website at theblogfather.co.nz"

","Let me begin by emphasizing the the original Guardians of the Galaxy was the movie I saw in theaters most, three times during its run. I was looking forward to this for the characters, wit and visuals. Unfortunately, only the visuals were not compromised.<br/><br/>To be blunt, this movie is not funny, and some of the comedy is cringe-worthy. I felt the length of the film during these scenes. Baby Groot is part of the problem, he loses his appeal after a scene or two, and does nothing interesting the rest of the movie. The gold religion from the trailer doesn't really have their arc resolved at all, and all we get to conclude them is a teaser in the after credits scene. <br/><br/>When the characters are just in idle banter, its pretty hit or miss, which is unfortunate considering how funny the first movie is. The characters here feel like a set of traits interacting rather than developed.

It was just missing the ""WOW"" factor that made last summer's original so much fun. <br/><br/>The dialogue and wit, while snappy at first, isn't as novel this time around and begins to wear thin about half way through the picture. <br/><br/>Hey, it's a comic book movie, right? But the ridiculousness of how powerful/deadly Yondu's little whistle arrow thing is (he's basically invincible when he has it? It can fly through inches thick solid metal? How does it make calculations so fast and know exactly where to go?) and the stupidity of the Sovereign Race pursuit story-line, complete impossibility of the way the Guardians evade multiple attacks on their ship by huge flying armies, and the over-sized, over-long funeral party for Yondu, attended by literally every Ravager in the galaxy, at the end really ruined it for me. It was just too long and too messy. And really - why do we need Sylvester Stallone? <br/><br/>I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as a light summer popcorn action, sci-fi flick. It's an entertaining ride and you could do much worse on a summer afternoon or night. But the expectations generated by the first one were just too much to overcome, unfortunately and this one did absolutely no improvements or upstaging of the original. <br/><br/>Ultimately it's a bloated, piecemeal mess predicated on a thin plot with lots of cheap machinations to ensure that all of our heros, and even some people we don't like that much, end up being fine in what looked like impossible situations to get out of. <br/><br/>5.7/10"

","Baby Groot. A young CGI Kurt Russell. And a soundtrack that will transport your parents back to the good ole' days. What more could you ask for in a summer blockbuster? <br/><br/>Aside from hits like ""The Dark Knight,"" ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" most sequels fail to capture the ingenuity, wit or sheer awe of their predecessors. However, as Norman Vincent Peale once said, ""Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars."" In that vein, ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2"" shines brightly.<br/><br/>The film continues the story of Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt) and his mangy band of criminals, warriors and assassins, who must once again save the galaxy from certain destruction. While James Gunn's first film masterfully introduced us to Marvel's cosmic realm and the quirky individuals that inhabit it, ""Guardians 2"" foregoes a conventional superhero narrative arc in favor of a more personal, character-driven story.<br/><br/>From Gamora and Nebula's disdain for their father, Thanos, to the Guardians' fluctuating relationships with one another, the story largely focuses on family. Many critics were put off by Karen Gillan's portrayal of Nebula during the more impactful, heartfelt scenes. For me, however, humanity and sincerity shone through her acting and in the small details of her damaged history with Thanos and Gamora.<br/><br/>The Guardians themselves, as always, exude confidence and chemistry, with much of the film's humor stemming from Baby Groot (Vin Diesel), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista). <br/><br/>Gunn's visual direction is impeccable, characterized by vibrant colors and grand set pieces. And the soundtrack, ""Awesome Mix Vol. 2,"" while less recognizable as the first volume, compliments the film's themes to near perfection.<br/><br/>""Guardians 2"" isn't groundbreaking. Not all of the jokes land, the secondary villains are, at times, annoying and it does little to further the overarching narrative if the Marvel cinematic universe. Overshadowing these nitpicks, however, is a glimpse into the souls of the characters we know and love, several gut-wrenching laughs and Baby Groot."

","No sane person expected Guardians of the Galaxy to succeed at half the rate it did, but it won a legion of fans and earned more than enough box office dough to earn a sequel. Though not quite as magically magnificent as the original, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (GotG2) lives up to the hit that was the original, and in some ways, is even better. <br/><br/>Director/writer James Gunn undoubtedly has proved himself to be one of the most passionate, driven directors in the superhero film genre, and that passion shines through to the film. Gunn deserves all the praise he can get, as GotG2 again delivers a wildly exhilarating, heart warming, hilarious and down right entertaining experience. <br/><br/>Vol. 2 is very much a character-driven film, with the character development in full effect, diving into more backstory and focusing heavily on chemistry. The main narrative revolves around Star-Lord and his quest to discover his true parentage, and while jumbled and somewhat disjointed in the second act, provides enough of an emotional weight to keep you intrigued. <br/><br/>But it's the characters, fueled by their spectacular writing and chemistry, that take center stage, allowing the audience to connect, laugh with and care for them, and this again calls back to Gunn's amazing passion for creating a rich, extensive franchise. Star-Lord and Gamora share terrific scenes of their ""unspoken thing"", Drax and newcomer Mantis mesh so hilariously together, and what else can be said about my favorite characters, Rocket and the adorable Baby Groot, who together again form the film's best duo. Yondu is a much better character this time around, Nebula gets more screen time and even with Marvel's ""villain problem"", the main antagonist Ego is a different take on your classic villain, very much enjoyable. There is enough humor to go around 3 times over, which is mostly great, but sometimes does get repetitive and dull, with some humor on occasion feeling overly forced. Even so, every character compliments each other in some way and the interactions are so entertaining and often laugh-out-loud funny, that you can't seem to get enough of it. The overall story of Vol. 2 isn't anything groundbreaking, but the characters that inhabit the narrative steal the show, and that is GotG2's greatest strength.<br/><br/>Along with its set of phenomenal characters, GotG2 excels in the visual and audible department. The CGI is breathtaking, Vol. 2 is a delight to look at, colorful, exotic and explosive. Behind the gorgeous visuals is the soundtrack, which again provides the movie with a unique pop and attitude that makes it so special. The action sequences are varied and entertaining, the atmosphere dazzles, and the amount of fan service and to the greater MCU is off the charts. Much like the original, if you're looking for pure entertainment, GotG2 doesn't fail to deliver.<br/><br/>I can't forget to mention the cast that portray the characters I spoke so highly of. Marvel's star power is unmatched, with the likes of Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, and Vin Disel leading the pack, followed by Kurt Russell, Michael Rooker and many more, who all represent their respective characters to a tee.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy was able to able to reach out to fans with its unique set of characters, adventurous and sci-fi setting and hilarious dialogue , all backed by an awesome soundtrack. Luckily for fans of the first, aside from some hiccups in pacing and the amount of humor, Marvel's 15th entry into the MCU once again delivers on every aspect that made the first one a success, getting you hooked on a feeling, and high on believing.<br/><br/>9/10"
"peci-89549","7","5","9","29 May 2017"," Good but not great
","It is a really entertaining movie, but it just can not live up to its predecessor. Missing the ""wow"" factor the producers decided to give too much from the essentials of vol. 1. Drax repeats the same jokes, but now twice, repeatedly. Dancing in action, now by baby Groot, but for several minutes. Racoon jokes become also a bit flat after a while. Family issues are also too much. It is discussed by several times by Yondu, Star Lord, Ego, Drax, Gamora and Nebula...etc. Too long, too much sometimes (Yondu funeral), and it resulted in not being as fresh and vivid as vol. 1 is."

","The long awaited sequel to the break out hit, Guardians of The Galaxy, is here! In 2014, the Marvel Studios original came out of obscurity to set box office records, introducing fans to a cast of heroes who aren't exactly your typical superheroes. Combining amazing special effects and comedy, the film quickly gained a cult following and critical acclaim, but can they defeat the biggest enemy of all, the curse of the sequel? The Guardians are back doing what they do best, with a new enemy on their tail, when they crash land on an uninhabited planet. Their rescuer comes in a form of a man who seems too good to be true, is he really there to help them or does he have something else in mind? The story in volume two is not as good as the first one, that was to be expected, but luckily it isn't far off. The characters are the same and this time they know each other a whole lot better, meaning the chemistry is better, the humor comes more quickly, and the magic is still there. Once again Chris Pratt is outstanding, it's still hard to believe he went from the annoying jock on Everwood to this charismatic megastar. The rest of the cast is also on it's game and we learn much more about the characters then we did in the first film. While not being as strong story wise, this film certainly hits closer to home, and everything is amped up from the special effects to the humor and even the soundtrack. I love these films and I hope there are a lot more of them, however I'd be remiss in not sharing my thought that something this good, especially with how the story evolves in the second film, is better suited for a weekly TV series than at most a handful of feature films. The Bottom Line, if you liked the first one, you'll love the second one."
"preppy-3","8","5","9","20 May 2017"," If you liked the first one...
","you'll like this one. It's more adventures of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt)trying to find his father...and succeeding! There's also Gamora (Zoe Saldana) trying to deal with her sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) who is trying to kill her. Then there's the psychotic raccoon Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) who steals some valuable batteries from a race and sets the whole world after them.<br/><br/>The special effects are great, it moves quickly and there's plenty of action and eye-popping visuals. Also the script is clever. It's full of funny one-liners and Rocket and Baby Groot are hysterical. Still there are problems. It tends to shove family values and friends are great messages down your throat. Also Pratt isn't that good. He's tall, handsome and pumped up...but sort of a blank. Still I was entertained and recommend it."

","Great movie, I was quite surprised that considering the quality of the first film, this one managed to exceed my expectations, very funny, lots of action but also a lot of heart, I may have had something in my eye during that last bit, when the thing did the thing and then the others did that other thing."
"MissSimonetta","8","5","9","14 May 2017"," ""I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!""
","I liked the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie. It was fun and flashy, a good summer movie. However, Volume 2 is just marvelous, a blockbuster that does more than just entertain you for two hours; this movie is character-driven, even philosophical. It touches on themes of family, love, and altruism. Like Empire Strikes Back, it is a sequel which includes everything we loved about the first installment while also upping the emotional stakes and putting the heroes we've come to love through hell and back.<br/><br/>A lot of summer movies come and go. You spend eight bucks, have fun for two hours, and then forget what you saw days afterward. But this movie gives you something more than a few one-liners and cool fight scenes: it's emotionally engaging. I'm more excited than ever to see what the filmmakers bring to the table in the next movie!"
"firstruleofmethclub","8","5","9","12 May 2017"," The MCU starts its biggest year yet with a very strong start
","Logan, 2017's first Marvel offering, was a movie I loved because of just how little it relied on its comic book origins, completely forgoing the superhero tropes and going in its own unique and totally enthralling direction.<br/><br/>Guardians 2 however, is a movie I loved because of just how intensely it embraced its comic book origins. The Kirby-isms shine through brilliantly and every couple of minutes I found myself grinning like an idiot at some new reference or stylistic choice.<br/><br/>Logan might be the super hero movie for people who don't like super hero movies. Guardians 2 is the super hero movie for people who have steeped themselves deeply in the lore of super heroes. But I absolutely adore them both for the same reason: How they made me feel.<br/><br/>Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ - An all round good movie with a little something extra."
"pkneer","9","5","9","12 May 2017"," Enjoyed This Film Very Much
","Bottom line, if you liked the first GotG film, then you will like this one. Since the characters were already known, more work had to be done to make it humorous and it hit the mark. <br/><br/>Probably the only downside to this film was the use of tiny Groot - it was for more of a cutesy effect and Groot in the first film was anything but cutesy. <br/><br/>Rate it a 9/10 as the effects are excellent, the action superb, and the characters once again lit up the screen with their wit and humor."
"thatguyttv","10","5","9","11 May 2017"," So much better than the first one
","I went into this film hyped as for this sequel and I tell you what when I left the cinema, I was blown away with what I saw. The director James Gunn has crafted another mind blowing movie with out of this world visuals and stunts making it the most spectacular film of all time, the hilarious chemistry between the guardians of the galaxy is unreal major points go to drax who made me laugh the loudest I've ever laughed in a cinema or ever to be fair. The main cast is excellent in it again, especially Micheal rookers character yondu who you really care for and get behind in this film which I loved. <br/><br/>What I loved about this film is that it's so different to the first one, James Gun hasn't tried to top the first one in anyway, he's tried to make this one so different from the first which I loved, seeing something that's fresh and unexpected really kept me on the edge of my seat as I watched this master piece of a film. The sound track is so much better than the first one, in fact I think this sound track puts the first one to shame because I'm still singing all the songs from this film to this day. And with out saying any spoilers, Kurt Russell in this film is amazing, I really liked what they did to that character. <br/><br/>In the end I had a blast with guardians of the galaxy vol. 2, it is so much better than the first one in every way and I cannot wait to see what James Gun does next with the crew in guardians of the galaxy vol. 3"
"Screen_Blitz","8","5","9","11 May 2017"," Perhaps not as spectacular as the first entry, but nonetheless exciting, funny, and visually stimulating as it needs to be
","When Guardians of The Galaxy first hit the cinema multiplexes in the summer of 2014, it was a surprising success, especially for a superhero film based on comic books that very few knew about. Grossing around a quarter from crossing the billion-dollar mark, it was fairly predictable for a sequel to see the light of the day. This second installment, which helms director and writer James Gunn as the conductor, brings back our favorite heroes from the first film and places them in an all-new adventure. While this film made the score as a wild crowd-pleaser with its clever humor and tense, special-effects-laden galore, this one perhaps marks a just a slight stepback from its predecessor. Cutting back by a fraction on its zany, light-hearted tone in favor of deep character development and heart, this film delivers the fun and excitement with only a few flaws that go marginally noticeable. This film focuses on the Guardians: Peter Quill/Star Lord (played by Chris Pratt), Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Drax (played by Dave Batista), and the now Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). The team travels to a distant planet where they come across a celestial named Ego (played by Kurt Russell) who happens to be Peter's long-lost father. The team soon sets out on an intergalactic adventure to discover the mysterious of Peter's strained past. <br/><br/>Whereas the first installment ran off the chains with non-stop cheekiness and balls-to-the-walls humor, this movie takes a small step back to take a deep exploration into the characters, most particularly Peter Quill. This endeavor opens doors to a more powerful emotional core that taps into the heart strings. That is not the say the film does not leave any room for some light-hearted banter between the characters along with gut-busting one-liners. Although a small portion of the sexual innuendos tend to fall flat, the character certainly prove to be fighters for stealing the show from each other. The main driving force of the plot here is themes of family, that is where the dynamics of the father-son relationship between Peter Quill and Ego comes in. The story spends a portion of time diving into the relationship between Peter and his father, and what accounts is some emotionally resonating sequences that are surprisingly moving. But that is not all, the relationship Gamora and Nebula (played by Karen Gillian) is also greatly explored here, though perhaps not as ambitiously. The family dynamics result in numerous (and occasionally clunky) tonal shifts throughout the picture. Along the side, the film doesn't fail to fuel the adrenaline tank with visually stunning action sequences including spaceship battles and countless CGI explosions to keep things moving at a reasonable pace. And much like the previous movie, serving the backdrop of nearly every scene is a sweet classic 70s soundtrack to establish the cheeky mood of the story. <br/><br/>The majority of the cast from the previous installment returns, each of them is good as ever. Chris Pratt, the likable guy he is, returns with a sheer amount of charisma and humor to his role. His humanistic performance serves as a supporting factor for his chemistry with new-face Kurt Russell who plays his father. The two share a strong emotional chemistry that greatly serves as a driving force the story. For fans of Russell, the actor never disappoints from his opening screen time, to the final act. Zoe Saldana is very strong in her role, boasting a fair amount of humanity with her emotional bond with Karen Gillian's Nebula. Bradley Cooper returns as the voice for the loud-bantering raccoon Rocket and continues to deliver one hilarious one-liner after another. Professional wrestler Dave Batista puts some great effort into the role of Drax, adding both humor and sentimental value to his already comedic figure. Groot who is now shrunk down to baby form is sustained by the voice of Vin Diesel who like the last film, never reaches a departure outside his signature lines ""I am Groot"". This little character is cute the second he appears on screen, and never fails to deliver the charm. Michael Rooker does his job as Yondu, another returning character. Sylvester Stallone makes a surprise appearance here as well, although his screen time is reduced to no longer than five minutes or so. Then there is Pom Klementieff as a telepathic mantis who swarms with a slice of humanity to her character, as well as a pinch of comedic chemistry with Dave Batista's Drax. If there is anything that chews at the clever chemistry between these characters, it is most likely the long separation between these characters with Peter, Gamora, and Drax spends a large amount of time on one planet, and Rocket and Groot on another, thus reducing the hilarious banter that contributes to these character's likability. <br/><br/>Guardians of The Galaxy: Volume 2 is a fun follow-up to the 2014 original, with a fair amount of energy, heart, and humor to satisfy moviegoers of a various demographics. It's certainly not as polished as the previous entry, but that very little to bar from the insane amount of fun this movie is. This movie is an early summer blockbuster that is virtually impossible to doubt for reaching a phenomenal box office receipt by the end of the summer."
"MaximumMadness","9","5","9","11 May 2017"," ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2""- A laugh-out-loud and wildly entertaining follow-up that is almost derailed by a messy first act, but quickly corrects itself and delivers!
","The first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was a magical film, and one of those rare examples of ""fun"" in its purest form. Seeing it in a packed theater with the right audience was mind-blowing, and it was a joy seeing everyone come together to just have a blast with its delightful characters. But even beyond that, it was also an expertly written, often stirring and enthralling and even sometimes surprisingly emotional work thanks to the talents of director James Gunn and his wonderful cast. Heck, the first movie literally had a scene where a gun-toting, smack-talking raccoon cried because his living-tree best friend appeared to die... and I heard more than a few sniffles coming from the audience. It was clearly doing something right and pressing all of the correct buttons.<br/><br/>And I'm more than happy to report that despite a shaky first act that nearly lost me, Gunn's follow-up ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" delivers much of the same high-quality entertainment of its predecessor. It's got all of our favorite characters, an intriguing new story filled to burst with shocks and laughs, and the same big heart that made part one such a rampant success. It might be a tab bit rough around the edges... but it pulls through and gives you more of exactly what you want to see.<br/><br/>The Guardians may be in over their head when member Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) decides to steal some tech from a race of prestigious beings known as ""The Sovereign,"" who respond by attacking the them and leaving them stranded on an uncharted alien world. Luckily enough, they soon are greeted by the mysterious god-like Celestial being ""Ego"" (Kurt Russell), who offers to help them because, well... he also just so happens to be the long- lost father of their leader Peter Quill, aka ""StarLord."" (Chris Pratt) While Peter catches up with his father, the other members of the team are off on their own adventures, as Gamora (Zoe Saldana) tries to settle the score with her sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), Drax (Dave Bautista) takes a liking to Ego's assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and Rocket and Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) are forced to team up with former-Ravager captain Yondu (Michael Rooker), after the three are captured during a mutiny while the Ravagers try to retrieve the Guardians for a hefty bounty.<br/><br/>The film did initial have me at a bit of a worry. After a spellbinding and hilarious opening action set-piece set to the iconic ELO masterpiece ""Mr. Blue Sky"", the film does dip into convoluted territory for much of its first act. There's just a bit too much going on a bit too quickly, as new characters are established, old characters are re- established, and an intricate web of sub-plots and B-story lines are set up. It almost lost me for a few minutes there. And I worried the whole film would feel overstuffed and aimless. But fear not, because Mr. Gunn knows exactly what he's doing, and every single thing that it established early on pays off in the later sequences. It might not seem like it at first... but there's a grand plan at play. So I can easily forgive the fact that the first twenty or so minutes doesn't flow particularly well. The pacing and focus quickly corrects itself, and we can see why it needed to speed through so much, so quickly.<br/><br/>Much like the original, a great part of the success of the film lays on its incredible cast. Every single returning player is a phenomena, especially Pratt and Rooker, who are given a lot of emotional pay- off in the film as they deal with their respective issues and arcs. The new cast members are a welcome addition. I especially must give major praise to the genius that is Kurt Russell. I've always been a fan of his, especially in his ""crazier"" work. (""Big Trouble in Little China"" in my opinion being his greatest film.) And he's just outstanding here as the rugged and hilarious and sometimes questionable god-like being Ego. It's the perfect casting.<br/><br/>Writer/director James Gunn is clearly having the time of his life, and his giddy attitude adds a lot to the proceedings. The first ""Guardians"" most certainly had his fingerprints all over it, but you got a feeling that he was perhaps holding back a bit. But for the sequel? He goes full-on insane in all the best ways! There's so many jokes. So many cameos. So many references. It's just crazy to think about how many zany details Gunn threw in, and I'm sure there's dozens of more in the background that I missed. Every single frame is saturated with pure Gunn mayhem, and I loved it. From the seemingly random insertion of familiar 8-bit video game sound effects into a number of action scenes, to entire sequences written around kitschy old pop-songs, to a climactic moment that I won't spoil, but I'm pretty sure was a giant ""Screw you!"" gag aimed at a recent high- profile critical disaster... It's so delightfully loving and geeky. And I can't wait to see what Gunn has up his sleeve for ""Vol. 3!""<br/><br/>While I do have to dock a few minor points for my issues with the first act of the film, I can't see any fan of the original walking out disappointed. It's not only a great new addition to the ever- expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe... it's just a great, fun film, period. I attended a sold-out screening, and the laughter and cheers and whoops from the audience brought me right back to that same magical feeling I had watching the original. You done good, Mr. Gunn. You done good.<br/><br/>I give ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" a fantastic and near- flawless 9 out of 10."

","Did Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 deliver? You better believe it delivered. Was it as good as the first one? Unfortunately, I would say no, but it's still amazing.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Set to the backdrop of 'Awesome Mixtape #2,' Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team's adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos. The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill's true parentage. Starring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Kurt Russell Director: James Gunn<br/><br/>The comedy delivered on all levels in this movie. But we all know the reason anyone went to go see this movie was because of the comedy. Seriously, if that is the only reason you are going to see this movie you won't be disappointed. Enough with the comedy, let's get to the story.<br/><br/>Anyone who reads the comics knows that Ego is not Quill's father. J'son is actually Quill's father. Although, they did take some backstory from J'son and added it to Ego's backstory to give a reason why he was doing what he was doing. I'm not going to tell you what he was doing, because that would ruin the movie. Just know, there is a purpose to it all.<br/><br/>The actors delivered on all levels here. There is no other way to say it. Adding Kurt Russell only made the acting better. If you haven't figured it out yet from other reviews, I give Kurt a lot of praise. He deserves it too. You would think I would say this is the best movie of the entire MCU, but unfortunately I can't. The reason?<br/><br/>I don't like that the changed the story for Ego. Yes, he has done things like he was doing in the first place, but still. They took one of the most powerful characters in the MCU and made him a one- off. You'll see when you watch the movie.<br/><br/>Then there's the fact they barely added any effects to the MCU. We all know the Guardians are part of the MCU. The closest thing we got was seeing Jeff Goldblum in the credits, a visual of three of the Watchers, another Adam Warlock tease (that's the third if I remember), and a glimpse of Planet Hulk that if you blink you'll miss all of them. I know that shouldn't matter in the long run, but it does to me.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: You MUST watch this movie. Yes, it is right in the middle of my averages for the entire MCU, but it is still worth it. Stop what you're doing and go watch this movie. Enjoy it.<br/><br/>Civil War ‚Äì 9 Iron Man 2 ‚Äì 9 Avengers ‚Äì 9 Iron Man 3 ‚Äì 9 Guardians of the Galaxy ‚Äì 8 Winter Soldier ‚Äì 8 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ‚Äì 8 Iron Man ‚Äì 8 Ant-Man ‚Äì 8 Incredible Hulk ‚Äì 8 Doctor Strange ‚Äì 8 First Avenger ‚Äì 8 Thor ‚Äì 7 Age of Ultron ‚Äì 7 Dark World ‚Äì 7<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10<br/><br/>That's it for me folks.

It fits all the criteria for family adventure, though. Nobody is going to be offended, but don't expect anything new and innovative either. I felt Kurt Russell was somewhat unconvincing as the bad guy, and except for the aliens, everybody is young and beautiful.

","The first film was a massive surprise when it launched, even the actors were unsure of how the movie would be received, and feared it was going to be marvels first real flop in the new age of superhero movies.<br/><br/>But as we all know, it wasn't a flop, it was a surprisingly entertaining and fun film that was so easy to fall in love with. The characters, the universe, the effects, the story, it was all good.<br/><br/>Personally i have seen more or less every single American superhero movie that has ever been made, with a few exceptions here and there, but hard to say which movies i might have missed, i even saw ""The Phantom"" and ""The Masters of the universe"" when they released back in the day.<br/><br/>But just to clear something up here and now. Those two films i just mentioned, is not among what i call good films. What i consider to be some the best superhero films made to this date is (not in any particular order) Batman (1989), Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), Superman (1978), X-men (2001), Logan (2017), The Avengers (2012), Deadpool (2015), Spiderman 2 (2004), The incredibles (2004). Guardians of The Galaxy (2014).<br/><br/>There are more, i just don't want to use up all my 1000 words here listing movies i like. It's just for reference.<br/><br/>Anyways. Guardians of the galaxy 2 is not on my list of best superhero movies of all time I'm afraid, no matter how adorable baby groot is, it simply wasn't enough. This movie is a pure effect bonanza from start to finish, and it looks absolutely gorgeous, no doubt about that. The pacing isn't too bad either, the music score is amazing. But...<br/><br/>Yes, *sigh*. The movie lacks direction. It is sort of a mess, and i have to be one of the bringers of bad news, but the movie isn't bad though, it just didn't live up to it's predecessor. It wouldn't be the first time in history that ever happened, but still.<br/><br/>Except for the main villain, this movie is basically almost the same as the first film, not much new to see here to be honest. It feels recirculated, like the writers just thought: Oh hey, they like the first film, let's just give them more of that.<br/><br/>Some times, this tactic works, if you write it correctly, and add enough new stuff go along with it. But they almost fell in the ""The Force Awakens"" trap here.<br/><br/>The big laughs are far apart, most of the jokes are just mildly ""gigglingy"" (new word *patent pending*), and the movie suffers because of it. But there are some moments in the film that are truly awesome and lifts the spirits, as it can become dull at times. Incredible actually, when you think of how much is going on in this film, at any given moment.<br/><br/>Kurt Russel is one of those ""awesome things"". He is the one that lifts this movie up a nudge, his performance and presence makes all the difference in this film. And if you are a Kurt Russel fan like me, well this movie is a lot more easy to enjoy. Snake Plissken never let's me down ^^<br/><br/>Anyways, if you are just going to hang out with some friends and just enjoy some laughs and watch some CGI extravaganza on display, this movie has you covered for the most part. But don't expect anything like the original. I'm sad to say they didn't achieve greatness this time.<br/><br/>6/10 - Fair"

"ivo-cobra8","1","6","12","14 August 2017"," A total let down and a hug disappointment an awful movie
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in my opinion is too over long, over blown, over dramatic, over hyped and one of the most overrated MARVEL films! This is not a good movie it is so boring and it is to over dramatic! It is not entertaining movie, this film f****** sucks! Chris Pratt through half of the film doesn't do anything. Kurt Russell is awful his performance is boring ridiculous and terrible. Sylvester Stallone is in this movie but he is only in the beginning in one scene cameo role and then he disappears trough in tier film. He shows up in two scenes on the end of the film and he has only two liens. I was excepting more from Sly to be in it but he wasn't.<br/><br/>What in my opinion this movie makes so terrible: Guardians of the Galaxy in the first half of the film were separated Peter Quill, Gamora and Drax fly to Quill's father planet and half of the movie the guardians are not together. The movie becomes boring and Kurt Russell is awful as Ego, Quill's father. Than the movie become melodramatic when it try's to focus on Quill's father and happiness he try's to get a score with Gamora I really don't care about their romance.<br/><br/>Rocket and Baby Groot were left behind on the different planet in which Rocket try's to fix the ship and Yondu and his outlaws comes they overcome Rocket but Yondu's men turn all against him and they kill all his friends that was so awful and horrible to me. I didn't care about Rocket,Yondu and Baby Groot been friends. What I hated on this movie on the end of the film when they were finally together in the second movie Rocket left Quill and Yondu behind he left them behind to die what kind of hero is this? He left them all behind.<br/><br/>They killed off Yondu, this movie killed of Yondu. This movie is terrible it is awful and it is a peace a junk! It is boring field with melodrama this movie is only for 6 year old children it is a child movie.<br/><br/>The first movie was entertaining good written, original and a good film I like it, it was really enjoyable film to watch. This movie isn't it is not good. Thanos wasn't even in this movie. This movie is not funny I wasn't laughing and Chris Pratt doesn't do anything trough half of the film the music is terrible.<br/><br/>This movie more focus more on Quill and his life legacy than on the Guardians of the Galaxy together. I did not read the comic books or watched the animation series I don't care I liked the first one this one I don't.<br/><br/>I don't like this movie and it is too much praised. I will never watch this movie again and trough inter film only Ego (Kurt Russell) was the bad guy and find out he killed Quill's mom and he betrayed Quill he was killing all children what kind of murder did this movie created? This movie in my opinion it is too long really and becomes really boring it is really slow paced and it is just not a fans wanted at least me I think it is a huge let down and disappointment to me.<br/><br/>Before I go I love Kurt Russell I love him in The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, Escape From New York, Escape From L.A. and Tango & Cash in which he shared with Stallone together in this movie they are not in the same scene together. He was also good in Furious 7. Sylvester Stallone I am huge fan of his I love Rambo all 4 films to death, Cobra, Demolition Man, Cliffhanger, Tango & Cash, Nighthawks, Rocky all 6 films and I wish in this movie Sly would be more in it. I think Stakar Ogord role isn't for him at least he can could have do more in the movie.<br/><br/>If you want to see a film about Galaxy watch Star Wars: Episode IV ‚Äì A New Hope, Star Wars: Episode V ‚Äì The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Episode VI ‚Äì Return of the Jedi they are way better films than this even the first Guardian of the Galaxy was way better film. <br/><br/>Score: F 1/10 avoid this movie like a plague."

","Plenty of action, humor and great to keep main cast together. Hope they didn't spend much money bringing in OLD actors (Stallone & Russell) as anyone could have done as well?? Great CGI and stunts. Be prepared to sit thru a long movie but at least the flow kept viewers engaged. Plot & writing was below average but characters kept movie engaging.<br/><br/>Obviously, there will be another sequel which will probably the last one. Saw on a rainy day with entire family and they really enjoyed it so it gets an above average rating."

","Guardians of the galaxy is an amazing Sci-fi, Action-Adventure movie. <br/><br/>It started off shaky with the beginning, the beginning made me think that they were going to rehash the same characters and tone as the first but as the movie went on it became its own.<br/><br/>There is a lot of character development in this movie but James Gun makes it feel all connected and not cluttered. It gives characters stuff to do without it feeling forced or shoved in there so characters have something to do.<br/><br/>The women who played nebula (Karen Gillan) made one of the worst performances i've seen in a while.

","Within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, solid standalone films are hard to come by due to setting up next phases. In all honesty, that formula does tend to get repetitive. Many sequels within the MCU are passable because of that very formula. However, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" ends up landing in a safe place.

"dave-mcclain","7","4","7","5 May 2017"," ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" has a better plot and visuals and is even more fun than the original.
","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" (PG-13, 2:16), much like its predecessor, is one of the most creative movie mash-ups ever. When I reviewed the original, I noted how much it had in common with ""Star Wars"". My 2014 review called it, ""a movie about a group of rebels of different races getting together to save a planet from the power of a mysterious deadly orb,"" described the group as including ""a good-looking outlaw pilot who is used to only thinking of himself, a large brown creature who makes sounds that others seem to understand as a sort of language, a tough woman with a royal background who has no patience for nonsense and a small, wise creature who provides guidance to the others."" To all that, add significant daddy issues and you have the Guardians films. Well, plus aspects of ""Star Trek"" (discovering strange new worlds), ""Independence Day"" (several people playing crucial roles in defeating interstellar evil) and even ""The Fast and the Furious"" (a diverse group of friends regarded as family).<br/><br/>And let's not forget that Guardians is a Marvel property. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is the 15th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie contains Easter eggs tying it to other Marvel film franchises and hints at future cinematic overlap. In terms of how this one fits with the others chronologically, according to IMDb, ""the film takes place in 2014, 3 months after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). It takes place a year after Thor: The Dark World (2013). Before or after Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and a year before Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)."" Speaking of Tony Stark's cohorts, shortly before the first Guardians movie was released, Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said that the goal with this franchise was actually to create ""another Avengers"". The Guardian series does have that feel to it, along with some of the comic sensibilities of ""Deadpool"", another Marvel film franchise born in the mid-2010s. Now, having said all that (and ensuing cinematic cross-pollination notwithstanding), the Guardians movies have definitely created their own niche within the MCU ‚Äì and their own sense of fun.<br/><br/>Picking up just months after the action in the original, ""Vol. 2"" sees Peter Quill / Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) adjusting to their newfound fame, their role as galaxy guardians and the dynamics of (and their individual places within) this team ‚Äì slash ‚Äì family unit. Early on, four of them battle a monster known as the Abilisk (looking like a much bigger and angrier Jabba the Hutt ‚Äì with tentacles)¬Ö while Groot dances to Quill's music. A gold-colored race of people known as the Sovereign reward the Guardians for defeating Abilisk ‚Äì and protecting the special batteries that it was trying to steal ‚Äì by turning over a prisoner, Nebula (Karen Gillan), Gamora's estranged sister, who has a bounty on her head. As the Guardians leave the Sovereign, Rocket steals some of those valuable batteries. The insult of such a theft sends Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) into a rage and she sends her fleet of remotely-piloted drones after Rocket and company. Due to some nifty flying ‚Äì and a little help from a mysterious ship which suddenly comes to their aid ‚Äì the Guardians survive, but crash land on an unfamiliar planet.<br/><br/>That mysterious ship lands on the planet too and out steps a being called Ego (Kurt Russell)¬Ö who claims to be Quill's father! Ego's story seems to check out, so Quill, Gamora and Drax let Ego take them back to his planet so Quill can spend some time with his pops. Rocket is left behind to repair the ship, take care of Baby Groot and keep an eye on Nebula. As Quill and friends get to know Ego ‚Äì and Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Ego's pet empath (a being who can experience the feelings of other people by touching them and even temporarily alter those feelings), Rocket has to defend against an attack by Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) and his crew of Ravegers, whom Ayesha has hired to retrieve the batteries and kill the Guardians. The Ravegers capture Rocket and Groot, but Yondu's reluctance to pursue Quill leads to a mutiny by Yondu's crew. His lieutenant, who calls himself Taserface (Chris Sullivan), imprisons Yondu, Rocket and Groot, gets rid of those loyal to Yondu and teams up with Nebula to catch up with the rest of the Guardians, who, in the meantime, have run into some pretty serious trouble of their own.<br/><br/>""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" has a better plot and visuals and is even more fun than the original. In the first movie, the Guardians became a family, but in this one, they have to learn how to BE a family ‚Äì while Quill and Gamora each have to deal with serious conflicts stemming from their own original families. Freed from the confines of establishing the Guardians' cinematic world and forming their relationships gives returning writer/director James Gunn the freedom to do more interesting things with the story ‚Äì and the characters, which are now more developed ‚Äì and more entertaining ‚Äì especially Groot, who's as adorable as any Minion, but much tougher (which also happens to be pretty adorable). The music is great, while the scenery is vibrant and the action is exciting (and deserving of 3D viewing). Sometimes, there's almost too much going on¬Ö visually, but also aurally, as the sound effects and music compete for attention with the dialog. As a whole, Vol. 2 is a good step forward for the franchise and (with help from five short scenes and embedded graphics during and after the closing credits) builds anticipation for more Guardian adventures, including some Marvel-ous crossover action.

It looked like it was directed by Michael Bay-- a lot of CG vomit that amounts to nothing.<br/><br/>The humor was very poorly timed and usually appealed to the dumbest people in the theater. For the smart people, the horrible ""dramatic and poignant"" moments inadvertently made for the best comedy in the film.<br/><br/>Even my favorite part-- Kurt Russell as a warm, nice father-- was ruined by a moronic script twist.<br/><br/>To paraphrase a great movie line, ""what you have just shown to me is the dumbest thing that I can imagine.

"Ziya90","1","5","10","28 August 2017"," Escapist entertainment at its worst
","Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is like The Avengers: Age of Ultron. After a spectacular, wonderful first film, it becomes a formulaic mess! Again, the movie opens by a scene which our heroes are threw into a mission for no reason and they are in danger, so they fight against an unknown enemy without building an introduction or tension. Just pure audiovisual joy. That's the key word to describe this movie: pure joy, but nothing else. We had high expectations and expected the movie to be greater than the first, but instead it was a total mess. The star of this movie is baby Groot but he is too cute. The mature Groot in the first movie was naturally funny and intimidating at the same time, here everybody tries to be amusing. The sentimentality in some scenes feel superficial. I just didn't buy it. Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone are cast in the same movie together years after Tango and Cash for the first time which is a historic moment, but they never come across during the movie. What??? The villain of the movie makes no sense and there is a relationship between the villain's motivation and Peter Quill's past, but why do you dig for the stories which were perfectly built in the first movie? What is wrong with you? We were exposed to the same forced sentimentality and story being tied to another story in the latest sequel of The Pirates of the Caribbean. Maybe, the most annoying relationship in the movie is between two sisters. It was ridiculous. I almost couldn't endure watching this character and her relationship with her sister, because it looks fake. It is just a plot device. The movie recalls the movie Zardoz which is nice, little Greek tragedy and definitely the best part of the movie is trying to escape from space prison part, but oh man, this was a total mess! Even the post credit scenes were boring and uninteresting. In the second half, we watch action, action and more action until we become mentally tired! The team has ""we are a family"" message for you like Fast and Furious movies and as said before, the movie is very similar with its poster: a complete audiovisual mess! Lots of CGI, lots of noisy action and overblown visuals with no properly built up story, no development, no tension and no heart and soul. By the way, like most of the movies in these days, the villain explains everything one by one, evil plans are included, to make everything clear for us at some point! Jokes are mostly unfunny and forced, Gamora has a lesser screen time, it is a pity, Drax doesn't fight much this time and everything else is a mess except for great Stallone! This is a must see for ""GOTG"" fans to follow the story, but keep your expectations low. However, your kids may love it!"

","The protectors of capesh!t, the heroes of PG-13 rated blockbusters, the knights of fartjokeverse / whatever you want to call it. <br/><br/>The plot of this sequel was most likely written by Butters from South Park. The characters are the same as well as the 5 years old visual effect. The movie was basically created by moving Chris Bratt from Parks and Recreation to Jupiter Ascending (the 2015 movie with Mila Kunis). Minus the comedy of course. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone who likes Marvel and DC because it's not like this is any better than Suicide Squad or any worse than Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy."
"Kingslaay","Null","5","10","13 June 2017"," Great sequel
","Sequels are not always successful especially if the first film was successful. Often they pale in comparison however that is not true for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 that more than holds its own. <br/><br/>The team are back and in excellent form for another space adventure. Baby Groot makes a great and humorous addition to the Guardians. The film also introduces a number of new villains and brings back some memorable old ones. It has a great story that in this genre and universe makes great sense and flows very well. So it's easy to sit back and enjoy the ride. <br/><br/>Just like the first film the humor is effortless and the great chemistry between the cast really shows and enhances its quality. The doses of humor are very well placed and occur at the right moments. Volume 2 also had a few big moments that the film built up and it certainly drives it home. The soundtrack, volume 2, is also really good and includes some other great tunes.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended as you should enjoy this fun and entertaining film."

","*******SPOILERS***** Now I don't know about you but every now and then I like to go and have a pizza. I don't actually care for fancy la-di-dah pizza's I just want a Dominoes thick crust with everything on it and a cold beer. Hopefully I can put my feet up and watch a good movie at the same time and once we've finished the pizza who knows we might even have some ice cream! Crazy right? It's madness! We're bonkers here. That is exactly what Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is, Dominoes Pizza, cold beer and maybe ice cream. IMHO it's not quite as ice creamy as Vol 1, but it was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. I was never bored there were some genuine laugh out loud moment and it's all rather silly, but in a good way, like Star Trek can be silly but IN A GOOD WAY. If at any point I had stopped to think about the logic of the story or even went, ""hang on - wait a minute...?"", the illusion would have been ruined and I would have found a shard of glass in my thick crust. It doesn't stand up to story scrutiny but it isn't 'that sort' of film. All the visuals are totally awesome and the space ship designs and tech are (pun intended) out of this world. I'm not sure why Sci-Fi always feels the need to get Godly and have gods in them (Star Trek, 2001, Promethius (shudder) and so on and so forth and what have you) but they do, and I know that they are guardians of the galaxy and they have to protect the galaxy but can you really kill an all- knowing immortal god by punching him in the head? Apparently so! It also makes Quin guilty of patricide, he kills his father because he killed his mother, but does that make it right? I suppose so, But wait hang-on! Doh! see - I'm not supposed to think about this stuff! Quick gimme some beer! Phew! Thanks! Some really awesome casting - Stallone is ace, Kurt Russel is fabulous and I was genuinely moved at the death of blue bloke, but mostly cause he's the best actor in the film, bit of a shame his 2nd in command wasn't Alieny-at all and just looked like a skinny human, but small potatoes.

Now the first trailer for second part(Vol. 2) came out and I felt some skepticism, but know after I saw the movie in the theater I knew that I was wrong¬Ö This movie brought me that feeling back but this time it felt stronger¬Ö Maybe because it's the second sequel which doesn't disappoint and shares this place with Star Wars: The Empire strikes Back. Both movies left me speechless Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Star Wars V¬Ö You know that a studio did everything right in my point of view if it manages to reach two times in a short period of time this feeling. <br/><br/>It's hard for me to find anything negative about this movie so I won't even try, because I hate to talk something down. In my opinion most critics are destroying most movies in these days¬Ö Maybe because we, the audience, forget what movies are about. They are about telling a story while emotionally reach the audience, let them laugh, let them cry or give them goose skin. That's what movies are supposed to do and in my opinion the story is just a little part in this whole composition which definitely matters to a certain degree, but destroying a movie just because the story is one dimensional is god damn wrong.

Also had some cheesy dialogue, which was disappointing as I found the first movie was able to avoid many clich√©s. The action sequences were chaotic and too long, and somehow lacked heart; too many people involved, too little that made sense, the heroes randomly surviving things they shouldn't. Sad to say I found Chris Pratt's performance, though not bad, was not as solid as it was in the first movie, though that could have been because of the director. There were some scenes where I found I wasn't sure what emotions he was trying to convey.

"Jim-Eadon","6","6","13","29 April 2017"," Fun, but the magic of the first movie has gone
","The first Guardians movie was fantastic, it made me laugh more than just about any other and I simply love that movie. This movie felt completely different, the movie makers were trying too hard and the magic slipped through their fingers. The first movie had an easy charm, it worked because it was fresh, original and they nailed the characters. Here they laid on the family-relationships stuff way too thick. It was not so much a comedy as a soap opera with corny lines. The chemistry between the lead couple was gone. And who cared about the sisters' squabbles? All of this felt laboured. Family this, family that, it felt as if we were being emotionally manipulated rather than entertained. Even Rocket was dragged into this over-egged family theme. The villain (SPOILER) didn't seem evil, rather, just a lonely, sad old God. The movie made us really like him and then tried to get us to hate him. It didn't work. Stallone made an unwelcome appearance, he snapped me out of the movie. The first movie worked precisely because it didn't feel like a Hollywood movie, as opposed to ""Expendables"" nonsense of trying-to-be-cool-with-the-youth comedy stuff. This movie, Guardians 2, started great but ended horribly, with criminals making a firework display, complete with bangs in space. And some flaky skits in the credits. The first movie was so funny, for me at least, largely because of Rocket, a genius comic creation. But here Rocket was sidelined, in favour of all the soppy soap stuff. And his comedy in this movie seemed a bit forced. The ""Taserface"" joke wasn't funny. The villain may have been called Ego, but Ego could have been the name of this entire movie. On the other hand, the opening credits and fight with the octopus fish monster were hilarious, (though I wanted to see more of the out-of-focus monster, and not the dancing plant, but that was part of the clever joke) but after that, the laughs were few and far apart, and as for the cheese: ""He was your father but not your daddy"" Eh? With the resources spend on this movie, they could have tightened it up, ditched the pointless sisters side plot - and coming to think of it - the lame metrosexual gold-people plot - and added in comedy in the style of the first movie, and stopped trying to press all the emotional buttons all the time, hell, one of the characters actually did that literally, in a manner of speaking, with her antenna."

I had it on Cassette and I have it on DVD as well as USB Memory.<br/><br/>They had Kurt Russell and used him so wrongly it may be his worst Film yet. Sly Stallone and they use him like a Retarded Judge Dredd type character personality. At the end credits, I am pretty sure I heard Hannah Montana's (Godawful Miley Cirus's) voice. If they want to destroy the next movie, go ahead and put ""Twerk n' Tard in it.<br/><br/>They did expand on Drax's Humor, that was good.

I can't even tell Vin and Cooper are doing Baby Groot and Rocket's voices. <br/><br/>I do question putting Megababe, Pom Klementieff, in all that make-up so you can't even see her total Hotness.<br/><br/>So, overall I give this movie a 6 and I feel I am being more than generous with that rating given all they COULD HAVE DONE with this movie, versus, what they ACTUALLY DID. With the wait and they hype, this movie was just nearly a complete letdown. And the Ending??? That Royally Sucked.

As somebody who was quite confused seeing the film getting mixed reviews before seeing it, I understand why now. There was even many times during the film when I just thought to myself: ""wow, this is disappointing."" Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 2 is just... plane, but it's in no way terrible, and it's obviously hard to match-up with the first Guardians of the Galaxy, but it doesn't even come close. There were a few really good action sequences, but there was more bad than good. Look, I respect Marvel, I respect James Gunn, but this movie is hard to respect, and there's one key reason why: It's PG-13, but the most childish PG-13 movie on the planet. It's a movie for children, and only children."

","Firstly, the main antagonist is a Marvel character that has been completely changed for this movie. It bears no background similarity to the character in the comics whatsoever. I understand that the Marvel movies are all about making a spin on the comic book story arcs, but this difference was far too large for me to accept.<br/><br/>Whilst watching the movie, I had to ponder whether I had stepped into a Marvel Superhero version of ""Fast and Furious"". There was a continuous message that family is important and how the protagonists became who they were due to disenfranchised childhoods. Whilst this is a valid point, I do not feel that it belongs in a superhero action movie as it serves no purpose. Worse was when the message contradicted itself when we see Peter Quill betrayed by his Father. The clumsiness of this contradiction did nothing to alleviate the sickly sweet message that the movie was trying to convey. I get that James Gunn is trying to send out a message to the younger generation but I would think that kids go to watch a superhero movie for the action, and will not really appreciate or acknowledge the message that he is driving.<br/><br/>Unlike the first movie, there was a distinct lack of character focus and their abilities. It could easily have been an action movie without superheroes. In fact, the movie seemed to be focused on two characters when it came to showcasing their abilities. One of these had a sequence that was inspired by the Quicksilver scenes in the X-Men movies. The other was extremely underwhelming and was defeated far too incredibly when you consider the differences in age and experiences. None of the characters were interesting with the exception of Nebula and Mantis. However, Pom Klementieff played her role like a stuttering female cyborg that I even thought the role was played by an East Asian actress before I checked the cast members. The actors paid to play the new characters were miscast in my opinion. Sylvester Stallone's performance reminded me of his Judge Dredd and not in a good way.<br/><br/>It was clear that the popular factors in the first movie were taken and overdone in the second movie. Drax was made to look like a dumb fool once again but even more than in the first movie. While the CGI effects were good, the cuteness factor of Baby Groot served only to market the movie to kids and geek girls, and to rake in merchandise profit. There was also constant mention and focus on the cassette mix which was totally unnecessary (again, for merchandise promotion).<br/><br/>With the exception of the very first Iron Man, why do the Marvel movies have to be over- saturated with humor? It's one thing to market the movies to a wider audience but it's totally another thing when it's taken too far, and the humor becomes so boring."

","If you liked the first guardians of the galaxy, then i suggest not seeing the 2nd one in theaters, you will be disappointed. They had some cool concepts, but the way they tried to administer them was less than sub-par. Normally Marvel can handle a sequel pretty well, but this one, not so much. However, if you're in the ages of 9-13 then you may enjoy the failed humor attempts regardless. Would have been much more pleased with it as a rental. Like many reviews stating the truth, it felt like fast and the furious's remake formula met Marvel, or a comparison for the gamers here, it felt like a Call of Duty sequel. This movie didn't feel natural, and instead felt very very trying."

The only redeeming quality of the whole movie was the little tree guy (what's his name ... Groot) running around most of the time, completely oblivious to what was happening in the world around him!

The story has some excellent character building elements that make it feel fresher than most standard blockbusters. <br/><br/>Any complaints seem to fall in the realm of ""formula."" While Guardians of the Galaxy feels more invigorating than other superhero genre films, the same formula for the MCU has been repeated to the point where this addition feels like it doesn't offer anything new. We've ultimately seen this all before in previous MCU films and it acts as fun, popcorn entertainment that doesn't change anything. We enter the theater the exact same way we left it and although the ""if it ain't' broke don't fix it"" rule applies to many, at a certain point, this formula is getting incredibly stale.<br/><br/>MCU issues aside, I would recommend this film simply because it offers genuine laughs and a good time.

"Marx_Bros_Fan86","7","4","8","11 May 2017"," Guardians 2 mostly delivers
","James Gunn's sequel to the surprise hit Guardians of the Galaxy had a lot to measure up to, and it mostly passes. Marvel has added an unconventionally character driven movie to its pantheon, which is both its strength and its weakness.<br/><br/>The Guardians are still a dysfunctional family ‚Äì Peter and Gamora are the couple that you root for but always seem to find things to fight about; Rocket is so jaded he won't let anyone get too close; Drax is still socially inept; the most normal member of the group seems to be the talking tree, Groot, who can only say variations of the phrase ""I am Groot."" When Rocket steals valuable property from a race of gold skinned aliens, the Guardians are chased around the universe, until they are intercepted by Ego, a living god played by Kurt Russell, who just happens to be Peter's father. Peter, Gamora, and Drax go off with Ego while Rocket and Groot stay behind to guard Nebula, Gamora's wacko sister. Without giving too much away, eventually a bad guy threatens to destroy the universe and the Guardians have to stop him.<br/><br/>While the plot ends up being pretty conventional, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is really about the characters learning to deal with all of their pent up personal issues. In that sense, it's pretty unusual for a Marvel movie. Marvel's grip is definitely felt on the film, but it's not nearly as strong as you would think. We get some pretty good emotional scenes here. I was most impressed with Michael Rooker's character Yondu, a supporting character from the first film that I did not expect to see again. He develops a pretty believable bond with Rocket and we get more insight into who he really is. I also have to give a shout out to Batista's performance as Drax. I'm not sure how much range he has as an actor, but he's excellent in the part. He's hysterically funny and he really becomes the character. But every character is handled very well. Peter's relationships with Gamora and his father are well done, and Gamora's relationship with her sister is also developed more.<br/><br/>I did have some problems with the movie though. As much as I liked the character's individual stories, I could have used a stronger plot. It takes a really long time for the real plot to kick in. I felt like there was not enough really meshing the movie together and instead it was just like watching a day in the life of the Guardians, albeit a slightly more unusual one. I also think it tried too hard to be funny at times. The humor came out of the scenes more naturally in the first movie ‚Äì with this one it felt like they were jamming in jokes to measure up.<br/><br/>Still, I'd recommend seeing this in theaters, especially if you liked the first one."

I hate captain America, iron-man and Spiderman Thor, avengers and all those hipster cgi rubbish garbage dumpster of films.

"pressboard","7","6","14","6 May 2017"," Something more and something less
","I love the characters and the actors playing same (This to offset some of my following negative comments). Almost every character was further developed from where we left them in the first movie. Groot is a baby and cute. Gamora I felt loses some of her edge here but her sister Nebula picks up that anger and aggression and satisfyingly runs with it. Drax is Drax and has some of the best lines. I am a long time fan of Kurt Russell and he did a good job as Ego but could have been made edgier, esp. as an enemy (was I looking for a good enemy?). Ayesha, the golden alien ruler and her video game playing subjects, did not make very good enemies (my enemy issues again?), but I did like the use of 80's computer game sounds for their virtual battles. I wanted more kick-ass Rocket Raccoon than I got. I usually complain about lack of character development which this sequel had in spades! Yondu got some quality time on screen and by the end of vol. 2 I wanted to see him in vol. 3...sigh. To solidify this ramble, vol 2 gave us much more of the characters we know and love but maybe had too little time to use them in a satisfying way. We get something less and something more here (but in a good way). Maybe James Gunn will better use the characters he has matured in vol. 3? So many story lines, so little time."

The chemistry and joking between the characters is still there, along with more pop culture than you can poke a swizzle stick at.

"classicsoncall","8","5","11","7 May 2017"," ""Are we savin' the galaxy again?""
","As I watched the opening scene, I was caught up in the same glow of the original ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", with the rest of the movie playing out as a grand, epic, space colossus. Today however I'm having a bit of next day, post partum revisionism, to the extent that the picture went way over the top with the action sequences in the latter part of the story. I'm all for it when the situation calls for, but when it feels like a film is trying to outdo itself, it feels forced and I was feeling some of that stress with the battle scenes and the cosmic repercussions.<br/><br/>I rated this picture the same as it's precursor, and I see in the short run it's running a tenth of a point higher than Guardians One. We'll see how that shakes out, and whichever way it does I wouldn't be disappointed. The surprises here for me were seeing 'old timers' like Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone show up in a Marvel Comics flick. It didn't seem like they belonged here among the up and comers like Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana, but they acquitted themselves well. Looks like we'll be seeing more of Ravager Stakar Ogord (Stallone) in future MCU films. A hint for film makers - I knew Stallone's character name by virtue of seeing it in the cast credits beforehand, but it didn't come across clearly to me in the theater. Might want to introduce new ones with better clarity.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, my favorite in this story turned out to be Drax (Dave Bautista). Not only were his lines humorous, but they were cleverly delivered with just the right touch of understated nuance. Like when he finally told Mantis (Pom Klementieff) she was beautiful - inside. His delivery was impeccable, as if he was a born comedian instead of an ex pro wrestler. Baby Groot was a hoot too, it's too bad he has to grow up, as seen in the fourth post-credit scene. I don't think he'll be half as cute in Guardians Three.<br/><br/>Speaking of those post-credit scenes, it looks like Marvel set a record here with five. A lot of future material to work with as revealed here - Kraglin (Sean Gunn) with Yondu's stinger weapon, Stakar stealing some s---, High Priestess Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) potentially forecasting an Adam Warlock appearance, the aforementioned teenage Groot, and my favorite Marvel guy, Stan Lee as an astronaut, boldly declaring that ""I've got so many more stories to tell"". You'd think he'd run out of ideas at ninety five, but he just keeps on rolling."
"sosmetallin","9","5","11","5 May 2017"," Welcome to the freakin' Guardians of the Galaxy
","The coolest team of the galaxy returns to save it one more time. But before you even begin to read the review, I can hear you asking: Is it better than the first one? For me: almost. Let's explain. This time our heroes are being chased through the galaxy by those gold people you see in the trailer. At some point, Star Lord meets his father, Ego (yes, this is actually his name) and that's where things get interesting. Starting with the technical aspects of the movie, I want to say this is probably the most beautiful among all the Marvel movies (flawless visual effects, colorful scenery and from what I know they used the same type of digital camera Pacific Rim used.) Now let's talk about the story. <br/><br/>What's better: <br/><br/>1) Double the humor: While the first was a really funny adventure, Vol.2 is a really adventurous comedy. Luckily, it mostly works, but sometimes it breaks the tone of some dramatic moments. <br/><br/>2) We get to know them better: This time we spend more time with them talking to each other and learning their back- stories(especially Star Lord, Nebula, even Yondu), which helps to develop the characters and make us care even more. Also, that's where a potential negative lies. <br/><br/>3) More action: and probably better. It's very creative and usually combined with humor, which makes it so fun to watch.<br/><br/>What's worse: Story structure: until half way through the movie, just funny things happen along with a lot of action. Our heroes don't have a specific goal to focus on. This, of course, is not necessarily a bad thing. Remember the same goes for Goodfellas, but it works perfectly. The thing is while Star Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot are definitely really funny characters with distinct personalities and a nice chemistry, they are still not so perfectly written. The jokes sometimes remind me of sitcoms. You can tell the character told the joke for the sake of telling a joke and making the scene funnier. All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2 is still a damn good time at the cinema. (9/10)"

"taryllsbaker","9","5","11","29 April 2017"," Guardians Vol. 2 continues Gunn's energetic, fun & emotional formula.
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is written & directed by James Gunn and stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Pom Klementieff, Michael Rooker, Sean Gunn and Kurt Russell. <br/><br/>Set to the backdrop of Awesome Mixtape #2, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' continues the team's adventures as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage.<br/><br/>Where to start? After the huge success of Gunn's first instalment in the trilogy and the incredible praise it received, Guardians Vol. 2 had expectations set pretty high. The story was written beautifully and each character felt important. It was hilarious & action-packed but still left room for one of the most vital ingredients in any film; emotion. When the first film cut to black, the fans felt like they'd experienced something truly unique. It made us happy, sad, filled with adrenaline. Gunn had us hooked on these feelings. The bar was set.<br/><br/>Which is why I'm so happy that Guardians Vol. 2 hits every single one of those notes once again. There's a surprise ingredient in this instalment, however, and you'll know it when you see it. <br/><br/>Let's start with the characters. 'The 5' are back. It pretty much picks up from where the first film left off, but our characters have evolved significantly and it's evident from the first 10 minutes; which is one of the most incredibly fun sequel openers I've ever seen (again, you'll understand when you see it). Peter Quill / Star-Lord, played effortlessly by Chris Pratt has some of the funniest lines, but also hits the emotional core splendidly. Bautista's Drax is one of the most amusing characters in the line-up. He delivers each line with great comedic timing and had the theatre laughing from line to line. Rocket is brilliant, Bradley Cooper is casting at its best. Gamora and Nebula are given some more development, we hear about their past and even at times feel a little sympathy for Nebula. Both Saldana and Gillan play their respective roles with strength. Even Baby Groot has some chances to shine, which is awesome.<br/><br/>There's a new addition with Klementieff's Mantis, providing a nice back-and-fourth between herself and Drax. Stallone's casting didn't work with me, it's one of the very minor things I disliked about the film, however we never get a chance to explore his character. Michael Rooker returns as Yondu and he is a badass with so many crazy scenes, a truly superb performance. Alongside Rooker is Sean Gunn, brother of James, returning as Kraglin. He has some really cool moments and definitely develops more as a character towards the end of this film. Finally, Kurt Russell. Yes, it's no spoiler that he plays the father of Quill. In fact, it would be impossible to avoid. That's why the 'reveal' is in the trailers. Gunn personally chose to have that scene included. There's so much more to Kurt's character, which I will not discuss here. Though a little exaggerated, Kurt is great.<br/><br/>Moving the focus towards something that most of the time goes unnoticed, or at least under-appreciated, is the costume design. Judianna Makovsky pays close attention to detail and everything looks beautiful. These films wouldn't be as brilliantly convincing as they are without her. The same goes for the cinematography, editing, visual effects, make-up, production design, art decoration, set decoration, stunts, sound department, and of course, the music.<br/><br/>As an exception, I had listened to the entire score by Tyler Bates before seeing the film. I think it worked out better this way; I had a vision in my mind of how these themes were going to be used, but then hearing them within the context of the film really surprised me. Tyler has created a wonderful score that, with Gunn's love and appreciation for his work, has been utilised perfectly. There's some Williams-esque writing in the percussion during the opening battle, creating a fierce introduction which then progresses into a psychological examination of our leads, most notably Peter Quill. Not only is it an enjoyable listen compositionally, it's as vitally important as the characters.<br/><br/>One of many fans' favourite 'characters' from the first Guardians was the Awesome Mix, gifted to Quill by his mother. In the final act of the first film, Quill opens a second gift with another tape inside, Awesome Mix Vol. 2. This continues to complement the picture wonderfully from start to finish. Personal favourites are Electric Light Orchestra's ""Mr. Blue Sky"" & Fleetwood Mac's ""The Chain,"" but a perfect use of Cat Stevens' ""Father And Son"" may just cap it off.<br/><br/>Finally, Gunn's writing feels as grounded and as human as it did before. He writes humour very well, but also provides intricate detail within characters that move the viewers. It creeps up on you and it's tremendously touching. Not only that, but Guardians Vol. 2, like the first, never once feels as if it's just setting up the next big thing. Although taking place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it sticks with our characters and only very minor nods to the MCU are used, creating its own 'Cosmic Universe' which breathes a lot of fresh air into the genre.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but that would ruin the experience. This film showcases some serious talent, in front of the camera and behind the scenes. Support these incredible individuals by heading to your nearest cinema and seeing this film. If you enjoyed the first Guardians, you're gonna love this. I think it's better on almost all levels.<br/><br/>Verdict; Action-packed, hilarious and an emotional ride. Welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (9/10)"

"randy_orton_fan","Null","8","21","12 May 2017"," Worst the MCU Has Given Us Yet
","This is easily one of the worst comic book movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The humor is so forced and so cringey I could barely stomach it. There's a part where they're being chased by a bunch of ships and are still cracking jokes, with Rocket telling Quill he's going to put a turd in his pillow case, and that it'll be one of Drax's. Drax then starts bellowing like a goon and says, ""I have famously huge turds."" I almost walked out of the movie at that.<br/><br/>Baby Groot is so annoying. It just shows how stupid society has actually gotten that people love Baby Groot. He's essentially Jar Jar but instead of people rightly being angered by such a horrible character getting focused like in the 90s when Episode 1 first came out, now everyone loves Baby Groot. With my Marvel loving friend telling me I ""obviously lacked a soul and heart"" since I didn't like Baby Groot. The start of the movie has the giant monster from the trailer, and instead of showing the whole fight, it focuses on Baby Groot as he dances to music while the fight is blurry in the background. <br/><br/>The story is bland as usual with MCU movies. It's just Peter's Dad needs Peter to help him activate these seedlings so he can take over other planets. All with bountiful jokes.<br/><br/>Drax was the only part I enjoyed of the first Guardians. His deadpan humor made up for the forced humor of the others. He took everything literally in the first film and that's what made him funny. Like the ""everything goes over his head"" line which he replied, ""nothing goes over my head, I'm too quick, I would catch it."" But in this movie he's ""AHAHAHAHAHAHA EVERYTHING I SAY IS A JOKE!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA WHY ARE YOU NOT LAUGHING? THIS IS WHAT MCU FANS LOVE!! AHAHAHAHAAHHA MEMES!!!!!"" And he didn't do much in the way of ""Destroying"".<br/><br/>There's a part of the movie where Quill covers himself in rocks and turns into Pacman, which I immediately thought ""oh, this movie is the comic version of Pixels!!!"" Not a good thing.<br/><br/>I think the one scene I really enjoyed was the Ravager funeral for Yondu at the end of the film. That was it. The rest of the movie was just joke, joke, joke, reference to old songs, jokes, serious scenes that played out pretty nicely and then ruined by jokes, and more jokes.<br/><br/>Five post-credit scenes. None of which mattered.<br/><br/>Everyone's singing this movie's praise. Which doesn't surprise me. Everyone loves the MCU and always give these movies a pass on being terrible. They love the humor and don't care how basic the plot is. I honestly believe if Marvel Studios put out a two hour movie of a Marvel character sitting at a table and just sipping a cup of tea it'd get a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and the Marvel fanboys would call it cinema at it's finest.<br/><br/>The movie is so bad it's cringe.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money, even though you no doubt already have."

","Full disclosure: I love the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and it wasn't until 3 years after this movie came out that I finally saw it (there are several reasons for that). I'd heard from others that this movie was very good, but not quite as strong as the first one. After seeing this movie finally though, I don't know what they were talking about. This movie was every bit as strong as the first movie, if not stronger in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>I won't spoil anything about this film, but I will say that Quill's father is one of the most interesting characters they've had in marvel films, and the fact that he's played by Kurt Russell certainly doesn't hurt.
The story is more interesting and fun than the original, with a lot of very well crafted jokes within the movie. There are some that overstay their welcome just a little bit, but as a whole, they are all great.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of the film was there was no sign of MCU in this movie really at all. There were no random cameos from other marvel superheroes, and there was no ""infinity stones"" or other nonsense like that in this movie. Not saying those things are bad necessarily, but it just feels so nice not having to deal with unnecessary shoehorning in of Marvel things. This was kept relatively tame in the first one as well, but the macguffin in that film was an infinity stone, but this film was it's own separate thing and that made it feel fresh. It didn't even feel like a superhero movie all that much if I'm honest.<br/><br/>I don't rate many superhero movies as highly as this, but this one is great. Go watch it if, like me, you put off watching it for fear of not being good."
"The_Celluloid_Sage","7","1","1","6 April 2020"," Solid, but not as good as the first
","James Gunn once helms the Guardians of the Galaxy's ship as well as once again writing the screenplay. After the success of the first film one might be forgiven that this was a good move. I would have agreed, except that for a variety of reasons the magic is slightly missing in this sequel which just doesn't quite manage to lift itself up to the lofty heights of it's predecessor or some other Marvel films.<br/><br/>The outline here is a lot more insipid and story-driven that the first offering we got from Gunn and for that I feel it does suffer for it. We once again start in eighties (nineteen-eighty to be precise) where we see a very young Kurt Russell with Meredith (as we know to be Peter's mother). He takes her to look at an unusual flower he has planted in the woods telling her of stories and dreams for the future.<br/><br/>Thirty-four years later (and set six months after the first film) our merry band of misfit hero's are battling an interdimensional 'beast' while baby Groot dances to Mr Blue Sky by the wonderful Jeff Lynne (ELO), completely oblivious to the fight. They are there to collect an important object in order to see justice done (and collect a lot of booty in the process).<br/><br/>Unfortunately the loveable rogue raccoon Rocket just can't help himself or his sticky fingers. This (unfortunately for our guardians) leads to the Golden High Priestess Ayesha of the Sovereign launching a full scale assault against them, forcing them to crash land on another planet. This is where we meet Ego (Russell) as he lands to rescue them having been searching for Peter for years.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the Ravagers are at a stip bar (with Howard the Duck in a ridiculous scene) and yes I did just say that, where Yondu is having issues with another Ravager leader (Stallone). Fortune favours the brave though as they say and the Golden Priestess offeres Yondu some redemption by hiring him and his own equal band of misfits to hunt down the Guardians.<br/><br/>Those are all really just side issues though. Unfortunately the film dwells on nothingness for far too long and takes an age (almost ninety minutes) to get to the actual main plot. Everything leading up to that is filler (very good filler mind at times) but filler nontheless. Onve this main story starts the film really does slow down to a snails pace and I feel that this is where it starts to go wrong. For ninety minutes you have a film very similar to the first. Then it all gets a little sidetracked and wayward.<br/><br/>We get to meet Peter's father who is millions of years old and birthed from the stars and cosmos itself. He also created his own planet and...well...is also a little crazy. I guess loneliness can do that if you're an ego-maniacal space God intent on universal control. Regardless, the visual aspects of the second part of the film are very impressive but the story does drag. Russell is also not at his best and does his best Jeff Bridges impression, funny how similar those two have become in their acting over the last few years. In fact, his character is just not that interesting despite the fact he should be.<br/><br/>Once again everyones acting is excellent here and certainly in the earlier parts of the film the laughs run freely. The entire scene where Groot helps Yondu is just pure comedy gold and Rocket still has an unnerving fascination for wanting other peoples mechanical body parts. As impressive as he was in the first, Drax has definitely grown as a character and is also brilliant, finding humour in many things with his raucous laughter.<br/><br/>We also get to see much more of Gamora's sister Nebula this time too and the film does benefit from having her presence. certainly an excellent and interesting character and I'm glad she got more screen time compared to the first film. Pom Klementieff does a good job asa a naive empath though she is not really around enough to make a lasting impression. Likewise the classy Laura Haddock has a little more to do this time as Meredith, though her talents are wasted for the role.<br/><br/>Just like in the first film, everything looks fantastic and there is some beautiful visual effects to go along with the fantastic soundtrack which has perfect song placement. The highlight of the entire film though has to be baby Groot, he is so adorable and even more fun this time around. With the best credits sequence of any film yet in the universe this is not a bad offering but does fail to meet its expectations. Just be sure to remember your metaphors.<br/><br/>
The Sage's Rating: 7/10"

Other than the obvious bonus of Yondu's character, I really enjoyed the rest of the cast as well, especially newcomer Pom Klementiff as Mantis. Drax is more hilarious than the last movie, and Baby Groot is adorable.

"cameronjames-86959","7","1","1","19 March 2020"," An alright sequel to the amazing first movie
","After a second watch of guardians of the galaxy vol. 2 I have to say my score I previously gave it has lowered and I have to say this movie is just alright and probably one of my least favorite marvel movies. There is a lot of problems with this movie but the biggest is that the guardians of the galaxy split up for most of the movie which easily weakens most of the movie. What worked most about the first movie was the whole team working together as a team and in this movie that happens at the beginning and the end of the movie and in my opinion those are the best parts of the movie, Yes there is enjoyment to be had in the middle of the movie but that is for only one story which is yondu rocket and baby groot's story but the rest of the stories are just not interesting sadly. But there is still some enjoyment to be had in this movie and the cast all once again give a great performance as there characters and the villain is pretty good and interesting. Overall, guardians of the galaxy 2 is probably a movie I'll never watch again unless if I'm doing an MCU marathon, yes this movie isn't the worst but it's not amazing either."
"Offworld_Colony","10","1","1","18 February 2020"," If Guardians was the film that I left lacking, that was promised to be the the movie for me and then ended up being almost the movie for me;
","The superbly names Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 IS the movie made for me. The soundtrack is apt, the jokes are the right kind of nerdy and every character gets their due, they get an arc full of pathos, connection, humour and depth. Absolutely every one of the main characters had me crying out from beneath my 3D glasses throughout. The emotion is rich, relatable and raw and I appreciated it. I mean just the way the movie ends and the interconnectivity of all the plot machinations are warranted and welcome.
The effects, battles, and shooting never felt rushed or cheap. Everything fired on all cylinders with a care and love throughout. The plot was personal and minimal as it should be and the way it was made global was sensible and simple. The stakes couldn't have been higher because they were personal and they didn't need a sky portal to do it.
Even the references I didn't get were welcome little injokes rather than complete set ups for other movies that played in to the tone of the movie. Mantis is excellent and Drax is almost the most hilarious which is saying something. The pacing and the structure of the battles were coherent and made creative use of everyday new skill sets. The film had me in stitches throughout and the potential of Volume 3 and the next iteration of Groot is certainly an appealing one.
The depth effects of the 3D, after he litany of terrible post conversions I've seen, was consistent, pleasurable throughout and extraordinary well done and for one actually enhanced the experience.
This film should be added to the annals of time as the exact right kind of blockbuster sequel that builds upon its predecessors shoulders to create something unique and memorable that was both economical, brisk and yet deep and seemingly never compromised."

Star lord makes a lot of pop cultural references and even the ending has something to do with a classic arcade game character.This movie has more drama and character development and that too mostly focusing on yondu and nebula.

"andrewnmiller","10","1","1","29 April 2019"," Hooked on a feelin'
","Following my viewing of the first Guardians of the Galaxy film back in early 2015, I eagerly awaited the return of the galaxy's coolest band of misfits so once I heard that James Gunn was going to be bringing us a sequel to the 2014 space fantasy, I got pretty gritty as I adored the first film and once the first trailer dropped, I was over the moon. I couldn't wait to see it so in May of 2017, I went to my local movie theater with a friend and after 2 hours, I came out of the movie overjoyed and even a bit sad at what I had seen. From it's themes and action to its fantastic soundtrack and performances, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is not only a non-stop cosmic thrill ride but also one of the most personal films in the MCU that I've seen yet.<br/><br/>The film begins on Earth in the year 1980 where a young woman named Meredith Quill driving with her boyfriend. He then takes her to a place in the woods where he shows her an alien seedling he planted. We then jump forward 38 years later to The Guardians of the Galaxy protecting a batch of precious batteries for an alien race called The Sovereign in return for Gamora's sister Nebula but after Rocket Raccoon steals some of the batteries, The Sovereign attack the Guardians with a fleet of drones but are destroyed by an unknown force and the team crash-lands on a planet where the mysterious force reviles itself to be Peter Quill's father, Ego the Living Planet. The Guardians then travel with Ego and his assistant Mantis to his home planet while The Sovereign hires Yondu Udanta to track down The Guardians. Now, Peter Quill must choose between his real father and unleash his true power or remain with the team all while other forces conspire to bring down them down.<br/><br/>Part of what made the first Guardians of the Galaxy film work so well was its regression from what a typical sci-fi film is usually seen as. Director James Gunn and writer Nicole Perlman gave us a masterfully crafted homage to 80s nostalgia by rooting it in a lead hero in form of Peter Quill who found himself taken away from everything he ever knew on Earth after watching his mother die. Some superhero movies work wonders when they are homages or as a tool to deliver a more human experience to the viewer such as Spiderman 2 or Iron Man 3. Guardians of the Galaxy is the story of a young boy who is taken from a life on Earth to being a tool for a band of pirates and though that, the character of Star-Lord is forged and in the first film, he starts out as a thief only out for monetary gain but upon meeting Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket, he learns what it means to be a team leader and in this movie, Peter learns what it means to be apart of a family and what family truly means.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 works not only as a sequel to the first movie but also as a further exploration of the cosmic side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If the first Guardians of the Galaxy explored Peter dealing with the death of his mother, this film deals with his relationship with his distant father. As with the first film, this one is slathered from top to bottom with 80s nostalgic callbacks as there's even a point in the film where Quill and Gamora mention David Hasselhoff. It's impossible to tell wither Star-Lord is dealing with Ego or someone else entirely. In terms of story, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is as direct as a superhero movie can be with various character and thematic arches but the film remains focused on its core story relating to the relationship between Peter, Ego, and Yondu and while the film may not be delicate about its message, at the very least, it isn't beating you over the head every 5 minutes with its moral unlike Avatar did with its moral and while this formula has been explored numerous times in other movies from Mary Poppins and Terminator 2 to Hook and The Incredibles, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is notable for how it approaches this subject. The themes of family and fatherhood dominate the film and dive its story. For example, the film compares the themes of family and desire by asking us what makes a family and what price must be paid for the sake of family unity. It's about maintaining a balance between work and family and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 even makes a subtle conclusion that when we are pursuing monetary gain, we are also pursuing family as well.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, each character goes through their own family conflicts thus allowing them to grow as characters. Peter Quill's ach in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is him coming to terms with his actual father and the Guardians themselves. At the start of the film, Peter is asked by the Sovereign what his heritage is, we see him being uncertain as he never knew his father which is a contrast to The Sovereign who have hereditarily engineered their children to be flawless in every single way. Though this scene, the viewer can see how Star-Lord is different as he never knew the love of a father and this makes him unsure of who he really is and where he fits in. The scene is also a fine example of how to state the theme of your movie but without beating it into the viewer's brain. As for Gamora, her sister is literality her enemy and she claims that she doesn't care about Nebula or Peter Quill when in reality she does. Given how Gamora's on father is a murderous super villain, she's happy with things the way they are as opposed to Peter who is looking to make a family with her as she doesn't want to get hurt or feeling vulnerable. That's how Gamora gets by in these movies. As a matter of fact, she sees the Guardians as her new family and wants it to stay that way hence why she's angry when Ego first shows up in Peter's life. Again, this is spoken when she says to Quill that he already has a family. Gamora's echoing is exceptionally upsetting as she comes from a broken family herself given how Thanos killed her family and took her in as his own and she doesn't understand how to connect with anyone else because of what Thanos did to her and Nebula. Her whole character arc is about keeping her new adopted family in the form of the Guardians of the Galaxy together while also opening up to Peter Quill's advances and making her own family with him as well as facing her own kin in the form of Nebula. As for Rocket Raccoon, his arc in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is that much like the first film, he acts like nobody cares about him and keep pushing the other Guardians away at every opportunity because he's horrified of being apart of a family and given his origin of being a genetically altered raccoon still haunts him so he's made it his goal to prove that he is the best out of the team. This is the first taste the viewer gets of the theme of desire over family as Rocket tries to one-up everyone else on the team but in doing so, he further damages his relationship with the other Guardians. He also uses zeal erratically such as stealing the batteries from The Sovereign just to spite the rest of the Guardians and to fend off any notion of family as that worries him.<br/><br/>Nebula says that she's out to kill Gamora as well as Thanos for the pain he put her through by making Nebula fight Gamora and replacing parts of Nebula's body with parts of machinery whenever Gamora beat her in battle, but Nebula can't kill Thanos so killing Gamora will do nicely. She feels second-rate, so she's out to show that she is better than Gamora in every possible way, but this has nothing to do with ambition but rather revenge. It's primeval and shows Nebula's desperate need for a family even more so than Rocket's need for the same thing. As for Yondu Udanta, Peter Quill's adopted father, his fantastic character introduction of him visiting a robotic call girl and all the while the experience leaves him feeling empty and then having a confrontation with his Ravager clan who declare that Yondu broke the code by keeping Peter Quill alive and child trafficking. Much like the other characters in the film, Yondu has his own issues with his Ravager family as they have a moral code and due to Udanta breaking it, they shun him. It's a wonderful depiction of a character torn between two awful choices, losing Peter or losing his clan. It's a fine example of how we all have different groups of family and sometimes we are forced to choose between one or the other and for Yondu, he doesn't have a choice here as he doesn't have a family to speak of and he saw a chance to have a family with Quill and he chooses that over his clan and while Yondu may say to the Ravagers that he doesn't care what they say, it still hunts him nonetheless. So when The Sovereign hire him to capture the Guardians of the Galaxy, he agrees and goes after his adopted son. As for Drax, he may have the least developed family arc in the film but he still acts improperly with everyone else in the movie which the other characters just accept it. He's not trying to drive the rest of the Guardians away unlike Rocket is but receives them. As clumsy and inept as he is, Drax is absolute that a family is a unit. His desire for a more personal family isn't really shown to us as Drax is straightforward about everything but he does remain hidden when it comes to his emotions which do come out later on in the film. With Baby Groot, he's everyone's kid. No matter what the Guardians are doing, wither fighting some high monster or repairing their ship, he is always there with one of the team looking after him and protecting him. He's the genuine glue that keeps the Guardians of the Galaxy together and he is what makes them a family. While Baby Groot may only have a small character arc in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, he nonetheless is the emotional heart of the story and the team. He is what makes the Guardians of the Galaxy the team that it is so he does give them a reason to work together, accept each other and get along with one another all for the sake of Baby Groot. There's a te"

","At first glance this movie may seem to serve as a moderate sequel to the original, however, it actually serves as a great progression in the MCU for the guardians. The whole movie is about family. Quill doesn't trust his father until he does, only to realize that his real family died when he was young and that his new friends are his family. The most development is all around not Quill, but Yondu. Yondu we learn has had good intentions from the moment he picked up Quill but never really knew how to express them. Here he is partnered with Rocket (another character who has driven those close to him away) and they bond over their flaws. By the end of the film
*SPOILER* Yondu is finally accepted by Peter as his real father and he gets one of the best send offs ever in an emotional light show. I cried."

"vault-57100","9","1","1","14 April 2019"," A near masterpiece.
","Marvel has come an incredibly long way since the 2000's, when it first entered the cinematic scene with movies such as ""HULK"" and the original ""Spiderman"" trilogy staring Toby McGuire. Watching Volume two, it is incredibly hard to believe how far the Marvel Cinematic Univers has come. Directed by James Gunn, volume two is as close to a masterpiece as one can get. Volume two was a comedic action filled sci-fi extravaganza, a roller coaster of emotions and a compelling story about overcoming the demons within one's own families, because families are far more than mere friendship or kinship could ever hope to be. Breaking the film down, one can truly assess these aspects of the movie that could truly be considered master-strokes in a near perfect film.
From light-hearted humor at stupid, laughable names such as ""Taser-Face"", to crude humor such as Drax reminiscing about the love of his life and how her stoic, lifeless expressions made his ""nether regions engorge,"" Volume 2 has a joke for nearly everyone's tastes. This can most vividly be noted in the beginning sequence of the film, where the guardians are facing off against an inter-dimensional creature dead-set on feeding on Anulax batteries on the planet Sovereign. One would expect the battle to be incredibly intense, and the focus of the opening sequence. But this isn't the case, as the entire battle is displayed in the background, and at the forefront is none other than Baby Groot dancing to upbeat 80's music while the world is in chaos around him. Through this sequence alone, it is easy to see what the rest of the film has in store for the audience, a humor filled action sci-fi adventure the likes of which had never been seen before, and an incredible installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
For those looking for a deeper story that tugs at the heart strings, they needn't look further either, as volume two has it all. Everyone has been at odds with there family oat some point of their life, some way more so than others. James Gunn understands this and uses this to it's fullest potential. Every main protagonist in volume two has had to deal with some heavy stuff. (Spoilers ahead!) This is best exemplified by Yondu and Rocket as they were both discarded by the people who conceived them, and even had an altercation where Yondu confronts rocket about his personality and why he pushes everyone away, stating he knows everything about rocket "" I know who you are boy! 'Cus you're me!"" Familial drama is always a touchy subject, yet Gunn lays the problem out bare for the audience to relate to. (Spoilers End)
Volume two is not perfect, but it's damn near close. It's comical, visceral yet deep, and is overall an exceptionally well-made film. It would be disrespectful to not recommend this film to anyone who loves comics and the MCU if they haven't already seen it yet."

","GOTG Vol. 2 went bigger with the action and the set-pieces. The soundtrack is an excellent follow to the first movie's mixtape. It had a far more interesting villain than the first (played by Kurt Russell). They explored some very interesting character traits and dynamics. Most notably the relationships between Rocket and Yondu, Gamora and Nebula, and Peter and Ego. James Gunn so clearly crafted this film with love and adoration for all these characters and the entire cast shines on screen. Some tiring comedy bits drag the film a little bit but it doesn't hurt the film too much overall. Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 improves upon the surprising and winning formula of the first film in every way."

So, they hook all the kids into being ecstatic to see this next movie. PARENTS BEWARE!!!

MY GOSH Disney. What kind of crap are you trying to pull? If your first movie was like this, I wouldn't have taken my kids to see it or the 2nd movie, and I wouldn't be complaining now. Responsible parents usually go to a PG13 movie before taking their kids to make sure there won't be any surprises, or they get the review from friends. But, if the first movie is ""safe,"" you expect that the 2nd installment will be, too. NOT! Disney should just get it over with and make a feature length cartoon of Mickey and Minnie getting it on!

","Greetings! Just came from a double-feature showing of the Guardians movies, Volume 1 and 2 together. In doing this I got to compare the first and the second movie with them both freshly in my mind, and I will say Vol 2 is the BETTER of the two movies. The first movie did introduce us to this universe and these characters, so therefore you will hear some people 'professional critics' complain that Volume 2 isn't as 'fresh' and the first movie. Well they are idiots for saying that because the first movie was the introduction to characters most people have never heard of. Remember when the first trailer came out and many people were like ""who the heck are these people? is Marvel pulling our leg?"". Volume 2 gets to get right into the action and the story without having to re-introduce all the characters again. The movie has bigger and better laughs and some very touching moments. The stand out characters in this film are definitely Yondu and Nebula. You find out what drives them and what shapes them and their life. The only downside to the movie is although it is 2 hours and 15 minutes long, it seems to go by way to quickly and I would have loved for it to have 20 minutes longer."

","A couple of months after the events of Vol 1. the Guardians of the Galaxy have been hired by an alien population to defend their world. Despite a successful job, a disagreement between the Aliens and the Guardians puts the team in danger. That is when Ego (Kurt Russel) comes to rescue them and reveals himself as a celestial being and Peter Quill's father.<br/><br/>Despite having every reason and possibility to fail and become a complete spectacle mess, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2."" is another gem in Marvel's crown of wonderfully diverse films and another reason for their utter mastery in the genre.<br/><br/>Once again we have a film that despite being a gigantic, out-of-control production, it represents good cinema and respectful storytelling. As in all of their recent films, Marvel has embraced the notion of telling stories and giving artists the possibility to realize their vision. Vol 2. has its problems and, as said above, they could have made the film a complete disaster, but once again thanks to the brilliant Marvel philosophy, the film is held together by the addictive passion and heart that is embedded in these characters by James Gunn. By starting on character and emotions and by worrying about telling a heartfelt story first Marvel has just made another great piece of blockbuster cinema.<br/><br/>The film goes in many directions, some very welcome some unwarranted. There are many story lines being developed at once, there are some inconsistencies in exposition and mythology, the molding of tones isn't always seamless, some visual and world building ideas don't really pay off the way they should: the whole film is slightly uneven and there isn't a solid balance to all of these elements. Yet, when it comes down to it, it does not matter in the overall experience exactly because of what Gunn does with these characters.<br/><br/>He manages to infuse such heartfelt emotion in these people that the problems there might be in the structuring of plot or mythology take a second place to all of the glorious, entertaining material being presented to you. Gunn takes us on a tour de force of character archs here, everyone of them is given a dynamic that is developed throughout the whole duration of the film. The surprises hit you, every emotional beat hits its mark, every laugh delivers.<br/><br/>There is a beautiful variety of emotions that you are taken through and it is always such a pleasure to see a director tackle both comedy and drama to these emotional heights and deliver on both effectively. There are so many relations new and old that are developed and all of them give the audience a different flavor, probably the best one remains for me the one between Gamora and Quill or Gamora and Nebula.<br/><br/>Then to top all of the heartfelt storytelling off, Gunn spices the whole picture with an incredible variety of quirkiness, great music and stunning action sequences that almost always manage to enhance the conflict between the characters. The space battles might still be a weak point of his, but it is hard not to be taken into the seamless, amazing work of the visual effects team.<br/><br/>""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is a beautiful, touching picture filled with powerful emotions and breathtaking laughter and entertainment, one that is so good at doing what is does that it overcomes its flaws and doesn't let the spectacle overcome the heart of the film."
"mitodruroy","9","5","12","25 April 2017"," This film is unabashedly funny
","I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 last night on the Xtreme screen at Hoyts Riccarton and I was utterly pleased with the work James Gunn has done for this film. There is no dearth of unapologetic humor in this film and after a certain point of time even the strong speakers of the cinema hall could not douse one of my friends' maniacal laughter. I was personally vouching for the more serious moments in the film because that's when I could clearly hear what the characters were saying. Otherwise when there was even the slightest hint of comedy, this guy (my friend) used to start laughing like the most hysterically loud hyena that has ever walked on this planet.<br/><br/>In this film we get a better insight into the complexities of Star- Lord's dad and realize that he is not exactly what he seems to be. We also get a better idea of Yondu's character. I wish Marvel made a spin-off film that intricately depicted the culture and traditions of the Ravagers. They are such an exquisite group of space -pirates. I also felt sorry for Nebula and I wish the Avengers manage to conquer Thanos as fast as possible although knowing how powerful Thanos is, it will take quite sometime to bring Thanos down.<br/><br/>We get to see Stan Lee in this film, not once, but two times. And the Marvel tradition of having post-credits scenes is maintained in this film. There are a plethora of post-credits scenes and I am eager to find out how significant Sylvester Stallone's character turns out to be in the future editions of the Marvel films. It would be awesome to see Doctor Strange and the Avengers team up with the Guardians to fight their most important battle . We got amazing seats for this film. We were seated at the center of the hall and I felt I was right amidst all the action that was happening on the screen. I'll try to seat myself at the center for all the future Marvel viewings. I"

","Guardians of the Galaxy is, for me, the best of the Marvel Universe films, so I had high hopes for the sequel, which happily maintains the wild humor, well-drawn characters, and over-the-top effects of the first movie.<br/><br/>A lot of the user reviews like the comedy and action but express less interest in the movies more emotional moments. This is very much a movie about family, and it doesn't shy away from the emotional nature of love and connection. I found this surprisingly affecting, although I can understand why some would prefer less tugging of the heart strings and more explosions. <br/><br/>Still, there are an awful lot of explosions, so I'm good. <br/><br/>Is it as good as the original? It's hard to say. The first movie benefited lack of expectations - it was nothing like the other Marvel movies so I wasn't expecting a comedy. The second movie, on the other hand, benefits from the fondness I have for the first one. So I can't say which is actually better. I can say both are great."

","Urgh, such genuine nasty dislike for such a harmless cool kickass little Outerspace thrill ride.. Well screw you, because I f*ckin' genuinely loved it! I for one found it to be about as good as the first movie, maybe not as As novel and fresh naturally, but certainly an awesome and satisfying movie experience in its own right and a well done return to this particular universe and these characters. I greatly appreciated its more touching moments and the way that it wrapped up the story on a surprisingly sombre note. It took a wee bit to really get going but once it got to the part of the story that was at the beautiful ornate palace on the weird planet that turned out to be Peter Quil's father I was hooked and having a blast with it. It definitely wasn't lacking in the funny department, I kept laughing out loud, a lot of those quips really just kept landing for me. There were just a few times though where the ceaseless comedic bantering was beginning to hurt the pacing a little and took away from the gravity of the dramatic moments and thrilling scenes a bit..but still among other things I'd call it a hilarious movie, it's just a little Drax heavy! If you ask me it was mainly the talking tree and the raccoon that really made everyone love the original movie, but in this one those two definitely seemed a little downplayed in comparison, with the focus being mostly on Peter and the seemingly benevolent father that had found him at last... Something I loved was how effectively it fleshed out characters that you might not have expected like Yondu and definitely Nebula, she felt way more like a real character this time than the practically bit part she was before. And also Gamora had some growth through Nebula as the two gradually settled their differences through fighting and fiery explosions and general peril and realised who their true enemy was, and I really found it a touching little moment when Gamora finally embraced Nebula as a sister and she slowly holds her back for a second before storming off to wage crazy blue cyberbabe war against Thanos alone! I loved every single back and forth between the blunt and thoughtless as hell Drax, and the sweet delicate Mantis, the ditsy alien girl with empathetic powers. David Bautista and Pom Klementieff's polar opposite characters played off each other perfectly and their funny and cute interactions were a real highlight for me. When Kurt Russell as ""Ego"" first appeared I was a bit miffed and taken aback, as I was well aware of what Ego is in the comics and this was just a man, and frankly I demanded to see a damn living planet with a face! But it was very cool how they approached the more immense and awesome stuff and gradually built up to that as Mr casual easygoing Ego started to become a little scary as his coldhearted reasons for locating Peter were revealed and he casually let go that he made Peter's mother terminally ill on purpose for his own selfish needs. After that little revelation Ego became nothing but another all-powerful roaring menace to be overcome, and any possibility of anything meaningful between him and Peter was pretty much tossed right out the window, but thankfully the father and son element of the story was addressed another way. It sure was cool though to see Star Lord briefly wield the cosmic power of a..Star Lord!! It was so well written and played out the way that what at first appeared to be the ideal father that Peter thought he'd finally got turned out to be his worst nightmare and the gruff rogue who gave him a harsh upbringing and taught him what he needed to know to survive was the closest thing to a father he'd ever had and he only ever realised it right at the end as Yondu heroically sacrificed himself by giving his oxygen suit. And what an odd unlikely image to end a superhero movie on with Rocket shedding a tear, very far removed indeed from the typical triumphant sunset fist-pump type note that usually ties up these kinds of pictures. It certainly worked though and was very fitting. I felt this was a very good sequel all around and was totally more of the same goodness if you got a kick out of the original's style and wit, it was great to see more of this colourful far out world and it felt the same, only a little bigger in scope and it branched out in interesting directions and expanded its characters and even introduced a few new ones. I was amazed thrilled and definitely entertained by it, it made me laugh a lot , and I just had a fun time watching it, it's one if the best comic book flicks that I've personally seen yet, and I had no hesitation in giving it a well-deserved 8 superpower-generated giant flying rock Pacmans out of 10! We want more!!!"

Kurt Russell, I've said it before, he's a very good actor who can not find any more roles for the level of his talent. Michael Rooker plays the best part, he is an actor with many good roles under his belt. He is nice and funny with blue face and red crest. Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff and Elizabeth Debicki are good all three. But the whole film is not! It's pathetic! The fact that it has many cool songs from the '70s and' 80s in the soundtrack does not save anything. The costumes and the decorations are indeed a praiseworthy achievement. Otherwise, special effects over special effects."

The soundtrack, the humors, everything that's good in the prequel, back in this movie. I love how Marvel delivers the humor that makes me and basically everyone else in the theater laughing. And i truly appreciate the way Marvel told us about all the planets living in the Galaxy. It's the title ""galaxy"", so Marvel should tell us what kind of Galaxy the Guardian taking care is. One plot that i didn't see to come is that the villain in fact, not the *SPOILER* Sarveign told in the beginning. It's maybe predictable for some, but i got tricked.<br/><br/>Lastly, this movie is really enjoyable for all ages (it's Disney!). The story is light as other MCU movies. The plot is predictable but still awesome. The soundtrack is lovable, and the chemistry upon the characters is really good.

","If repetitive chase sequences, contrived colorful explosions at the end of every action sequence, and occasionally forced and isolated comedy are the only parameters that you judge a superhero movie in 2017 with, then Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 should be a collector's product. There's a lot of references in this film that demands you go back to Vol. 1 and also take a 50-hour pop culture lesson narrated by Stan Lee. The plot associated with Walkman-ambassador leader guardian Quill's parentage is a boring clich√© and one that makes you puke, considering there are more grotesque beings and objects in the film. A sheer lack of novelty, the inability to improve the charm in the characters, and reckless usage of CGI majorly affects James Gunn's second major feature film that is gaudier than the film's obnoxious poster. Chris Pratt has begun to slightly annoy and if he maintains a similar air we'll have to turn to DC by the time these guardians create the next volume. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an ordinary superhero film with lots of blabbering using advanced vocabulary and lots of flashes, lasers, flares, and plasma. It also has a gold-obsessed priestess awkwardly trying to get at the guardians for stealing a bunch of her Duracell batteries. Like this, there are many more mindless arcs, but I'm fairly content because Quill was finally introduced to Microsoft Zune, arguably one of the best music players to come out of the technology race.

","The visually stunning follow-up to Guardians of the Galaxy, has the same spark of cosmic brilliance that shone when we were first introduced to everyone's favourite, dysfunctional group of space misfits.<br/><br/>If there's one truism in comic-book movie-making, it's that giant superhero team-ups are almost always sure-fire hits. (And then there's, ahem, crap like¬†Fantastic Fours). What's less true is that superhero team-up sequels will have the same good fortune. All the right ingredients can be there‚Äîgood cast, same director, bomb-ass CGI‚Äîand for whatever reason, the movie just doesn't ascend as high as its predecessor. Such is the rare case with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.<br/><br/>Like any good mix-tape, James Gunn serves up a steady vibe. But as long as we're talking mix-tapes, think back to the¬†first mix-tape your crush¬†gave you. You remember the songs, the sequence, even the smell of the air¬†wherever you listened to it. Now, quick: What was on the second mix-tape they made you? You remember some of it, but chances are you're having a tougher time remember if the opening track was by Steely Dan or Stevie Nicks. Or, y'know, any non-1978 equivalent. But GOTG2 ain't one of those. You're most likely to remember at least some of it quite easily. (Hopefully).<br/><br/>To say the least: If you like superhero flirting, bonding, and not- too-graphic dick jokes, it's a hoot. There might even be a tearjerker or two. But if you're hoping for¬†something radically different from the first Guardians,¬†you might¬†be disappointed.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is, at its very core, a story about family. Where its predecessor brought together five hilarious a- holes and helped them realise that there's more to life than stealing, revenge and running from your past, Guardians of the Galaxy¬†Vol. 2 works to test their ties to one another only to further strengthen their bond.<br/><br/>There are certainly flaws in the story structure and an aggressive case of trying to please fans by just recycling what worked in the first film, but at its core, Vol. 2 gives us insight into the sins of our fathers and certainly packs an emotional punch when it counts. It's loud, it's colourful, it's funny, and it's endearing. If you were a fan of the first, you're sure to enjoy the second. However, if you're looking for the greatest movie in the MCU to date, it'd be wise to level those expectations. Don't kid yourself into absolute fanatical- ridiculousness.<br/><br/>To declare Guardians of the Galaxy¬†Vol. 2 a beautiful film would be an understatement. Since Marvel actually did a some really good work and for the first time, bringing the new instalment loaded with some memorable goodies of visuals and stunning cinematography. However, the incredible visuals alone aren't what make Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 a worthy sequel. Building on the dynamics within the core group of characters we already know and love, introducing us to an array of new and interesting guests, plus still managing to make us all howl with laughter one minute and fight to hold back tears the next, it's clear that Gunn's 'Guardians' are far more than one-hit-wonders."
"jthompsonbarnoldswick","6","3","6","2 May 2017"," These guys are not the avengers
","I want to start off by saying that I was thoroughly entertained throughout this movie, and would highly recommend it. I must also say that this film has it's issues. Personally, I found the structure a little uncomfortable. I expected that like the first installment and the other Marvel films, that the focus throughout the story would be on an a group of heroes eliminating a great threat. Unfortunately the main antagonist is revealed way too late in the story, leaving the characters rather aimless throughout most of the film. As a result the plot meanders into the territory of sketch show and t.v. drama, but fortunately, still manages to deliver a great final punchline. Although the action, effects and comedy are all very enjoyable, I couldn't help but wonder where it was all leading. Although the story evolves into quite a satisfying conclusion, about two thirds of the way through the film the absence of direction made me worry that the film would end up being a complete mess. That worrying unfortunately soiled the experience a little. I feel that I would probably enjoy the film a lot more the second time around, knowing what to expect."
"ekveland","7","3","6","1 May 2017"," From a non comic book readers perspective: fine, not great
","Whilst I enjoyed my self plenty, busting out laughing at many points during the movie, something felt off when it came to a close. Whereas the first movie captured lightning in a bottle, delivering great, original (to most) characters, in a bright, colourful and most importantly funny sci-fi fantasy; the second feels less fresh and suffers from what I call ""Marvel scope creep"".<br/><br/>What do I mean by that? It feels way more ""comic book""-y this time, forcing itself to integrate with the Marvel Cinematic Universe¬ô in ways that feels inorganic and downright puzzling. Having a detailed universe to draw upon is great when it can add texture and make the stories feel like they are supported by a living breathing world. Star Wars of course being the prime example here.<br/><br/>But having the climax of the movie give significant screen time to characters that have never been introduced, or a seemingly major character arc and plot inferred to by two lines of dialogue earlier, is downright puzzling. Who are these people and why should we care? I can imagine comic book readers or even viewers of the billion plus Marvel movies getting a kick out of seeing quartzface or whatever get a short cameo. But this is literally the ending of the movie and we get more combined reaction time from bit players than our main characters. Bizarre and off putting.<br/><br/>There are no surprises, and posters having already revealed well in advance which previous antagonists would end up joining our heroes, or who Quills father would be and his alignment, so that tension is well out the window. Even the Awesome Mix vol 2 seemed to have spent all its best tunes on the first one.<br/><br/>I'm sure this all sounds like I'm too down on the movie, but I am not. I still had a great time whizzing through space with this motley crew. It is as funny as ever (even though the best jokes were in the trailer), trippy and downright beautiful to watch. Even with the diminishing returns, it is still well worth your while."

But what a disappointment this Vol2. Nothing against working through family-related therapeutic issues in a Woody Allen Film - but it doesn't belong into a cool Marvel Superhero movie. The lack of character focus led me to wondering if this wasn't just another action move, forgetting all about the 'super' of its genre. New additions, such as Ms Klementieff as weirdly stuttering cyborg or Sylvester Stallones as an unnecessary kind-of-good-macho- guy, were pretty confusing and Mr Groot clearly was sent on the Marketing-mission to make this movie likable amongst and accessible for screaming one-direction-teens.<br/><br/>I soooo wanted to like this movie - and soooo didn't!"

The first ¬ÑGuardians of the Galaxy"" collected over 770 million dollars from the cinemas in 2014, so the sequel is, of course, very similar. A true-blood superhero movie, just like the grandmother used to make. It's loud, brash, full of colors and explosions and always ready to gently tease about superhero and sci-fi movies' tired clich√©s, without bringing anything to replace them. Yes, the result is full of ¬Ñenergy"" and much ¬Ñfun"", but if you don't particularly care about the paper-thin characters or picturebook world they inhabit, it's difficult to hold interest after 30 minutes or so. And how can one care if there's never even a slight feeling that any big character is really in danger, no matter how large the explosions and enemy guns! It's all sound and fury, signifying nothing, as the late great Shakespeare would say. The story is trivial as expected and thus would work better in small doses¬Ö but the movie format is much more profitable, so we get about 140 minutes in a row. Nevermind that there's maybe 90 minutes worth of story here, every self-respecting Hollywood epic must last over two hours. I am Groot!"

","SPOILERS SPOILERS<br/><br/>1. Unlike the first Guardians which became better and better as the story progressed, with a true development of story and character into something that was believable and worth rooting for, the 2nd is a disaster. <br/><br/>There's really nothing here to look at, and the story is as paper-thin as the dioramas that Dad was showing Son on the planet Ego - fake, unbelievable, unrealistic, unsatisfying. 2. Much of the 'action' is there merely to fill the eyeballs of fanboys with more 'Guardians', much like watching hours of CoD game play videos online. Seriously! You've got unmotivated sequences upon sequences - the usual, show one of the heroes trying to do something, artificially put a roadblock in front of him, watch him struggle a bit, then next.<br/><br/>For example, let's say you're a hero trying to escape with a woman who has fainted. So you carry her in your arms as you are rushing to the escape ship. Out of nowhere, the earth turns into quicksand and you're now sinking down, down, down. You don't do anything at all, just hold her up while you sink. The sinkhole has nothing to do with the character or the story - it's simply something the writer came up with to put in the hero's way just so fanboys can see some sort of 'action' on screen. None of this moves the story or character development along, and it's almost like stubbing one's toe all of a sudden. Ouch! But why is this scene in the movie? 3. In the end, the arc of the story is weak, the tension non-existent, the jokes sub-par. A failure compared to the funny 1st movie, where even non-fanboys could have a great time rocking to the music and laughing at the actually funny jokes (it's sad in this movie - limp comedian time with very few things to laugh at). The music has gone, nothing to rock to in this one, and in the end, the classic Walkman is replaced by a Zune?!? Huh? Poorest product placement ever, and doesn't even evoke a feeling (did anyone actually love a Zune?). 4. Not worth the movie tickets, even at the $1 theater. Best if you can see it for free on TV decades from now because it'll be an equal waste of time."

The movie made a lasting impression on me, so I couldn't wait to see Guardians of the Galaxy volume 2.<br/><br/>Volume 2 is everything you don't want it to be. It starts okay, with a scene of the whole team fighting a huge monster. Especially baby Groot is really cute. From that scene on, the film is on a slippery slope. <br/><br/>The jokes are not funny and especially the story line is thin and ridiculous. Wow, Quill 's dad is a god. And he wants to destroy all life in the universe. This is a road Marvel has taken before. In X- men Apocalypse and Days of future past, Marvel also goes for a larger than life enemy.

","This movie has already earned the better part of a billion dollars in box office receipts, so it's like spitting in the wind to write a bad review of it. But here it is. This movie is a hot mess. A melting pot of a bunch of old SF movie plots blended into what's going to be largely hard to understand for a lot of people not already enraptured by SF or the Marvel Universe. Our heroes start out doing what they always do: taking on impossible tasks and succeeding. Then pissing everyone off and becoming goats. The movie then fractures into many, many subplots. There are not one but two father/son-issues subplots. There's the men-become-gods clich√© trope (calling Gary Mitchell). There's the rival siblings subplot. There are not one but two budding romances. There's the inferiority complex of a goodhearted character who pushes away his friends so he won't get hurt by them. There's the evil-but-goodhearted space pirates plot. Also there are numerous bits and pieces lifted from dozens of other SF films including several in the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. There's also plenty, plenty of pretty, pretty CGI eye candy.<br/><br/>If you can't get enough of this stuff, then Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 is a buffet for you.

A great movie for comic book fan (loads of Easter eggs) but also nice for a casual movie goer (might need a lot of explaining and seeing vol.1 is a minimal requirement to really enjoy it). <br/><br/>It remains fresh in comparison to other recent comic book shows, even if it's more of the same compared to the vol.1. The genre that I love got a bit stale with the latest installments of Marvel Cinematic Universe (like Avengers 2, Civil War and even Dr Strange) or DC movies (hello Suicide squad). This flick was refreshing almost on the same level as Deadpool or Logan (clearly not the same style as that pair).<br/><br/>I highly recommend."
"rannynm","8","4","10","2 May 2017"," More Thrilling and Hilarious Than its Predecessor
","Set to ""Awesome Mixtape #2"", Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. #2 is more thrilling and hilarious than its predecessor. It is an action packed, sci-fi adventure about a group of intergalactic criminals who are tasked to work together to save the universe. Chris Pratt again stars as Peter Quill, aka Star Lord. The rest of the cast follows suit - Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax, Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot and Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket. <br/><br/>The film starts out with the classic 70s song ""Brandi"" by Looking Glass as we see two young people driving down the highway, very much in love. We later learn that this is the back story of Peter's conception and is foreshadowing the main storyline of the film. The movie jumps 34 years and Peter is now Star Lord, captain of a band of reformed outlaws. The group is hired to guard the uber batteries of the Sovereign planet. Upon leaving, Rocket steals some of the batteries and a space battle ensues. Star Lord and his crew are shot down and make an emergency landing on a nearby planet. Before landing, they notice a mysterious spaceship, which takes out the entire Sovereign fleet pursuing them. The rest of the film is an emotional, action-packed adventure, having to do with this mysterious personage. There are lots of battles between different factions in this crazy sci-fi, fantasy universe. <br/><br/>The movie has lots of lively and entertaining scenes. My favorite is when Rocket Raccoon uses traps to his advantage to defeat an incoming horde of ravagers. Every scene with Drax is terrific because he has a different philosophy of life and has the most infectious laugh of any character in any movie, ever. I also love how Peter is obsessed with 80s pop culture. He references them all the time, but his companions never understand them, because they didn't grow up on Earth. I especially love how 80s music is used to evoke nostalgia from Peter's childhood, making for a terrific oldies soundtrack.<br/><br/>Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is phenomenal and full of whimsical jokes that don't get old. It is a perfect family adventure that is suitable for ages 10 to 18. Parents and grandparents will even get a kick out of it. I rate this film 4 out of 5 stars for its engaging humor and captivating action. <br/><br/>Reviewed by Clayton P. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
"soxlade","9","4","10","3 May 2017"," Lacks the element of surprise, but Guardians 2 is just as much a blast!
","Going into a cinema with no real idea what you are going to see is a rare experience. Nowadays films seem intent of giving away everything in the trailer, or the hype is so detailed that the film sounds rubbish and you're not going to see it anyway.<br/><br/>The first Guardians of the Galaxy film was a similar experience. Here was a wacky sounding premise from Marvel: a sci-fi space opera with no known characters, no links to the established Marvel Cinematic Universe and contained a character who was a talking tree with limited vocabulary.<br/><br/>There was no real need to worry, the first Guardians was a highly imaginative, colourful, lively, fresh and funny movie with a robust rolling plot, instantly lovable characters, quotable dialog and, get this, it was fun. Seriously fun.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is, guess what, the first sequel that introduced us to Peter 'Starlord' Quill, Gamora, Drax, Rocket Racoon and Groot and it has a lot to live up to. No matter that all the cast returned, along with writer/director James Gunn, there was always the worry that the first film was a fluke, a one-off never to be repeated. The oft-mentioned threat of rolling this free-spirited franchise into the wider MCU also raised eyebrows (and concerns).<br/><br/>Therefore I am happy to say that Guardians 2 (as literally no-one is calling it) is a worthy sequel to the original film. It is a slick, funny, colourful intergalactic romp that is resolutely like nothing else in the MCU and is just as good as the original . Though not hugely different from the first, who cares when a film is this much fun.<br/><br/>The story of Vol 2 (any better?) sees our heroes battling a interdimensional space beast on behalf of Elizabeth Debecki's race of beautiful gold beings called The Sovereign. One swift double- cross later and a mighty space battle ensues causing our characters to crash on a remote planet when they are finally tracked down by Kurt Russell's Ego. An ancient god-like living planet who just happens to be Quill's long lost father.<br/><br/>One of the signature joys of a Guardians film are the snap scenes, scenes that don't really advance the plot, but provide character moments that are sometimes sweet, sometimes caustic, but nearly always very funny. Other snap scenes are simply extremely stupid - at one point Yondo and Rocket perform multiple hyperspace jumps which wreak havoc on their physiology. A joke so silly that visiting it twice is only natural.<br/><br/>Performances are all excellent, with an particular nod to Kurt Russell as Ego, whose performance is subtle and well delivered, even when he is reduced to CGI for the inevitable climax, and Elizabeth Debecki who, despite being drowned in unflattering gold paint, delivers a performance of frustrated rage and despair hidden under a shell of calm control. See her performance in ""the-scene-where-the- carpet-runs- out"" for an example.<br/><br/>Visually the film never quite delivers some of the gob-smacking spectacles of the first - there is nothing that quite compares to ""Nowhere"" in the first film for example. However it is still a lush, colourful look at space that is always attractive to look at.<br/><br/>There are other problems, the last 10-15 minutes descends into the CGI slug-fest that mars so many of these films and swiftly becomes tiresome. Also the whole film differs from the first by not visiting any of the characters and locations we visited in the first film, there's none of the Novacorp that set up much fun in the first film. The film is, in my opinion, weaker for not having our ragamuffin heroes dropped into and frustrating an icily organised and civilised society, and the Sovereign don't quite cut it.<br/><br/>However these are minor quibbles. This is a film packed to the rafters with character, comedy bickering, whip-crack dialogue, stupid visual jokes, clever character moments, joyous action and a desperately cute baby tree.<br/><br/>Perhaps the real problem with GotGv2 (nope, there is no shorthand that's going to work) is that is no longer a surprise, it is no longer that exciting new thing. The flaws of the first film, a weak villain, unclear plotting and over the top CGI climax, are still present here. If anything the plot is a little worse than the original. To beat this James Gunn turns everything up to eleven and, you know what, it works.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic film, one of the year's best, and it comes highly recommended. But be warned if you have not seen the first film, you may be a little lost."

This isn't a big spoiler, but the movie can be divided in two plots (one with baby Groot and Rocket Raccoon and the another one with Star Lord, Drax Gamora and Ego), I found the plot with Rocket and Groot more interesting because the development about Peter's parentage is a little boring. However, there are enough space to a lot of good jokes and that's the heart of the movie.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the characters is amazing and I'm sure you will enjoy each dialogue between them, even if you're not familiarized with that little big group, like me.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the biggest problem is the lack of the danger sensation, I mean we only find the real problem and the real enemy near of the film's ending. It's bad for who's expecting a movie full of thrilling scenes that can make you believe the characters could die every moment.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy 2 isn't the best Marvel movie, although is very away of to be one of the worsts, it's just good and fun.<br/><br/>Rate: 7.5/10"

","Well, that was quite fortunate. I went to the cinema planning on seeing another movie, but I had missed the earlier session and the later one was about an hour and a half away. However, it turned out that they were showing previews of Guardians of the Galaxy, so instead I decided to go and see that, and they weren't even charging a premium. Well, to put it straight, it was hilarious, and while I thought a part of the previews was a spoiler, it turned out it wasn't because the movie is basically all about how Peter Quinn finally meets up with his father.<br/><br/>Honestly, I really don't want to give any more of the plot away than this, and while I can easily put a spoiler tag up (which I basically do for every movie review I do anyway), I still don't necessarily feel like saying anymore anyway. As for a film, well, it is the next chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so you can pretty much expect to get what you generally get from these films, including the ubiquitous Stan Lee cameo. However, one thing you probably should be aware of is that there are actually five cuts scenes after the end of the movie, so make sure you hang around until the end.<br/><br/>As for the film, well, I'll have to admit that it came across to me as your classic science-fiction film with your typical Marvel Superheroes slant to it (though considering that it is based on a Marvel Comic, then that is not surprising). The other thing is that they seem to be bringing actors in from here, there, and everywhere for this films, because not only does Kurt Russel appear as Peter Quinn's dad, but we also have an appearance by the Stalone, who I honestly thought had long been left on the Hollywood junkheap. Well, it seems as if I was wrong.<br/><br/>In a way it does answer a number of questions from the previous movie, including who Peter Quinn's dad happens to be, though if you have read the comics you might already have a reasonably good idea (though I suspect that they have changed it from the comics so as not to spoil the movie too much ‚Äì however not being an expert I personally can't say for sure). On the other hand it also happens to be a lot more light hearted than the previous movie. In fact, it left not only me but the entire audience in stitches. In the end, I have to admit that the term Trash Panda now has a completely different meaning."
"Lost_In_Translation_","6","3","7","17 April 2019"," Subverts expectations, but half of the movie is a slog
","I along with many other people loved the first Guardians when it came out. No one knew what it was, though I had some minor knowledge of them from the comics. It was a hit so obviously Marvel was gonna do more.<br/><br/>The way this movie starts off is something James Gunn did as he probably wanted to subvert the expectations of what people thought would happen. Everyone though after the initial scene that they would fly off and find an adventure together and have a fun romp like the first one with the crew getting along and having a blast of an adventure.<br/><br/>Instead after the opening bit, he pretty much reduces their relationships to rubble as well as Star-Lord's iconic ship. I don't mind Gunn doing something that we didn't expect, but its after this point that the movie splits into two stories as the Guardians split into two groups.<br/><br/>Peter, Drax, and Gamorra go to Peter's father's planet. The 2nd group starts with Groot, Rocket, and Nebula, and but then adds on Yondu and the mutinous crew of Ravagers. The Rocket/Yondu/Groot story felt fun and like an adventure that we would see the Guardians take part of. The Star-Lord/Father bit is one of the slowest, uninteresting thing you could ever watch in an ""adventure"" movie.<br/><br/>That whole side of the story is just exposition after exposition and you 100% know his father is going to turn out evil, no question. So since there is no question or doubt he will be bad, you spend all of those times they cut back to it just waiting and waiting for the turn to happen and it is so dull. They also take quite a while introducing and getting us used to Mantis, which is fine, but the pace at which they do that along with the Peter/Father stuff just brings the whole movie down.<br/><br/>There's way too many repeated jokes that are just annoying (ie ""It's Not Ripe yet"", ""Tazerface"", the many times Rocket is made fun of, and some really unneeded sexual humor).<br/><br/>I just wish they had tackled the Star Lord's father part of the script differently. It just brings down the movie so much whenever they cut back to it. Also the Yondu/Peter father/son relationship felt way too forced. Since they don't see each other until the end there is no buildup to them ever having that kind of relationship. Even in the first movie it's never alluded to that Yondu raised Peter like a son.<br/><br/>It's a shame as the opening is fantastic, there are small bits here and there that are really good, and the final action scene is great. It's just the Star Lord/father stuff that really wasn't done well and the overused jokes just really become annoying. I'd watch a Yondu/Rocket/Groot full on movie over what they split this movie into."

Give 'em what they loved in the first one and up the budget. This was a sequel movie trope since the 80s and more so in the 90s. And this movie was broken into quarters, as one disposable character in this movie points out are not thirds of the movie. <br/><br/>Let me preface that I LOOOVED the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Seen it multiple times and is one of my all-time favorite Marvel, Comic Book and Origin Story movies. So¬Öwhat a let down here.<br/><br/>Back to quarters. The first half of this movie was just fan-fare. Giving the audience what they loved about part one without much new substance or heart the first one had in spades. Then, the 3rd quarter picks up and makes my heart soar and I loved every minute of that third quarter. Annnd, we're back to the never-ending fourth and not-so final quarter since there were far-too-many post credit scenes I simply lost interest with each one. <br/><br/>While I didn't hate the first half or the never-ending last quarter as they both contained some decent scenes and hearty laughs, it was that wonderful third quarter that makes me grant a slight recommendation for this entire movie.<br/><br/>Basically, the gang's back and they're saving one clone army of batteries and causing another conflict that eventually lands our beloved Guardians of the Galaxy apart for most of the film. Oooooof course, they only work together well as a team and it takes the majority of the movie and our patience to get that.<br/><br/>Gone was the heart of the original. Vanished were the unforgettable songs. Out were the stakes. And Mini-Groot was absolutely more annoying than cute and hell, did I miss the big, funny and heartfelt Groot from the first one. This felt rushed and if not for some comedy throughout, good FX and, again, that third quarter, this wouldn't get the slightest of recommendations. <br/><br/>In fact, as stated, I've seen the first multiple times. I might never see this one again, if not for the inevitable Vol. 3 where I might do a little Guardians marathon. Hopefully, enough time has passed by then and I'll have a little heart for this entry. But, until Vol. 3, I'd skip this movie and just do a marathon then. Hopefully, they'll get back on track with that chapter.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Just a clarification and in defense of this project, outside that now infamous third quarter, I did LOVE the Rocket vs. the Dozens of Henchmen in the forest scene. THAT was so awesome and is worth an extra ¬Ω star for that scene alone."

","It was always going to be a difficult job to make this sequel. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was an unexpected hit in 2014 whereas this time we all knew what was coming. But what made the original such a breath of fresh air in a depressingly stagnant genre is missing this time around.<br/><br/>The first film was brimming with enthusiastic, immature energy. But while the enthusiasm and the immaturity are both back in spades, there is nothing driving the plot forward here. In GotG we had the assembly of an unlikely team of original weirdos. The sequel offers up a couple of plot-lines: fractures in the team due to clashing characters, a will-they-won't-they romance and a central story that revolves around the protagonist's past. To the film's credit, there isn't an excess of story-lines here, a fault of many franchise sequels (I'm looking at you, Pirates). It's just that there's nothing organic about the way the film moves forward. After a fairly decent set-up, which goes some way to expanding the universe, we enter into sluggish 2nd and 3rd acts which draw their impetus from the writers, rather than a natural energy emerging from the characters or story. It never feels like the actions or choices of our characters are drawing them towards anything - plot developments occur purely when it's convenient for them to happen. I was so bored by the last 20 minutes - I could not wait for the film to end.<br/><br/>Every now and then, the film throws us an action sequence to liven things up. Unfortunately, the characters are so unthreatened by these set pieces that there's no chance of any tension developing. Early on, Drax (played to amusing effect once again by Dave Bautista) hangs out of the back of a space ship and is pummelled by debris during a crash landing. He just shrugs it off, and it's indicative of the level of damage the heroes can sustain without any effect. Admittedly I haven't seen the first movie since it came out in the cinema, but I don't remember this being a problem last time around.<br/><br/>There are definitely some positives. The performances are very good, once again, with Bautista and Pratt in particular delivering on their comic moments. We get a little bit of universe expansion, which is gratifying, as it's a colourful world. It's a shame that so much of the film takes place away from the vibrant multi-world cultural mix that we know is in the background, as the film often feels limited in size and sparsely inhabited.<br/><br/>It definitely feels like I am judging GotG2 by a harsher standard than the first film. But this is warranted - sequels need to justify themselves as more than simply another go round for the characters, but this time they have to build on the plot resolutions that we've already had, which makes the job harder. While this is by no means a disastrous attempt, it is a limp and unexciting one."

Shortly after the events of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', the fame of the Guardians has spread throughout the entire galaxy and reached Ego(Kurt Russell), a cosmic being who has a personal relationship to one of the guardians.<br/><br/>Let me just say that I liked the original 'Guardians of the Galaxy' but I didn't think it deserved the mass acclaim it had achieved. That said, I had high hopes for this movie due to the talented team working on it and Marvel's recent track record. I really liked this movie. Gunn has outdone himself with this movie and provided a true, character driven story with good humour, great acting and stunning visuals. The original cast of the original return to this movie and all do spectacular jobs. That said, this movie does have a few flaws. One of them is the messy action. Not to say it was poorly filmed, none of the movie was, but it just didn't feel that clean and felt like they were trying too hard to make it very grand. I do recommend this movie but I think caution is warranted due to the differences in how the story is driven. If you're a die hard fan of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', I can see you having issues with this movie but I think most people will be able to take the changes and enjoy it.<br/><br/>In comparison to the simple origin story presented in volume one, this movie provides a much deeper, fleshed out study of the characters and is built around them and their relationships. I really appreciate this focus and feel it definitely benefited this movie. I also really like how every line of dialogue in this movie means something and has some effect to the story. This was a really clever way to approach it and made for some really powerful and even hilarious moments. Combine this amazing change in focus with the incredible ending, and you probably have one of the best, if not the best, MCU plots we've had. Well done Gunn.<br/><br/>My-main-strength-with-Volume-One-was-the-incredible-cast-and-that echoes-all-the-way-through-to-this-movie. Chris Pratt is amazing as Peter Quill and the exploration of his character in this movie is excellent. That said, I think that a greater focus should be applied to other characters because I don't want this franchise to turn into 'Starlord: The Movie' over 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Both Zoe Saldana and Karren Gillen were great as Gamora and Nebula respectively and I really loved the relationship between the two. It's rare that movies can have a genuinely heartbreaking and emotional relationship between two characters that's carried in blood not in attraction. Vin Disel is Groot. Baby Groot is one of the most adorable things in the known universe and do Disney play on this? You bet they do but any excuse to look at the little guy is as good reason as any. Also, rebel Groot. Stay through the credits just to see Rebel Groot. Dave Bautista is also pretty good as Drax and steals a lot of the scenes he's in. Granted he doesn't receive much focus but I think they've expended all the ways they can use his character anymore and that is actually kind of sad. Bradley Cooper is great as Rocket but I feel like he was wrongfully pushed aside in this movie. There is one scene involving him and Yondu(Michael Rooker) in this movie that I thought was beautiful and poetic. Speaking of Yondu and Michael Rooker, Rooker did a phenomenal job as Yondu and gave probably the best performance in the entire film. This movie made Yondu one of the best characters in MCU cannon and I think it's incredible how they did that. Kurt Russell was also pretty decent as Ego and I genuinely bought his relationship to one of the Guardians. This movie had TWO sets of villains. One set was a very weak punchline that served nothing to the plot and existed for the sake of existing. The other set was very enthralling and intriguing for the former half of the movie but loses credibility and enjoyment value as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, this movie is gorgeous. I don't mean that lightly either. This movie is so artistically appealing and visually stunning that I admire Gunn and Henry Braham for the beautiful movie they've produced. It really takes you back to the visual wonder and amazement of watching something like 'Jurassic Park' for the first time. Both movies are completely different, mind you, but the sense of awe and wonder you feel in this movie, and incredible attention to detail reminds me of my first viewing of that movie. Top the cinematography off with amazing visual effects(courtesy of half of China) and flawless costume/set design, and you have one technically astounding movie. <br/><br/>The drama in this movie is also surprisingly well handled and I really bought the character conflict throughout. The laugh-to-cringe ratio was around 50/50, which isn't bad to be fair but they do hover around some jokes for WAY too long and this really reduces their meaning and humour value. As stated before, the action in this movie is really messy, except for one sequence towards the middle. <br/><br/>The pacing for this movie was also WAY off and didn't work in the slightest. While the music was fine, it didn't hold a candle to Volume One and was no where near as good.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I do recommend you see this movie and I would rate it a solid 8 out of 10. I can see some die hard fans of Volume One having issues with it but realistically the new focus of attention definitely benefited the movie and helped garner my interest back into a Marvel team I neither liked too much or cared about. Congrats Gunn, you've earned it.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Guardians of the Galaxy 2 fascinated me, not just for the swashbuckling adventures, stunning visuals, special effects, goofy, campy humor and wonderful retro 70s soundtrack, but for the story. I don't know if it was intentional, but the writers plumbed the darkest depths of ancient esoteric Christian theology.<br/><br/>Maybe the most controversial doctrine held by the Gnostics, and what Jesus was most likely executed for saying out loud, was that the ""God"" described in the Old and New testaments was not a ""real"" god. He was a ""fractured"" deity, a small fragment of the true omnipotent God who came to believe He was the ""one true God.""<br/><br/>But the demigod was deluded. He was an anomaly, a mistake, not a full-on deity. But still, this deity didn't know He was a mistake. He sincerely held the belief that He was the only All-Powerful, Omnipotent Deity (""Ego""). He suffered delusions of grandeur, was a bit manic-depressive. He was more ego than deity, supremely flawed. He was cruel, petty, jealous. He required constant adoration, sacrifices, ""beliefs"", gestures, rituals and obeisance from his helpless subjects in order to continually feed his Ego.<br/><br/>His creation was as fundamentally flawed as he was, rife with pain and suffering, a reflection of Him, a supreme blunder. Gnostics believed that the abject, deep-seated cruelty of Nature itself ‚Äì where animals kill and eat each other to survive ‚Äì was proof of that. The out-of-control demigod's ego polluted the Earth (as ""Ego's"" unholy mass tried to cover Earth in the movie). This was manifested in nature's rampant cruelty and Man's own ignorance, cruelty, greed and power lust ‚Äì Man who was ""made in His image ...""<br/><br/>Gnostics believed the only way to escape this flawed universe, the only way to disembark from the Wheel of Suffering (or Wheel of Life,) was through several reincarnated lifetimes of meditation, right living and selfless service to others (""right living and selfless service"" perfectly describe The Guardians).<br/><br/>I don't believe the writers were trying to promote any particular belief system, I just think they are really, really well-read, and they dug deep for inspiration. They are to be commended for that. These are some pretty deep thoughts for a superhero movie, and I was sincerely impressed and delighted with every single aspect of the movie -- writing, casting, acting, special effects, settings, costumes, sound track. A new classic."

","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is a vivid illustration of the deplorable state of the genre of entertaining cinema. In addition to an impressive visual series, which is not so easy to surprise the viewer, looking at the budget of the picture, the film has absolutely nothing to offer. The absolute inner emptiness and senselessness of what is happening on the screen are felt.<br/><br/>The main problem of the film is a primitive and boring script, and as a result, after watching 2/3 of the film you can not find the main storyline and determine what is the main intrigue of the film. In addition, the film is not perceived as a single whole, rather as a collection of shorts with beloved characters from first great film.<br/><br/>The main characters, like pathetic little parody of themselves on the original film, everything they do is predictable, the jokes are primitive, and the louder the characters laugh, the sadder the situation with humor.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I would like to note the beginning and the ending of the film, as well as an excellent soundtrack, but the excessive length of the film, far-fetched drama and the desire of the filmmakers to please the largest possible audience, negatively affects the final result."
"ironhorse_iv","8","3","7","8 May 2017"," This Intergalactic Superhero Movie was Marvelous. What a blast!
","'Guardians of the Galaxy' was once known, as one of the least recognized Marvel comic books of all time, even with 2008 reboot by writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. However, that all change in 2014, when director James Gunn create a cosmic masterpiece of a film, loosely based on this offbeat source. Nobody saw it, coming. It was like, 'Star Wars' for a new generation. A peculiar small popcorn flick that somehow became a successful, because how fun, it was to watch. It really did eclipses everything around it, at the time, even strong Marvel movies like 'the Avengers"" series. It was a blockbuster hit that was mostly universally loved. So, it was no surprised to anybody, that a sequel was quickly greenlight, and put out in production. You don't need to see space to know, a shining star. Just like the original movie, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' shines just as bright. It's equally as fun, as the first movie. Yet, unlike the first movie, this film does suffer from some long pacing issues. I found the movie to be, a bit slow at times. Mostly, toward the beginning of the film, where the story had to brand off, into multiply subplots for each character of the Guardians team. Don't get me wrong, I did like, seeing them, having something to do, while, Star-Lord AKA Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) learn more about his true parentage from Ego, the living planet (Kurt Russell) as we learn, more about them. However, I just felt, that the film could had speed it, up a bit. After all, did we really need long-drawn out scenes with Gamora (Zoe Saldana) dealing with family problems with Nebula (Karen Gillen) or Rocket (Voiced by Bradley Cooper) teaming up with Yondu (Michael Rooker) to take on, below-average, traitor, Taserface (Chris Sullivan). Couldn't these two problems, be solved, a lot quicker, than the 136 runtime. I get that, family is a big theme in this movie and serves as its unifying plot thread, but all these individual character arches needed to be better balanced. It doesn't help that the movie kinda waste time on jokes that somewhat fall flat for me. A good example is, most of the scenes with Baby Groot (Voiced by Vin Diesel). Yes, he's adorable, but do we really need to see him, dance around in a fight scene for so long. I didn't find it, as funny as I should had. If anything, it just slow the movie, down for me. Honestly, if there was one character that really makes this film, enjoyable to watch. It has to be Drax (Dave Bautista). Most of the jokes with him hit my funny bone, because how quick, they landed. It wasn't drawn out like the ones with Groot or Rocket. It was rapid and on the point. While, the movie is not as funny as the original, at least, the antagonist in this movie is a huge improvement from the last one. Without spoiling too much, he wasn't as one-note evil, as the others Marvel villains. He does seem, a little better-rounded; than the others, however, it does feel, a bit odd, that he would reveal Peter Quill's mother death, seeing how he's secretly trying to work with him. That was a bit, out of the blue. The same, can be said with Yondu suddenly becoming more of a father-figure to Peter, than the first movie. That was weird that he was willing to help Peter, seeing how he was trying to kill him in the previous movie. Still, I did like how the film, had more stakes in its climatic action, than the last film. Seeing important Marvel characters die in the battle really does add to the intensity & emotional impact of the action scenes. I love how Gunn isn't afraid to have this adventure cost the lives of some of his characters. That being said, it does kinda ruins the oncoming 'Infinity War' movies, seeing how a small group of people can kill a God. How can a normal villain like Thanos (Josh Brolin), do any better? Another thing, the battle was still a bit too massive and incomprehensible for a realistic action set-piece. Parts of it, was a bit over the top like the leap through space and time. However, the visuals were still impressive. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is as beautiful to look at as the first movie, with its bright, almost 1970s's style psychedelic aesthetic. Yet, the movie doesn't have the same amount of awesome with its soundtrack as the predecessor. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have some good songs, but it was just not as impactful. Some of the tunes, really didn't fit with the scenes, its sync with. The same can be said with its cameos. I really have no clue, why the movie would introduce the original members of the comic's 1969's incarnation of the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' by Arnold Drake and Gene Colan without establishing their history, first. It's a hard sell for a spin-off film. Nevertheless, I dig the Stan Lee cameo, toward the end. That was nice. Also, if anybody was looking forward to any ""Avengers: Infinity War' teaser in the end credit. They would quickly be disappointed. None of the mid- and post-credit scenes doesn't shows that. Overall: With all that say, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' doesn't really need to tie with any of the other MCU films. It pretty much works as its standalone sequel with everybody, old & new playing their part, well, even if some actors voices is a little bit jarring, like Michael Rooker. For the most part, it delivers on the things you love about the first movie, and improve on it. I highly recommended seeing this movie."
"Robert_duder","7","3","7","7 May 2017"," As good as the first, I suppose it's just not my cup of tea
","The Marvel Universe on the whole has been great for me. I don't quite get the insane popularity of some of those films (AntMan for instance?) and I expected to really like the first Guardians film. I would never say the first film and this one were not ""good"" because they have incredible special effect, good performances, good laughs and people love it. Good! But for me, for some reason, the film doesn't resonate with me. It has all the things I love about a good popcorn flick but it just ends up being okay with me and this one was the same as the first. I think it was easily as good as the first and expanded the Universe a little bit and the characters. I loved the Howard The Duck cameo, I LOVED my hero and idol Sylvester Stallone showing up, there were some good laughs....but I see reviewers and even friends saying they cried multiple times and how emotional it was....I didn't get any of them. It was a CGI studded event with Science Fiction roots all through it but it didn't break any grand moulds and no one will say it reshaped the Marvel Universe like Doctor Strange did. It was fun and that's about it. It is an easy watch and good music like the first but what about this movie makes it so unique from any other film in it's genre.<br/><br/>Hollywood's latest superstar Chris Pratt might be part of the reason the film doesn't floor me. I like Pratt but I'm not sold on him as a superstar. He doesn't have the chemistry yet that (say Stallone had 20 years ago) or Dwayne Johnson nowadays. He plays this role well and this definitely builds more for his character and the Peter Quill story but he gives just a good performance in a good movie. Bradley Cooper as Rocket might be my favourite Guardian character but he is actually underused this time around. He has a few good lines and the banter between he and Pratt is good but I feel like he needs more story. Dave Bautista continues to surprise me as a half decent actor and he really nails the role of Drax. He is definitely the most lively character and also gets a ton of comedic moments and also some great action scenes. Zoe Saldana is decent but much like Rocket Raccoon, got downplayed significantly this time around. The romance between her and Quill is hinted at (which is part of the gag) but I think they should have added a touch more to it. I believe I said this in the first movie but why in the hell Vin Diesel was hired and is credited for being Groot makes no sense. I love Groot. He's adorable and funny but he is a 110% CGI character with an indiscernible voice so why do we need a Hollywood star playing him? Michael Rooker returns to get a huge character development as Yondu. It's a great twist to the story and he and Pratt are good together but I'm not sure the development makes a lot of sense given how quickly he makes a change. Still it definitely adds the emotional depth to the film. Karen Gillan is really amazing as Gamora's sister Nebula. She doesn't get enough screen time but her sub-plot was one of the best and I hope to see more of her in the future. And then we have Kurt Russell who is phenomenal in his role as Peter's long lost father. ***SPOILER ALERT*** he is also the villain, the big bad etc. and he is perfect at that. I'm so glad he's been getting a career boost as of late.<br/><br/>James Gunn is probably the only person who can helm this franchise. He cares about it, he co-writes it, produces, directs and he wants to build the Guardians Universe and keep it cohesive and bravo to him for that. I am quite certain that the continuity and feel of this movie was as good as the first because of him. I think once he steps away from the helm of this franchise it won't be nearly as good especially for me who just thinks it's okay to begin with. I know he is crafting a story here and I will gladly see the third and not just because I see all Marvel films. This isn't one of my favourites but it's not because it isn't good. I am in a very very small minority who think Guardians of The Galaxy and Volume 2 were okay and average in every way. Check out the amazing visuals and stay for the characters and story and chances are you'll be as hooked as everyone else. Considering this an anomaly for me."
"Zak-20","5","3","7","7 May 2017"," Very little of the charm of the first
","What was sweet and fresh in the first volume is now saccharine, and self-indulgent. A few subvocal chuckle-worth scenes and sly references that only the older among us will get. Special effects were so over the top and the heroes so clearly indestructible that they failed to impress, thrill any more than a first person shooter video game. It did not have to be this way but I am sure that like me the audiences were disappointed, if mildly entertained."
"oneoff2","Null","3","7","7 May 2017"," Save your money
","The first G of G was creative and fun. It was well written and witty. This sequel is simply awful and pathetically written. Violence, torture, extremely derogatory personal remarks without any point to it. It treats the audience as if they are all idiots. The ""heros"", though still mischievous, are no longer charming, witty or funny and lack empathy. They are SAD, as a certain elected leader would say. A tweet would have sufficed instead of subjecting us to this garbage. To be fair, a whole group of us walked out at the 90 minute mark. We did not bring our kids, and I felt terrible for the other preteen kids and their parents that we left behind."

Whole storyline is boring without any real bad-ass ... Iam disgusted how somebody could ruin the whole idea that was so perfectly stared in first episode. This movie is not worth your cash. If you liked first episode storyline, action and perfect jokes you will be very disappointed from this movie."

"davideo-2","7","3","7","4 May 2017"," Epic, flashy sequel that is still not quite as good as the first one
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>This sequel to 2014's monster comic book fantasy hit Guardians of the Galaxy delves further into the back story of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), the young boy abducted from Earth by Yondu (Michael Rooker) after his mother succumbed to cancer. Here, he is re-united with his father (Kurt Russell) who disappeared from his life and became the inter-galactic warrior Ego, who inhabits his own corner of the universe. His son, meanwhile, continues to be known as Star-Lord and, as he and his ragtag misfit friends, including Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket the Racoon and Baby Groot go about their missions, they uncover a sinister truth that could tear them all apart.<br/><br/>The big screen comic book craze is certainly not one that's showing any signs of dying down, but of the last few years, none has quite sent it into such a spin as James Gunn's 2014 blockbuster GOTG. This sequel was practically a cat in the bag in terms of being made, and the fans of the last one have certainly been waiting for it (as the packed theatre I was in would attest to. ) It pretty much repeats the formula of the last one to wise effect, and with Gunn back at the helm, hopes were really as great as they can be. What it does try and do is do it all on a bigger, grander scale and while this is visually impressive and aesthetically stimulating, somehow it's all a bit too much and just not quite as good as the last one.<br/><br/>The 80's throwback vibe is on higher alert, with David Hasselhoff frequently referenced (and even making a brief cameo!) as the image presented of Quill's father, on account of him being a big Knight Rider fan, whilst even Howard the Duck himself no-less appears in one segment. This is often used to enhance the humour, which it does, though it even creeps up uneasily during darker moments of the film, such as when Peter learns the truth behind his mother's death. The big theme here is exploring the back stories of each of the characters, and what springs off this is a load of subplots, that are interesting but don't have a massive connection to each other, and so what we do have is a long, slightly incoherent film.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, though, it does faithfully stick to the formula from last time, with some hilariously funny moments, and a soundtrack listing that is actually better than the last one (including a wonderful opening involving a shoot-out to the tune of ELO's marvellous Mr. Blue Sky.) It is a visual splendour to watch, too, that even Mr Sylvester Stallone seemed to want to get on board with. ***"
"tymbus","5","3","7","4 May 2017"," Just can't stop the music, but you'll wish that you could
","The Guardian's of the Glaxy is a film so in love with its own cuteness that it forgets that the audience might want something more than laughing along with a CGI tree stump dancing across the Guardian's opening battle with a big pink monster. <br/><br/>I welcomed the first movie as new space opera to stand along the Star Wars and star Trek universes but the focus of Vol2 is on character relationships and another Hollywood take on men with Daddy issues. Chris Platt's Star-lord is troubled because he never knew his father, who exists in his memory as a David Hasslehoff look-a-likee. These feelings of loss run so deep that they are given one line of dialogue in which they are established. <br/><br/>Cue the arrival of Kurt Russel as 'Ego' Star-Lord's biological dad. Comic book fans will recognize the name from 'Thor' where Ego, as here, is a living planet no less and one of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's cosmic 'God figures'. Needless to say, the family reunion doesn't go as planned. <br/><br/>I desperately needed to take a leak after scoffing a large piece of coffee cake (oh the joys of diabetes) and chose the films climactic battle to leave the room. I didn't feel I missed much. By then, the film had undercut any involvement by relentlessly using bathetic humour to undermine almost every scene. <br/><br/>The script feels afraid that the audience will lose interest in the film if it isn't laughing at itself. This becomes a weird self-fulfilling prophecy. Post the God versus Guardians punch up, we are suddenly asked to engage with the profound revelation that it doesn't matter who your biological dad is, your real father is the man who brought you up (in this case Yondu, the blue finned gang boss who took a paternal if not exactly unselfish interest in Star-Lord and taught him in the ways of ravaging). Now, I am adopted and have met my birth father so I should have been moved by this. I wasn't. Because it was too much to ask me to engage in any depth with characters who had only been taken seriously as straight guys setting up quips, put downs and jokes. <br/><br/>The sister-act between Gamorah and her angry sibling Nebula would fare better than the Peter Quill/Ego conflict because at least the two women are treated seriously. However, audiences forgive me, I couldn't remember who the heck Nebula was or what role she played in the last movie. A quick scan of Nebula's comic book history reveals that I have managed to miss her appearances in the comics. That at least explains why my mind kept confusing her name with Nebulon, 'the celestial man' (sic) another cosmic character. Except that, stop the boat, the film may play with this confusion too because the star beast the Guardian's fight at Vol 2's opening looks a bit like the non-human form of Nebulon √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú go image search it.<br/><br/>The wider conflict is between a race of haughty golden people called the Sovereign race who are first helped then scammed by The Guardians √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú well by Rocket Racoon actually, who takes offense at their upper crust ways and snobbish attitude. Cue a space battle played out as an arcade game, a joke that wears thin even as it is being told, but in case you missed the gag the film tells it again.<br/><br/>But never mind the plot what about the music? A consideration deemed so important to the film that Marvel's plot outline here promotes it to the first line of its synopsis. Sure, this collection of big, bold but ultimately banal songs helps while away the time and helped me forget the film is only ever moments away from slipping to just the wrong side of terrible (THAT terrible side being the god awful Star Trek V (pun intended). But this is no Tarantino movie sound track. In his films, the music sets up all sorts of frissons. Here, the pop tunes just make the ride pass easier exactly like a tape mix in a car's cassette player (does anyone remember Eight Track?).<br/><br/>If, after the next Avengers movie, there is a Guardians Vol 3 I can only hope that it takes time to developing its wider fictional universe and has the courage to take that universe a little more seriously- by that I mean respectfully. One of the five in-credit sequences reveals a cocoon containing Adam Warlock, one of my all- time favorite characters, and I want a better world for him to be born into."

","""Sometimes, the thing you've been looking for your whole life, is right there beside you all along."" Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) <br/><br/>Although a clich√É¬© like that shouldn't be allowed on any screen or stage, in the hands of filmmakers responsible for the amusing and sometimes serious Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, it makes a sweet leitmotif that serves the large family-searching theme.<br/><br/>Yes, this comic sci-fi is not Shakespeare or Sophocles, but it does allow classic motifs to be enclosed in wise-cracking and explosions as the Guardians return from a rousing first volume to keep the noise high along with the humanity of earth '70's√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthe opening sequence featuring the pop tune Brandy (You're a Fine Girl) ushers in a sound track full of blasts from that turbulent time.<br/><br/>Central to the serious side, Peter is faced with the father he never met, appropriately named Ego, played ever so craftily and cavalierly by the durable Kurt Russell. You say you've already gone through daddy issues in summer movies, and you'd be right. However only the 1977 Star Wars with Luke, Han, and Darth is a bit ahead of the light and dark in this version.<br/><br/>After all, James Earl Jones is all voice while Kurt Russell is all boy- man: complicated, evil, and lovable at the same time. When Peter and he face off, I actually felt the tension every man-child in the audience remembers about his dad. In true Greek tragic form, the sisters are not left out either: Gamora (Zoe Saldana) struggles with her bad-girl sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan). No, it's not classical drama, but it is at least a worthy sequel to a version of the first Guardians at which even Aristophanes would chuckle.<br/><br/>Praise goes to director/writer James Gunn. Who spreads the love among the characters, most of whom are searching for identity or a respected reputation among a family of crew members prone to insult each other as social sport.<br/><br/>Captain Peter does double emotional duty between his father and his unspoken love, Gamora. Fortunately Pratt, Having played the mediocre hero of the latest Jurassic Park, is low key enough an actor to do no serious damage to the demands of heavy-duty plotting, and Russell, well, is a pro at mixing the ridiculous with the sublime.<br/><br/>But, hey, this is the beginning of summer blockbusters, where classical dramatic tropes are not usually on the menu. What is so delectable, however, is the constant rattle of ironic lines like, ""You killed my mom! And squished my Walkman!"" (Peter) That's the sound of summer fun."

","Having really enjoyed the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy', which was not quite as good as the hype but still very good, expectations were high for the sequel while being a little worried as to whether it would be as good or disgrace the first.<br/><br/>The good news is that 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' does not disgrace the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and is actually just as good. Like as was said with 'Guardians of the Galaxy', is it as amazing as the IMDb rating (which is something that really shouldn't be taken to heart and is often blown out of proportion here on IMDb) and ecstatic reviews suggest? To me, not quite. Is 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' well made and entertaining? Absolutely.<br/><br/>A couple of the gags fall a little flat and the film does drag in the middle act. That's pretty much it for the complaints however.<br/><br/>'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2', reiterating what was said in my review for the first film due to having the same strengths, boasts spectacular special effects, gorgeously psychedelic colours, slick-yet-with-enough-visual-depth cinematography (nothing cartoonish or plastic here) and very colourful and atmospheric sets that more than effectively makes one think they are immersed in this galaxy. Costumes and make-up are also of very good quality. The soundtrack and score is rousing and touchingly nostalgic, really making the toes tap. The action is beautifully edited, choreographed with lots of entertainment value and thrills and is at best exhilarating, there's plenty of it without feeling too much.<br/><br/>James Gunn directs with style and a sure hand, always seeming as if he knew what tone he was going for and who he was aiming at. Both 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films are far and above anything else he's done and his best overall direction are in them as well. Personally really enjoyed the way that 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' was written too, most of the jokes are enormously entertaining and the film also has heart.<br/><br/>The story is mostly energetic and compelling, let down only by some of the middle act. At least however it doesn't have as many random misplaced moments and over sentimentality, even if it's not exactly original (not that that is a desperately bad thing).<br/><br/>Characters are on the most part incredibly colourful and engaging, with a great chemistry throughout. Peter is a likable lead character, but it's adorable and hilarious Baby Groot, scene-stealing Rocket and touchingly conflicted Yondu steal the show.<br/><br/>Once again, like in the first film, Chris Pratt is highly charismatic, Zoe Saldana is suitably fiery, Karen Gillan is imposingly formidable, Dave Bautista induces lots of laughs and charm while showing a very intensely played vengeful side and a surprisingly well-cast Vin Diesel does a great job as Baby Groot. Bradley Cooper stands out, being a sheer delight as Rocket. Kurt Russell is an enigmatic presence and Michael Rooker is quite touching as Yondu.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a lot of fun and very well made, every bit as good as the first, a few flat jokes and draggy middle aside. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"ILikeMoviesOkay","6","4","11","11 May 2017"," Twice The Jokes, Half The Charm
","The Marvel universe isn't great for its sequels. After the fantastic 'Iron Man', we got the atrocious 'Iron Man 2', a film so forgettable I can't even remember what happens in it. After the Blockbuster Extravaganza 'Avengers Assemble', we got the seriously underwhelming 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', a film even the director was disappointed with. And finally, after the decent 'Thor', we got the unspeakable 'Thor: The Dark World' which I think is one of the most boring comic book movies in years. So yeah, the track record isn't great, but I was still excited for 'Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 2'. I remembered really enjoying the first one, due to its likable characters, its kick-ass soundtrack, and really fun, well written story. The only issues that I had was its rubbish villain (Try to remember his name, you probably can't he was so forgettable) and some nonsensical scenes that felt too far-fetched even for Marvel. So what did I think of Guardians 2? Was it as good as the original?<br/><br/>The story follows our rag-tag crew from the first film, in the middle of a job securing expensive batteries for a race of gold people. Eventually Star Lord (Chris Pratt) meets someone important to him, and he spends some time with this person. What we witness is a completely bland, forgettable, mostly unfunny mess of epic proportions. Yes the sequel curse strikes again, and it's a doozey. The story feels rushed, there's hardly any character development both old and new characters. Another issue with the story is the over abundance of pointless plot points that go nowhere. It almost feels like Disney was breathing down Writer-Director James Gunn's neck forcing him to put in pointless scenes and characters just to set up future films. The situation feels very similar to what Sony did with 'The Amazing Spiderman 2', being trying to set up future films so much in this one, they forget to create a coherent story for this film itself. The movie also believes that by doubling the jokes for this film, it automatically makes it funnier, whereas what it actually does it makes it seriously incoherent in humour. Some jokes do land, making you laugh and smile, others just let off an awkward silence that just makes you cringe in your seat. This happened much more often than I expected. <br/><br/>Acting is also a mixed bag in this film. Chris Pratt is ever likable as Peter Quill/Star-Lord, being both funny and also charismatic in his performance. He is also great in some of the films more dramatic scenes. Zoe Saldana is also great as the rather stubborn Gamora, being great in many of the films action scenes. Dave Bautista was fantastic as Drax, being definitely the funniest part of the entire film. But the best performance by far was Kurt Russell as Ego, but this is due to him being a fantastic veteran actor who could make any role just mesmerising to watch. The only people i had issues with was Bradley Cooper as Rocket, who to me felt rather one note in this film, and also Karen Gillan as Nebula, whose only emotion was grinding her teeth in anger, after a while it just got old. <br/><br/>Visually the film is a CGI Extravaganza. Bright colours fly everywhere, and a lot of it is stunning to behold. There are some moments that look clearly fake, and drag you out of the experience, but most of it is definitely solid. Cinematography wise its rather standard, it's nice to not see much shaky cam within the action scenes. You can clearly see everything that is going on, and these sections are really well directed. But the best thing by far is the Soundtrack, its outstanding. Songs by Fleetwood Mac and Cat Stevens are used perfectly, and many others (Which I won't spoil) just slot into the scenes effortlessly. This is definitely a soundtrack to pick up. <br/><br/>It's just a shame that the film is a serious mess. There is some enjoyment to have. The action is fast paced and wonderfully directed, there are a few very funny moments, and many of the dramatic scenes are well done. The issues with the film though are serious, the story often feels non-existent, many of the jokes fall flat and plot points feel forced in. To me, it feels seriously rushed, and maybe needed another year to fix its seriously weak script.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm seriously disappointed with the film. It lacks a lot of the charm that the first film had, and thinks that a funnier film is an abundance of jokes. It's definitely not. Not the worst Marvel film, but it is a misstep."

","Our team now work as mercenaries. Now, they run afoul of the Sovereign, the Ravagers come into an unexpected circumstance, and everyone's relatives show back up... well, the ones that are still breathing. What? Everybody's got dead people! So the big theme is family. Because Vin can't keep that out of his franchises. Siblings, even if not by blood. Father *figures* if not biological ones. And it's explored incredibly well. It does grind the story to a halt.<br/><br/>By and large, this recreates, does twists on, and always increases in scope, what everyone loved in volume one. And most of the time, it's enjoyable. It does feel like it was written specifically to ensure it does well, where last time, it came out of the blue. The size is immense. At times, the amount of CGI on-screen is almost excessive. The smaller, personal scenes ensure it doesn't reach sensory overload. Fights get vast, and yet we can follow it. Heck, there are times where, intentionally, the action itself is literally off-screen, while we're watching something amusing or even ""boring"". The 3D is some of the best I've ever seen. There being so many jokes in this does end up slightly excessive, even forced, and there's too much low-brow stuff(and that's coming from someone who in general digs that kind of material).<br/><br/>There is a lot of content in this that is disturbing and/or violent. I recommend this to anyone who liked the original. And if you loved it, I will do more, I will implore you: you *have* to watch this one, too. 8/10"

It reminded me low level jokes like seen in recent Baywatch movie or other Zack Effron's nasty ones. This kind seems to be the new standard now?

","One reviewer said they went 180 degrees on this one, and I agree...<br/><br/>While the first installment was literally a big screen comic book, with lots of action and very little story line, Volume 2 showed Guardians with a soul, plain and simple. There was still a fair amount of over the top action, but now we also see the characters for who they are as well, frail humans and aliens (and Racoon and Baby Tree), with fears and real feelings. So, I really do understand all the negative comments...I wouldn't expect die hard comic book fans to feel any other way. But I fall into another category, one that expects a movie to first and foremost entertain me with a story...which this one does...<br/><br/>Sure, it is much slower moving than the original, and that is certainly a shock. But it redeems itself by showing the characters to be something more than comic book heroes...and for that consideration I gave it a solid 8...so there !!"

"svorva","5","2","4","24 May 2017"," Now With 100% Less Hooked on a Feeling
","Hooked on a Feeling was a modest 60's love song performed by forgotten pop star B.J. Thomas. A simple love song, I mostly enjoy it for the electric sitar intro. No, this is not the tune that resurged during the summer of '14. You're thinking of Blue Swede's cover, a track whose abrasiveness can only be matched by the band's pun name. Unoriginal kitsch. Even the (questionably racist) ooga-chakas were hijacked from an earlier cover. I loathe this song, the anthem of the first Guardians of the Galaxy. So naturally I enjoyed Vol. 2 more.<br/><br/>Three years ago I walked out of a theater befuddled. I enjoy space adventures. Guardians had both worthwhile characters and a few good laughs. Yet, I remember feeling largely unsatisfied. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 offers a bit of clarity. The introductions and backstory are all out of the way, now we can finally have a couple hours of quality time. This is a welcome change. My revelation is that it is not the plot or the middling protagonists that carry Guardians, but the side characters with their (literally) colorful world and humor.<br/><br/>Plot. Star Lord Quill (Pratt) and his band of misfits are back, albeit their tree is one tenth the size but thrice as cute. The Guardians get a gig with the imprisoned blue sister villain (name forgotten) as a reward. However, Rocket botches the mission by pilfering the cosmic batteries they were supposed to protect, only to be saved by a mysterious man with unbelievable power. This is the subtly named celestial Ego (Russel), Peter Quill's father and Yondu's (Rooker) original employer. Ego invites Quill and his friends to join him on his utopia planet where he hopes to have some bonding time with his son. Half the crew remains behind to fix the ship, blue sister escapes then rampages, and a mournful Yondu is ousted in a mutiny. Basically hijinks that I won't spoil for your ensue leading up to a final confrontation on Ego's paradise. There is a secret and a purpose beneath the surface of this beautiful lifeless planet. So dark that Ego's servant Mantis (Klementeiff) is reluctant to share. The Guardians will have to save the world a second time and I guess learn a lesson about family.<br/><br/>Guardians Vol. 2 evoked in me, an almost Zen reaction. As the movie winded down after the final climax I almost wondered if I had missed an act. Lights on, curtain down, power up the cellphone, lo and behold I had just watched a two hour fifteen minute film. Nothing really happens, nothing was unfinished, and I was never bored. Not your typical blockbuster fare. The story is just a device, not why you're watching the film.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt is the new age Hollywoodified anti-hero, he is supposed to be cool because he transcends cool. His character never has the right words and can only expresses himself through dated pop culture references in a universe where no one could possibly understand. Although endearing, Pete Quill should not be a captain of ship nor a movie, fortunately in Vol 2. he has a crew with which he can share responsibilities. Rumors of Gamora (Saldana) having personality or appearing in this film have been grossly exaggerated, but Drax (Bautista), Groot (Diesel), Rocket (Cooper), and Yondu are the side character lesser films dream of. They each have carved out their own comedic space. Their lines and shenanigans are uniquely identifiable. I did not care for a moment what was going on in Vol. 2, but I did care about who it was happening too.<br/><br/>Half the footage in this film is inessential. That is not a criticism from me, but I am sure some will disagree. If you enjoy the inconsequential and the associated comedy you are going to enjoy Vol 2. Humor is arguably the most subjective element in film, but I cannot imagine anyone enjoy the original and hating the sequel. One unfortunate side note. I am not interested in political correctness, but Mantis is a caricature of a racist stereotype. I am not saying I was offended and you should be too, I was just baffled I was seeing this in 2017. Even more astonishing was I had trouble finding any similar reactions. Maybe I am out of touch, but if this is tolerable social media warriors need to go out and fight the real enemy. Still, I can forgive this oversight. I have never seen an episode of Star Trek, but Vol 2 is what I imagine, just grander. Almost campy, with its multicolored humanoids and pop rock, but forever lovable because of the charming crew."
"pokedom","7","2","4","21 May 2017"," Not as good as the original, but still very fun
","It's next to impossible to make a better film than the original Guardians of the Galaxy. You have start with no expectations going in, and when you do get sucked into the world, you end up loving the characters and laughing at every line. Everything comes together perfectly to make an incredibly fun movie, and one of my personal favorite films of all time. So naturally I, along with many others I'm sure, was excited for the eventual sequel. Watching it... it's good, but not better than the original.<br/><br/>The characters are still hilarious (save for maybe Baby Groot... we'll talk about him later). The action is still super fun to watch (save for the first scene... again, later). And the soundtrack is debate-ably better than the original. Debate-ably. Personally I prefer the original, as I still have some of those songs stuck in my head to this day. When new characters are added, such as Peter (Chris Pratt, one of the best actors ever)'s dad (played by Kurt Russell) and Mantis (I'M UGLY AND I'M PROUD!), they have great chemistry with the main cast. More backstory is given to Peter, as well as reasons why Nebula is mostly machine and bad makeup... sorry, it's more obvious the more you look at it. The best part of all of this new stuff is that it doesn't fall flat on it's face and continues to make sense in terms of lore and faithfulness to the comic book.<br/><br/>Speaking of new characters, we got about 5. Mantis (please make a meme with her face over Spongebob going ""I'm ugly and I'm proud!"" and Drax being Patrick), Ego (the obvious bad-guy), Sylvester Stallone (he has a name but I just refer to him as Sylvester Stallone) as the Leader of the Ravagers, a new friend of Yondu's, and Baby Groot. I hate Baby Groot and the opening scene. Everyone else is great. So for Baby Groot they tried the whole ""cute character"" stick and suddenly I lost a lot of respect for the character that was given two extra words to show incredible character development. The opening scene is that of the Guardians of the Galaxy fighting a rainbow-fire-breathing space kracken. You know, the one that was in the majority of trailers? Well screw you! Let's show a spinning shot of Baby Groot dancing to some admittedly good music! It ruins the scene that was built up in every trailer. Do you want to see the most amazing thing ever? The one thing we're sure you walked into the theater to see? Screw you! Here's a 2 inch tall tree dancing! Why would you ruin that? Every other action scene is classic Guardians fun however, so I can forgive it somewhat. Like that one scene with Yondu and Rocket shooting/magic-arrowing up the Ravager base, that practically made up for all of it.<br/><br/>Ego turns out to be the obvious bad-guy, and we get to another weird thing about this film; it's surprisingly adult. And not in themes, I mean there's a lot of adult humor and somewhat disturbing imagery. Hundreds of skeletons of children, weird sexual humor, Ego without skin and muscle... weird sexual humor... Earth getting blobbed... weird sexual humor... There's a lot of sexual humor in this one. It's weird because the first one didn't have any. At least, none that I can remember.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good film. It was never going to top the original, but that's totally fine, because the first one is something special. I'll definitely continue to rewatch not only that film, but when this one eventually comes out on Starz, I'll certainly rewatch this. Go watch it and see for yourself."

","GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOLUME 2<br/><br/>STATISTICS (*NO SPOILERS*) ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2"" is a 2017 superhero film directed and written by James Gunn (""Slither""). Music is by Tyler Bates (""Super""); cinematography by Henry Braham (""Legend of Tarzan""); editing by Fred Raskin (""Django Unchained"") and Craig Wood (""Frogs""); and production by Kevin Feige (""Thor""). It primarily stars Chris Pratt (""Parks and Recreation""); Zoe Saldana (""Star Trek""); Dave Bautista (""The Man with the Iron Fists""); Vin Diesel (""Fast and Furious""); Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover""); Michael Rooker (""The Walking Dead""); Karen Gillan (""Oculus""); Pom Klementieff (""Sleepless Night""); Kurt Russell (""Silkwood""); Elizabeth Debicki (""The Great Gatsby""); Chris Sullivan (""This is Us""); Sean Gunn (""Gilmore Girls""); Sylvester Stallone (""Rocky""). Filming began February 11, 2016 in Fayette County, Georgia and ended June 16, 2016. Its budget totaled at around $200 million, and to date (May 2017) it has earned about $632.3 million. It spans a total of 2 hours, 16 minutes (136 minutes) and is grouped as PG-13. <br/><br/>PLOT SUMMARY (*NO SPOILERS*) We begin the film with the Guardians, headed by Star-Lord/Peter Quill (Pratt) and consisting of assassin/combatant Gamora (Saldana), the primary muscle and brawn Drax (Bautista), raccoon hybrid Rocket (Cooper), and an adorable yet still infant Groot (Diesel). They are on a job for the Sovereign Race, a group of no-nonsense, relatively generic yet perfect beings led by High Priestess Ayesha (Debicki). They do this in exchange for Gamora's sister Nebula (Gillan), whom the Sovereigns have captured. But Rocket, against the team's best interests, steals a collection of the batteries intended for the Guardians to retrieve. The angered Sovereigns begin to chase the Guardians, but luckily a mysterious commodity comes to their aid. The Guardians crash land on a foreign planet, where Ego, (Russell) later revealed to us as a modest celestial, rendezvous with them and reveals to Star-Lord that he is his once faceless father. Star-Lord, Gamora, and Drax agree to join Ego to his home planet, while Rocket, Groot, and Nebula repair the damaged ship. But Star Lord and his friends soon learn that Ego's planet, as well as Ego himself, are not as they appear. <br/><br/>REVIEW (*SPOILERS*) There is trash, and then there is good trash. This is good trash. It's not awe- inspiring, or thought-provoking; it's not even blatantly clever. No, this funny. It's violent and fun and entertaining. It was purely meant to kill 2 hours of your time and give you a nice ride while doing it. So let's actually discuss the film and how everything played out. First, the characters are presented with undeniable swagger. Most of the audience will have a connection and familiarity with the Guardians already, so most of the film focuses more on them, their aspirations and backstories, rather than introducing their abilities or parentage. Really, this is an expansion of the Guardians, a movie that allows you more time with them as they save the universe. Yes, some moments are admittedly stupid, yes the story can get a bit choppy. But it ultimately succeeds in its goal to be fun and entertaining. In terms of action and cinematography, this film is stunning. The arguably best scene was when Yondu (Rooker), Rocket, and Groot were escaping a Ravager Prison and Yondu showed the immense abilities of his telepathic arrow. The graphics were seamless, and I was guiltily captivated as he commanded the arrow with an angelic whistle and it whirled across the screen to his whim. <br/><br/>As for what I didn't like; I didn't think the Sovereign subplot was used to its full advantage. The beginning scene was funny, interesting, and promising. But since the Sovereigns are supposed to be the main antagonist until Ego is revealed, I felt they were under-used for the rest of the film. There was also this scene toward the climax when the Guardians, with no Quill, are discussing whether or not they should leave him behind, thereby saving themselves. Drax chimes in with a classic, ""We're family. No-one gets left behind"" speech. So yes, the moral can be a little ham-fisted. But those are my only complaints.<br/><br/>The new characters were very interesting; Nebula brought a kind of ominous seriousness to the already light hearted film. She had some moderately funny lines, but it was ultimately her identity and Karen Gillan's performance that made her stand out. Mantis was captivating and entertaining. She had little in the way of backstory or development in that way, but she was sweet. I just wish that her talents and abilities were expanded on more. I knew very little about her respective powers or how they really work. Other than that I liked Mantis. With Kurt Russell's Ego I thought the film was very self-aware that they were using a common superhero trope, so they tried and succeeded to bring something fresh. Ego was different, and he brought a versatility that the first film lacked.<br/><br/>In short, I enjoyed and recommend this film. <br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>70%<br/><br/>B-"

","We recently watched ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2"" as a class. The series continues with another strong movie, leaving no question about the universe they've created, the age gap across the moviegoer demography, and the carefully placed comedy within the interstellar drama. If you are looking for adventure, comedy, love, drama, and talking animals, the second in the GOTG series will not let you down!<br/><br/>The movie begins as the Guardians protect a set of batteries in the sovereign territories from a monster. After stealing the batteries, a series of unfortunate events cause Peter (Star-Lord) Quill, played by Chris Pratt, and the rest of the guardians to cross paths with a sentient being named Ego, played by Kurt russell, (spoilers withheld here) who takes the Guardians to a planet he has crafted with his powers. Ego ends up being an important piece of Quill's puzzle (still withholding spoilers). Throughout the adventure, comedy is provided by Drax (Dave Bautista), and Rocket (Bradley Cooper), advice and attitude by Gamora (Zoe Saldana), and overall confusion by Groot (Vin Diesel).<br/><br/>I loved the never-ending twist of action and comedy, and the way that you are always learning something new about a character, helping the story to continue to evolve. Drax being brain dead and Star-Lord's hard-headedness help to involve the viewer by presenting relatable character traits, and the space pirate equivalent to everyday personal and social issues. At times the movie seemed to drag, but it would always redeemed itself. A large underlying moral of this story is that family doesn't always mean blood, and to be careful who you trust.<br/><br/>The demographic for GOTG is unbelievable. The rating and often gore-free violence opens it up to younger viewers, adults who grew up in the 80's are attracted to the throwback style of soundtrack, and pop-culture references, and older generations who saw the Guardians emerge as a comic are drawn in by this modern version of a childhood staple. This movie is honestly excellent for everyone; never too gory or vulgar, has great underlying messages and morals, and is only rated PG-13. I give this movie 4.5/5 stars. It is a great movie overall, with no lack in entertainment and excitement."
"yvonneshusband","8","2","4","17 May 2017"," More of the same, only better!
","This particular iteration of the MCU is starting to grow on me, particularly since 'Vol 2' gave me exactly what I required from the sequel: more Nebula, more Baby Groot, funnier jokes (the toilet humour excepted) and more originality (seriously, I spot more rip-offs from other films in GOTG every time I watch it). I also like how the whole thing kind of reminds me of classic 'Star Trek', Chris Pratt being, well, Kirk; Quill's, or Pratt-Kirk's, egotism being on a par with Pine-Kirk's from reboot Trek, but most obviously when flirting with Elizabeth Debecki's Ayesha shortly after the opening credits! Meanwhile, Zoe Saldana riffs on both her role in rebooted Trek while simultaneously serving as this series' Spock character (complete with the requisite green skin),struggling to keep her emotions in check while at the same time being patronizing to her less evolved crewmates.<br/><br/>Anyway, keeping things as spoiler-free as possible, Kurt Russell makes a great Kurt Russell as he portrays Pratt-Kirk's 'celestial' father; reuniting with his earthling progeny for not particularly altruistic reasons (and his name is pretty much a spoiler hidden in plain sight). Ga-hura works out some sibling rivalry issues with her cyborg sis (and I definitely require more from Miss Gillen in the inevitable next installment) by way of a sequence clearly inspired by 'North by Northwest', Rockett steals the 'cow' joke from 'Father Ted' (as well as other more plot-significant things) and participates with Yondu in my favorite sequence in the movie, as Yondu retakes his ship in a very 'Pirates of the Caribbean' fashion. Dave Bautista earns his paycheck as Drax, with some laugh out loud dialogue to go with his impressive physical acting. Baby Groot is, well, go see for yourself but in my humble opinion he steals the show.<br/><br/>The weaknesses (IMHO) of the original are still there though; some pretty uninspired, CGI-heavy action sequences (and was Ego's manifestation of himself throughout the Universe as a blue-grey blob, reminiscent of, well, 'The Blob', really the best they could do visually to realise his plan to reshape the Universe in his own image?), the afore-mentioned toilet humour, Saldana'a woefully limited acting range (which is further exposed by pitting her against Karen Gillen) and over-reliance on shots from other (not necessarily better) movies; for example: if you've already successfully sneaked in a copy of the 'Avengers Assemble' tracking shot in your first movie, why go all-out and simply rip it off in the second?"

","(RATINGS: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ¬Ω out of 5 ) <br/><br/>GRADE: B- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Not nearly as much fun as its predecessor, this film still entertains.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: That dysfunctional band of lovable space fighters as they solve one problem only to uncover another.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: There is a scene in the new chapter of Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 which has the right flippant tone that most of the film lacks. Playing to the song of Jay and the Americans' Come A Little Bit Closer, the images of combat resonate with a stylish flair and a sense of wit. This sequence is very well choreographed and cleverly done. Would that the rest of the film have that same polish. I just couldn't get remotely close to this new entry to the Marvel series, especially when comparing it to the first marvelous 2014 Marvel movie. <br/><br/>ÔøºThis film entertains but unlike its highly enjoyable predecessor, this sequel lacks originality, inventiveness, and humor. Oh, it tries hard, but it leaves one with a feeling of bloated desperation. You really want to have that giddy feeling of joy once again, but everything this time around seems artificial and forced. <br/><br/>The jokes repeatedly fall flat, the action is formulaic, and the plot(s) are heavy-handed. Many scenes go on far too long as the movie rambles from one misadventure on one planet to the next. All that is left is the faint reminder of camaraderie served by its capable cast and their yeoman-like contributions to their likable, if underwritten, characters.<br/><br/>ÔøºFortunately for the film, the actors bring on the charm in major doses. Chris Pratt as wisecracking Peter Quill, Zoe Saldana as the tough warrior Gamora, Dave Bautista as the brutish but lovable Drax, and the fine voice-over work of Bradley Cooper as Rocket and Vin Diesel as Baby Groot reprise their misfit roles with finesse. Adding strong support are Mike Rooker, Karen Gillian, and a robust energy force in the form of Kurt Russell as Ego, Peter's long lost father.<br/><br/>ÔøºWhile James Gunn's direction is solid enough, his writing efforts are a disappointing mix. His dialogue is bereft of one-liners that zing. He tries (and mostly succeeds) adding more backstories to his characters and their dysfunctional relationships. The real problem is his script which sacrifices its more interesting sub-plots (the relationship between Peter and Gamora, Drax's new love interest, the sibling rivalry of Gamora and her sister, Rocket's rude personality issues, Baby Groot's learning curve) with the main story-line, a dull routine father- son conflict. <br/><br/>Technically, some of his visuals are poorly executed. For a big budget blockbuster, the CGI is uneven. The characters of Rocket and particularly, Baby Groot are spot-on, Yet, the production design on most planets use of matte backdrops are far from authentic looking, lacking depth and details. Especially obvious in its ineptitude is Ego's world, showcasing a garish Jeff Poons vibe.<br/><br/>ÔøºGuardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 will entertain its loyal audience, but already the franchise is losing its comic focus. This installment keeps the action moving, but it rarely catches its breath as it huffs and puffs its way to its conclusion. Well, let me re-phrase that...until its next chapter. Yes moviegoers, Vol. 3 will be coming to a theater near you very soon...let's hope that chapter breaks out of its own comfort zone as it explores the ever-changing universe."

","Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Michael Rooker, Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell star in this 2017 sci-fi sequel based on the Marvel Comics.

Saldana returns as Gamora, Bautista as Drax, Diesel as Baby Groot, Cooper as Rocket, Rooker as Yondu and Stallone (Tango & Cash) appears briefly as Commander Ogord.

","***SPOILER ALERTS - DO NOT READ UNTIL YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE! ALSO NEVER LET SOUP BOIL**** <br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy 2 Review Usually sequels are less than satisfying when the original was, and is, loved. Some notable exceptions being The Dark Knight and the Godfather 2. Nevertheless GOTG2 delivers. And it delivers like a take away meal with an unexpected and delicious side dish you didn't order and don't have to pay for. Win. I loved it. The cast again fill their roles with relish (forgive the food pun) and for me, Dave Bautista's Drax shone. Such is his timing and delivery, of an apparently completely literal character, he has become the adored poster boy for people with autism around the world. (After she gets hit) ""Mantis, watch out!"" Perhaps it works so well because, like The Dark Knight, it isn't really a sequel but more of another episode in a series you would binge watch if only they had released the next 5 (yes please!). The origins of Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) are teased out with a sophistication akin to a seduction. He is the BEST. Jesus. EVER. Kurt Russell as Ego (essentially God) is charming and disarming until one discovers his utter contempt for any life other than his own as well as Sony Walkman's. His inability to see beyond anything but his own needs transforms him from an apparently loving father (playing catch with his son) into a wonderfully dangerous Super- Villain. Like all the best Super-Villains he fully believes in his philosophies and nothing will stand in the way of his plan. Not his many dead children, not Star-Lords mother (Chris Pratt's reaction to Ego's casual admittance that he killed his mother defines, in that moment, both of them and is beautifully played out), not anyone or anything will stand in the way of his destiny. Mr Pratt again brings an uncool cool to his role. He constantly manages to show chinks in his emotional armour while somehow maintaining a sangfroid that resonates with everyone who wants to be a superhero but knows they'd be a bit sh*t at it. He gives us all hope. He doesn't get the girl but the 'unspoken thing' between Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and he, a much used, almost clich√©d, plot device, is here given a slight twist or breaking of the 4th wall. They don't actually break the 4th wall, more maybe a hair-line fracture or perhaps they make it transparent. Deadpool would work well with the GOTG if only they inhabited the same universe. We can hope that, like the world of physics, one day there will be a Grand Unified Theory and they can. This is an exceptionally funny movie but it is also very moving in parts. I laughed out loud several times and cried twice. I may have cried more than that but I admit only two because I want to be Star- lord. It's that sort of movie. You come out wanting to BE them. Any of them. Even Rocket the little Trash Panda. The father son theme continues and takes a twist as Yondu shows his true colours are opposite to the colours of EGO and his sacrifice and funeral are hugely moving moments. ""He may have been your father, Quill, but he wasn't your daddy."" Like the comedy nothing is forced, nothing is sugar coated and nothing is over egged. The only criticism (other than Disney are involved in any way at all) I have is that very, very occasionally the film turns into a music video. Whole songs are played without any dialogue and somehow the pace drops a little at those moments but that is because in those moments they seem slightly incongruous. When taken within the context of the whole movie they set the tone for the glorious end sequences a little like a clear blue sky above a battlefield littered with the dead and dying. Or a mound of dead baby skeletons. The opening, featuring baby Groot (who is used skillfully to distract and move between scenes throughout) is excellent but, at the same time oddly, perhaps, for me, the weakest scene in the movie. Don't get me wrong though because many good movies would kill to have an opening sequence like that and it only appears weak because the whole thing is so well done it's a 5.9 on a board of 6's. ELO's Mr Blue Sky - already an acknowledged classic - will never be the same again but they haven't ruined it - they've added to it. This movie has everything and damn nearly in perfect proportions. Perhaps the tiny imperfections I saw made it better, they echo Star- lord's. I could go on for hours and I probably will (name that tune!) because I have all but scratched the surface but, finally, this IS a great movie. Funny, moving, thought provoking and thoroughly entertaining. One to watch again and again. One for the collection. Definitely. Marvel are getting everything right. EVERYTHING. We are ALL Groot. Nebula: (to Gamora) All you do is yell at each other. You're not friends. Drax: No... We are family. And they are. And we want to be. Gloriously uplifting, full of good-natured, self-effacing humour. It's near perfect for what it is. Fantastic entertainment."
"pyrocitor","9","2","4","8 May 2017"," Episode II: The Raccoon Hugs Back
","Forget the Avengers. Forget the Fantastic Four. With a bust of colour, light, and Blue Suede, the Guardians of the Galaxy exploded onto the screen as the Marvel Cinematic Universe's REAL first family. And it's a word that writer/director James Gunn is loathe to let audiences forget in round two. Creatively untethered after his first roaring success, gone is any compulsory Infinity Stones hyping in favour of more belligerent, tearful outcries of 'family' than there are a new batch of chart-topping tunes (which is saying something). And while Guardians 2 may not hold many surprises, Gunn is wise enough to recognize audiences were hooked on a feeling, and he delivers another stupendously satisfying round of ferociously character-driven, pop-punk Star Wars-lite (less plot; more hugs) with demented gusto.<br/><br/>If the stereotypical sequel trend is to always plunge into DAAAARRKKKNESS, it's a trend Gunn is happy to spit his intergalactic candy-floss in the face of. Wasting no time on exposition, Guardians 2 dives right into rambunctious fun by scene one, spewing slick one-liners, banter, and a teasing fight scene so disarmingly clever our theatre floors shook with laughter. And it seldom slows down afterwards. Gunn is that rare master of the prolonged gag that, although it really shouldn't, somehow becomes even more absurdly hilarious when dragged out to a ludicrous extent (case in point: you can now buy a Funko Bobblehead of a character called 'Taserface'), and Guardians 2 easily ricochets with as much infectious, exhilarating laughter, and impossibly catchy tunes as its predecessor (including bonus points for unprecedentedly badass use of Fleetwood Mac). <br/><br/>If nothing else, the full resources of Weta Digital lend the scrappy subject matter the visual effects buff befitting a proper space opera (or space punk concert, in this case). Gunn's accelerated action - with jetpacks and explosions aplenty - is anarchically playful enough to even (mostly) circumvent the oft-lambasted MCU 'CGI blob blowouts,' from adversaries (including the lovably huffy Elizabeth Debicki) piloting their ships like weird, 90s arcade racing games, to a climax that will feel inventively surreal as long as you don't think of the similarities to the bloated mess culminating Ang Lee's Hulk (oops ). Still, a succession of almost alarmingly violent interludes are just as unsettling - one uncomfortably long slow-mo, laughing mass-murder(!) set to a cheery tune feels more like a Tarantino movie than anything under the Disney umbrella. Confusingly, for a film so irreverent, Guardians 2 is also strangely beautiful, rendering the jaw-dropping, explosively colourful panoramas of a plethora of alien worlds to the rusting fur on Rocket Raccoon and forehead crinkles on Baby Groot (who, yes, is as hilarious and adorable as you'd hope, without overstaying his welcome)'s forehead with consummate detail. We'll just politely overlook the juvenile Looney Tunes 'space travel face warping' effects - it's almost comforting to know that not all of Gunn's prolonged gags are as rewarding. <br/><br/>But, more importantly, Guardians 2 is all about parents (sorry Batman), and is characteristically unafraid to dip deep into the emotional cookie jar. If the first Guardians bared all of its characters' emotional scars, Vol. 2 pokes at them and massages in some salt for good measure, giving each character a resonant emotional arc that, gags aside, makes for a surprisingly tender and sad watch. Gunn (now on solo script duties) orchestrates their interactions with more clumsiness than before, his writing sometimes hand-holding to an almost distracting extent that slightly undersells some pivotal emotional beats (similarly, characters repeatedly verbally cuing the soundtrack, via Quill's walkman, is an unnecessarily contrived screen writing cheat), leaving the occasional aftertaste of trying somewhat too hard to make a Guardians movie rather than letting it breathe effortlessly. Still, he's concocted the ultimate cosmic sitcom: a gaggle of characters painted so distinctly and lovingly that we'd watch them do anything, superfluous plot be damned.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Gunn's peerless cast of characters are given plenty to do, and their respective takes on 'social performance masking inner pain,' win our hearts and laughs anew with eager abandon. Chris Pratt's unique blend of radiantly roguish, childlike charisma and propensity for puppy dog sadness is as heartwarming as ever here. If his listening to Cat Stevens, emotionally unpacking his 'Dad triangle' doesn't unplug your tears, you are of sturdier stuff than most of this Galaxy. Dave Bautista's Drax almost overdoes it on the comic relief front, but Bautista carefully weaves in just enough subtle heartbreak that his peerless comic timing remains unfettered, even as his jokes drift into the increasingly crude (he, after all, has famously humongous turds). Bradley Cooper's Rocket similarly pokes the limits of how much caustic, a-hole acting out audiences will buy in the name of raw, emotional hurt, but we understand him too well not to love him, prickliness and all. Michael Rooker's snarling space pirate Yondu starts out with unsettling softness, but once we acclimatize to his perturbing pathos, he's as brashly affable as they come. In Kurt Russell's uneasily charming Ego, Gunn has unearthed (ha!) a deceptively creepy villain, far more philosophically and visually memorable than his goofy premise would suggest, while fellow newcomer Pom Klementieff redefines adorable as bug-eyed empath Mantis. Still, it's the sister spat between Zoe Saldana and Karen Gillan - the MCU's first real relationship between two women(!) - that really lingers after the credits roll. Saldana and Gillan drip with pitch-perfect, seething vinegar and heartfelt hope in the perfect encapsulation of a sibling relationship: they may usually want to murder each other, but what they really want is a hug. Aww. <br/><br/>Guardians 2, not to mince words, is rambunctiously fun, colourful, hilarious, and, above else, proudly sports its soppy, adorable bleeding heart on its sleeve. It's hardly revelatory and occasionally overly didactic, but plays to its strengths with cheeky obstinacy, and is downright irresistible for it. Will you blast 'Awesome Mix 2' on repeat all the way home from the cinema? Obviously. Just be sure not to hassle the Hoff.<br/><br/>-9/10"
"Laakbaar","9","2","4","7 May 2017"," A great sequel!
","This high-energy sequel is hugely entertaining from the opening scene to the very end. Highly recommended!<br/><br/>This movie is very funny and, at times, ribald and camp. The real pleasure is not in the world-destroying, starship-battle action, but in the snappy, humorous dialogue and in the character conflicts. Chris Pratt and Zo√´ Saldana are sexy as hell. The soundtrack (yes, still based on Peter's Mom's 1960s cassettes) is uplifting and catchy. Even the other characters have adopted this music, and play it non-stop. At the end, quite unexpectedly, this movie becomes moving. Excitement, laughs, cheers, tears -- it's all there.<br/><br/>I think it would be a great idea to see the first movie before you see this one. Volume 2 brings back the winning characters, musical theme and formula from the first movie, so don't expect too many changes. Groot is still alive -- although he is a mere, um, twig. We see more of the Ravagers. A new alien species is introduced: the strange, perfect golden Sovereign. One important new character is introduced: Peter Quill's father. This movie is essentially about him, and all is revealed.<br/><br/>The film is worth about 8.5, but I'm rounding it up. Go see it!"

","SYNOPSIS:
Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is found by his long lost father, Ego (Kurt Russell), and learns a lot about himself. He also finds out that it might not be as good of a reunion that he was hoping for.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
A step up from the first film. *Insert outrage and hate in the comments*. Someone had to say it and I'm apparently the only one man enough to admit it. We get a deeper dive into the mental of several characters and it was funnier. Don't get me wrong, I have the same qualms that I had from the first film and I also feel that this movie had a couple of terribly unfunny lines. Like, super cringe. Almost makes it worse than the first film, but not quite. On top of learning about who Peter is, why Yondu (Michael Rooker) and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) are the way they are, why Nebula (Karen Gillian) acts the way she does, how Drax (Dave Bautista) feels deep down behind his strong and cheerful facade. This film gives us so much and then it just throws interactions between Drax and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) in there like we're all angels and saints. We don't deserve those moments, but James Gunn goes ""here, take this, cherish it, hold on and never let go."" Or at least I imagine that's what he would say to us. In this film, I also feel the villain was a genuine threat. I do wish that Starlord wasn't just automatically incredible at what he just found out he could do. Other than that, I really felt this was a strong film with slight potential to do more, but still good nonetheless. 7.6/10."

","I was lucky enough to see this on 20/4 at an industry screening which allowed me to sit on the film for a few days before I gave a review. I can safely say GotG Volume 2 absolutely wowed me. I can't believe these bunch of lovable misfit a-holes made one of the most MATURE themed films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is visually gorgeous. The use of colour, design and the straight up imagination of the source material outstand any MCU film prior. The action is glorious and astonishing. One scene in particular, I was jaw-dropped in its entirety as direction, action-choreography and music all came together so harmoniously. And THE MUSIC! What an eargasmic soundtrack. The songs are more poetic this time around and fit the subtext of the film perfectly. The trailers gave me the feel of the first movie; a straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy with a simple point A to B plot. GotGV2 is so much MORE than this! This film is patient with its characters and there is an emphasis on growth and family. It manages to balance 7-8 characters and gives almost all of them a satisfactory emotional arc. There is so much to chew on here with the issues and motifs felt by certain characters and I applaud that! This film is vastly different and I'm glad because I just love these characters so much! They are still so fun and energetic. It's great to see the team again and how their dynamic transforms. Also I forget to mention, the film is laugh-out-loud funny! All thanks to Drax who is by far the most comedic character and put me stitches.<br/><br/>Overall, this was both (I can't believe I'm saying this about the Guardians of the Galaxy) an emotionally dense and exciting blast. If Guardians 1 is the fast-paced Sci-Fi adventure like Star Wars was in 1977, then Vol. 2 is the deeper & richer film that takes its time to expand our beloved characters; just like Empire Strikes Back."

It's one of those insanely fun summer movies, you know.<br/><br/>With that said, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is certainly more flawed than its predecessor : the gold people serve no purpose other than providing some sort of conflict until we get to the real stuff, Kirk Russell plays the god of exposition and I feel like they took the humour a little bit too far.

That's the basic storyline here & it's well done with some new faces on screen like two absolute legends of Cinema, Kurt Russell as Ego & Sylvester Stallone as an old ravenger who used to work with Yondu, named Stakar Ogord. Great having these two legends enter this MCU as i grew up watching & loving these guys & they starred together as partners in the Classic Action Cop Thriller ""Tango & Cash"" from way back in the 80's. Also there's much more emotional depth to all the characters this time & makes us care for this time & like them even more. Yondu (Played greatly again by Michael Rooker) has so much more depth to his rugged, angry & deadly Ravenger here that we get to understand him & find out what he's done for Peter Quill. Baby Groot is absolutely adorable & so cute that he steals the show & Peter Quill aka: Starlord gets much more emotional depth with his past catching up to him with a few surprises. All the characters get lots of time to shine here & even Rocket opens up more too!!!
The special effects are as always Amazing & the comedy is just right with plenty of fun comments & banter between our group & that's why is such a fun movie as we love to hang out with this group of misfits & the love of this team is on full display by the end.
A blast of thrilling adventure, stunning set pieces, witty humour, beautiful colourful cinematography, good music & lots of Action make this one great big budget blockbuster popcorn extravaganza. Fun for the whole family, we all loved it."

","During quarentine my wife and I watched all of the MCU in chronological order. I did not expect this movie to be my favorite, but it was. It really stood out. Some of the best, if not the best, character development in the MCU, and for the whole crew not just one character. It explores some great themes; redemption, father and son relationships, friendship, and love. That's a solid list, especially for a Marvel movie. The scene where Yondu says to Rocket ""I know you, because I am you."" That scene is a top tier scene in the whole of the MCU. And finally, it's hilarious. I laughed more at this movie than any of the others. Harbulary batteries."

","They're back, after a groundbreaking first film loved by critics, audiences and a box office success does this sequel deliver.
Kind of.
All the characters from the original are here plus many new ones, too many new ones actually. That's one of the problems with GOTG 2 it feels bloated and in need of editing especially in the final 3rd. Had to watch the film twice at home on Blu Ray after seeing it in the cinema to fully absorb everything that happened both from a story perspective and the action sequences.
There's plenty to like here though the film looks amazing, the GOTG team have not been changed and the positive momentum from the first film has not been derailed, in fact if the 3rd movie is an improvement then this GOTG 2's stock may rise."
"hooma814","8","0","0","31 March 2020"," They've done it again!
","Marvel has made a superhero movie how it should be made! This movie again is fresh, funny and interesting the whole time. This is so much better than some of the earlier movies that come before it. And as far as sequels go, this does a great job of not sucking like most other sequels.<br/><br/>The opening scene is so smart and unique, with focus being on baby Groot (who is such a great character, loved by many I'm sure) whilst the characters battle in the background. It was funny and it gets the main idea of what superhero movies need to be about, the characters! Not action. Action should always be secondary or in the background and the character development always needs to be central. The superhero movies that have all action have never been rated very highly.<br/><br/>From here the movie goes from strength to strength with the cast being the real powerhouse. Every character is likeable, Drax for me especially I found hilarious! His laugh and dry honest comments were always appreciated.<br/><br/>One issue I did have with the movie was the spaceship scene, flying through the comets, seemed like an exact copy of a scene out of the original Star Wars triology. Plus it then got quite far fetched when Gomorrah caught a flying Draw in the spaceship and then proceeded to hold onto a piece of the ship whilst holding Drax for a ridiculous amount of time. This was too far fetched and needed to be rewritten.<br/><br/>Peter Quill and his father was an interesting story, and had some good twists and jokes throughout. The development of what it means to be a father vs a Dad was also playd out well throughout the second half of the movie.<br/><br/>Rocket also gets some important screen time to rise up as a hero alongside Yondu. Both of these characters get redemption in the end and Yondu's sacrifice was emotional and made sense.<br/><br/>The only other problem I had with the movie was the fact that they threw people out into space to die and they were dead with a matter of seconds, however when Peter Quill is thrown out into space in the previous movie he gets at least 20 seconds of life before being taken into a ship and still survives. This doesn't line up, but could be excused for Peter's god like abilities.<br/><br/>Overall this was another great edition to the Marvel Universe and ultimately if it wasn't for these strong contributions, I would ultimately not care about Marvel at all. These characters play a siginficant part in making Marvel what it is today. Well worth a watch!"

With a whole multi-verse to continue to explore, Vol. 2 doesn't rest on its laurels or spend a lot of time revisiting old haunts. Instead, the sequel rockets the Guardians to brand new worlds to meet an array of new aliens and gods, most of whom want the Guardians dead for various reasons. Vol. 2 is a hell of a ride once again.

So with planet hoping and times lines of the m c u In the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline the film takes place in 2014, three months after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). It takes place a year after Thor: The Dark World (2013), before or after Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and a year before Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). Ego arrived on Earth and began his relationship with Meredith Quill in 1980, which took place 38 years after Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and 32 years before
Stan Lee clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in 'Guardians' was something very fun, it says, 'Wait a minute, he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?'""<br/><br/>So with connections to up and coming phase 3 films in this movie
While traveling via multiple space hops, one of the planets the ship travels past appears to be the Kronan homeworld. This is home to Korg the rock creature, who will be appearing in the Planet Hulk storyline of Thor: Ragnarok (2017). Thor already fought and defeated a ""Kronanite"" in Thor: The Dark World (2013).<br/><br/>The opening battle sequence resembles the first issue of the 2008 comic book, which featured the newly formed Guardians battling a giant monster from another dimension. In that story the Guardians were defending a cult called the Universal Church of Truth, which had ties to Adam Warlock. In the film the Guardians are working for the Sovereign race, which is later revealed to be in possession of Adam Warlock's cocoon. Both the Sovereign and the Church become adversaries of the Guardians.<br/><br/>The Sovereign are an arrogant and xenophobic race of golden beings genetically engineered for perfection. The Sovereign consider themselves superior to every other race in the galaxy
When the Sovereign chase the Guardians, they use a remotely piloted ship. The consoles they are operating look like the ones in video game arcades back in the 80's and 90's, especially when the eliminated pilots crowd around the last remaining starfighter, cheering him on. In another nod, the Guardians fly into a Quantum Asteroid Field to escape them. ""Asteroids"" is a very early arcade console game.
As a result of the Guardians' victory over Ronan in the Battle of Xandar, they are hired by the Sovereign to protect the Anulax Batteries from the Abilisk in exchange for The Sovereign releasing Gamora's sister Nebula (Karen Gillen) into the Guardians' custody. Their golden high priestess Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) declares war on the Guardians after Rocket (Bradley Cooper) steals some of the Anulax Batteries
When they escaped from the Sovereign fleet, the Guardians of the Galaxy crash landed their starship the Milano on the planet Berhert. On this forest world, the Guardians meet Ego and Mantis (Pom Klementieff), his empathic helper. Soon, the Guardians split up: Star-Lord, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), and Drax (Dave Bautista) accompany Ego and Mantis back to Ego's planet while Rocket remains on Berhert to repair the Nebula
The ice world of Contraxia would seem to be an unusual vacation destination, but nonetheless, Contraxia is a favorite stop for the many factions of the Ravagers. When staying in Contraxia, the Ravagers frequent the Iron Lotus, the planet's most colorful den of sin, drink, gambling, and ill-repute. Howard the Duck, after escaping confinement in the Collector's destroyed museum on Knowhere, was sighted schmoozing at the Iron Lotus
One of the most powerful yet unusual beings in the universe, Ego is a Celestial born countless millions of years ago. Alone in the beginning, Ego, in the form of a giant brain, began expanding itself and gathering knowledge, eventually taking the form of a lush garden planet roughly the size of Earth's moon (but with a human-looking face). Eventually, Ego began creating avatars of himself, taking on the forms of the races that inhabit the planets he visited to spread his seed. This includes taking on a human form and siring Peter Quill with Meredith Quill on Earth.
Ego hired Yondu and the Ravagers to retrieve each of his children born across the alien races, but Peter was the only one of Ego's offspring able to tap into the light, Ego's Celestial powers, which would allow Ego to absorb all of the planets he seeded into himself. Ego has a strange side to him that he does reveal but
When Yondu, Rocket and Groot escaped the Ravagers on board a splinter ship called the Quadrant, their destination was Ego's world to rescue the rest of the Guardians. However, Rocket miscalculated the number of necessary space jumps it would require to reach Ego, and the Quadrant ended up performing 750 space jumps.<br/><br/>We saw several unidentified planets and aliens in the course of the Quadrant careening across the multi-verse, but the most significant aliens sighted were the Watchers. The Watchers are an ancient race whose mandate is to observe all events in the universe - but they must never interfere. This particular gathering of Watchers were being regaled by tales of the misadventures of one of their own informants, who had taken the form of an older human male (Stan Lee). Uatu, the Watcher assigned to observe Earth, resides on the Blue Area of Earth's moon. It's possible this was the location briefly glimpsed when the Quadrant jumped in the vicinity of the Watchers.<br/><br/>that Nebula ""is a pretty angry woman, with some daddy issues and that, in the second movie, we're going to start to see how much pain her father actually caused her, and we're going to delve right into the relationship with her sister Gamora. I think we might even feel a tinge of sympathy towards her this time.""
There is five end credits this film is madness and you expect nothing else
One of the end credit scenes shows the Sovereign creating a cocoon of sorts for a new being named ""Adam."" It is assumed that this refers to the character Adam Warlock
Uatu is the Watcher assigned to observe Earth 616, the reality in which the regular Marvel Comics Universe takes place.
. Also appearing were Krugarr, an alien sorcerer who, in the comics, was from another timeline and was the disciple of Doctor Strange, and Mainframe, an alien female robot who, in the comics, was a male and an android related to the Vision
Star-Lord's father, as a continuation of exploring the personal side of the Guardians: ""If a raccoon could talk and shoot a machine gun, how could that be? Answering that question ended up being the entire foundation of the first film. There's a sadness in these characters. Rocket was an animal experimented upon and torn apart. Groot has far more in common with Frankenstein's monster than with Bugs Bunny. Ego is an even more ridiculous character. But if a planet was alive, how could that be? And how could it father a child? Nova Prime said about Peter's father in the first film that he is something ancient and unknown, and being a cosmic being, alone for eons, is even more lonely than being the universe's sole talking raccoon.""
This film is nearly as good as the first film the special effects and color would be probably great in 3d like the first I just saw it on DVD and its a bonkers stunning film great acting as usual and groot and rocket steal the show As usual

"davidmvining","5","0","0","25 November 2019"," Peter Quill meets his dad, the planet Exposition
","James Gunn loved his characters too much. That's the only way I can process this movie's failures. He loves them so much he's going to give them great big emotional moments whether the movie needs them or not. Mostly not.<br/><br/>As with several of Marvel's less successful movies, I have to ask, what's the story? Is it Peter reuniting with his dad? Is it Rocket coming to terms with his unpleasant nature? Is it Gamora and Nebula accepting their shared horrible past and becoming real sisters? Is it Yondu examining his past and confronting his failures in life?<br/><br/>All of these happen, take up significant screen time, and most of them don't mesh particularly well together. And, on top of that, the structure throws some of these moments side by side so we're getting unrelated moments of high emotion that have never been significantly established or built up to.<br/><br/>I know that a lot of people love Yondu in this movie, but I think his story is a complete mess. When we first see him, it's about twenty minutes into the movie, and he looks out the window of a robot brothel to see someone he recognizes. He gets dressed, runs down outside, and we learn several things in quick succession. The first is that there are more Ravagers than just Yondu's group, totaling one hundred in all. The second is that Yondu had been expelled from the Ravagers as a whole some years ago for breaking a code. Oh, and they have a code, that's new too. The fourth is that Yondu stole kids (so, more than just Peter at the beginning of the first film). The fifth is that the Ravagers have funeral ceremonies and that Yondu isn't ever going to get one. The sixth is that Yondu is really broken up about this. That amount of information is relayed in about ten seconds, and at the end of that exposition dump, we've got Yondu, accompanied by mournful music, yelling that he is sad about the situation. It's such a clunky dump of information followed very swiftly by an emotional moment that gets only that exposition dump as support, I cannot imagine how anyone in the audience can feel anything in that moment.<br/><br/>Yondu, essentially, spends this movie sad. His crew mutinies, and he sits in a chair as they toss out his loyal crew into the iciness of space. He tells a sad story about his growing up in a Kree slave camp. Most importantly, the most intimate relationship he has with any other character in the film is with Peter, and the two don't share a scene until about one hundred minutes into the film, and their relationship is supposed to act as the counterbalance to Peter's relationship with his real father, Ego.<br/><br/>Ego, on the other hand, is almost nothing but exposition. Twice, he walks through the same room with dioramas depicting his life, and he just recites what went on, the first time in as happy terms as possible, the second in terms more conforming to what he actually did. Kurt Russell is game as Ego, explaining things for minutes on end, but it doesn't get past the fact that twice, Ego stops the movie to simply explain stuff. It's dramatically inert and akin to reading a Wikipedia article instead of watching a movie.<br/><br/>Gosh, I haven't even gotten to the plot of the thing, yet. And yet, the plot is of little importance. Peter and the Guardians save some expensive batteries for a planet of gold people. Rocket steals some batteries because it's what he does and the gold people chase after them. Ego, Peter's previously unknown father, rescues them and brings some of them back to his planet. The rest stay behind and get captured by the Ravagers, who go through the aforementioned mutiny which ends with Yondu killing literally everyone on the ship save one crewmember. They then go to Ego's planet where Peter has learned that he's immortal and that his father gave his human mother brain cancer. That information set him off and he fights his father, who is the planet itself. The gold people, Yondu, and all of the Guardians converge on Ego's planet to fight Ego, Peter turns himself into Pacman, and the good guys win. Yondu dies saving Peter from the final explosion.<br/><br/>Now, Yondu's death is another moment that I read people getting all teary-eyed up about, but I just feel like it falls flat. Take that scene in isolation and it feels like the kind of moment that will tug at heart strings, but Yondu's story has been so poorly handled and his time with Peter so limited that it feels like much ado about nothing. His high emotional moments have come out of nowhere and been unconnected to anything else in the narrative. His sacrifice for Peter is undermined by the fact that they barely share any screen time throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>I'm spent over 800 words complaining, and yet I don't dislike this movie. My problem is that I loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy, and I wanted to love this one. The problems I have with the movie wouldn't have been too terribly difficult to fix at the script stage, and so I see wasted opportunities everywhere. However, I actually find the movie okay overall. I moderately enjoy the experience. Just like the first film, the movie is beautiful to look at. There's such an embrace of color and design that just makes every image pop off the screen. Character interactions are generally quite fun (save when people just explain things). Dialogue is light and witty, and the tone (aside from some moments here and there) is one of an enjoyable romp through the stars. The use of music meshes well with the action on screen, often producing entertaining juxtapositions between sound and visual that brings a smile to my face.<br/><br/>I just wish the script had gone through another draft. Someone needed to look at this and ask, ""Why don't Yondu and Peter have a scene until page 100?"""

","I mean it. Other than its choice in music (which is even better than that in the first film), GOTG 2 improves so greatly on its predecessor. Characters I didn't much care for like Gamorra and Nebula get some much needed character moments. It brings in a compelling villain. It brings in fun new characters like Mantis and Ego. Even more, this film is driven by emotions and can be incredibly moving to the point it had me bawling my eyes out. Other than its excellent emotional core, the film is also hilarious and visually beautiful. GOTG brings some much needed color and visual beauty to Marvel's drabber palette, a trend future movies smartly followed. The film is a comedy first, but it knows when to be serious. Other than a few jokes that don't land, I don't have much criticism over it. I suppose the action is rather dull in the last act, but I enjoyed all else about it. Excellent work James Gunn.

","I was rather unimpressed by GOTG2. The first film is my favorite Marvel of all time, due to its comic approach and funny quips. The sequel does not live up to those high standards set by the first film. The newest addition to the team, Mantis, seemed unusually shallow, and is supposed to be the love-interest of Drax. Honestly, I felt Baby Groot was overplayed for the one-liners, although he does provide a memorable scene in the midst of chaos: while perched on Rocket's shoulders: ""I am Groot!""; Rocket to Yondu: ""He says, 'welcome to the fricking Guardians of the Galaxy... Only he didn't say fricking""<br/><br/>Ego is a creepy father to Star Lord and plants his seeds on planets to eventually claim them as his own once one of his spawn shows the ability to harness cosmic energy. Of course, after thousands of years and thousands of offspring, Star Lord is the only such one.<br/><br/>Ego saves the team from humanoid pursuers and invites them to visit his planet. There he offers to teach Star Lord how to control cosmic energy. There is an emotional scene that brings the truth to light about a character's intentions, and this serves as the catalyst for the team to save the universe a second time.<br/><br/>Rocket sadly has a minor role in this film, spending it more alongside Nebula than the rest of the team. Although he has a fun booby trap scene against some Ravager pirates, overall it doesn't amount to much for his character building. He and Yondu bond somewhat, but there was so much more they could have developed there.<br/><br/>Halfway decent due to the actors and nostalgia from the first film. 6.5/10"

"mitchell5954","7","0","0","4 May 2019"," Nice Follow-Up To The First Film
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the long awaited sequel to the surprise hit Guardians of the Galaxy. No one thought that film would be good, or be a success, but it was. Is this film good too, or did it crumble under the immense pressure. In all honesty, this film is actually a little better than the first. There's one simple reason for that; the characters and their amazing interactions and development.<br/><br/>Practically everything that made the first film fun and appealing is in this film; the action, the effects, the spectacle, the adventure, the humor, the music, the great characters, everything. The one thing this film does differently is the story. The first movie had a very straight forward narrative that you knew where it was taking you.<br/><br/>In this film you don't know where the plot is going until the third act. Some might have an issue with this, but I actually didn't mind it. With the first film you knew exactly how it was going to play out in terms of the plot. Here it could've gone in any direction, which makes it a bit more fun to watch.<br/><br/>What truly makes this film better to me is the character development. The first movie basically just set-up the characters, their personalities, and motivations, but focused more on the story. In this the story takes a back seat to the characters and their development and interactions. This is fine, because the characters are more important than story. The story is important, but the characters are why you care.<br/><br/>The character who gets the most development is star Lord, but everyone gets their development and chance to shine. Gamora, Rocket, Nebula, even Yondu all get great development. The only two major characters who lack development in this movie are Drax and Groot. Though, to be fair, there isn't much more that can be done with them, especially Drax.<br/><br/>The new characters are also good. Kurt Russell as star Lord's father is really good. Silvester Stallone also has a cameo in this, which was cool. The villain is another improvement over the first film. He's not an amazing villain, but he's made automatically better by the fact that he has a more personal connection with our heroes.<br/><br/>The one issue I had was some of the humor. The first film had good humor. I'm not saying this one did not, but there was an overabundance of it. Many sequels to films praised for their good humor will add more humor, which is usually detrimental to the movie, like Transformers 2 or Sherlock Holmes 2. This film does have that, especially in the first half. There many jokes that hit, but many that don't as well, especially Drax's humor. Drax I actually find to be the week point of this movie. Not only is he not given any real development, but most of his jokes I found lame.<br/><br/>Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fun time, especially if you enjoyed the first movie. Everything you love about that film is in this one, and then some. The comedy is hit or miss, but that's just me. Comedy is subjective."

Sadly, this film can't hold a candle to the first, and indeed it suffers from all of the usual sequel problems that have plagued Hollywood down the decades. It tries to be bigger and badder but instead feels bloated and unnecessary, with a plot that involves the main characters sitting around aimlessly for a while and the only interest coming from supporting players in their own mini-adventures. The film has a dumber, more lowbrow feel than before, with jokes about body parts and functions that feel rather crass.

"margulanabutrlov","10","0","0","23 March 2019"," Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 Review
","The Guardians Of The Galaxy - Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) - are running for their lives from an alien race called The Sovereign, when they receive help from an unexpected source: Ego, The Living Planet, an ancient being who claims to be Peter's long-lost father...
The first Guardians Of The Galaxy's chief weapon was surprise. When the quirky quintet made their debut back in 2014, they represented Marvel Studios' biggest gamble to date. Sure, it was the company that had taken an Aussie surfer, given him a magic hammer and still created another hit to add to its roster of box office behemoths, but the received wisdom was that a sci-fi film featuring a talking raccoon, a sentient tree, an ex-wrestler, a green warrior woman, and a roguish bloke best known for being the tubby guy in Parks And Recreation would be a step too far.
Well, received wisdom can go hang. Driven by the indie, often delightfully deranged sensibilities of its director, James Gunn, Guardians was a joy, combining humour and sci-fi action in a manner that out-Star Warsed most Star Wars movies, danced a jig at the global box office, and became a fixture on many 'Best MCU films' lists. In short, we were Groot.
But when you've lost the element of surprise, following that is no easy task. Happy to report, though, bar a few last-act wobbles and the odd tonal shift, Gunn has done it again, crafting a sequel that keeps the focus on the characters we fell for first time around while pumping up the volume.
After the success of the first one - and perhaps learning from the travails of Joss Whedon who, by his own admission, had to endure a fair amount of interference and second-guessing on Avengers: Age Of Ultron - Marvel has handed Gunn the keys to the kingdom. And that confidence is evident from the film's credit sequence, which presents an action set-piece in a hilarious and highly unorthodox manner, while giving the incredibly cute Baby Groot a glorious moment in the spotlight and serving notice that 'Awesome Mix Vol. 2', the mix-tape that drives the film's soundtrack, is going to be every bit as earwormy as 'Vol. 1'.
And, for the terrific first hour or so that seems to be the case with the movie as well. If the first film was about bringing this group of A-holes together, then convention dictates that the sequel should be about forcing them apart. But Gunn is clearly uninterested in what he should do and so this is actually a film about the group realising that, despite their huge differences, they function best as the universe's most dysfunctional family. Yes, family - thematically this has a lot in common with Fast & Furious 8, with the F-word said so often it would overheat Dom Toretto's carburettor. Almost everyone here has daddy, mummy, or sister issues, with Quill in particular finding himself in a weird version of My Two Dads, torn between the dependably swaggering Russell's aptly-named Ego and Michael Rooker's gnarly space pirate, Yondu. But the emotions this engenders are unexpected and genuine. Beneath the film's sass - and there's plenty of that again - there's a real beating heart.
Vol. 2 is at its best when this motley crew are bickering and bantering amongst themselves (with Bautista's wonderfully unfiltered Drax getting the lion's share of the best lines again, including the T-shirt-worthy, ""I have famously huge turds"") and outside parties, this time including Ego, Pom Klementieff's sweet Mantis and Gamora's aggrieved sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan), given more to do this time around. Hanging out with them is so much fun that it's a shame when Gunn finally makes a concession to convention and remembers that films like this typically have to have a) a plot and b) a villain.
With the introduction of both, that's when the movie starts to falter. What was previously assured becomes a little abrasive and, at times, unappealing. Jokes that landed unerringly start to miss the target, including a running gag about a bad guy called Taserface that's not as funny as it may have seemed on paper/on set/in the edit, while one sequence which is meant to be a moment of triumphant heroism comes across as a tasteless misstep. And the final battle, try as it might, can't help but become a greenscreen jamboree."

Without revealing too much, you get lengthy conversations about feelings and family on a distant planet with no real action, and then you get a plot twist that anyone can see coming a mile away.<br/><br/>The opening is fantastic, the stuff in the third act is great, and there is a sad and poignant moment in the film as well, but it's simply not enough to sustain the film as a whole.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","7","0","0","8 March 2019"," Another victim to the trilogy conundrum.
","I sometimes wonder if the strength of the first film in a series dooms the following films to a condition I refer to as ""the trilogy conundrum."" If a single film is original and has a strong story that stands by itself, it almost requires the following films to be weaker in comparison, each sequel needing another sequel to tell a complete story. Films like Back to the Future (1985), The Matrix (1999), and Pirates of the Caribbean (2003) are fantastic films that defined their generation, but their sequels were highly dependent on a follow-on sequel, thus making the trilogy complete, but lacking the strength of the initial film.<br/><br/>I hate to say it, but Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 (2017) falls into this ""trilogy conundrum."" The original Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) was a fun and meaningful departure from its Marvel comic book brethren. This sequel, however, lacks a few things that made the original as good and as singular as it was. First off, there were almost too many antagonists in this movie. The Sovereign were essentially a ""joke"" antagonist, were it not for the mid-credits scene that sets up the opponent for the third installment, and the actual antagonist of the film (whose name is a little too on the nose) was revealed so late that the final battle almost seemed rushed.<br/><br/>I will give Vol. 2 some credit, though. The opening credits sequence had a catchy song and an amusing ""background action"" sequence the likes of which I haven't seen since The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015). The character development in this sequel was fantastic, helping bridge the gap between this film and its predecessor, while also setting up the characters for the 3rd Guardians installment as well as Avengers: Infinity War (2018). As was the case with the original Guardians of the Galaxy, the dialogue and nostalgia included in Vol. 2 were fun and lighthearted. Finally, Yondu's (Michael Rooker) slow-motion sequence was just as entertaining as Quicksilver's (Evan Peters) sequences in the latest X-Men films.<br/><br/>Another victim to the trilogy conundrum, I give Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 3.5 stars out of 5."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","0","20 January 2019"," A sequel that hits all the right chords.
","Making a sequel that is both its own independent film and a helpful addition to the first successful installment is tricky. James Gunn does everything right with volume 2 of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Gunn gets us to fall in love with our rambunctious anti-heroes from his first film for their previously explored personalities and quirks, yet allows us to get to see different sides to them and explores them more intimately. He doesn't get carried away with his story, instead grounding us in an articulate narration that is both fun and silly, yet enhancing to our characters. Rocket the Raccoon yet again steals the show as the clever and wise-talking fury friend who can shoot a machine laser gun better than any human. Chris Pratt is also fun and confident as a Marvel protagonist, once again shaping the traditional identity of a superhero in a new fashion. Volume 2 is just as stunning and fun as its predecessor, and after this sequel, I can honestly say I cannot wait to see what Volume 3 has to offer and what the future is for these wildly enjoyable characters."

","The Guardians Of The Galaxy have returned once again for another space adventure, only this time the film has a much stronger focus on character development. This includes the unraveling of the mystery surrounding our lead super hero Peter Quill's (aka STARLORD) heritage as he learns more about his true parentage and other unanswered questions from the previous film.<br/><br/>I remember when I walked into theaters to see the Guardians of the Galaxy VOL. 1. I knew very little about the film and the trailers didn't really represent anything new or exciting. To be honest, I watched it because I thought ""Hey it's a Marvel film and they're all connected normally"". The 1st film had a fantastic dose of brainless fun along with one of the best motion picture soundtracks (known as the Awesome Mix Vol.1 - which I own on CD and Vinyl ) and I think Marvel themselves were also surprised at how well this new franchised was received. Is Vol. 2 a worthy sequel?<br/><br/>I love how this movie takes a risk and tackles the unanswered mysteries that had been provided to us in the previous Guardians film. Even though the film is heavily focused on the story of Peter Quill's past, I feel the film gave us more development and depth to EVERY character that surrounds Peter! I also found this time round that Peter (Chris Pratt) doesn't make as many jokes as he did in the previous film due to the many distractions provided for him in the film's plot. Instead, the other characters are the ones who make the bigger wise cracks throughout the film's duration. There's also a few actors who manage to sneak into the Marvel World including Kurt Russell, Sylvester Stallone & Howard The Duck...<br/><br/>The film's soundtrack once again was a pleasure to hear. It's a rare feeling, but if I was to tell someone the artists featured in the film's soundtrack it would feel like I'm spoiling the plot. That's because the music plays such an important role in providing the extra fun for action or the slower pace during sad times.<br/><br/>Overall, Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 2 has delivered a great mix that we would all play over and over again until we wear the tape out... or wear out the Ultra HD Disc. Even when I found the villain to be predictable, I found myself never bored but very invested in the film due to the characters having a greater depth on screen. The world our heroes live in is also stunning to see on the big screen. I personally feel the 1st film and soundtrack holds a higher rating... but don't worry, it's only because a little difference.<br/><br/>7.9/10

In any case, after the Guardians of the Galaxy depart they soon discover that one of their own members has kept some of the batteries for himself-and because of that they are now the targets of the same people who had employed them earlier. To make matters even more complicated, while trying to escape from the Sovereigns they encounter a man named ""Ego"" (Kurt Russell) who claims to be the father of ""Peter Quill"" (Chris Pratt). But what they don't realize is that Ego has a secret agenda that he only plans to reveal when the time is right. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that-as in the first movie-fans who enjoy lots of CGI and action will probably love this particular film. And while I was quite impressed with the CGI, I must admit that-once again-I didn't consider this movie to be as good as the marketing and hype surrounding it. To further elaborate, I found the acting to be rather mediocre and I didn't think that the humor was very sharp either. That being said, while it wasn't necessarily a bad movie by any means, I thought it could have been much better and I have rated it accordingly. Average."

","""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2017) is an action comedy about a team of misfits led by Peter Quill, played by Chris Pratt, as they are charged with saving the galaxy a second time from a foe that is too close to home. The film opens with comedy and dives right into action. It is a wonderful balance of funny and adventure that will pull the viewer into a confusing yet amusing world of violence. It feels like a less vulgar ""Deadpool"" with more teamwork. I enjoy this film and the series because it makes me think of how my own friends would act if we were heroes.<br/><br/>I commend James Gunn for his ability to assist his actors in the continued capturing of their characters. The acting is superb for a film that doesn't fit the norm of an action adventure. I do believe that the story of the first film was much stronger, I did find the turning point in this film to be unexpected and equally intriguing. I find sequels are difficult to top the originals, but this film was a great attempt, though occasionally a little cheesy, if not over the top. Overall, I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone that loves a laugh with a side of violence."

","The first Guardians of the Galaxy movie is one of the most popular comic book movies thus far, with its memorable cast of colorful characters, spectacular visuals, and pop culture references from the 1980s. The Guardians return here for another adventure, where Star-Lord meets his father, Ego. The strength of the first movie was how this band of drastically different characters functions, which the second movie builds on successfully. It explores character relationships in pairs - we see interaction between Star-Lord and Ego, Gamora and Nebula, Rocket and Yondu, and Drax and Mantis. It's just as action-packed and funny as the first movie, but they spend most of it separated. In addition, Ego is one of the MCU's best villains so far, with a good performance by Kurt Russell, an interesting backstory, and an awesome set of powers. The twist with him at the end was totally unexpected (in a good way). Much like the first movie, the soundtrack and visual effects are highlights. The theme of music from the 80's continues, with the likes of Fleetwood Mac and the Electric Light Orchestra having songs featured in the film. The visual effects were spectacular, from the space battles to the planets, especially Ego's planet. The problem with it is that it feels like it's just trying to get the Guardians more screen time before Infinity War, making it seem like filler material for the MCU's overall story. The first Guardians movies introduced the Power Stone and gave Thanos more screen time than any other before Infinity War, so it was rather surprising to not see it connect to the overall story with the Infinity Stones, and have it not connect to Thanos. And a lot of people were upset at how drastically Mantis differed from her comic book persona. While I see the two as entirely different characters, it makes sense that that would upset long-time fans of the Guardians. Still, for fans of Marvel or comic book movies, this is a must watch. It's definitely a worthy addition to the MCU, even if it's not as memorable of important to the MCU's overall story than the first one."

You really found yourself rooting for the team throughout the movie.<br/><br/> The soundtrack was outstanding, the song choices worked really well with most scenes.

However, after watching it a second and third time, you sort of just get used to it for what it is. A comedy that doesn't have a good plot, but a lot of laughable scenes.
I was disappointed after the first viewing as I found the first movie amazing. But like I said, it's still worth a watch. A lot of friends who's opinions I've asked also thought the same as me, they tried to add too much music, lost track of the plot and made it more stupid funny."
"michael-young-585","8","0","0","7 September 2018"," The Visuals are So Much Fun
","This year's Best Picture Oscar winner, The Shape of Water, cost a little over $19 million dollars to make. (It has already grossed ten times that.). Most of the other Best Picture nominees came in with budgets far less. Get Out, for example, cost just $5 million dollars to make and has returned revenue of more than a quarter billion dollars. Dunkirk, probably the most expensive best picture contender, cost quite a bit more to make, with a budget of around $100 million dollars. (Not surprisingly, it too is turning a profit with revenue of more than $500 million.). The point here is that it doesn't take a block-buster budget to make a good movie.<br/><br/>When you look at the movies nominated for Visual Effects, however, there is an entirely different economic system at work. I couldn't find budget numbers for Star Wars: The Last Jedi, but it has already grossed more than $1.3 billion dollars. Blade Runner 2049 cost $150 million to make and, as the least successful of these five movies, it has only grossed $259 million, still returning a profit of more than $100 million to the studio. War for the Planet of the Apes also cost $150 million to make and has grossed more than three times that amount. Kong: Skull Island was a little more than expensive, coming in at $185 million but has grossed almost $569 million.<br/><br/>So Visual effects are expensive to produce, but almost always reward the risk with hundreds of millions of dollars in profit. But the most expensive movie of the entire year, or at least of this year's crop of Oscar-nominated movies is this one, Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2. With a budget of more than $200 million dollars, it has a world-wide gross at this point of more than $863 million dollars. Guardians invested heavily in special effects and has been handsomely rewarded.<br/><br/>And where, exactly, does that kind of money go? Well if you can't tell by watching the movie, then just study the credits (which are kind of fun in their own right). They list 1533 people spread among multiple companies all dedicated to providing the mostly computer-generated graphics that make up the bulk of the movie. (There are another 49 people credited for 'special effects' and, to be honest, I don't know what the difference is). Most movies don't have that many people making up the entire crew and here they are all producing the stunning visuals.<br/><br/>And they are spectacular. In fact, I would say this is a must-see movie just because of those visuals. There is a set of scenes taking place at the core of a rather special planet that is reputed to be the most complex computer-generated sequence ever brought to film with scenes composed of several million polygons, a measure of CGI complexity. The result is a set of moving images that is stunningly real and strikingly beautiful as well. And that is just one scenario out of many in this movie. And large numbers of this team worked on the Oscar-nominated visual effects for the first Guardians movie, but also for all three Iron Man movies, Captain America, the Avengers, Master and Commander, and War of the Worlds. This is an experienced and accomplished team with lots of successful, mostly comic-based, movies under their visual effects tool belt.<br/><br/>This is, as the title conveys, episode 2 of the franchise, and I'm sure there will be more coming down the pike. The main characters in this one are the same as in the first one and portrayed by the same actors. Chris Pratt plays Peter Quill, whose parentage is the subject of this movie. In addition to this role in two movies, he also played in the TV series Parks and Recreation, and the movies Jurassic World and the Lego Movie. Zoe Saldana plays the green female Gamora (one of my favorite characters). Saldana also played Uhuru in a Star Trek movie and is best known as Neytiri in the CGI classic, Avatar. My favorite character, though, is Drax, a philosophical brute (as contradictory as that sounds) with a terrific sense of humor. Drax is played by Dave Bautista who has also performed in this year's Blade Runner movie as well as the Avengers. Vin Diesel provides the voice for Baby Groot, a CGI character that is cute in this movie, but will likely be more central in future movies as he grows up. Diesel is more of an action star, famous for roles in the Fast and Furious franchise. Finally, Michael Rooker plays Yondu, one of the more interesting, and important, characters in this movie, but I haven't seen anything he's played in before these two Guardian movies. The point is that this cast of characters is not exactly known for their acting ability, but they do have credentials in the comic book and action movie worlds - talents that help infuse their performances here, but will not likely get them any Oscar nods.<br/><br/>The only major actor who does have Oscar pedigree, is Bradley Cooper. Cooper, a serious dramatic actor, was nominated for roles in Silver Linings Playbook, American Sniper, and American Hustle, all of which were terrific. In Guardians, though, we never see Cooper. Rather he provides the voice for the intelligent raccoon, Rocket - the genius engineer with a heart of gold who really saves the Guardians, as well as the Galaxy!<br/><br/>Both Guardians movies were directed by James Gunn who, along with some twenty other writers, mostly of Marvel comic books, was also responsible for the script for both Guardian movies. He has written and directed a few other movies, none of which I have seen and none of which received any Oscar mentions. <br/><br/>So the acting, directing, and writing are not exactly Oscar level - this isn't a movie to see if that is what you want. But, in addition to the Visual Effects, there is also Oscar awards to be found in the Cinematography, Film Editing, Costumes, and Makeup Teams, with many of those credits for comic book type movies like the Guardians, or the Avenger series. There is talent at work in this movie, even if it is 'below-the-line'.<br/><br/>In the end, though, this movie should be seen for two reasons. First are the spectacular visual effects - in my opinion, the best of the year and the most visually exciting of any movie in this year's crop. Secondly, though, is that this is a funny movie. The movie pokes fun at itself, and all comic book movies, without crossing the line into parody. Drax's subtle humor is almost painful, and yet he has an infectious laugh. Baby Groot, like his predecessor in the previous movie, has a single line 'I Am Groot', but it is in the inflections that he communicates and by the end of the movie, you can almost understand him; and he's cute. Gamora and Peter provide the romantic interest, although Drax starts to get it on with another female character and those scenes too are an interesting mix of tenderness and fun. The themes it explores are obvious, and sometimes trite, but the movie brings a level of humor to the mix that makes it fun to explore, even if you know it won't be real deep.<br/><br/>But the visuals - yes, the visuals are outrageous."

","While Marvel has come out with many a great film in the past 10 years, let's be honest: Guardians of the Galaxy ranked near the top. It was such a surprise hit to everybody, but once people knew who these guys were, everybody wanted to be as good looking as Star Lord, deadly as Gamora, strong as Drax, quick-witted like Rocket and just plain awesome as Groot. It was such a massive success that no one saw coming, but did the sequel live up to the same hype?<br/><br/>Well, I can safely say that, while it is not quite as good as the original, Vol. 2 definitely lives up to the hype!<br/><br/>While the special effects and action sequences are all amazing, what really makes a Marvel movie is the performances, and the ones in this film are no different. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Michael Rooker and Karen Gillan all do an even better job at their respective characters, but the new characters are all just as fascinating. Pom Klementieff plays a new character named Mantis who can feel the same emotions as someone else when she touches them; Sylvester Stallone makes a great cameo appearance in the film as Stakar Ogord, who true fans know as Starhawk; and, of course, Kurt Russell dons the mantle as Peter's father, and you could really say that these guys really were Father and Son. Oh, and the villain of the movie is really amazing; I won't say who it is because I don't want to spoil it, but it's such a surprise towards the end of the movie!<br/><br/>So, why do I rate this lower than the original if I felt the performances were better? Well, to be honest, a bit of the originality was lost in this one. Don't get me wrong; the songs, the dancing, the quick-witted jokes, they were all there and they are all a big part of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. It's just that I expected them to come when they did.<br/><br/>But all in all, a great popcorn flick to enjoy with the family! These guys really do know how to entertain!"

","With the birthday of a friends son coming up,I decided that I would get him some Comic-Book presents.

Planning to get Spider-Man: Homecoming,I decided that to complete the package,to join the Guardians for a second time.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Returning in a greatly expanded role, Karen Gillan gives a wonderful performance as Nebula,whose fights with sibling rival Gamora (played by a very good Zoe Saldana) is fought with snappy exchanges by Gillan that nicely balance the action thrills. Bouncing off Dave Bautista's lively performance as Drax and Bradley Cooper's wise-cracking Rocket,Chris Pratt tones down the comedic edge Peter Quill showed in the first for a warm sincerity, that impressively gives a human cost to the grand special effects across the screen,as Pratt and Michael Rooker bring a tenderness to the loose father/son relationship between Quill & Yondu.<br/><br/>Guarding the galaxy again with cinematographer Henry Braham,writer/director James Gunn sets the rocket off with bursts of dazzling primary colour,with every inch of the screen being covered in bright,pulpy yellow,blues and greens. Landing the action scenes in the middle of a playful,Sci-Fi family drama,Gunn gets lost in space with a stylised sense of scale,where the action scenes, (even the traditional blue floating thing in the sky Comic-Book final) are given a real crunch thanks to Gunn placing each set-piece from the weaving camera following Groot and Rocket's part in standing tall with their family,and continuing to guard the galaxy."
"JaydoDre","7","0","0","9 August 2018"," Goofy, entertaining, lacks power in the ending.
","There are guidelines against stating the score in the body of your review, but given the Imdb's inflexibility, I have to say that Guardians 2 is possibly the most 6.5-star movie I've ever watched. <br/><br/>I remember how I complained about the ending to first Guardians movie having unrealistic physics. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 lets you know right away that it throws the physics out of the window, which frees you from having to worry about pesky things like realism and this creative choice appears to have been right one.<br/><br/>In combination with an overwhelming amount of colourful CG, the flexible physics at times made me feel like I was watching another Shrek animation, and it was not annoying like it should have been.<br/><br/>Compared to the first movie, the sequel turns up the goofiness knob quite a bit, and with it, also the funny knob. This movie is a comedy above anything else and that's where it shines. All you need is fun characters played by interesting actors, just doing their shtick.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most notable thing about the movie is that it doesn't have a strong central storyline. There is a main villain, but he and his plan do not really enter the movie until about half way. Instead, this movie has 4 or 5 stories and themes running through it almost side by side, which is completely fine and does not feel disjointed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film went downhill for me in the second half, as prolonged action sequences were making increasingly less sense and the humour was replaced by conflict and forced drama. Also, if you think about this movie's value in the future, it's hard to ignore the amount of CGI used to make it and how bad it may look to the human eye 10 years from now. The costumes and character design are nice, but they are drowned out by fake explosions and monsters.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is at its strongest in its middle section, when it is having fun and doesn't think too hard about anything. The last third of the movie starts losing momentum and entertainment value."

","Highly anticipated sequel to the very amusing and colourful bubblegum sci-fi comedy adventure. This film captures the fun and enjoyment of the first film with ease. It has a photorealist style, eye-popping visual effects and fantastical kinetics which seem to suit this film more than any of the Marvel series films. Classic 70s retro songs are replayed in pleasing synchrony to the drama and action on screen. The story is a bit aimless for a while - flippant even, and the plot stalls a bit in the middle, and there isn't the same tension as the first film - but these are minor blemishes because there are entertaining performances and the pacing never feels forced."

The story is interesting one wherein Quill is happy to find his father on one hand but on the other finds difficult to protect the Guardians on revelation of his true identity. The Macho role played by Yondu was also commendable and so was his sacrifice in the end.

 <br/><br/>We are presented with a backstory to Peter Quill's parents as soon as the film starts. This makes the context flood back into the audience's mind and sets a good tone for what the film will be covering. This immediately engaged me into the story about to be told. I felt immersed into the world that the first film had created for me.<br/><br/>When we meet the Guardians of the Galaxy crew again, we're thrown straight into action. The way the characters are casually talking with one another and bickering like a family, feel familiar and comforting.<br/><br/>The film's main objective is to help Quill find belonging and seek out the truth about his father, that he has close to no recollection about!<br/><br/>
The star of the movie, Chris Pratt, did a tremendous job filling the young athletic, yet captivating and comedic role of Peter Quill; codename: Star Lord. The energy he brings to the character is tremendous, so much so that you never think twice about the fact that he's acting. The same goes for Zoe Saldana (Gamora). Despite her immaculate performance, I still believe that her role in Avatar, as Neytiri, tops her list of acting performances.<br/><br/>With Groot dying at the end of the first film, a significant character hole was left to fill. To solve this problem, the writers brought back Baby Groot in his place. The fact that Baby Groot is a seedling from the original Groot, makes you feel like the original character remains. His immaturity and lack of spacial awareness is well played with during the film and is certainly not overused. <br/><br/>As well as the main story line, we follow this characters journey watching him learn the ropes within the hectic life the toddler has been thrown head-first into.<br/><br/>However, one character in particular was not portrayed to the high standard set by the rest of the cast. Elizabeth Debicki, playing Ayesha was overly dramatic and frankly unbelievable. Perhaps this was down to the directions she was given, either way, the character didn't have enough screen-time to negatively impact my overall rating of the film.<br/><br/>The film integrates a mixture of genres to cater for audiences of different ages and as well as interests. Its a Sci-Fi Fantasy, action and adventure film with a definite comedic value, which keeps the seriousness of the story at bay; when the action gets too much. In addition, there is an evolving love interest between Star Lord and Gamora, as well as an oddly developing one between Drax and Mantis. This inclusion to the storyline was perfectly executed, leaving viewers wanting to see how it develops in future movies.<br/><br/>This dense mixture of genres blends perfectly and guarantees a fun experience for both friends and family attending.<br/><br/>The props seen throughout the whole movie were flawless. Many of the weapons had to look flashy and futuristic, to live up to the expectations of the audience. Thankfully this was the case. The detail on the blasters and cannons made them my favourite props by far!<br/><br/>The same can't be said for the make up. The Sovereign race had tacky-looking gold makeup smeared across their bodies. Despite the makeup being applied accurately, having these actors covered from head to toe, probably wasn't the best idea to accomplish the gold skin effect. Gamora's green makeup looked slightly more realistic as it wasn't as shiny and it blended in better with her surroundings.<br/><br/>The costumes however looked very authentic and the characters looked natural wearing them. Yondu's long coat, is a great example. The bold size makes him stand out from the rest of his crew, yet has a vibrant enough colour, to distinguish him as the captain.<br/><br/>
The editing for the most part is well timed to give the film a comedic effect. The transitions keep you on your toes between scenes, but sometimes the audio doesn't quite match-up with the visual. For example, at the beginning when Baby Groot hits Drax with a stick, the sound is out of sync with the actual action. This breaks the connection that you have to the story, releasing you from the moment. This is a highly negative attribute as the sole purpose of a film like this, is to captivate and make the audience escape from reality.<br/><br/>The visual effects for all of the alien characters, especially for Baby Groot, are unquestionable. The natural movements, along with how the artificial materials react with their environment seem flawless from a viewer's point of view.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes in the movie are shot on green-screen, as the majority of the backdrops are in space. The film is shot with multiple camera angles, which allows you to follow the action up close.<br/><br/>During the production process, the director (James Gunn) had the soundtrack playing aloud for the actors on set, to help immerse themselves into the scene fully. This method, in my opinion, stepped the atmosphere up a level and made the experience unforgettable.<br/><br/>Finally, I would state that the trailer, as well as all promotion for this film is accurate, gives you a good idea of what you're paying to see and is in no way misleading.<br/><br/>Overall I would highly recommend this film as great Friday night entertainment, with the family, or as a trip to the cinema with your friends."

","James Gunn returns to bring us the second instalment in the wildly popular Guardians franchise starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Karen Gillan and Michael Rooker.<br/><br/>Before I start this review, I should mention that the first Guardians film is my favorite MCU film. I think it's easily the best directed Marvel film and it features in my opinion the most human characters in the MCU.<br/><br/>Vol. 2 expands these characters and gives us even more reasons to love each one of our heroes. It's a totally different movie than the first one and it's all the better for it.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is first and foremost the characters. Everyone gets his or her moment to shine. And Gunn very wisely decides to focus on them and exploring the events that shaped them into the characters they are now.<br/><br/>The story here is a little less tight than the original mainly because the plot sort of happens to the characters once Ego shows up. And it isn't until the final act where it really kicks in. This is also something I adore. Gunn structures his story around his characters and that really works for this film.<br/><br/>It's also extremely funny. Some people have an issue with this saying that the film features to much comedy. I understand where they are coming from but for me it's what makes these characters more human. They make jokes to avoid being hurt and that really resonates with me.<br/><br/>The action is once again spectacular, and the CGI is mostly great. It all build towards an exciting and emotional climax that managed to make me cry.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to everyone, certainly if you're a fan of the franchise and I hope that Vol. 3 can bring this trilogy to a satisfying conclusion."

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 starts with an absolutely laugh out hilarious opening credit scene with baby groot. It's great to see the team back together and having fun. Their banter and chemistry is still very strong. The comedy is even funnier than the first and is loaded with some big laughs. Primarily dished out by Drax, Mantis, Rocket, and Baby Groot. Baby Groot is used brilliantly in this story, and every second he's on screen are the best parts. The new addition to the team is Mantis, who is an outstanding side character to see interact with the team but mostly interact with Drax. Rocket and his CGI continue to be phenomenal, and he builds a new interesting relationship with Yondu. The heart from the first movie is present in this one, and the quality of the first soundtrack is duplicated in this as well. The two come together to softly complement one another near the end of the story. The film finds a good villain in Peter Quill's father Ego. He himself is a good character and villain even though his plan at the end is rather dumb, but there's still stakes. Gamora's behavior in this makes her a little unlikable. She spends most of the film just being angry, which makes her presence kind of unfun. Overall, this sequel is right on par with the first, and has a better villain and comedy than the first. Even though the first has better team chemistry and story. So I give it an 8.2"

","The real force of the movie is that it contains a lot of humor of the more self-ironic stuff. The group dynamics of the Guardians is, until around 2/3 into the movie, based on interpersonal conflicts that are depicted in the most funny way.<br/><br/>When the guardians actually put aside their thirst for revenge and distrust to each other it helps them fall into their specific role that fits their special abilities and this makes them fight as a unity. I had a wish for this to happen but as it progressed I found to my surprise that it was boring. With the loss of their dark sides they became one dimensional with predictable behaviour. For instance they prove their friendship by risking their own lives saving each other, they have their moments of doubt that they overcome and they redeem themselves. All of this adds to a very solemn atmosphere that stands in a stark contradiction to the first part of the movie.<br/><br/>This harmony cannot develop with sarcastic comments and antisocial behaviour so I am sad to say that the very happy end competes with any Disney story...<br/><br/>The big showdown isn¬¥t bad - the special effects are cool but everybody knows what it will up to so the suspense is absent.<br/><br/>Regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist.

","I gave the first Guardians film an 8 and this movie is slightly better than a seven, but not quite as good as the first film. They still manage to capture the magic and imagination the first film has, while progressing the stories and ultimately leading into Infinity War. It was great to see this assemble back on screen again with another killer soundtrack. The first scene is so perfect for the sequel because it wraps everything we love about the Guardians into a few minute explosion to get you buying right back in to why we love the first film."

","Even though I really enjoyed the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movie, for some reason it didn't leave me wanting to watch the next instalment straight away. I sort of got the feeling that it would be more of the same. And it was. And I tried really hard not to like it. And I failed. Yes, it's effectively not that different to the first instalment and yes there's a lot of CGI, making it look like an extended cut-scene from a computer game, but it's just too much fun to really hate.<br/><br/>The story carries on a little while after the first ended and our team of 'Guardians' are in the middle of some computer-generated space combat, generally saving the galaxy from one beastie or another. However, the main story is kicked off by a plot thread that was left hanging from the original, namely regarding 'Starlord's' father.<br/><br/>People often use the term 'Avengers in space' to describe the 'Guardians' films and I can see why. It's technically (another) superhero team-up movie. Starlord is 'the star,' but the rest of the screen time is shared between the five or so other main cast members, giving each just about enough room for a little character development. And it's because it's an ensemble that it words so well. I guess for all its obvious flaws that I tried to dwell on, it's the sheer 'interaction' between the characters that makes it so enjoyable. Yes, the action is - by today's standard - pretty generic in that you'll probably have seen stuff like it before in any other modern sci-fi movie, but the way the characters bicker is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>It's also nice to see Michael Rooker's character getting extra screen time, but the big surprises were the 'big names' of 'Tango & Cash' getting back together for their respective roles (or should I say Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell if you're not familiar with that *ahem* 'classic' buddy-cop movie from yesteryear). There's even a bit of genuine emotion thrown in there at the end which I won't go into for fear of runing into 'spoiler' territory.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if you're familiar with the current 'Marvel Shared Universe' then 'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' isn't anything you haven't seen before, even coming across like other similar modern space epics (like 'Valarien' only people actually went to see this film!), but if you're looking for something which is pure 'fun' then you'll definitely find it here. It's not really that necessary to know what went on before and I was pleased to see that this film wasn't one long lead-in to the upcoming 'Avengers: Infinity War' movie."

","I love the focus on the character stories and relationships, but at times there were too many background characters, causing confusion about seemingly distant villains beyond the main conflict (I couldn't remember who Stakar Ogord, Taserface, and Ayesha were and what they wanted) As always, the visual effects, music and humor were on point. I loved the Mary Poppins line! And baby Groot dancing!"

","I like the way they picture their ""space universe"" down at Marvel's: It's sleek, fast, varied, colourful and grim at the same time. It's like a throwback to these old Flash Gordon novels, and even the film in the early 80s.<br/><br/>In this opus we get to see less of the characters' powers, instead focusing on their interactions. It has strong ""family values"" questioning. In terms of sheer originality it is a lesser beast than the first one, but it's still far from being run-of-the-mill.<br/><br/>The aspect that I liked most was the ""Sovereign"" civilisation and the ending concerning them, which guarantees we might see more of (a least one of) them in a future movie. Also, Zoe Seldana ages beautifully and with grace, turning into a stunning woman. Drax had the best lines out of a mundane lot. Karen Gillan was excellent as rough, repulsive Nebula, with her cyber-precision moves and man-like, akward postures, reflecting the character to perfection.<br/><br/>7/10, worth a few re-watches."

The best scene was when Peter and Rocket argue at the start of the movie by Peter calling Rocket a ""Raccoon"" and a ""Trash Panda"". When Rocket calls a ravager ""Tazerface"", when some ravagers are chucking alcohol at groot which was sad and funny at the same time.

Or a guy is riding on some plasma-platform....and the thing just automatically knows exactly where to go, and it automatically transforms itself and attaches to whatever it needs to.

"samwillpearce","3","3","8","19 April 2020"," The Worst Infinity Saga movie--history will prove me right
","Yes, even worse than Thor: The Dark World.<br/><br/>I know that plenty of people like this movie now, but I cannot see this movie aging well at all. I can't imagine it becoming a superhero classic like several of the other MCU movies are destined to be.<br/><br/>The main problem with Guardians 2 is that it takes everything good about the first film and cranks it up to an intolerable level. While the first Guardians film was probably one of my favorite MCU films, Guardians 2 takes everything that was so excellent about the first movie and somehow makes it bad. A lot of the vintage music choices didn't really seem to fit the film, or at least they were not nearly as iconic and recognizable as the songs in the first film. Really, the only scene I especially liked was the opening with ""Mr. Blue Sky"". The goofiness and camp was far too strong with this one. Everything from the freakishly bright and lurid colors to Starlord becoming a giant Pac-Man was just ridiculous. There was not a single genuine emotional moment (other than Yondu's death) that wasn't undercut by a poorly written, unfunny joke. Major character traits and arcs (most unfortunately, Drax's) were sacrificed for the purposes of comedy. And to top it all off, it was so painfully predictable that there was hardly any excitement or tension at all. If you didn't see that Ego was going to be evil a mile away, you probably have never seen a superhero movie before.<br/><br/>It had its moments; it wasn't bad through and through, but it was so disappointing compared to the first film that I can't help but loathe it."

"z-a-pliskin","4","3","8","3 September 2017"," ""I have famously huge turds."" Wut?
","Oh my¬Ö where to begin?<br/><br/>About an hour into watching the Blu-ray release I decided to critique what I'd seen and add to the list as I continued to watch the remaining hour and fifteen minutes. I went over the IMDb character limit and had to delete a lot of it. Never a good sign. Here's what remains after editing!<br/><br/>* The intro where the Guardians are fighting a giant space slug monster could have had a lot more depth to it, but instead it's the backdrop to Baby Groot (who can't be any help) dancing around to Mr Blue Sky by ELO. Merchandising for Baby Groot toys, that's why it's there.<br/><br/>* The people they're working for on this job are gold Egyptian statues, living in the discarded sets from the old Flash Gordon movie. Quill says ""hey, don't offend these people"" or words to that effect and then does, followed by Rocket stealing things they were hired to protect. Then him and Quill have a pointless argument in a magic asteroid field, which destroys their ship. Pointless conflict.<br/><br/>* Talking about destroying the Milano, it's reminiscent of a scene from Star Trek: Generations, where the saucer section from the Enterprise D crash lands on a forest planet. Here, Drax is trailing behind the ship on a cable getting bashed around on the trees unrealistically like some sort of video game character. I know these movies are about fantasy storytelling but this is just ridiculous.<br/><br/>* Nice to see Sly Stallone in this movie, I thought. Until he mumbled and stumbled his way through the main scene he was in. Using star power to shill a crap film? Check.<br/><br/>* Kurt Russell is an actor I like. He's an action star but able to do decent dramatic scenes too, got a bit of range. However here he's given some sort of deranged Christlike figure to play, who walks around on his acid flashback planet opening his arms wide, doing animated Powerpoint presentations using white egg pod things designed by Apple. This seems to keep most of the main cast distracted while Rocket and Groot are captured and there's some mutiny subplot involving Yondu resulting in them all being kept against their will.<br/><br/>* There's so much weak comedy shoehorned into this. The comedy in the original film had better pacing and built up to the moments nearly perfectly throughout. Case in point, the long drawn-out and not at all amusing scene where Rocket and Yondu are imprisoned and Groot has to try and find a replacement for the red arrow-controlling Mohawk on Yondu's head. This is so he can arrow through all the story problems - I mean prison bars and mutineers, sorry. He brings back item after item that isn't right and it's just tedious. In the first movie the arrow tricks were amazing because the story built up to using it just once, and then the scene where he did was so quick and well-executed it had a huge impact. Here it just doesn't. <br/><br/>* It's too heavy on the CGI and slow motion shots. It feels mercilessly overdone, like it's trying to distract us all from the massive story problems. Yondu/Rocket/Groot going through the jump points with giant wacky eyes or Gamorrah attacking Nebula with a ginormous Gatling gun that even Drax would struggle to carry, that's five times the size of her, Quill and Ego playing ""space catch"" with a ball made of energy for that family values in space moment - just three examples.<br/><br/>* Ego's plan is both baffling and disgusting. Basically he's some kind of immortal man-whore who's been spreading his seed across the galaxy, who comes back to enlist his children to help him turn all the planets into copies of his acid trip one. He does this by draining their life force, going back to their home planet via some weird glowing plant thing he's put there when he visited to knock up some poor unsuspecting girl, then using some weird blue energy mass that then consumes that particular planet. Using - I kid you not - a cheesy special effect reminiscent of that awful David Duchovny movie Evolution, or Galactus in Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer. It's just¬Ö horrible. Such a whiplash tone shift from what they were doing before as well, not that that was any good either. If I was a kid that would give me nightmares.<br/><br/>Overall this reminds me of the Star Wars prequels, by which I mean Episodes I-III. The cartoon set pieces, the endless overdone action scenes, flat characters, poor dialogue, story holes. Worst of all the jumping from planet to planet to ship to planet so quickly that it becomes hard to follow what's going on. It genuinely feels like this movie was written and directed by late 90s George Lucas, more concerned with cramming in merchandising opportunities than making a great movie. All those great character moments between the main cast have vanished here, they're all off doing random errands until they're obligated to meet up later to stop Admiral Nutcase aka Ego and be the heroes again.<br/><br/>I started grading this movie as a 4 after watching the first hour. Now I've watched all of it I can't give it more of a score than 1 because it's just dire. I got up to take a whiz at the one hour forty minute mark and actually turned to my girlfriend and said ""Oh my god there's still over half an hour of this travesty left"". Even the Stan Lee cameo was a roll eyes moment, they couldn't even get that right!<br/><br/>Avoid. I cannot stress this enough. One of the worst movies I've seen in years.<br/><br/>Best bit?

","This movie was so damn disappointing. There was barely anything good in it, I seriously don't understand how the hell did it get such good reviews from both critics and fans. I guess it's pretty easy to entertain dumb people.<br/><br/>I've seen the first one multiple times and I loved it. The characters were cool and lovable, the action scenes were well done and full of tension, the humor was good, but not overused and forced, it barely had any boring moments.<br/><br/>This movie though? It was a mess. I honestly don't know where to start.<br/><br/>The characters were basically dumbed down and less interesting versions of themselves from the first movie. All the time they're acting idiotic, saying pathetically written dialogue and dumb jokes, and then they suddenly go emotional, and I guess we were supposed to feel... sad, or something? Because that doesn't really work. It's like, I don't know, having one of those thieves in Home Alone have a mental breakdown in the middle of the movie. It just doesn't work. Kurt Russell's villain was ridiculous. He had a few jokes, a bunch of boooring exposition, and then he turned into a hilarious and completely unmenacing villain you can just cringe at. I love how everyone endlessly complained about Ultron two years ago, but no one had to say anything about this godawful villain. Those golden- skinned villains were even worse, I just wanted them to stop appearing in every few scenes. So unmenacing and lazily written. When that priestess announced that she will hunt them down again in the post-credit scene, I was like ""NO! GOD, PLEASE, NO!"" Sylvester Stallone's cameo was pretty pointless and distracting. Why couldn't they just leave his character out of the movie, or cast someone else? Who the hell asked for Stallone's mumbling botoxed ass in the MCU? <br/><br/>The action scenes were also ridiculous. None of them had any tension, I literally never felt like characters were in danger at all, because they just kept surviving the impossible and get rescued. The special effects were really weird and too colorful. Were the VFX supervisors of this movie gay? If not so, then why the hell was everything rainbow-colored? What the heck? You're not making a freakin' My Little Pony movie, for God's sake! The entire last action sequence was a bad joke, they went totally DC there. I just felt my brain cells dying off when Mantis managed to make Ego fall asleep when he was in his full supergod mode.<br/><br/>Now we come to the humor. There was a lot of it in the last movie too, but there it was just an icing on the cake and a fine addition to all the great character moments and exciting action scenes. Here... Urgh! It was overused to hell and back right from the start. Why isn't comedy one of this movie's genres on IMDb? Because every scene had at least three jokes, the movie completely relied on humor. And, to be honest, it didn't work either. The jokes were so unfunny. They felt so recycled and repetitive to the point where it actually got really annoying. I literally haven't even smirked even once during this movie, except for the Mary Poppins scene with Yondu. Also, did they really have to force at least one joke in every scene? Even in the ones that are supposed to be serious? Come on, guys! They even crammed unnecessary humor in the scenes where Drax talked about his brutally slaughtered family. That's just too damn much!<br/><br/>The ending was decent, I guess, but it's so obvious that they made it a total tear-jerker to get us emotional and make us forget how underwhelming the movie was.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie just felt so disappointing. It was nothing of an addition to the MCU. We could've had Thanos, one of the heroes from the other MCU movies, or even an Infinity Stone, but I guess James Gunn just wanted to make a pointless, dumbed down rehash of the first movie. I honestly didn't find it any better than Suicide Squad or Batman v Superman. I'm glad he won't be directing any of the Infinity War movies, the Russo brothers know how to perfectly handle MCU, unlike him. I guess he's just another one-hit-wonder."

And that is the biggest problem of this film I feel.<br/><br/>The plot is quite shallow, motivations of villain(s) and sometimes heroes are not expressed, and the whole movie felt like a filler for Marvel fans, to get their dose before Infinity War and save some introduction scenes in that movie. Some jokes were really good, but most felt forced and predictable.<br/><br/>We learn something more about the characters, sure, we get a lot of shooting and explosions and actors do their best, which sometimes feels like a waste of their capabilities in this movie. Its like doing a soup with only spice. It wont taste good without the veg and wont satisfy you without something substantial in it, but most people will eat it and pay for it anyway, even though inside they are still hungry.<br/><br/>POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD!!!

Rocket however, has stolen the batteries and in the ensuing battle with the Sovereigns they are saved by another spaceship but they have to crash-land on a nearby planet.

But is Ego all he seems? Meanwhile, Yondu (Michael Rooker: Jumper, The Bone Collector) and his team of Ravengers meet his old comrade Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone: Rocky, The Expendables) who has exiled Yondu for child trafficking, leading to some of the Ravengers questioning his leadership, even his normally loyal ally Kraglin (Sean Gunn: Super, TVs Gilmore Girls). The High Priestess of the Sovereigns then hire the Ravengers to find the guardians and their batteries, but once they capture Rocket, Groot and Nebula, the Ravengers, led by Taserface (Chris Sullivan: The Drop, Imperium), now stage a coup and Nebula leaves to track down and kill her sister, Gamora, who is already beginning to question Ego's motives and feels that Mantis knows more than she is letting on.<br/><br/>This film is that rare thing where the sequel is better than the first movie. We start with backstory from Peter Quill's past showing us his parents and then a wonderful slow-mo set piece set to one of the awesome tape songs with baby Groot just lighting up the screen. The essence of this movie is that it is so character-driven. Every one of the guardians gets to show their real selves and this is the movie that the blunt to the point of cruel Drax comes into his own. There are plenty of jokes and over-the-top wackiness but this is grounded with some excellent heart-wrenching moments that you just didn't get with the first movie. This time, you really care about the fun characters.<br/><br/>Fine acting throughout, but for me Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista and Michael Rooker were the stand-out performances. It did seem to lack a coherent storyline though, a clear goal, yet here is a non-stop sci-fi action comedy that feels it is beyond that, because it is just having too much fun in this 80s infused romp, complete with hilarious celebrity cameo.<br/><br/>Be sure to stay right until the end because there are five, yes count them, five end credit scenes that contain lots of Easter eggs.

The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that there was a bit too much focus on Groot at some points - other than that? 10/10. The feeling I had after the movie ended? I wanted to watch it again!<br/><br/>The visuals are great. The actors are great. The jokes and puns are on point! They keep true to Guardians of the Galaxy feel and the plot is amazing and different! Not that I was surprised, but this movie was solid!<br/><br/>People in here are giving bad reviews because ""it's not like the comics"". Not many of the Marvel movies are remotely close to the comics. They each have some elements from the comics, but as every Marvel fan should know: there are multiple story lines for each superhero. <br/><br/>I'd even go as far as to say that this movie is my all time favorite Marvel movie! Go watch it! Now!"

","What can i say? I love it, the cast, visual and practical effects, music, this movie really makes me laugh and cry at the same time, every character shines in their story arc, the thing i enjoy the film for what it is, forget about the nitpicking, and look at the positive elements in it, the standout to me were Dave Batista's Drax The Destroyer who is by far my favorite character since the first film and the most surprising highlight, here in Vol. 2 he did better and improved, he is the funniest and not only that you feel heartbroken and sad for him, imo the best character in the MCU"
"bk-05500","6","3","8","4 May 2017"," Good but no magic
","After having watched the first GotG a gazillion times I was SO looking forward to the sequel. It was definitely entertaining but fell short of the first one. You can tell they really were trying and tugging desperately at the viewers' heartstrings, but they were unable to capture the magic of the first one.<br/><br/>First, the music fell far short. I remember every single song in the first movie from my childhood, and they were all hits. This movie, I didn't recognize half of them and half of the rest were not big hits. Also, the timing and pacing of the music didn't work, pulled me out of the movie instead of tapping my foot and smiling like the first movie.<br/><br/>Second, (possible spoiler alert), in one scene there is a close-up of Gamora and her green skin makeup clearly looks unfinished. Terrible job and again, takes you out of the movie.<br/><br/>Third, too many scenes don't work (SPOILER ALERT). Nebula practically kills herself trying to kill Gamora, and minutes later the sisters practically forgive each other. I know the movie's theme was family, but it just felt so forced.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT) I did like the young Kirk Douglas in the beginning of the movie, that was amazing.<br/><br/>I won't be watching this one a gazillion times. Maybe just once more. It just didn't have the magic of the first one. Oh, but Groot was ADORABLE."

","Saving the Universe is bound to get you noticed, and in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"", we find the dysfunctional Guardians reaping the benefits of their newly found notoriety by being hired to resolve threats all over the galaxy.<br/><br/>The film opens with Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), and Groot (Vin Diesel), battling a gigantic creature at the request of a race known as the Sovereign. <br/><br/>During a frantic and hysterical battle the crew is eventually triumphant and accepts their payment, which is the form of Nebula (Karen Gillan), who the crew look to turn in for a very lucrative bounty and settle some old scores in the process.<br/><br/>Of course their naturally ability to find trouble arises thanks to Rocket, and soon they have a very large and motivated new enemy gunning for them which results in them crashing on a remote planet. A mysterious benefactor named Ego (Kurt Russell), arrives and claims to have a connection with Peter and he, Gamora, and Drax head off with Ego and his assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff), to his planet while the rest of the crew repair the ship.<br/><br/>As if things were not complicated enough, Yondu (Michael Rooker) and his crew of Revengers arrive hoping to collect a Bounty on the Guardians that has the group divided and facing serious danger. A new and greater threat is soon discovered and despite internal tensions and conflicts, the Guardians must once again risk everything to save the universe once again.<br/><br/>The new film hits the ground running with plenty of action and humor and gives the characters new and old plenty of great moments that really expand upon their characters. The only issue is that the film does have some slow pacing in the middle as we are given numerous CGI landscapes where the crew walks around talking, but little else. With such a large cast, this is done to allow the characters to grow and new ones to be properly introduced, but it can at times drag on. Thankfully the finale is filled with the trademark humor and action that fans have come to expect which although very CGI heavy does result in a very satisfying and surprisingly touching finale.<br/><br/>The cast works well with one another and the jokes fly frequently throughout. Writer/Director James Gunn has done a great job in expanding the characters and introducing new ones as we see new layers of complexity to the characters that explain their actions and motivations in ways not usually shown in comic themed movies. I would strongly suggest waiting through the credits for the numerous bonus scenes and keep an eye out during the film for some special surprises as the film is littered with them.<br/><br/>As the characters will soon transition to ""The Avengers: Infinity War"" which is currently filming audiences will not have to wait as long to see the dysfunctional Guardians family on their next outing, and thankfully we have an enjoyable new outing to enjoy until then. 4 stars out of 5"
"Neil-M09","7","3","8","3 May 2017"," Entertaining, with revelations and amazing visual effects
","Like many Sci-Fi movies, they are entertaining, they have good fights and flashy characters. This sequel has all this.<br/><br/>This time the plot, unlike the first film, has a little more drama, with family problems in fact, from sisters' relationship from Gamora and Nebula, Star- Lord meeting his father and the emphasis of the father-child relationship that Yondu kept with Star-Lord when his mother die. Oriented in a simple way, good against evil, with much more comedy than the prequel.<br/><br/>Now what stands out are two things, the mixes nostalgia with old songs in a futuristic environment and the visual effects, making colorful places of the galaxy, space traveling, bubbles and beautiful fireworks are just a part of it. So, maybe not a masterpiece, but really entertaining and solid Sci-Fi movie, isn't the best of Marvel in my opinion, yet among the top."
"FallenEye","6","3","8","2 May 2017"," GotG Volume, Mute.
","As much of a bigger, more extravagant, more visually stunning and far more expansive of an exhibition Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was, it suffered extraordinarily from seemingly becoming a mockery, or a parody of sorts, of its own profound self. A self inflicted injury sadly, that diminishes the enjoyment and deteriorates the intense core of the film.<br/><br/>One could argue that the dynamics of the actual guardians themselves is to express emotional connection to each other in a silly manner, because that is their language and it works for them, and us as the viewer just need to realize it, and understand it... Sadly though, that doesn't work for me. A vast majority of this films humor and silliness only achieved being a detergent to almost all the deeper elements Gunn was attempting to express.<br/><br/>Though GotGv2 may not be the weakest in the Marvel Universe, I do believe it is the one Marvel got the most wrong, because it had the most elements I've seen gotten right, just to fall victim to the most elements gotten wrong. Is it better than its predecessor or even Iron Man 2? Yes, yes it is... But, if they hadn't gotten it this wrong, the question could've been rather; Is it better than Captain America: Civil War. No question; with this particular final product, no, no it is not.<br/><br/>GotGv2 honestly, felt like a bouquet of eye-catching flowers that didn't belong together, and had conflicting aromas that in isolation were fragrant, but together, smelt like gasoline; A scent that for some, smells sinfully good, and for others, just bad.<br/><br/>The story was a tangent, and Gunn saw this, and tried to tie the knot stronger by bringing us closer to Rocket, but unfortunately, this was not enough. Tyler Bates' score, somewhat erratic. The performance from the stars, was so incredibly stifled by the script, and all that unnecessary humor.<br/><br/>GotGv2 could've obliterated its antecedent, but because it was only slightly better (and quite honestly, maybe even not better at all), means it disappointed greatly. It's not a matter of expectations not met, it's a matter of potential lost. The Guardians were ""on blast"", but their Galaxy, proved too vast a Volume 2 handle."
"mjplysaght","7","3","8","2 May 2017"," Definitely a spectacle, but not quite on par with the first
","I loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy. It introduced a lovable band of misfits very effectively. Now, as we move on to the sequel, roughly carrying on where we left off, a number of things are occurring to me.<br/><br/>A) Is this just going to be a re-thread of the first film, only with more quips and wise-cracks? B) Are we going to go more into character development? Will we know more about the characters motivations? C) Is this film going to contain more references to the MCU? The answer to A and B is yes. C, not so much. Guardians is very much in its own world, figuratively and literally.<br/><br/>We're reunited once again with Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and (Baby) Groot, who bring Nebula along as well. Yondu also comes to the forefront and everyone gets more character development, which is fun to see because everyone works so well off each other. After an interstellar mishap, they end up crashing on a nearby planet and end up meeting Ego, Quill's father and his associate, Mantis. However, while Quill is trying to form a bond with his father, things don't stay cheerful for long. The Guardians figure something's wrong and they take care of it.<br/><br/>So, overall, the film is entertaining, although I found it a little bit cluttered. The jokes were funny, don't get me wrong, and the visuals, once again, were stunning. However, some scenes didn't really mesh together tonally.<br/><br/>The characters were great though. Baby Groot won the hearts of everyone, and Drax and Rocket were by far the comical highlights. Star Lord once again tries to win the heart of Gamora, and Yondu has a change of heart after being exiled.<br/><br/>It's not the best film I've seen but it's definitely entertaining and action-packed. Definitely worth a look."
"iamjacksmoviechannel","6","3","8","1 May 2017"," The Learning Curve Movie
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is the sequel to the highly successful surprise hit of 2014 and damn, you gotta give James Gunn credit for that movie. It's hilarious and he managed to get a group of characters to the point where you understood the motivations of all of them, but they also managed to function as a very cool team.<br/><br/>You would think with Vol. 2 that now it's the easy part. They'll go on a mission together, the sarcastic ones will tell some jokes, we'll get to know a bit more about Gamora's dad Thanos, Peter will give us another Awesome Mix Tape, Baby Groot will say ""I am Groot"" over/under 500 times and there you go.<br/><br/>But while we can see snippets of the characters we loved so much in the first film, this movie is strange. Like there's no real plot to speak of but I don't think I was even able to realize that til about an hour in. It's very involved. Like most second movies it's trying to figure out where it should go from here, just not always successful. <br/><br/>Basically the Guardians have been lending their services out around the Galaxy, then Kurt Russell turns up as Peter's dad and he turns out to be a celestial planet whose been built into bio-form. So we'll get some bonding over harnessing Cosmos and classic rock, but never with the amount of feeling you might expect. <br/><br/>While Peter, Gamora, and Drax hang out on Planet Daddy, B-Groot and Rocket are in a pickle with Yondu and have to help him. So the group is separated from most of the movie and I felt it ate into some of the comedy. <br/><br/>There are other subplots like a will they or won't they romance between Peter and Gamora (which, you won't care), there's one about the Guardians pissing off the head of some Sovereign race (you can tell they're Sovereign cause they're done up like Oscars) and they keep coming back for a fight, Stallone also shows up in another.<br/><br/>Nebulla is brought in too because Gamora also needs some kind of family drama to deal with while Peter deals with his. I actually thought Nebulla would be the villain here but it appears Marvel has fixed it's villain problem¬Ö.by keeping the villain a secret til the last half hour. He's still bent on world destruction though.<br/><br/>But listen- all of this really does come off like Gunn is just trying to keep 10 plates spinning at once but it's not really bad so much as it's just hard to hang on to for long. There is still some fantastic stuff here and for every joke about Cheers or David Hasselhoff that seems played out, there are others that work excellently. <br/><br/>Drax doesn't get much to do plot-wise but Bautista couldn't do a better job of playing him. Drax is a lunatic, that big laugh just makes him more of a lunatic, and when he does a joke or a prank with a straight face; he is comedy gold. Rocket also brings the sarcasm, B-Groot is cute.<br/><br/>The action is also as cartoon-like over-the-top as it was in the first film, and Gunn gives us a humdinger of an ending battle sequence. His effects work here is like the best acid trip you've ever been on and he really does have a gift for attaching music to all this. <br/><br/>So overall, if you loved the first movie, you'll like this one. But this is a movie that's going to be overrated before people even see it. Some will expect more, some will just overblown the whole thing cause they love these characters. I think as we look back on it, it will be the movie in the series we'll all call fine but that was definitely a learning curve. <br/><br/>I go 6.5 out of 10. If you guys liked this, be sure to check me out on Youtube for more."

","I was a big fan of the first film and went to see the second one with some expectations and was not disappointed. Vol 2 is funny, interesting, touching and visually better looking than the first one. Some of the songs are very nicely chosen again for the scenes. <br/><br/>Although some characters might have lost some of the spotlight they had in the first one, some now have more. I especially liked Drax and Dave Bautista this time around. He was hilarious almost every time he opened his mouth. Also Yondu was a much better and had a pretty nice role in the story. <br/><br/>I was laughing a lot and in the end got slightly emotional, because of a pretty beautiful scene. Although it seemed to be slightly more serious than the first one, it still remained pretty light to watch. A great movie experience and looking forward for the next one."
"Troy_Campbell","8","3","8","30 April 2017"," A rollicking good time.
","Despite existing in the ludicrously popular Marvel Universe, the first GotG outing‚Äîfull of relatively unknown characters‚Äîhad minimal expectations attached to it. The follow-up, however, has big shoes to fill thanks to the immense popularity of the original. Whilst it falls slightly short of blowing minds like its predecessor, Vol. 2 is still a rollicking good time that boasts inventive action sequences, edgy humour and a titular ragtag group that are so likable you don't want to leave their company. Director James Gunn brings his idiosyncratic flair to the blockbuster realm once again, imbuing the set pieces with little flourishes that add an extra depth of awesomeness to the proceedings. A booby-trap battle in the jungle is creative and hilarious, the ballsy opening credits sequence is an absolute hoot, and a Yondu-centric annihilation aboard a spaceship is undoubtedly the standout set piece of the entire film. In fact, Yondu's stock increases dramatically: his screen time triples, his arc is integral to the plot, and he's handed the most badass moment of the movie. Michael Rooker is clearly having a blast playing the arrow-wielding anti-hero. Chris Pratt leads the way though, his easy charisma shining through as Star Lord. He also shares a wonderful chemistry with Zoe Saldana‚Äîas the tough as nails Gamora‚Äîwith their unspoken relationship building slowly throughout. Baby Groot is sure to be a hit with the younger audience members, but they return to that childish humour too often and the Groot-based jokes quickly become cutesy instead of cute. The biggest flaw is the finale; it's not quite blue-beam-from-the-sky bad, however it still suffers from the overwrought, CGI-hodgepodge requirement demanded of big budgeted affairs. All in all GotG Vol. 2 pushes past its flaws through sheer excitement, energy and passion, topped with another ripping soundtrack and multiple laugh-out-loud moments."
"SpoodermanDerp","9","3","8","30 April 2017"," ""And if you don't love me now""
","""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2"" benefits from an already scintillating cast of characters that are put into a plethora of undeniably vibrant and colorful adventures. Cutting through the childish jokes and somewhat random and unexpected conflicts, the film splits and presents the Guardians into groups that may not click with audiences at first. However, once the film picks up its pace near its third act it becomes nothing but pure glorious and genial fun as good as the first one at best.<br/><br/>Part of what made the original so brilliant was how organic the portrayal of its rag tag characters was. They were all broken, weird and made decisions that showed each character. The best thing you can do for your characters in the film and to have the audience like them is if you put them in a situation that is hard and have them make a decision that will reveal character. Lots of that showed up with Star Lord i.e. him saving Gamora in space and lending her his helmet instead of using it for his own gain. Groot sacrificing himself for the team. Rocket saving the people on the ground. Drax shooting Nebula to defend Gamora as a statement of their friendship and many more. However for this film, right from the start, the whole team gets on an adventure on a very small and preventable mishap. There would be some Empire Strikes Back parallelisms here if you look at how the film is structured, such as how they split each character into groups and let them develop. Some would say this was a very bad decision to make, splitting the main cast when them being together was probably the best part of this franchise. Despite this, the film ties up all loose ends up until the end and this film truly makes the team realize how much they needed each other. For the first half, the film was very slow and had a very weird and inorganic flow. Lots of things kept happening so fast and sometimes become unbelievable, and you would sometimes roll your eyes in the jokes that didn't work at all. Despite all of this, that shouldn't take you away from the joyous and unorthodox world Marvel strikes you back in and added a whole lot more. Every frame in this film is vibrant and are never dull unlike the bleak and standard colors that plague the usual MCU films like Civil War and Ultron. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Dave Bautista and to an extent Vin Diesel all do their jobs so significantly well and they are all such a joy to watch individually. The humor is definitely out of this world and may seem very childish considering the context of a very different galaxy that differs from our own culture. But even then the saturated humor is cancelled out by the once again amazing soundtrack and vivacious world building. Kurt Russell as Peter's Dad works as this incredibly innocuous character that serves and benefits Peter's own mysterious arc. Michael Rooker as Yondu also serves as an interesting and unexpected addition to an already jam packed cast. Everything at the start feels unhinged, there is an unclear goal, and the stakes haven't risen. With no goal influencing a character and everything feeling static a bit static, the conflict/s at the start sometimes feel lackluster. It is when the huge reveal happens wherein you are given all the dots to connect, you finally get a goal for each character, and you finally feel the stakes being raised. Although, maybe some would say it should've been earlier, the fact that the reveal happens to open up the third act all the more shows the growth each character achieved throughout the course of the first and second act making each of their actions seem more emotionally packed and more worth it. The action scenes in this film are just absolutely amazing as well accompanied with an astounding soundtrack, definitely up there with Doctor Strange. James Gunn has also mastered hitting up the galaxy with balls to the wall weird and hilariously intricate details. All of these that add to the already diverse and magnificent world of the MCU. In the end, GOTG 2 compliments an already established cast of characters from a bunch of nobodies to a legendary pop icon for years to come.<br/><br/>Verdict: 8.5/10"
"visionaforethought","8","3","8","30 April 2017"," Funny and equal to or better than the first
","Surprised at some of the reviews stating this was not as good as the first. I saw and loved the first when it was first released, and then caught (the original) on Sky Movies just a few days before seeing GOTG2, so came into the 2nd one with very fresh memories.<br/><br/>MINOR SPOILER...<br/><br/>The humour in the 2nd instalment was superb from the get go and didn't really let up, making it all the more enjoyable. I also thought the visuals were outstanding and certain scenes reminded me of What Dreams Become.<br/><br/>One observation that applies to other movies I have seen in public recently: Myself and those I went with are in our 50s and laughed out loud throughout, whilst NOT ONE person younger than about 30 even sniggered. I do worry that millennials have been so brainwashed by contemporary humourless culture and PC attitudes that they just don't get it. The script was tack sharp and it pains me that people even in their 30s are either too stupid or too I don't know what to get it.<br/><br/>Very worrying for the future of humanity if you ask me! Very dystopian and ironically, the opposite of the world features in GOTG.<br/><br/>Anyway, 2 was a character movie and sets us up nicely for the next one.<br/><br/>Cannot wait for Mixtape 3!"
"coreyjdenford","8","3","8","28 April 2017"," We Are Groot
","This review of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is spoiler free<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>THE MAIN WEAPON behind the first Guardians of the Galaxy was surprise. From the time of unveiling to the release it's fair to say Marvel knows how to keep our patience. Of course after release who knew that one of our new favourite groups of superheroes would be a former wrestler, a hyper-engineered Racoon with a will for people to hate him, an anthropomorphic 8-foot tall tree and a homicidal green lady? And the helmsman of the group is the fat guy from Parks and Recreation.<br/><br/>But this, of course, didn't stop Marvel and they had another success on the hands, which became one of the highest grossing films of 2014 and be one of the best films in that same year. Writer-director James Gunn was happy that the film was a success and just to seal the deal and decided to return to ground-breaking form, with his highly anticipated, albeit, well-needed sequel to his space romp. <br/><br/>And so, with this in mind and a little bit of egotistical annoyance, we were ready for the ride, it's here at last, and it's safe to say ""We are Groot."" <br/><br/>Our minds are kept at ease, and the first hour to Gunn's sequel is a success from the moment of opening the audience are looking with an un-blinking eye. To open, we get our team of misfits all in one go ready for a fight as usual, there's Peter Quill (a.k.a Starlord) the only human of the group amped with his facemask and his trusty Sony Walkman, then there's Gamora (Saldana) with an insight to killing, Rocket Racoon (Cooper) the hyper-engineered rodent the let's say the comedian of the group who's always ready for a one-side banter aimed at his team, finally there's Drax the Destroyer after being bent on revenge in the film's predecessor is ready for another fight. <br/><br/>Of course, it's not all tongue-and-cheek with this team there's a hidden message in them: that is family, what better way to show that they're a family than by shouting at each other? There's another path though behind the film's sass there's still the flare that keeps this team going whether they're tagging a place with Rocket's traps, planning on a fight and, well, in Peter's mind, dancing to some of his favourite tunes. Keen to find out where or who he came from he goes in search for that fatherly figure, thankfully that comes, namely with Kurt Russell's Ego, a multi millennia year old humanoid with one path to get to know his son. <br/><br/>This bodes for the film for some time, until it hits a wall there's a flaw, for almost the entire second act GOTG2 is stagnate in a father-son reunion. It stays on this for quite some time, but thankfully due to some hilarious utterances, gnarly sass and teamwork the film stays together and never gets dull. Also there's a side to Russell that we have never seen before when he unleashes his ego. <br/><br/>It's the third act that's the shiner, well for the most part it's actually the team who shine the brightest, for all their moments of shouting and threatening to break up their brotherly-sisterly friendship they stay together, during their most intense battle (which thanks to the effects team on the outside looks stunning. Even though Vol. 2 isn't perfect there's a shining light that bears down on us all and keeps the big grin from ear-to-ear and no matter how much the film stagnates it's still dare we say marvellous.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Director Gunn returns to Ground-breaking in his highly anticipated albeit well-needed sequel to his far-out space romp, are the A-holes back? It's safe to say they are."

","This movie is a masterpiece. I watched it in Germany, where it started a day ago. Without telling any spoilers I can tell you the first 5 minutes of GOTG2 was better than most of the so called Blockbuster movies from the past 5 years all together! Everything on this movie and it's story is perfect! Yes, it's even better than the first one. The characters are working great and their chemistry is really special. This is what makes the action and the humor working 100%. You always feel with every one of the characters. This is what makes the movie an instant classic. Remember the iconic scenes form Indiana Jones, E.T., Star Wars? This movie has them all... and it feels like they come every 5 minutes. Wow! This is how a movie should look and feel like. Loved it and will love it for the years to come! Really really great stuff here and you have to watch this on the big screen."

","Better villain, better story, more action, more music, more of everything that made the first one good.<br/><br/>The flaws come in two parts. <br/><br/>Part 1: It is a sequel. It has an incredible story and of course new characters but you won't have a unique overall experience unless of course this is your first Guardians movie. <br/><br/>Part 2: This is the key flaw and the main reason why this gets a 9/10 for me. It is still movie aimed at a young audience. This movie has a lot more humor than the first and that's good on paper but it also means a lot more jokes that I didn't find funny. If you watch this in a full cinema, preferably with some kids or you laugh easily then this won't be an issue for you."

","A unique presentation for Marvel fans wanting an added complexity amidst the well-retained humor and action of its predecessor. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 brilliantly illustrates new depth for all its main characters. Which is a particularly difficult task considering how many of them there are.

"Councillor3004","Null","3","8","27 April 2017"," Decent sequel with some hilariously entertaining moments
","Being someone who is not the greatest fan of the Marvel universe, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me. This movie is defined by its entertainment factor, which may cause it to be regarded as a typical mainstream Hollywood blockbuster. However, the movie once again manages to cleverly combine an interesting story with entertaining characters and stunning visual effects. While the first movie already included several overwhelming effects, this sequel provided some gorgeous images which were an absolute feast for the eye.<br/><br/>For a movie with such a huge cast, featuring five protagonists and a huge amount of secondary characters, it was able to find a fine balance between the story line and the character development. It may easily happen for this kind of movies to feature certain characters more prominently than others and to push some of them into the background, but even though it sometimes took a few minutes to return to some characters as they were all scattered to the four winds, the movie balanced each character's appearances out and allowed them all to appear equally often. Of course, the adorable Baby Groot caused a huge amount of hilarious moments, while Peter Quill and Gamora, the protagonists known from the movie's predecessor, are developed more intimately as we delve into their pasts and get to know members of their families.<br/><br/>Some moments do actually feel quite forced or even cheesy, but thankfully, the movie never takes itself too seriously which basically doubles the entertainment factor. The script is not the strongest, but it does surpass expectations (at least mine), considering that many superhero/space opera flicks lack enormously when it comes to the writing. The movie feels like it is driven by its characters, which should always be the most important thing - it won't bring any pleasure to the viewers if the visual effects are exciting and the action is breathtaking, but you simply can't find any characters to root for. Even the most gorgeous cinematography will not please viewers if it is impossible to get attached to the characters, but unlike some other movies of its kind, the sequel to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" managed to combine both aspects in a satisfying way.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect movie, it's far from being a masterpiece, but within its genre and the expectations raised by the hype which was developed after the first movie, it is going to please most fans of the first movie and is definitely worth a watch if you can forgive some weaker moments in the writing. The movie is all about the entertainment, so if that is what you expect from it, then I can certainly recommend watching it. I would actually urge you to go watch it at the cinema - I saw the first movie at home on my laptop, and the second movie felt a lot more intense to me when watching it on the big screen."

When you see Baby Groot starts the music, you know that this film is going to be fun. I am praising Dave Bautista, his character is so lovable and enjoyable to watch. Every time you hear him laugh you'll laugh with him. His jokes are too funny! The characters development have improved, Draxs being Draxs, Rockets using more of his traits and gadgets and Gamora and Peters relationship have increase. The film was going great but the story goes extremely wild and very far fetch. When you see it you'll be like WTF?!??

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the 15th film in the juggernaut that is the MCU. The first Guardians film was a massive surprise to all including me. Many people have it as their top MCU film. With that, it's safe to say that Vol. 2 has a large expectation on it's shoulders.<br/><br/>My thoughts on the film have swayed very back and forth in the 24 hours since I've seen it. When I walked out I was really high on it, however as the hours went on I was getting a little lower and lower, and then it changed again. Is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 on the same level as the first film? No, but it didn't need to be. <br/><br/>Guardians 2 is a different beast. Of all the MCU films, I thought that this one had the most heart of any of them and it was more of a personal story rather than the big galactic space battles we got in the first installment. Guardians of the Galaxy doesn't work without the level of characters that they have and they really understood that they were this franchises biggest asset. What I really liked about the characters was that you could tell time had passed since the last film. Their team dynamic was different, they had different interactions, each character had evolved in some way which felt natural. While talking about characters, I need to point a few out. Personally I had 2 stand out characters. This however does not count Baby Groot because while I loved every scene with him, it was a given that he was going to be up there with everyone's favourite characters. But the characters that stood out to me most was Drax and Yondu. They used Yondu so well in this film. Of all the character, he had the most moments of heart and when he was on the screen you could really feel that coming through. Moving onto Drax, I think he was my favourite. He was so perfectly written for in every way. He was the character you could see had evolved the most from the first film and they really took full advantage of him.<br/><br/>There was some really great relationships that took place and built over the movie but one I need to touch on is Gamoa and Nebula. I know a bit of their backstory from the Infinity Gauntlet comic so it is always cool to see them both on screen together. I really liked how they handled their relationship throughout the movie. You understood why they are the way they are towards each other and you got to see them understand each others point of view. By the look of it, their relationship is going to play a big part further down the track so it was really good to see if fleshed out.<br/><br/>Still into characters, I need to talk about the new introductions. Firstly, Sylvester Stallone had a great small role. I wasn't expecting much from him but I really enjoyed what we did get from him when he was on screen.<br/><br/>Pom Klementieff as Mantis was a great addition to the cast. She played really well off Drax and I think her character was one of the main reasons I enjoyed Drax so much.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Kurt Russell as Ego. As someone who has a little knowledge on Ego, I was interested to see how they managed to pull him off and I think they did a fairly good job at explaining how a plant is a human.<br/><br/>And finally, Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha, leader of the Sovereign. Unforunatley this is where I get a bit into the negatives. While I thought Debicki was great as Ayesha and her and the Sovereign were a nice introduction, I felt that they misused the Sovereign a little bit. They were great first act villains however I thought they hung around a bit too long. By the looks of it we are getting more Sovereign in the third installment, which I'm okay with because I want to learn more about them however in this film, their presence felt very out of place in some moments.<br/><br/>Now I have to talk about what had me so unsure about this film. This is the Guardians last on screen appearance before Infinity War (not counting any post credit scenes they might be in). Because of that I felt like I wanted to see more of a pathway formed as to why they will be present in the film. I know that the Thanos tie is strong however I felt like I needed that little bit more of a nod to what else is happening around the universe. However the more and more I thought about it, my feelings towards it changed. I view most Marvel movies now as chapter X in the MCU, therefore this was chapter 15 of the MCU. But this movie shouldn't be viewed as that. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 shouldn't be seen as chapter 15 of the MCU's story, it should be seen as chapter 2 in the Guardians story. This film was the perfect sequel to Guardians 1 and I think in a few years time when you watch all Guardians films back to back without the context of the MCU, they are going to tell a story about a group of misfits coming together to save the galaxy.<br/><br/>Overall, while it didn't quite reach the heights of the first film, it didn't need to for me. I needed more of the characters I love and I got that. I got more humour then the first, I got a greater insight into who these characters are and I left the film feeling like I knew the Guardians more personally.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"Chiller7","6","3","9","20 August 2017"," Simple dumb fun, which could be good or bad, depending on your tastes
","The *Marvel formula* is back. By now the famous Marvel formula has been so successful for the Marvel movies that not only do they not have any reason to ever surprise us by giving us anything new, but they're actually doubling down on the weaker aspects of their formula: Interruptive jokes, underdeveloped villains, and the same old recycled plot where the world/planets/dimensions are threatened, but despite the massive scale of events, things never actually get serious enough for any viewers to be afraid the heroes won't save the day, and even before it's over, you already know that the inconsequential events of this week's episode will probably be by wrapped up by the end credits and forgotten by the time of the next Marvel movie.<br/><br/>Marvel must have some sort of mandate to never let any of their movies go for more than a couple minutes at most without another interjected joke. It's like they deliberately pepper in jokes to desperately avoid ever taking themselves too seriously. It's gotten to the point where it's not natural humor anymore; they just have to constantly interrupt the flow of the movie to insert jokes - and, in the case of this movie, not even particularly witty jokes, but extended juvenile back-and-forth conversations about nipples, penises, and turds... I wish I was making that up. <br/><br/>But despite all of the above, I'm not saying don't watch it. If you watch it expecting nothing beyond simple dumb fun entertainment, which is what it is, then you might enjoy it."
"DarkLights95","10","3","9","6 May 2017"," One of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe villains
","Marvel has done it once again. This movie was amazing from start to finish. This movie literally has it all. I personally enjoyed this more than the first one, due to the fact that I love when movies flesh out their characters and gives us a look at why they actually feel a certain way and what they gone through. As much as a disappointment Iron Man 3 was , I still enjoyed how Marvel were trying to make a personal drama story about Tony Stark, and that was good, its just the other story bits in the movie that were bad. Logan is another great example of fleshing out characters. This movie doesn't go to the extent of Logan, but still went to a good amount where you were watching and thought ""oh now I know why Nebula is so angry..."". Movie also had one of the best villains of the universe(Majority of Marvel movies have weak and forgettable villains. This one wasn't)/<br/><br/>Guardians Of The Galaxy 2 gets a 10/10. Cant wait to see them join Avengers 3!"
"mark-durfor","7","3","9","1 May 2017"," The Guardians are Still Fun and Still Rocking
","Three years ago, the earthling Peter Quill A.K.A. Star Lord (Chris Pratt) acquired a mysterious orb that put his life in danger. Hunted by the villain Ronan the Accuser, Quill assembled a team of intergalactic misfits who teamed up to stop Ronan and save the galaxy in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. Quill was accompanied by Gamora (Zoe Saldana) a green orphan from an alien world raised to be an assassin; a physical brute named Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista); Groot (Vin Diesel) who is basically a giant walking tree with limited communication skills; and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) a raccoon bounty hunter / mercenary.<br/><br/>Groot is back and adorable. Though the giant tree perished in Volume 1, Rocket replanted a piece of his friend that has produced the offspring, Baby Groot for Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2. The unspoken sexual tension (ala Sam and Diane from Cheers) between Quill and Gamora is palpable, but endearing and sweet. And, as expected, another epic soundtrack accompanied this movie, including the ending credits from David Hasselhoff. As a child, not knowing who his father was, Quill would tell other children that the Knight Rider was his dad. But Volume 2 answers that question for us.<br/><br/>We don't learn too much from the preview. We can tell the action and animation is at least on par with Volume 1. It was. We saw that the humorous one-liners would be flowing plentifully. They were. We know all our favorite characters are back and some new ones will be introduced. But, we don't get too much of a plot reveal from the preview. Well, if you don't want any spoilers, here where you stop reading. <br/><br/>Volume 2 opens with Ego (Kurt Russell) and Meredith (Laura Haddock) driving in 1983 with the radio blasting and Meredith singing, truly where Peter got his passion for music. The two young lovebirds run into the woods where Ego shows her a beautiful exotic blue plant. As he vaguely describes what it is, she says she doesn't understand what he's saying but loves the way he says it. She can't believe she fell for a space man.<br/><br/>Thirty-four years later, Star-Lord and his fellow Guardians have been hired to fight off an intergalactic monster trying to steal a valuable source of power. It's a cute seen that is pretty much Baby Groot dancing while the Guardians take down the beast. They return to collect their prize for a successful mission: Gamora's sister Nebula (Karen Gillan). They don't get along and Gamora is going to turn her in for the bounty on her. They don't make it that far as their ship is attacked by the very same creatures that employed them because Rocket, couldn't resist stealing some of the valuable cargo they were tasked to protect. They set their course for the nearest safe planet, but they were outnumbered and it looked like all hope was lost until one solo ship appeared and the pursuing armada was completely decimated in an instant. After crashing on the planet, their savior ship appears and Ego emerges, immediately revealing himself as Peter's father. Ego, with his companion Mantis (Pom Klementieff) convince Peter, Gamora and Drax to return to his planet for further explanation while Rocket, Baby Groot and Nebula stay behind with the damaged ship.<br/><br/>That's where the big reveal happens. Ego is not a human. He is a god. The planet is his and he is the only inhabitant, other than the alien orphan he has with him, Mantis. He has fathered many children throughout the galaxy, but Peter is the only one who carried his god-gene that Ego needs to take over the universe. The epic battle ensues on many levels, but culminates on Ego's planet as the Guardians again must save the Galaxy. I won't tell you how it all ends, I think I've revealed enough plot-spoilers at this point.<br/><br/>Most of the star prediction was based on Volume 1 since the preview didn't reveal much about Volume 2. But it was a successful preview for two reasons. First, there was just too much to reveal. I just scratched the surface of all the plot twists and reveals that are jam-packed into this sequel. In addition to that, there are more characters and special appearances in the film. But, if the preview clued you in to their roles, it wouldn't have been as fun when they popped up on screen. So kudos for keeping those nuggets to themselves. Second, it gave you enough to make you want to come see it. Basically, the preview said, if you liked the first one, everything you loved about it will be in the second one. And it was all there. It was fun, original, enjoyable and more than just a sequel. I gave Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 a 3.5 star prediction: worth the money in the theatres, something I'd watch again, and a contender for my home collection. I was right on and I'm sticking with my 3.5 Stars. Fans of the comic, fans of sci-fi action movies, fans of Marvel, fans of the first movie, they will all be quite pleased with Volume 2. So, what movie"
"cary-02582","9","3","9","30 April 2017"," Vol. 2 is a Hit!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It provided as much action and as many laughs as I had hoped that it would. It's not a perfect movie, but how many movies are? I could say that I liked the way this was done, or didn't like the way that was done, but there really isn't any point. As a whole it delivered what I thought that it would, and anybody who enjoyed the first movie should enjoy this one. I just love the characters, and for the principal characters I think that the films have been well cast. I don't think that this movie will cross the $1 billion mark gross wise, but it is more than capable of surpassing the mark of the original installment. Is it as good as the first? For me, too early to tell yet. I will have to watch them back-to-back after the blu-ray release.......even then I still might not be able to choose :)"

The sound track for it was very upbeat as was the movie I general which I like and is a difference from most movies today as the happiness in it wasn't usually bad jokes or cringy moments that are forced and don't seem right.

"sarah_mccully","8","2","5","21 September 2017"," A great sequel and a lot of fun!
","Read my full review here: www.havekidwillteardrop.com<br/><br/>This is one of the best sequels I have seen come out of a series. It doesn't feel like a bridge to the next movie. It is great as a stand alone film and keeps the viewer engaged the whole time. There is so much more of the story told here, lots of answers are given that were left hanging in the first film,and the characters become richer and more developed as the story progresses. Relationships are changing too, which is fun to see and as a ""family"" forms and more people are brought into the fold, this is bound to happen. Plus, Baby Groot completely steals the show. Could he be any cuter, seriously?!<br/><br/>The movie is high action although I feel it was more violent than the first. The death count was certainly higher. I also felt this movie has a lot more humor and over all joy than the first movie. The jokes are a bit cruder and there are sexual innuendo, penis jokes, and general 'potty humor'. Crass language was kept to a minimum, but there is a modicum of it sprinkled throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Holding true to the first movie, the soundtrack to GotG Vol 2 is stellar and I think anyone who was alive in the 80's in the US will appreciate that. My British husband wasn't as keen on the music, but he doesn't have the same nostalgia I do.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film if you love Guardians. I don't think you will be disappointed in the slightest!"

","An excellent film. Whereas the atmosphere changes from Volume 1 this movie tops it, at least in my opinion. Major reveals of character backgrounds in the movie with a bit of a twist, of course. In fact, I'd say quite a twist, and an enjoyable one at that ! It's got funny moments, some romantic tension and some sad, even tragic moments that might make you shed a tear or two.<br/><br/>You also have an amazing soundtrack and baby Groot !"

","Fun sequel to the original. True, it wasn't the surprise hit the first one was, but was really enjoyable nonetheless. Can't believe some of the negative comments for a movie that, for a sequel, was pretty darn good. The story was a solid continuation of the first, some of the characters from the first movie got more development, plus you get some new ones. Particularly liked Baby Groot's ""growth"" during the film. Definitely worth seeing: exciting and funny. Go Guardians!"
"chazzheaton","6","2","5","11 September 2017"," Stick To The First One!
","Man, I was really looking forward to this movie. I loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy. This however, was kinda boring. The producers looked at what worked in the first Guardians of the Galaxy and said ""hey we'll do that again"" without actually thinking *why* it worked. An example is the soundtrack, usually the songs on the tape would be playing for the characters in the movie; when Peter is in the hospital, when he's on that abandoned planet, when he's dancing with Gamora etc. However in GOTG2 the 70/80s music just plays for the sake of it and selling more soundtracks. <br/><br/>The 80s references felt misplaced and forced, the pac man reference at the end made me cringe. The CGI looked really bad, I mean, *really* bad. It felt like there were hardly any sets and the team just said ""we'll just CGI the whole thing"". If it looks bad now the film is not going to age well at all. <br/><br/>I did think that it was a funny movie, though. The humour has carried on from the first movie and it did make me laugh out loud. The main characters are written really well even though there's quite a few of them to fit on screen in 2 hours. <br/><br/>The plot could have been better, I felt like it was pointless really. I would have preferred if there was a movie of guardians just going around the universe being The Guardians of the Galaxy. this is just Peter and his dad issues."
"billsuon","5","2","5","11 September 2017"," Three words...
","This movie can be summed up in three words: trying too hard. <br/><br/>The humor in this sequel, instead of being genuinely witty as in the first Guardians of the Galaxy, feels like someone telling obvious jokes and laughing at them at the same time to convince their audience that the jokes are funny when in fact they're barely amusing.<br/><br/>This is a franchise that's become too self-conscious too soon. Maybe some new writers should be brought on board for Guardians 3. James Gunn is doing a great job as director but he seems to have reached his limits as a writer.<br/><br/>Another proof of that might be the story in itself, which strives to be epic but ends up being barely more than a family anecdote. Despite all the effects and the multiplicity of characters, I can't help thinking that this could've been a stage play. That's how freaking small the overall plot is.<br/><br/>One last thing that really bothered is the overuse of music. Again, an effect of self-consciousness about what was popular about the original Guardians, this time abused until it makes you sick, on top of spoiling what should've been awesome action sequences.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 5/10 because it's not a bad movie, but it's so loaded with bad decisions that I wish they had gone with another script."
"damianjwolf","4","2","5","9 September 2017"," The Guardians are chased around the Galaxy in a Humorous and Action filled Film
","This Movie will Probably be one of the most Humorous in 2017. The film showcased a lot of Friendly Banter between the main squad, which added up to be Hilarious. However, It did Lack in Story line. The way I see the plot is: The Guardians Land on this Planet, where Peter Meets his Father, and then his Father takes him back to his home planet, which is where they spend the last hour and a half catching up about everything, and it all ends with the death of his Father. Doesn't seem like a very interesting plot to me. I would definitely say that the first one was better in overall Cinematic Areas (Score, Action, Humour etc.). I wouldn't recommend Buying this Movie, maybe a casual watch when it comes on Netflix."

Everything starts to suck. In order to explain the missing bits from the previous installment, the writers start to treat the audience like we are 5 year olds - uninteresting Dad son moments, literal video game sounds, annoying romantic moments(certainly not funny if that was the intention) and that's where one starts to lose interest. I could barely watch the whole movie and not sure on what basis other users have written such positive reviews.<br/><br/>The bottom line is the movie seems like its meant to entertain kids & kids only!

"pc95","5","2","5","25 August 2017"," Polished Fluff
","(spoilers) Unfocused and overlong, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 suffers a bit from writer's burnout, and the clich√É¬©d sequel's curse. It's pretty difficult to duplicate original magic in Cinema of big hits and so this one follows the pattern. It has an overindulgence in 70s and 80s soundtrack which gets tiresome. While it has a few clever bits of humor with Groot, David Haselhoff and Pacman , it lacks a focused coherent story that the original possessed, and feels like fragmented occurrences. And while the original was a preferred 66/33 mix of seriousness/humor this sequel reverses the mix - and the seriousness and pathos comes too little too late. It's not a bad movie but it doesn't make it to its predecessor's entertainment level and is a tiresome retread. Only toward the last 15 min does it gain some pathos it sorely lacks for the first 100 min or so. 5.5/10 - Mixed to poor."

"Vishal_s_kumar","9","2","5","20 August 2017"," Are we saving the Galaxy again!!!???
","There's no mistaking that the Guardians of the Galaxy films have focused on the family, not necessarily blood relations -- even if one particular character's blood relations have drawn the most curiosity from fans since the first released -- but rather the bond between friends, that familial, tightly knit tie that's stronger than the weapons each guardian wields in their various misadventures in saving the galaxy, all set to a killer soundtrack. Vol. 2 only expands on that sense of connection as it reveals the series' biggest secret to date -- the identity of Peter Quill's father -- that in turn only prompts more questions and, unsurprisingly, a whole lot of wickedly fun action and more great tunes. Though this film isn't quite as narratively fantastic as the original, it's still a joyride of epic proportions, a smart, snazzy, and downright funny film that maintains that perfect elemental balance and delivers what is arguably the most purely enjoyable spectacle film 2017.<br/><br/>The Guardians -- Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) -- have been hired by Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), leader of the Sovereign People, to protect their immensely powerful and infinitely valuable batteries. The Guardians' prize is not wealth but rather Nebula (Karen Gillan), Gamora's sister and a rogue who was captured attempting to steal the batteries. The Guardians are successful in their mission, but sly Rocket pockets some of the batteries for himself. That results in the Sovereign fleet chasing them down and, despite the Guardians' best efforts (and too much testosterone-fueled piloting one-upmanship between Peter and Rocket), forcing them down on Planet Berhert. As Yondu (Michael Rooker) tracks the Guardians under Ayesha's orders, the Guardians meet Ego (Kurt Russell), a man who holds the answer to one of the great secrets of the universe.<br/><br/>Guardians Vol. 2 not only continues the story as it began in the first, it maintains the same boisterous spirit, arguably more critical to the film's success than even any narrative connections or dramatic developments. Few films are so dependent on identity as these, and Director James Gunn, who also helmed the original, never allows the movie to miss a beat, whether in its most insanely over-the-top action scenes, its comical overtones, or its most intimate character moments, all of which often intertwine into the same sequences. Though it may be overlong by a few minutes, it captures that same beat that's partly its heartbeat soundtrack and partly its lifeblood rhythm which comes from the uncannily strong connection shared amongst the cast and the characters they portray that plays right into the franchise's core strength of family. Even as secrets are revealed, new characters are introduced, as humor abounds, as explosions dot the movie's landscape, as character quirks and quips flow like running water, Gunn and company maintain a harmonious, connective balance that through all the bickering, mayhem, reveals, tunes, and trials keeps the movie feeling fresh, invigorating, and always in-tune with its strengths, what its fans want, what its characters and universe need. Few films and franchises come as harmoniously precise as this.<br/><br/>The movie's character-driven heart and its perfectly tuned complimentary soundtrack -- so finely integrated into the movie it's almost a surprise that Cameron Crowe's name isn't in the credits somewhere -- are matched by a barrage of awe-inspiring visuals effects, a seamless blast of intergalactic goodness where every zippy spaceship, weird alien landscape, and fantastic creature isn't just plopped in digitally, they all appear organically integrated one with the other. The film outdoes even its predecessor in terms of scope and digital perfection. There are moments when the artificiality of it all is perceptible, but not particularly bothersome. Given the diversity of the cast and all of the abundant colors and the many supporting practical elements, the viewer never feels overwhelmed even as the movie throws so much stuff onto the screen, even through the most fearsome, chaotic action scenes. Gunn makes sure every shot has a focus, serves a purpose, and that even when visual effects are centre screen, they're not centre emotionally. Truly, all of the complimentary digital bits -- even fully digital characters -- melt into the greater whole as the humour takes hold, the soundtrack takes shape, and the story comes into focus. As with everything else, even when it would seem there's some element that would overwhelm a lesser film, Guardians Vol. 2 manages to maintain harmony from start to finish. It's an incredible technical achievement but even more an incredible thematic achievement, too. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 may be a smidgen less of a film than its predecessor, but it's still a blast of a movie, telling a quality story supported by seamless visuals, a stellar soundtrack, perfect humour, and more goodness from its terrific ensemble cast. It's the quintessential spectacle film, a near flawless sequel, and promises more epic goodness whenever the Guardians again return to the screen."

","Now that all of the characters are friends, I feel like the movie isn't as good as the first because there are no character bonding scenes other then Star Lord and Gamora. This movie is mostly about Star Lords farther and his story. Personally I think the original film's villain was better than the first. Baby Groot was a great decision from James Gunn, it's a cute thing that can make great merch. Yondu is much better in this film from the first, he questions why he is stealing, being mean and killing? The comedy has maintained great throughout both movies. In this movie there are two villains, the father and the gold people. The father is a great villain, Star Lord has a connection with him which makes it harder to kill him and the father is a truly sick man. BUT the gold people are one of the worst villains in a marvel film I've ever seen. Whenever there was a scene with them you really just wanted it to be over, there was a repetition of them always chasing them in their ships. Throughout the movie the soundtrack is amazing! Personally the best scene in the film was the first scene because it was all action.<br/><br/>This movie was great, it was not as good as the first one. It was still an amazing film, it was more emotional than funny. The first was more funny than emotional which is why I prefer the first movie.<br/><br/>I give Guardians of The Galaxy: Vol 2: 7/10"

","I have a degree is English literature from the University of Washington. This qualifies me for only two things; I can teach, and I can be a snob about movies. I read some of the bad reviews of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and I was ready to hate it. Surprise! It's really enjoyable. OK, when we compile our lists of the most influential movies we've seen, this won't be on anyone's list. It breaks no new ground. The characters don't develop much. The plot has so many holes you could drain your pasta. Boo hoo! Cry me a river.<br/><br/>It's fun. The special effects are amazing. The colors are brilliant. The action is well-paced. For the haters, get over yourselves. It's not that kind of movie. You like all the characters. Even the villains are thoroughly enjoyable. The violence is slapstick, and makes you smile. You know nothing bad is going to happen to anyone important. Even when bad guys die, it's nothing more than a ""darn it, you got me"" moment. <br/><br/>Is Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 a great movie? No. Should you expect to enjoy it? Yes! (Unless you sat on something, and it's still lodged firmly inside you.) Will I watch the inevitable Vol 3? You betcha. Can't wait!"
"paul_haakonsen","7","2","5","15 August 2017"," It went to a much bigger scale...
","I am not much of a fan of the superhero genre or Marvel movies in general, but I actually think that the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie from 2014 was the best of all Marvel movies so far. So I needed little convincing in order to go to watch ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"".<br/><br/>I will say that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" was every bit as enjoyable and entertaining as its predecessor. And I don't understand why so many people have been mouthing complaints about the sequel. In my opinion it was every bit as good and right in the same alley as the first movie.<br/><br/>The CGI in the movie was fantastic, as it usually is in all of Marvel's movies actually. And having good CGI effects and visuals is rather important for a movie such as ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"". I like how the effects were every bit as fast paced as the actual movie turned out to be.<br/><br/>I found the storyline in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" to be entertaining and enjoyable. Sure, it was a little bit more out there in comparison to the first movie. But come on, this is a movie set in a galactic setting with alien creatures, spacecrafts and what have you not. And furthermore, it is set in the Marvel universe, so what do you expect if nothing other than getting a story blown out of proportions as all other Marvel stories essentially are.<br/><br/>Just as in the first movie, then the cast ensemble for the sequel was quite good. It was nice to see the return of the cast members from the first movie. Just as it was nice to welcome new ones. But we also depart with some in this movie, which I hadn't expected. It wasn't a bad thing, but it just was somewhat of a surprise to me. But then again, I haven't read a single page of the comic books. Personally I must say that I was very pleased with the introduction of Mantis (played by Pom Klementieff), as this was a very interesting character and the presentation of the character was quite good in terms of effects and wardrobe.<br/><br/>""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" has a myriad of impressive cameo appearances, some more obvious than others, among which I found Sylvester Stallone, Michelle Yeoh, David Hasselhoff, Ving Rhames and Stan Lee (of course). I looked up the cast list afterwards and saw that there were even more cameos such as Seth Green, Rob Zombie, Miley Cyrus and Jeff Goldblum.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie then you will definitely also enjoy the sequel. If you haven't seen the first one, then you can still sit down to watch the sequel, as there is nothing overly important from the first movie to the storyline of the sequel.<br/><br/>""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" scores a solid 7 out of 10 stars from me. And I am looking forward to seeing the next movie in the series."
"verminhater","5","2","5","14 August 2017"," Too much CGI - too little story
","Rather similar to the first film in that that effects seem to be the main reason for making a film these days. There's so little plot actually happening that a fair portion of the film has to be given over to a side story of little connection to the main one.<br/><br/>The main characters are never felt to be in peril even when under massive attack. This prevents any concern for them which in turn leads the viewer to simply not care. I don't understand how this failure happens time and again in ""blockbusters"".<br/><br/>As a set of guardians they are a fairly dysfunctional group and I'd not want them guarding a fridge let alone a galaxy. It's by no means an awful film but others have made far better films with vastly less money."

Got to see a funny side in Drax the before edition he was always angry this one he always laughs I like the part he keeps saying positive things and suddenly ends it with a negative touch. Now to talk about gamora and quill love is in the air but she keeps denying it. Quills line ""We keep searching for something our whole life and we never realize that it has been with us the whole time"". Always hated yondu but this movie made me change.

This however was a huge disappointment. Without Rocket and Drax, it would have been two hours of my life wasted. Started really promising and then quickly descended into what was obviously a ""we have to get a second film out quickly to cash in on the success of the first"". I know that the Stallone and Rhames characters are major parts of Guardians lore, however only the real geeks will care about that and having those cameos just cheapened it all. <br/><br/>The humour was too concentrated, the story with Kurt Russell was confusing.

","I wasn't raving about the first Guardians of the Galaxy but it was humorous and enjoyable. Didn't think it was the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it was one of the better efforts. I knew I would catch the sequel at some point in time and now that I've seen it, I gotta say I'm a bit mixed about it. I think overall the film is good but is certainly inferior to the first film. Regardless, this film and the MCU still remains a money making vehicle as they head into the next Avengers.<br/><br/>This film takes our Guardians on a new path. They are wanted by the Sovereign people after Rocket steals batteries from them. More importantly Peter Quill comes across his father (played by Kurt Russell) who is revealed to be Ego a celestial being with great powers. All is not as it seems, as the film tries to uncover Ego's real motivations.<br/><br/>The cosmic visuals of the film are still as good as the first. This was never a problem with the film as cinematically still colorful and eye-popping. I think the humor while still ever present, does not hit its mark as much. There are funny moments, mostly through the MVP character of the film (Baby Groot) but the jokes feel forced and not as natural. The writing in places isn't always strong and the film has a hard time justifying its running length.<br/><br/>I will say though the film does a better job of characterization for some of the side players in this film, namely for Michael Rooker's Yondu. He is one of the standouts in this film and is a strong point of the film as he is given great time to develop. While the film doesn't have a lot of negatives I have to say it seems worn down and more manufactured than the first film, which genuinely felt like a free flowing fun film. Its standard sequel stuff really, but the film is still worth a watch. Especially if you are waiting on the next Avengers film that everything is building towards.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Vartiainen","Null","2","5","25 June 2017"," Comes very close to matching the original
","Sequels are often plagued by sequelitis, which is of course the technical term for the need for a sequel to be almost the exact same thing as the original hit except bigger, faster, stronger and far more outlandish. This film neatly avoids that. Partly because the original already was so outlandish that you can really only go down a notch from there.<br/><br/>But, in all honesty, Guardians Vol. 2 works exactly as a sequel should. It continues the story. The Guardians have already met, they are a team, and thus the film is about them working as a team and learning to be a team. It also deepens the characters. We learn a huge deal about all of the returning characters, including the Ravager boss Yondu played by Michael Rooker, hands down my favourite part of the film. But we also learn a lot about Peter (Chris Pratt) and the film's main story is about him learning about his heritage. We'll get to that in a moment.<br/><br/>But a good sequel also needs to retain the good parts of the original. And this definitely does. It's just as colourful, just as imaginative, just as laid back and just as much fun as the original. It feels exactly like a Guardians sequel should feel. Sure the novelty is no longer there, but that's the price we inevitably have to pay.<br/><br/>And that lack of novelty is really one of two things keeping this from being as good as the original. The other thing being the story. The original story wasn't perfect either, suffering from a weak villain and some various hiccups. But it kept together very nicely and was a genuinely good origins story, especially keeping in mind the size of the cast. In this film the villain starts out much better, but ends on a sour note. The film is also all over the place story-wise. This isn't a huge problem because the characters and the humour are what people come to see, and both of are great, but it still means that it simply doesn't deliver as much of a punch as the original did.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is one of the best Marvel sequels to day and a great watch for anyone looking for a scifi film that knows how to entertain."
"anish-25809","8","2","5","21 June 2017"," Splendid & colourful sequel
","While the film may not be as fresh as it's predecessor and the soundtrack may not match up to the first one,this film's got great character development,amazing cinematography and visuals,with an ending which is easily the deepest moment in the MCU. Michael Rooker was the best actor in this film in my opinion,along with the deadpan Dave Bautista. But this time,Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana seemed to be putting in minimal effort. Kurt Russell was really really good as Ego,his character was really interesting. The cinematography and visuals are great as ever,particularly in Ego's planet. The humour is quite funny (and excessive,unsurprisingly) but that aside,James Gunn wrote and directed the film with great flair. Action scenes were well done,particularly the final act. Rocket was voiced very well by Bradley Cooper,and Baby Groot definitely elicited the aww from the audience.<br/><br/>I wish they left out the golden people from the film though,they don't really contribute to the film. Sylvester Stallone was on screen for too little time to be interesting or even memorable.<br/><br/>Overall,this continues the MCU's hot streak,they're doing quite well. I really expect a great sequel."

Which is refreshing, let me tell you. <br/><br/>To that end, it's exactly what I was hoping for; the songs are well chosen (The Chain, in particular, one of my very favorite songs) the humor's great, and the story's strong enough to balance new faces (Kurt Russell, Stallone, the Hoff). It's a little saggy in the middle with everyone separating off on their various narrative jaunts, but when the group is together, the movie fires on all cylinders.<br/><br/>7/10"
"DJKwa","7","2","5","12 June 2017"," A winning combination of infectious energy, gorgeous aesthetic and laugh out loud humour
","In 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy catapulted relatively unheard of superheroes into the hearts of millions of Marvel Cinematic Universe fans worldwide. Three years later and looking to jack up their prices as two-time galaxy savers, the Guardians make a triumph return with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Eschewing the need to outdo the first in terms of spectacle, the sequel offers a more mature and deeper look into the ragtag group of lovable miscreants. The characters once again prove to be the highlight of the show, and by putting the spotlight firmly on them and their relationship with each other, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 delivers a satisfying sequel despite the uneven storytelling.<br/><br/>Opening with another memorable credits sequence, we reunite with the Galactic heroes on a new assignment. Hired by a gold-skinned race called the Sovereign to take down a giant inter- dimensional monster eating their planet's power, it's business as usual for the crew. That is until Rocket steals the power that they were meant to be protecting and the crew swiftly find themselves on the run from the Sovereign's fleet of drones. Old habits die-hard after all. <br/><br/>Except the chase doesn't last long before the Guardians crash land on a nearby planet. Stranded, they are aided by a mysterious stranger who, if the trailers hadn't already spoiled the surprise, is revealed to be Peter's dad, Ego (Kurt Russell). The father-son reunion forms the crux of the story, and with the group left with few options, they split into two. Ego invites Peter to his home planet, and he follows along with Gamora and Drax, while Rocket and Groot stay to tend to the ship. As the characters break up, the story also splinters into a tangled web of subplots, and there's not much pulling them all together. Each character is given their own arc and we learn a little more about each of them, especially Peter and his relationship with his father, but there's nothing really pushing the story forward. There's no real villain, no imminent threat and only hints of something nefarious bubbling under the surface which lends a decidedly lack of urgency to the center of the film. <br/><br/>Having said that, even when the story does slumber, there's always something to distract your senses. The film's presentation is once again stellar and it not only elevates the film but at times it feels like the film gets by solely because of it. The bright, fluorescent colour palette nails the trippy, free spirited 70's aesthetic and locations such as Ego's beautifully, CGI rendered home planet are a feast for the eyes. Much like the first, the film is a marvel (pun intended) to look at.<br/><br/>Your ears are also in for a treat as the film's new mix tape (aptly titled Awesome Mix Vol 2.) is another killer. The soundtrack has been carefully curated as an integral part of the film and the inspired song choices reflect that. Drawing once again on classic tunes, the soundtrack is populated by the likes of Fleetwood Mac and Cat Stevens, who perfectly compliment the film's eclectic mix of drama, action and comedy. Even the bizarre addition of an original song called 'Guardians Inferno' sung by David Hasselhoff feels inspired and is likely to be stuck in your head for days after.<br/><br/>Despite the mid-film lull, the story does recover, and a late game twist pulls it back into top-form. It's a dark revelation that threatens to pull the group apart but instead serves to bring them closer together. It highlights the strength of the film, that even amidst all the action and razzle-dazzle special effects, it's the characters which standout and endure. Their resolve to stick together as a family, through thick and thin, is what makes the characters so great to follow and the film's heartfelt coda encapsulates this perfectly.<br/><br/>It should be noted, however, that those expecting for the film to pave the way for Avengers 3 are going to leave the theatre somewhat disappointed, as the narrative is surprisingly self-contained for this stage of Marvel's Phase 3. While it has been confirmed that the Guardians will appear in the third Avengers film, there's nothing in Vol.2, not even in one of the five (yes FIVE) end-credits sequences, which remotely hints at the Guardians involvement with the Avengers. <br/><br/>For that matter, very little at all of what happens seems to have an impact on the overarching MCU universe. While that's not exactly a complaint, given Marvel's penchant for constantly teasing of bigger to come, there's a slight disappointing feeling to Vol 2 that it acts mostly as filler. In the end, however, it's hard to complain when the film is as enjoyable and well made as this. While not exactly the breathe of fresh air that the first one was, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2's winning combination of infectious energy, gorgeous aesthetic and laugh out loud humour more than makeup for the uneven storytelling."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","8","2","5","10 June 2017"," Better than the first
","James Gunn's Guardians Of The Galaxy Volume 2, I'm happy to report, blows the first film right out of the water. There's a subversive, wonderfully sarcastic sense of humour running through both films, as well as a boundlessly creative and colourful canvas of ideas both big and small, coalescing into something just this side of chaos. Picture a stick of dynamite; Volume one is the fuse, fizzling terrifically as it gets off to a great start. In many franchises, by the time the first film uses up the wick and reaches the stick, it's sequel, the energy is lost and we end up with a dud of a follow-up. Not this baby. Volume two is the stick of dynamite, exploding gloriously across our screens in fits of dazzling imagination, humour that doesn't quit for a nanosecond and the heart to back it up. Volume one dipped its toe in the water and showed us the roots of what a great space opera might look like, and volume two plunges in to give us just that. We rejoin with the merry band of misfits who now know each other a little better, are more comfortable working as a unit, and blast off into a tale of space battles, living planets and perpetual banter. Chris Pratt's Star Lord, equipped with a brand new eight track collection of vintage pop songs, is still searching for his real dad when he kind of finds him by accident in the form of Ego, a powerful celestial being slyly played by Kurt Russell. Joining him are the gang we know and love, broccoli hued babe Gamora (Zoe Saldana), deadpan Drax (Dave Bautista outdoes himself in the comic relief department, a true highlight) Rocket (Bradley Cooper, excellent), scowling smurfette Nebula (Karen Gillian), adorable Baby Groot (Vin Diesel, collecting a mortgage- eclipsing paycheque for literally doing nothing) and antihero Yondu (Michael Rooker). Rooker gets far, far more to do here than he did the second time around, becoming a fleshed out character with a terrific arc and a whole pile of scenes, a strong asset to the film. The villain here is way more compelling than Lee Pace's silly space vampire in Volume One, and I won't spoil anything but there's more than a few surprises. Kurt Russell's living planet is pure delicious eye candy, a vista to rival anything in Star Wars, Mass Effect or similar worlds, detailed and lovingly rendered. As per usual there are cameos, but surprisingly it's more than the obligatory laundry list of Where's Waldo fellow Marvel appearances. There are truly inspired name drops here and a few genre titans who show up, none of whom I'll give away except Sylvester Stallone. He's given an unassuming supporting role that he plays solidly without tongue in cheek or any hint of a gimmick, just an enjoyable little addition to the cast. James Gunn is a cinematic punk, cracking prudence right in the jaw, throwing caution to the wind and tirelessly churning out the kind of fresh, funny and irreverent films we want to see, scrappy crowd pleasers that people will actually remember, which lord knows is what Marvel needs to shake up their sometimes complacent, too comfortable aesthetic. The soundtrack is obviously a winner, and any film that uses Fleetwood Mac's The Chain as its main cue has pretty much already won me over. This will probably be the cornerstone of summer blockbuster season, it's just too much fun and has everything you'd want, with the dial cranked just past what we got the first time around in the best way possible. I am Groot."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","5","8 June 2017"," A standard superhero movie that works more during its lighter moments than its deeper moments
","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is an American movie from 2017, so really fresh and new still, that runs for 2 hours 15 minutes approximately and was co-written and directed by James Gunn. He was also the man in charge of the first film that plays before this one. The key cast members return as well, like Pratt, Saldana, Bautista plus Diesel and Cooper with their voices. Add to that the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Kurt Russell, Elizabeth Debicki and ""Walking Dead"" fans will be happy to see Michael Rooker play a core character in here. This one is all about family. It's about fathers, about sisters, about past loves and children, but also about future family and how friends can count as such as well. It was unclear for a long time who would be the main antagonist in this movie, if there even was one main antagonist. Stallone's character? Rooker's character? The golden gal? The female protagonist's sister? But then it is one you would not expect initially. Maybe the golden gal would not have been the perfect choice because honestly some kind of theft would not have been enough to justify that, would it?<br/><br/>Anyway, this is of course a Marvel adaptation and this means not only that Stan Lee has a cameo again as always (even two if you count credits), but also that you will rarely get as many shots at comedy as in this film here when it comes to other superhero films. This is good on the one hand as some of the jokes are indeed working, but it is also a negative aspect as with this quantity of funny one-liners many jokes aren't working (like the one about Kurt Russell's character's penis) and make this a film at times that just tries way too hard to be funny. Another negative side effect is that the comedy takes away majorly from the dramatic parts. Just take the scene in which the sister raves on in an insane manner about how she wants to kill Saldana's character and her father and then there is that guy who is the companion to Rooker's character (no idea what his purpose was anyway) and he must give this outburst of rage a comedic note by talking about simple stuff (jewellery or so). It was pretty embarrassing. And there are more moments like that, like Bautista's constant rambling about how Mantis is not really that attractive which was only funny the first one or two times. But luckily the characters in here are so unique (a talking raccoon nuff said, Cooper is actually pretty bearable when you don't see his smug face and grin) that it is still a really entertaining watch. I liked Drax, Rocket, Ego and Yondu the most I believe. On a negative note, this film proves once again that Chris Pratt, who had his breakthrough on Parks and Rec, is just not lead actor material as he was overshadowed by pretty much everybody else and that things don't look much better for Saldana, even if her make-up hides it pretty cleverly. Their interaction together about forbidden romance between protagonists was downright embarrassing and the story with Saldana's character and her sister was basically saved by the sister really and honestly the film still could have done without that story entirely. It also did not feel that authentic that she wants to kill her sister the most gruesome way and then they start bonding all of a sudden. You could say okay they have not seen each other for a long time and that changed everything, but they have when the bad girl is cuffed inside the spaceship. So the story sure had some flaws and while I enjoyed Russell's performance a lot, I still am not sure if the plot about his planet was good enough to be in the center of it all.<br/><br/>The one area where the film delivers without a doubt is the technical side. Visually and acoustically this film is as good as it gets and with that I am of course referring to sets, but also to make-up, cinematography and costumes of course. I would not be surprised if the movie manages to get in at the Oscars for one of these just like the first one did. I must say there is one exception though. The use of music was a bit exaggerated in terms of frequency and the only scene where the song played was truly working was the very first scene that is all about Baby Groot and that also was perhaps the best scene of the film already. However, the liberation scene with Rooker's character and this red laser was pretty cool as well. Speaking about this character in general, one could almost think that he and Stallone's character could get their own film, even if it is not too likely to happen I guess. What is likely, basically safe already, is that there will be a third GotG movie, probably in 2020. This one here is the second most successful film of 2017 when it comes to box office and that's a major (not unexpected though) success, even if there is perhaps a slight deterioration in quality compared to the first film. I recommend them both. Worth checking out."

","No Words. I've seen this movie twice (On opening day and 2 days after it came out) and It's the best Marvel Movie ever. Heck, I could probably say it's one of my favorite movies ever. The entire film is God Amazing. There is nothing wrong with the movie in my opinion. Some people complain the jokes are forced but I did not feel that any joke was forced in the movie. <br/><br/>This movie, Along with the first one, Ant-Man, and Civil War are my favorite marvel movies.

","This Vol. 2 disappointed me a bit. I think it's a goofy movie for kids, but not even since my two kids were not so impressed by this film either. So different from the first one.

"lesleyharris30","9","2","5","3 June 2017"," A Stellar Sequel that Maintains the Fun and Energy of its Predecessor,
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and an excellent cast. It brings back a lot of what we loved about the original film, but not in a way that comes across as forced or that it is trying to be a carbon copy. It has a brand new soundtrack with plenty of toe tapping tunes, as well a ton of sequences that are just enchanting, as a result of how fun and well executed they are. <br/><br/>It is, sadly, not quite as fresh as the original, there were moments were it felt like they were trying too hard to mimic something that worked in the first, as well as that, the plot just simply is not as engaging. It is a lot slower, while in the original we see Star Lord and his crew jump from one place to another, here they spend the majority of the film on one planet, when as audience members we are craving a bit more excitement, rather than seeing Peter trying to connect with his enigmatic father. <br/><br/>The cast are all top notch, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista all slip back in to their respective roles very naturally, Bradley Cooper shines once again as the voice of Rocket Racoon, and Vin Diesel puts so much heart in to Groot, in this case, a baby version. The best character in this film, which came as a big surprise to me, was Yondu. A very two dimensional being in the original, they added so much development to him in this movie, and Michael Rooker portrays him with great depth. I found myself feeling more connected to him than anyone else, and actually somewhat relatable. <br/><br/>While it falls flat in certain aspects, you will not be able to wipe the smile off your face when seeing these characters on screen again. Funny and action packed, I would recommend Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 to anyone looking for a good Sci-Fi or Adventure film. <br/><br/>The Guardians land on a planet that they soon learn is inhabited by Star Lord's father, he must now learn the truth of his origins. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Michael Rooker"

","Loved the movie, maybe too many jokes and not the biggest story but it made up for it. I'm so exited for infinity wars and can hardly wait. Too bad there is only one GotG movie left. Great films but maybe tune down on the jokes and bring more story into the next one, other than that great job. I even got tears in my eyes from the ending of this movie and that never happens so 10/10 will see again."

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) Starring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Chris Sullivan, Sylvester Stallone, Kurt Russel, Seth Green, Stan Lee, Ving Rhames, Miley Cyrus, David Hasselhoff, Rob Zombie, Ben Browder, and Jeff Goldblum Written & Directed By: James Gunn Review You know to me personally I think the Guardians of The Galaxy (2014) is a bit over-rated. Heck I even read a comment where someone said that the Guardians are better than the Avengers. I mean the characters not the movie but those same people who think that may put the movie higher than Avengers. Why? I'll never know. But I'll respect because they are cool characters. After saving Xandar from Ronan's wrath, the Guardians are now recognized as heroes. Now the team must help their leader Star Lord (Chris Pratt) uncover the truth behind his true heritage. Along the way, old foes turn to allies and betrayal is blooming. And the Guardians find that they are up against a devastating new menace who is out to rule the galaxy. I said I find the Guardians of The Galaxy (2014) to be over-rated and I don't like the opening of that film with Peter singing and kicking the little things that look like dinosaurs or actually more like raptors (I don't know what there called) because it was obviously played for laughs and was completely ridiculous. But the opening sequence where baby groot is running around while a battle is going on around him is pretty cool. I love the cast and Karen Gillian's Nebula is going through stake of survival so she can kill her father Thanos and her scene's with Gamora where sweet. Dave Bautista who is more that background physical actor and once admitted he's not that great actor was more fun this time around. Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana who play my favorite's Starlord and Gamora where amazing I loved there chemistry in this film. Especially Starlord who grows as character when he meets his father Ego the living planet played by Kurt Russel and I love the scene where he creates this blue celestial ball and they act like a regular father and son playing catch with it. Michael Rooker is my Mary Popins, that's all I'm going to say about him. It was cool to see Sylvester Stallone I hope he's in the next one a little bit more, oh and Seth Green returns as Howard The Duck I doubt you'll miss him he has a pretty cool line. The film is a lot more about family just like the recent few Fast & Furious movies, well I know what family I want to spend more time with. Guardians of The Galaxy Vol.2 has more heart, with astounding visuals that bring this massive space opera (which is far better than The Force Awakens by the way) and it tone's down the humor which thank goodness, this was an an amazing chapter in the massive Marvel Cinematic Universe, I loved this film way more than the first so I'm giving Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 2 a five out of five."

","I couldn't wait for the second installment of GoG and was happy it did not disappoint. The plot was well planned, and the evolution of the characters was great. The story line had many layers and I enjoyed each surprising twist. The music in Quill's Awesome Mixtape #2 is darn right awesome. Love the selection! In this story, the Guardians are fighting to keep their misfit family together. The mystery behind Peter's birth father is revealed, and Peter learns allot about what a true father really is - Knight Rider, his birth father, or the man who raised him. Sisters, once again have to choose to fight or unite. Drax and his humor just gets better. Rocket and Groot are as cute as ever. Two thumbs up!"
"TheOneThatYouWanted","10","2","5","25 May 2017"," I can't stop this feeling..
","Seriously. I honestly do not know which I like better; the first GOTG or this one. I think the first GOTG is the better of the two in storytelling and flow however GOTG 2 just feels like a funnier film. I can not wait to watch it again because back when I rewatched the original film, I actually liked it less. Whatever, on to the review. The film is fun and the soundtrack is amazing. And the classic rock music is used well in the film, unlike some DC garbage I watched last year. However the film does feel chunky at times but the universe building, action, comedy and visuals more than makeup for the uneven flow. Overall, you'll be happy with this. I scored passes for an advance viewing on Wonder Woman and I'm this close to tossing them in the trash. As a true DC fan, it is heartbreaking to see Marvel kicking our backside. Whatever, I'm over it.<br/><br/>Update: I just rewatched this and I dare say it is just as fun upon second viewing."

","The new movie ""Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2"" became a really hit in the cinema industry. Where else you can see talking raccoon, silly human and elegant lady death machine together? And of course Groot, baby tree-like creature, who knows only 3 words ""I am Groot""After the successful release of the first part the following should be about nothing, but the director was managed to surprise everyone.<br/><br/>On the plot of the movie, which i intentionally absent, the guardians fall into another accident which is the guardians where they are rescued by none other than the father of the Star Lord not a simply human and around this the whole story is built. I think, that in the film the absence of the storyline is compensated by a huge amount of humor, and by raising such issue as family.Against the backdrop of these things that movie is not inferior to the first part. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I want to say you will not waste time on the film and You will get a lot of positive impressions and start appreciating your beloved ones."
"nchuzhakind-00737","7","2","5","23 May 2017"," Worth seeing for real heroes.
","I'd classify The Guardians of Galaxy vol.2 as a crazy action with both jokes and sad moments. I'm sure that the film will keep both adults and children excited. The picture is very colorful and contains many professional special effects. This is the first feature film shot with Red Digital Cinema's Weapon Helium digital camera, and is the first film shot in 8K resolution. I would pay a particular attention to the film score. I'm sure you'll agree that The Guardians of Galaxy is especially famous with its soundtracks. Music of 60's, 70's add some retro color to the movie. The film has a talented cast. I'm in favor of Chris Pratt's acting. Most of humor scenes belong to Drax that is the character of Dave Bautista. Also I was pleased to see charismatic Kurt Rassel. The plot isn't very complicated and new: our heroes try to save the universe again. Most of questions are answered in this film that remained unanswered in vol. 1. Some things were quite illogical and not convincing but in general I was satisfied at the end of the film. Represented topic of the relationship between father and son made a big impression on me. If you liked the prequel, I'll recommend you to watch this. The film is full of breathtaking moments and flavored with light jokes. Don't forget it has 5 scenes in the closing credits. 7 of 10"

And this movie is just as entertaining as the original. It is full of intense action, good special effects, a lot of humor, and a fun soundtrack.<br/><br/>Like the original, this one doesn't feel so much like a traditional superhero movie. It plays out more like a more colorful, retro, comedic version of Star Wars. The Guardians are a conceptually bizarre team, and the movie knows this and has as much time devoted to comedy as it does to action. And James Gunn, who also directed the previous movie, perfectly replicates the fun of the original.<br/><br/>That being said, this is still not as good as the first movie story-wise. However, it is as FUN as the first movie. This is a very entertaining, funny, and visually stunning time at the theater.<br/><br/>jaythemovieguy.blogspot.com"

After Rocket steals some for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. The drones are destroyed by a mysterious figure, but the Guardians are forced to crash-land on a nearby planet. The figure reveals himself as Quill's father, Ego.

"hemmerda-83544","9","2","5","19 May 2017"," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Even More Guarding and Galaxy-ing
","I recently watched this movie and I must say that I really enjoyed it. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a comic book movie, so if you're not into that, this movie probably isn't for you. However, if you want to see a movie but you don't know what you want to watch, I'd recommend this one. It's a movie that I think anyone can enjoy. Especially normies.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, as the name suggests, takes place in space and on various alien planets. The movie takes place in the present day, however nothing is the same. They have space battles and alien life forms and stuff, so it never really feels like present day. The story is that the Guardians, specifically Rocket Raccoon, stole some valuable batteries from the Sovereign, so they are after the Guardians. Along the way, they find a man who claims to be Star-Lord's father named Ego the Living Planet. Yes, he's literally an entire planet. Anyways, they enter Ego, (that sounds inappropriate, but he is the planet, so what else can I say?) and *POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT* find out he's a bad guy so the Guardians must rescue Star-Lord and destroy Ego before he destroys the galaxy. I thought Dave Bautista as Drax almost stole the whole show. They gave Drax a lot more lines in this movie. He also laughed in excess in this movie. I thought all of the cast did well, nobody was really lacking. Although Sylvester Stallone's Starhawk, the leader of the Ravagers, was kind of a pointless cameo so I hope they didn't shell out too much cash to get him.<br/><br/>What I liked about this movie was the humor was mostly good, the CGI was spectacular, and the characters were enjoyable. Everyone got at least a minute in the spotlight, and it was enjoyable throughout for that reason. The only character I thoroughly disliked was Baby Groot. Some of his bits were funny, but it was obvious he is just a marketing ploy dragged in for the women and children moviegoers, and it made his character not enjoyable for me. Another thing I disliked about the movie was the length. It felt like I was sitting through two movies. I have never had to leave the theater to use the restroom as far as I can remember, but during this movie I left twice. Still, I enjoyed the film and had fun watching it. I was really impressed by the scene where they were going through the asteroid field with the Sovereign chasing them right after they stole the batteries. The CGI in that scene was well done, and I liked the little bits of humor sprinkled in, like the Sovereign were piloting their ships like they were playing a video game.<br/><br/>This film is a film for everybody, really. Unless space movies aren't your thing, or team movies aren't your thing, I think you'll enjoy the movie should you decide to go see it. Even if you do hate the genres this film is classified as, I still think you might enjoy it. It's well made, has a fantastic cast, and a good sense of humor. It's rated PG- 13, so you can take your kids to see it, but be careful, as this movie does have some inappropriate-for-kids segments in it. Overall, I think the movie was well worth the ticket price. If I was a regular moviegoer, I'd probably watch this one multiple times. If I had to give it a rating out of 5, I'd give it a solid 4.5 out of 5. Not a perfect movie, Baby Groot was a low point and kind of dragged the movie down, but other than that it's a great film that I enjoyed very much."

"RforFilm","9","2","5","12 May 2017"," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an awesome mix of goofy fun and emotion in this great sequel
","I'll admit that the Guardians of the Galaxy from 2014 was and still is one of the best summer blockbusters I've seen in years. Director James Gunn took a big gamble on adapting a Marvel comic that few people knew about, and made a movie that could only be described as ""fun"". Like a lot of the best comedies, Guardians of the Galaxy seem to be an accidental masterpiece where each actor was casted correctly and that their delivery of a good script was spot on. The movie represents the kind of space opera that gave me a spectacle that I had not seen sense Star Wars (yes, even over the new ones).<br/><br/>As much as I've wanted to see a sequel, I also couldn't shake the feeling that it was going to suffer the curse that Marvel has on their subsequent follow-ups (except Captain America). Neither Iron Man, Thor and even The Avengers could outdo the originals. A lot of that has to do with the fact that while the situations become larger, the characters don't evolve. A sequel needs to bring the character into a new area that will help them grow as people. Let's see if Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 can do so for our space heroes. <br/><br/>Since the events of the last movie, Peter ""Star Lord"" Quill (played by Chris Pratt), Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana), Rocket (played by Bradley Cooper), Drax (played by Dave Bautista) and Baby Groot (played by Vin Diesel) have become something of a renegade-for-hire team whenever needed. They defeat an inter dimensional monster for the Sovereign race of gold people in exchange for Gamora's half sister Nebula. Things go well until they leave and Rocket reveals that he took some valuable batteries from the people. A drone army attempts to destroy the Guardians but an unknown ship fends them off and leads them to a planet.<br/><br/>While the crew examines the damage to their ship, the person that helped them reveals himself to be Peter's father, Ego (played by Kurt Russell). He talks about how he's been searching for his son when he was never returned. Ego takes Peter, Gamora and Drax to his heaven-like world while Rocket and Groot fix the ship and guard Nebula. Meanwhile, the gold people hire Yondu (played by Michael Rooker) to catch the Guardians in retaliation from before. Though Peter is overjoyed to finally find his father, Gamora gets an uncertain feeling about the world, but can't quite put her finger on it. <br/><br/>I can say that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues it's goofy, space fun while giving us an emotional connection with our heroes. The movie has it's fair share of battles and fights (this is the kind of movie where we see Pac-Man and an arrow kill hundreds of people), this is a sequel that does the job of taking our heroes to the next emotional step. Each one goes through an arc, though the majority of the story is on Peter and his father/son relationships with Ego and Yondu. What might disappoint some fans of the last movie is that the story is almost set on Ego's planet. <br/><br/>The action does feel larger, so the movie has the distinction being both bigger and smaller then before. Some people may see that as a rip off, though I felt the jokes and story kept things interesting. If anything, the biggest problem is the final battle which does go on a little too long. Perhaps if they cut ten minutes, you may have a perfect sequel on par with The Empire Strikes Back or Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Even the ending seems to be a nod to Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Kahn. <br/><br/>I'll give this nine Sony Walkman cassette players out of ten. Guardian fans should get plenty to digest with this sequel. It's a fun time at the movies and recommend that you catch it on the big screen. Kids and adults should be walking out of the theater with the same fun spirit that Starlord has. This sequel is an awesome mix."

The battle between Nebula and Gamora is the best and most powerful scene in the movie. Totally love Karen Gillan who plays Nebula in this movie.

"Carycomic","6","2","5","11 May 2017"," One star better than THE CIRCLE. Not quite as good as GOTG Vol.1.
","Once more, we have a total retcon of characters I grew up with. Mantis--who, in the comics, was a highly intelligent, kick-butt martial artist raised by Shaolin-like Kree expatriates--is reduced to being an empathic bug-like concubine. Drax is still a knife- wielding psychopath rather than the J'onn J'onzz analog he was in the Silver Age Captain Mar-Vell stories. And the only nod to the original GOTG comic from the 1960's is the inclusion of Martinex (a crystalline humanoid) as first-mate to special guest-star Sylvester Stallone.<br/><br/>The only thing remaining intact was the concept of Ego being an aptly-named living planet. <br/><br/>Add to all that the fact that, once again, out-takes were unethically used as previews and you have a time-killing adventure flick that isn't too bad. Almost as delightfully campy as any old episode of the Adam West Bat-series, in fact! <br/><br/>But, still possessed of way too much room for improvement."

"justinpkelly","7","2","5","7 May 2017"," The sum is better than its parts
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an incredibly entertaining ride that I thoroughly enjoyed watching, although it is not perfect. I really liked the first Guardians because of the fantastic characters and well-written story. Vol. 2 doesn't quite live up to the first one, but it delivered on many of the elements that I was excited to see.<br/><br/>Firstly, the humor in this movie was top-notch. Nearly every single joke in this movie worked and there were so many memorable hilarious moments. Vol. 2 is 10x funnier than Guardians 1, and that says something because the latter was also hysterically funny. However, despite it working very well, I do think that they used a little too much humor in the movie. There are moments that feel unnecessary that are simply there so a joke can be said and the placement of these jokes becomes very predictable by about halfway through the movie.<br/><br/>The characters, once again, are fantastic. They all have the same quirks and personalities that made audiences fall in love with them the first time around and are given even more depth in this movie than they had in the first. One of my favorites in Guardians 1 was Drax, and he still is after seeing Vol. 2. He was absolutely hilarious and had countless moments that had audiences in stitches during my viewing. Star Lord was also one of my favorites because he was the deepest character, and he continues to succeed as an excellent main character in Guardians 2. But the truth is, every single major character in the movie was great and each one had their standout moments. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the villains. Ego, who was revealed to be Star Lord's father, just spewed exposition and was a flimsy character. Not enough focus was given to the writing of his character to make the father-son relationship between him and Star-Lord feel tangible and emotionally involving. The reveal of him as the actual main villain of the movie should have been more emotionally impactful on the audience. The secondary villains of the movie, the gold aliens, felt somewhat unnecessary and dull, although there was some unexpectedly well- written humor involving them that I enjoyed.<br/><br/>The story was somewhat messy and felt as though it was going in ten different directions at once. I think that a more simplified plot would have benefited Vol. 2. The gold aliens in particular muddled the story and added a plot element that probably should not have been in the movie. The mutany involving Yondu's crew also felt somewhat misplaced and blurred the focus of the film even further. There were also many moments that felt placed just for humor purposes that should have been taken out of the movie to help it flow better. The third act, however, felt very focused and did not have these same issues. I also felt that some of the emotional moments at the end of the movie were not completely earned. The relationship between Star-Lord and Yondu was supposed to be the emotional core of the movie, but those two characters were barely on screen together and this element was not given the time it needed to blossom. <br/><br/>The action was all top-notch and was better than it was in the first movie. The sequence involving the asteroid belt was extremely fun and the Yondu arrow sequence is honestly one of my top five favorite Marvel set pieces to date. The third act has nonstop action and it all works ridiculously well. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, the universe building was also one of my favorite things in this movie. The costume and creature design as well as the set design are both perfect. The universe feels even more limitless after Vol. 2 and there were so many creative and exciting locations.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Vol. 2 is a somewhat messy and choppy movie that perhaps could have been slimmed down, but there is no denying the fact that it is a thoroughly entertaining and fun addition to the MCU. I look forward to seeing it again and I cannot wait to see the Guardians again in Infinity War.<br/><br/>7.4/10 Grade: B+"

","First of all, how the heck can a movie be so entertaining predicated on a plot thinner than those Chinese ""pancakes"" you wrap your Moo Shu Pork in???<br/><br/>Gigantic explosions, huge laughs, enormous fun, and probably the weakest plot of any Marvel movie to date. <br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, our protagonist finally gets to meet his long lost papa, who may not be exactly who/what he purports to be. Thanos's daughters continue their long standing sibling rivalry, and Disney/Marvel gives us the cutest CGI character since Dreamworks ""Puss"". <br/><br/>Note to parents, there is a lot of vulgar language thrown around, as well as a major plot point in which a certain character regales us with his conquest of the opposite sex all over the universe in VERY PG-13 terms. <br/><br/>All in all a big, fun, and at times touching film about family, friendship, and loyalty, all of which revolves around a plot-line that may have you leaving the theater wondering what it was exactly that you just watched."
"drqshadow-reviews","9","2","5","7 May 2017"," Every Bit as Marvelous as the First - Guardians 2 Made Me Happy
","The continuing adventures of Marvel's raggiest, taggiest team of interstellar misfits. This one picks up right where the first volume left off, with the gang collecting bounties from odd alien races, taking missteps (and making enemies) despite themselves. I loved the first one, consider it one of the best the MCU has to offer, and this sequel is right on the same level. Unabashedly chaotic, recklessly entertaining, cheeky and silly, emotive and sweet, it touches many of the same nerves that made the original so well-liked and even goes a step or two further. Given such a quirky, offbeat opening take, there's always the risk that sequels will come off as forced or derivative, but that isn't the case here. The humor still feels sharp and appropriate, the core cast shares the camaraderie (and constant personality clashes) of a real family, the greater universe remains intensely deep and well-populated. And there's still plenty of time to develop ancillary characters, be they new foils or uneasy old allies. In fact, one such dose of potent character development efficiently shifts a minor player from the first act into a significant part of the story this time around. Quick with wit and with the cannons, never afraid to let its inner weirdness shine like a beacon, brimming with vibrant life in every scene, it's vast and rich and sprawling and completely enjoyable. Guardians Volume 2 made me thoroughly happy. How long until the next one?<br/><br/>Updated thoughts after a recent re-watch (2018):
Just as loose and entertaining as the original, though less tentative. No longer compelled to prove itself as a viable, if offbeat, property. In other words, Volume 2 is free to let its freak flag fly, to fully embrace its inner weirdness. And wow, what vibrant, colorful, unimaginably rich spoils it reaps. Each setting feels unique and cultured, from sleazy ice brothels to the ornate, richly detailed architecture and stunning, unexpectedly lively landscapes found upon Ego, the living planet. It's a visual feast, backed by another groovy, excellent soundtrack, finely-tuned comedic timing and a sweet, resonant set of character studies. Tons of fun to watch, impossible to hear without shaking a hip, meaningful and memorable from a long-term storytelling perspective. An impressive step up from what was already one of my favorite franchises in the MCU."

","I can't add much for die hard GOTG fans but for those who might be on the fence about seeing this or dreading having to sit through it with your kids - GO ! Full disclosure - I saw this film in the main auditorium at the Senator Theater in Baltimore, MD - and that makes any film better. In 2014 Men's Journal listed the Senator among the top 20 movie theaters in the world. I had low expectations for this - not particularly a sci-fi fan, not particularly a comic book movie fan - I expected to be by far the oldest person in the theater - but it was a rainy day, and it was the film chosen to entertain a young family member, so off we went. First, I was surprised by the make up of the audience - lots of family groups, and lots of older viewers - I was not sitting in a sea of teens as I expected. This movie was simply put great entertainment. The characters were well fleshed out, the acting was stellar, and it was funny - laugh out loud funny. You have to love running jokes about David Hasselhoff, and I'm still wondering exactly how they pulled off the ""Benjamin Button"" reverse aging of Kurt Russell in the opening scene! Don't pass this up just because you aren't a fan of the genre - it is much more - fun and entertaining !"

","I am Groot. I am Groot. I am Groot!<br/><br/>Another day, another sequel. This week we're treated to Marvel's latest adventure, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, a sequel to 2014's critical and commercial darling, Guardians of the Galaxy. GOTG sprung a pleasant surprise on the audience with its cheeky attitude and portrayal of superheroes in a less-than-super light. Naturally then, we expected a lot from part 2 and the film delivers. Mostly.<br/><br/>The Guardians are messy, disjointed, and the unlikeliest bunch of heroes. They're going through growing pains as they try to save the galaxy while stealing and leaving their mark on every planet. Heroic, indeed. But that's why we love em! This time the drama is heightened with Peter's father finally coming forward. Throw being chased by a powerful alien race on top of the daddy issues and you've got yourself a movie.<br/><br/>GOTG 2 isn't as original or refreshing as the first part but it manages to stand on its own despite wobbly legs. The humor is the lifeline. This is a very funny movie which doesn't take itself too seriously. The chemistry between the characters, doused in one liners, helps you overlook any weak moments that pop up. The brilliant visuals make the frames all the more watchable. Ego's planet is breathtaking. For a few moments I forgot the plot had come to a standstill. Guardians of the Galaxy was the first time I saw Chris Pratt as anything other than goofy Andy from Parks & Recreation. The movie propelled him to stardom and GOTG Vol. 2 only cements that status. He's in terrific form this time around as well. From funny and slightly annoying to endearing, he covers the whole range with Peter Quill. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well. Pom Klementieff playing Mantis is a welcome addition to the family. And Groot. Oh, Baby Groot. The adorable tree is a winner in terms of imagination and execution. Who doesn't want a lovable tree sitting on their shoulder?<br/><br/>Angst free superheroes are hard to find so when we do find them we embrace them with open arms. Visually grand with an emotional and hilarious core makes this is a solid sequel that doesn't break new ground but provides a good time. I'd like to explore more of the galaxy with the gang. Laughter, adventure, and Baby Groot- I'm not complaining.<br/><br/>Oh, and stay for all the end credit scenes. They're a hoot.<br/><br/>https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com"
"pinkarray","5","2","5","5 May 2017"," If you're a Marvels fan, you will enjoy this a lot
","I saw the first GOTG at a party but didn't get to finish the whole thing. So far, it looked pretty good.<br/><br/>I've never been a big fan of Marvels movies and this movie isn't much different. It's a superhero movie with a person that looks like iron man, action, comedy, drama, and slow moments. Though, it's probably the most emotional Marvels movie I've come across, it has more sadness in it than a Marvels movie usually has. <br/><br/>The raccoon that looks like Star Fox, I don't recall him being this annoying in the first one, but in this one, he was annoying in the beginning of the movie, but softens up once you get to see how action- oriented he is. The tiny cute tree guy, Babby Groot was annoying in the beginning, too, but he softens up too and becomes a likable, fun character. He doesn't talk much and usually only says ""Groot"", so, he has a quirk to him that makes him interesting and can be funny.<br/><br/>Then, we got the cute Asian, Mantis who decides to join the team and I found her annoying for some reason, I don't know if it's the actress or what, but she wasn't my favorite character.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's my autism or what, but I felt this movie was confusing and there were moments that were forced such as references to video games and the sad parts.<br/><br/>The third act was a bit predictable and the dialogue was obvious.<br/><br/>Verdict: The movie was heart-warming and the characters change but it's very complex and very slow. It's got some funny dialogue and fun action scenes. If you're not a fan of Marvels movies, this probably wouldn't be very entertaining for you unless you're in the mood. <br/><br/>I was tired when I watched this movie, I got up pretty early in the morning to go get my hair done."
"foxc-2","6","2","5","5 May 2017"," Brilliant but flawed
","Flawed certainly if you're expecting a reprise of part 1 but certainly brilliant in the special effects which are extravagant and mind-numbingly overwhelming. The plot, minimal as it is, continues the saga of the first film but otherwise follows predictable sci-fi/comic-derived paths; character development is also minimal and phony, personal interactions and situations are sentimental and boring used mainly to provide relief from the near constant barrage of sound and explosive visuals; music is triumphal or soft and flowing as befits the screen action. It's also flawed in the sense that they tried to incorporate some of the features that made the 1st film such a surprise and delight: the sparkling, inventive dialogue with its outrageous puns and allusions to the 70's occurs in part 2 but now it's thrown in out of context and totally bewildering in terms of its meaning. Similarly the cassette of 70's music and some songs of the era make predictable appearances but in a casual, pointed and rather nonsensical way. Part 2 takes itself seriously like many other ""save humanity from aliens"" features whereas Part 1 was whimsical and lighthearted where Part 2 is angry, driven and almost brutal at times. I gave Part 2 6 for the captivating, riveting special effects but the other 4 are lost for trying to incorporate features of Part 1 that no longer fit. IMAX 3D is stunning and do sit through ALL the credits; you won't be disappointed."
"Lord-Bigglesworth","8","2","5","5 May 2017"," Funny, beautiful, but a bit forced
","So I thought this was a very entertaining ride, possible funnier and with better visuals than the first (which is saying something.) However, I'm starting to notice a trend with Marvel sequels. Some sequels will try to crank up the action or the humor, sometimes effectively, other times less effectively. The issue with Marvel sequels seems to be that they try too hard to push the inter- character drama. We've got no less than four character conflict plot-lines going on in this film and they're all in some way forced on us in a way that does not feel to develop naturally within the confines of the film. <br/><br/>In a way the humor also felt a bit ""forced"" but it was in rather a good way--kind of like in how explaining a bad joke makes the bad joke even funnier.<br/><br/>Marvel has long been known for their weak villains, but I'm starting to think that it's not necessarily the villains that are the issue, but that, instead of focusing of the conflict that the villain presents to the characters, Marvel films insist on focusing on conflicts between the protagonists. And, in the way that a villain feels weak if we aren't convinced by their motivations in doing their nefarious deeds, neither does the character infighting drama really connect to us if we don't buy their motivation for bickering with one another."
"OlieRendch","8","2","5","5 May 2017"," Visually amazing, really funny, plot was a bit choppy.
","Guardians of the Galaxy was a break-out hit for Marvel in 2014 and has since become quite a pop cultural icon. Well, three years later and we return to this crazy space extravaganza seeing the likes of Star- Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, Groot and more once again. And it's these cast of characters that are one of the great things about these films.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt always seems like such a nice guy and his Peter Quill character is thus an enjoyable one to watch again. I enjoy Zoe Saldana and even though a notable number of her recent roles have been in very similar settings I find Gamora to be the most interesting. But for me, the best Guardian in this film was Drax the Destroyer; he had the best lines and got the hardest laughs from me. The other returning cast did great as well, I can't pick a problem with any of Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan or Sean Gunn's work here; they did just as well as they did in the previous movies with perhaps one or two having to stretch their characters emotionally and succeeding. Newcomers included Kurt Russell which was great to see and he played Quill's father really well, I can believe that the two are related. Pom Klementieff was surprisingly entertaining portraying the childlike gullibility of Mantis and am looking forward to how she'll be used in the future.<br/><br/>Story wise, Vol. 2 is very different from the first which was great as I don't like repetitive franchises but the plot wasn't as structured. It felt like half the story was focused on Peter and his dad and all that involved but then the writers had to come up with something for the other Guardians to do so paired them off with various characters and had them either sit around or have things happen to them for which they had to deal with. The final third was where it all came together though, as it would, and the climax was, although familiar in parts, visually unique and quite stunning thus making up for any narrative problems. And the Guardians films do have a lot of great visuals which is one of the reasons why I enjoy watching them.<br/><br/>In the end Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 wasn't as good as the first but I'm definitely not saying it wasn't good. I laughed out loud, it was surprisingly emotional, and having five post-credit scenes isn't as bad as it sounds."

","I loved the first movie from this franchise, so I had lots of hope and excitement. Sadly the movie was not up to that mark.<br/><br/>I felt numb in most of the scenes. I felt like running away during first half. I did not enjoy the story with base containing star lord and his father.<br/><br/>But I loved certain scenes. Groot steals the entire show, followed by mantis. I was waiting and waiting for the scene where Groot is taught to deploy something as shown in trailers. Other acts from groot were also awesome. The powers that mantis has is awesome too.<br/><br/>You will love it if you are regular marvel fan."

"ayoreinf","8","2","5","4 May 2017"," It's still a joyride, even if it doesn't take us by surprise anymore
","Guardians of the Galaxy vol.1 was a big surprise, a fun movie that didn't take itself too seriously but was still very well done. Cosmic, and still very human, and there were super heroes too. Well all this is true about vol. 2 as well, but it's no longer a surprise. So what. Good movies that don't take themselves too seriously don't get made so very often. With good acting all around, delivering that unspoken stuff so very perfectly, with the right amount of emotional involvement, stopping short at exactly the right time before it all goes sappy. And still presenting us with a group of very unconventional heroes that do work together well.<br/><br/>I don't know about you, as far as I'm concerned, that's all I want from a movie I go to see on the big screen. Great CGI, are part of the territory, same is true of the editing and the pacing of the movie. It's just great well made fun movie."
"Molongirl","8","2","5","3 May 2017"," Good entertaining movie but not for kids
","Great fun filled movie, fantastic special effects, a good follow on from the first. Kurt Russell as Ego was genius casting as he has that slightly arrogant, self satisfied look that was perfect for Ego. Baby Groot was brilliant and the glimpse of teen Groot in the post credits was so spot on accurate for those ""whatever"" years I laughed out loud. I thought each character was developed nicely and it certainly makes you want to see more of all of them. My only gripe was the excessive killing. The scene of the whistle arrow massacre on board ship just trivialised death to a comedic level, not necessary and not nice. Are we meant to laugh as hundreds are killed and then cry as one individual dies? This certainly makes it entirely unsuitable for viewers less than middle teens. I admit to a tear at the funeral scene, whether in reaction to hearing Father and Son or the character's death or a mix I'm not sure but it was a scene of loss and love well done. However the overall sense of fun and humour was great - the Hoff's brief appearance; the effect of excessive clicks in space travel; the hitch of the rolled out carpet for the Sovereign queen; Rocket's leaping bodies; the Blob like appearance of Ego's takeover (remember that crazy Steve McQueen's movie from the 50s) - and so many more moments had me in stitches. Whatever you do don't miss this on the big screen. A heads up - if you're like me and had no idea who the talkative old guy was or who he was talking to, or who the other seemingly significant characters with Sylvester Stallone were, you can always Google it - try easter eggs gotg2."
"drsecure","6","2","5","3 May 2017"," Great Comedy, Convoluted Plot
","GOTG vol. 2 certainly has a lot going for it and right from the opening sequence you can tell it's going to be fun. Overall I liked what the story wanted to be, but it just went a bit too much in the end. The heroes are great, funny, and well written. The bad-guy, long-lost-father is predictable and shallow. Toddler (not really a Baby) Groot is seriously cool and really lightens the mood throughout. The final battle sequence is visually striking, but way too convoluted and far-fetched even for a fantasy film. Sometimes all the Digital is just not physics relate-able.The best character development of the entire ride was Gamora and her sister Nebula. In a scene where they are genuinely trying to kill each other it is a believable feud. The story between Star Lord and his father Ego was bubble-gummy (playing catch in the backyard) and I saw his bad-guy turn very early on in the film. Why do writers have to have heroes always fall for the over-the-top promises of the villain? It reminded of me the Allegiant plot, where Woodley's Tris falls for all the mumbo-jumbo of the others once outside the city. I saw this in 3D at an advance press screening on 05/02/2017in an ATMOS theater. The 3D was pretty good, but a lot of the effects were muddled by all of the goings on in various battle, fight, destruction scenes, taking away from the overall effect and pulling me ""out"" of the movie at critical times. Overall this movie is a C+ for its execution."

"ChannelFAB","9","2","5","2 May 2017"," ""Review time A-holes!""
","So Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was a brilliant entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Its 'staying to 80s' theme stayed lucky from the first film introducing another great album. Talking about the album, there were two ways I saw the album in the movie, 1. It wasn't better in song choose than Vol.1 but 2. Its song fit more and perfectly with the scenes it was placed with, especially 'Mr Blue Sky' in the opening titles. Also on the topic of the opening titles, Having close ups of baby Groot dancing whilst in the background the guardians try to kill the inter dimensional beast was a great idea and show'd a side of threat with what the guards had to face. One downside of this movie was that it had a recurring problem which happens in almost every other MARVEL movie and that its bad villains. Ayesha was a bit... nath and made no attempt in the movie to make actions her own. Taserface was a villain which well... died instantly and finally, Peters Dad... Ego Ego who was made out to be a good guy turned out to be a odd villain, another floating head villain which would make sense as his other side is a planet with a face in the comics but he's basically just a redone Dormarmmu.... which isn't good... Overall, the movie was brilliant, I think personally Yondu was my favourite character due to his personality change and I would give this movie an 8/10 for all these reasons"
"drawlife","7","2","5","2 May 2017"," Serviceable fun.
","Vol. 2 is not as good as the first. Lets get that out of the way, but there are moments in the film that work better than the first, despite an uneven and overstuffed plot. <br/><br/>The crew are at it, and they're just as good as they were in the first film. Chris Pratt leads the team with his charm and charisma, which just oozes on screen. Zoe Saldana is great as well. She's got a lot more to do with her sister Nebula played by Karen Gillian. I didn't think their relationship was established well in the first film, but here in the sequel it's explored more which is a plus. Dave Bautista's acting is a lot better too. I felt the delivery of certain lines within the first film were kinda dry, but here he delivers them with more natural ease. The comedy involving Drax also felt more natural too, but this time around he isn't involved in a lot of action sequences besides the opening of the film, which is a huge disappointment. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel do excellent jobs projecting their voices to Rocket and Groot. <br/><br/>Aside from Pom Klementieff, the supporting characters however, they are the one's who shine. This to me was Yondu's film, as much as it was Hawkeye's in Age of Ultron. Michael Rooker totally brings his acting chops into full flare. James Gunn gave him a nice solid arc to his character and it's quite touching. We see a lot more of Yondu and who he is. He shares most of his screen time with Rocket, and the two come to a realization that they are a lot more similar than they think. More backstory is also fleshed out with his character involving Sylvester Stallone's Starhawk. Yondu's right hand man Kraglin played by Sean Gunn, James Gunn's brother also has way more to do in this one. <br/><br/>Gunn also gives Karen Gillian's Nebula a full story with something to contribute. While I thought she was kind of disregarded in Vol.1, here I finally got to know her better. Her backstory and her motives are fleshed out and we finally get to see her interact with Gamora a lot more. Their complicated love/hate relationship doesn't ever bring the movie down. It's handled eloquently and doesn't get too over the top. <br/><br/>The same can't be said with Mantis played by Pom Klementieff. It's not her performance really, it's just how the character was handled. I thought the naive attitude and characteristics she presented felt forced and overplayed. The film already tries to showcase how cute and naive Baby Groot is so I didn't feel like the film needed another character who does that. She does contribute to the plot however so kudos to Gunn for figuring all that out, but I would have preferred an iteration of Mantis more closer to the comics, who is slightly more mature with martial arts background, who could have easily been a body guard to Ego in the film, rather than some servant. <br/><br/>Speaking of Ego, I enjoyed Kurt Russell's Ego. He brought a sense of warmth as Peter's father. I bought into his character within a few scenes, simply because Russell knows how to deliver his lines effectively. Chris Pratt also effectively delivers on his performance anytime he has a scene with Ego. Without any spoilers Ego and Star-Lord's arcs in the climax are what salvages the film from what is a draggy and choppy middle act. <br/><br/>As for the villains, Taserface and Ayesha played by Chris Sullivan and Elizabeth Debicki, they don't bring too much into the table, but they also bring enough. They don't have much to do, but in a film that's got so many moving parts, Gunn again finds a way to have them be apart of the story. <br/><br/>The visual effects dazzle and the color palette is bright and vivid. I commend the hardworking visual effects artists who probably didn't get much sleep working on this film. Action set pieces are awesome and fun to watch, just wish Drax had more to do in that department. <br/><br/>Aside from the occasional ""been there, done that,"" feel to the film and a draggy second half, there is still enough to enjoy, with a few new elements sprinkled in. Gunn still manages to make a cohesive and entertaining film despite it being really uneven. I would hope that Vol. 3 would have a new tone and feel to it. It isn't Marvel's finest, but it's serviceable, not as terrible as the first two Thor films and the last two Iron Man films, but falls somewhere along the rankings with Ant-Man or Age of Ultron. <br/><br/>Stick around for the credits, there are five and they're not setting the seeds for the future really, but they're fun little segments. One of which perplexes me in a good way, and if you know the rights issues between Sony, Fox, and Marvel/Disney, you know exactly what I'm talking about. It was quite surreal and makes me wonder what other surprises are in store for the future of Phase 4, or whatever our Marvel king Kevin Feige decides to call it. <br/><br/>7/10"

","This is the much anticipated sequel to the smash hit launch film released in 2014, featuring the same band of misfit (superhero) buffoons that most fans (even Marvel fans) didn't even know about. It was obvious that the cast were still clearly very comfortable in their characters.<br/><br/>Whereas the first film was all about building a team of trouble-shooters, this was more about friendship and family, and we see Quill finally meeting his father, 'Ego' who turned out to be the villain in the plot, although not a really great memorable villain and this is where the plot lost it way a little for me in act 3.<br/><br/>My wife loved the original film and she's far from a superhero fan, I loved the original film, but this 2nd installment falls a little short, although it was still highly entertaining and funny with fantastic 3D effects that were full of depth.<br/><br/>You'll enjoy the excellent 80's soundtrack as well that runs from Quill's 'Awesome Mix 2' cassette tape.

"alindsay-al","7","2","5","28 April 2017"," A good fun space adventure sequel
","One of the most anticipated sequels in history is here in guardians of the galaxy vol 2 and I enjoyed this film, even though I do think this is a pretty disappointing film. The premise of the film sees the team attempting to avoid an ancient race hunting them down, while finding out more about star lords lineage. Chris Pratt is back as Peter quill/star lord In this film and he is truly great in this role, he provides a lot of charisma, humour and especially emotional depth to his character in this film. His character arc is the main plot in this film and he truly made me buy his character and the emotional journey he goes through in the film, while keeping his humour in this film. The rest of the team is back, Zoe saldana is back as gamora and she does a good job in this film, I liked her relationship with her sister nebula in this film and I feel like she did the best job she could even though she is a little underutilised. Dave bautista is back as drax and proves that he is the real deal in this film and proves that he is a future acting star. He nails all the humour that he is given in this role and has a bit of drama with his character but like saldana is a bit underutilised. Rocket raccoon and this time baby Groot are in full flow in this film and I loved both of there characters in this film for humour and drama. I also liked Kurt Russell's addition to the cast and I thought he provided a lot of charm to his performance and dramatic with Peters storyline. But the real show stealer for me in this film has to be Michael rooker's performance as yondu. He is given so much great character development in this film and I loved seeing him progress as the film goes on. He is probably the coolest character in this film and I loved how much better he was treated in this film then the first. The story has a lot of good pairings in it with emotional story arcs as the film develops, as you see the team progress together and apart which was well handled. However, this film is really not cohesive at all, there are to many story arcs in this film to follow and some characters get left behind. Also the character of ayesha and the sovereign are absolutely ridiculous and I hated there role in the story of the film. The script has a lot of humour in it, probably the most any marvel film has ever had and most of it works. But there is way too much humour in this film and at times it feels like a flat out comedy instead of an adventure film. The drama is handled very well in this film and I really liked how it helped develop the characters. The style of the film once again has the bright colourful look that the first film film did and I really liked that along with the action scenes. However, the pacing of the film is a bit all over the place especially with a bit of a lacklustre second act and maybe a little forgetful final confrontation that didn't deliver for me. Overall I liked guardians of the galaxy 2 but I wanted this film to be so much better with its execution, I hope they get a fresh start with the future projects but this is a decent film worth a watch if you liked the first film."
"rorymarsh00","8","2","5","29 April 2017"," Lightning Strikes Twice
","I should begin this review by stating that I am far from an MCU fanboy, and find many of the series' instalments adequate, but far from stellar. This is a feeling I largely held until the original 'Guardians of the Galaxy' arrived - a fun, fresh and funny addition to this cinematic universe, with a genuinely likable cast. In short, it was, by far, one of my favourite films in the franchise at the time.<br/><br/>Before sitting down to watch 'Volume 2', I was excited, yet sceptical. Whilst early reviews were positive, they all assured me that it was not as good as the first, and in some places a retreat of its predecessor. Having seen it, I am inclined to agree, but more of the same is far from a complaint. <br/><br/>Firstly, to focus on the plot. It achieves many staples of a good sequel. It expands on the universe (a lot!), develops the characters, and improves upon its predecessor (which is the case here, in places). I was worried, judging from the trailers, that the film may be trying to show more than it had time for, but fortunately, this was not the case. Instead, it introduces us to new races and organisations in the universe, making it seem like a much larger place that appeared in the original. The characters are well- developed here, and the relationships between them are clear and concise, however, the majority of time was allocated to Chris Pratt's Star-Lord, and whilst the rest of the cast did have decent screen time, it is clear that they were not the priority here, despite the all-round stellar performances.<br/><br/>Secondly, the soundtrack returns and is as glorious as ever. The use of music felt more frequent that in the previous film, and could prove a little unnecessary at times, but overall, the song choice was impeccable, and in some cases had a real relevance to the events unfolding on screen. The inclusions of Cat Steven's 'Father and Son', as well as Fleetwood Mac's 'The Chain', were very welcome. <br/><br/>The humour was another standout of the first film, and delivers here in droves. It often hits, but the frequency and unresting presence of jokes can ruin the more sentimental or serious moments in the film - causing a wavering tone that isn't quite sure which way to turn. Despite this, I can say that in my opinion, this was the most emotionally impactful film in the MCU to date, due to investment in the characters and how likable they are. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this film was a satisfying follow-up to the original, and I would struggle to determine which of the two is superior. The characters are as engaging as ever, the set pieces are glorious (despite a heavy reliance on CGI, rendered beautifully). The soundtrack is possibly better than the first (perhaps a little overused, but quality nevertheless), and the humour is largely on-point, but can be very in your face and ruin emotionally significant moments. All in all, this is worth a watch, and I will definitely be coming back to it once it is released on home video."
"valleyjohn","8","2","5","29 April 2017"," Comedy and soundtrack are the highlights
","Of all the Marvel films that I have seen over the last decade , The Dark Knight and Guardians of the Galaxy are my favourites. Because of this I was so looking forward to Volume 2 and I'm please to say I wasn't disappointed. This time the Guardians come across a mysterious being known as Ego , who claims to be the long-lost father of team leader Peter Quill . As Quill learns more about his past, the Guardians do battle with enemies old and new.<br/><br/>The reason I really enjoy these films have nothing to do with the story lines but more about the humour and soundtrack and volume 2 is ram packed full great tunes and brilliant one liners. Dave Bautista gets the best lines and he's laugh is infectious. From the brilliant opening credits where Groot is dancing to Mr Blue Sky by E.L.O while the guardians are fighting for their lives , you can't help smiling . loads of great obscure songs are squeezed into this film and there some inspired choices. Only when the film concentrated on the action in the second half of the film did I find myself getting a little bored not that the action wasn't great. Good stuff"
"thebackofmyhouse","8","2","5","29 April 2017"," Character driven and fresh
","It is one of the better Marvel movies, certainly the most emotional. It's a breath of fresh air for it to not have anything to do with Infinity Stones, Thanos, or Hydra. It's just about chilling with the Guardians and going with them on their adventures.<br/><br/>It didn't feel like the jokes were overdone like people said. And the criticism that the villain was weak was unwarranted because The Sovereign were not supposed to be all that powerful, they were supposed to comedic. The real villain was Ego.<br/><br/>Story-wise, it was the best of the Marvel movies. It really WAS about ""The Guardians Of The Galaxy"". Volume 1 is about what they are, Volume 2 is about WHO they are. And I might even say it has the best camera work of the Marvel movies.<br/><br/>It is a very character driven movie. An analogy I can think of is that is you like the last 2 Hunger Games movies better than the previous ones, then you'll like Volume 2."
"austin0731","7","2","5","28 April 2017"," Well, did it live up to the first one?
","Guardians of the Galaxy 2 in my opinion does not surpass the original film however is not a let down at all. The second film managed to tie in a more interesting aspect about family and therefore becomes a much more self centered and confined film which may be a put off to some as in nothing really happens and everything is generally self contained with not much implications on the greater MCU. However as James Gunn has quoted he does want the Guardians to be mostly its own separate thing despite having to eventually join the Avengers in the Infinity War. Which is a creative choice that I fully support, granted what makes MCU great is its ability to tie in all these different characters a separate faction is a breath of fresh air and is a chance for audiences to just have fun without having to worry too much about the overall continuity.<br/><br/>The film is very funny and contains many of the space battle sequences that we would like with a dose of Baby-Grootness that just edges on the line of being too much, a good thing that they have finally decided to bring back the old Groot as suggested in one of the five post credit scenes. My favourite character to come out of this second outing is Yondu and he actually plays a very interesting father-son dynamic between him and Quill also establishing a sort of rivalry with Kurt Russell's 'Ego' the planet. <br/><br/>Gamora and Nebula's relationship was also very interestingly explored, as i said this film features heavily on family and this sort of familial ties. Another relationship that I really liked was between Drax and newcomer Mantis, they make a very good dynamic duo and Drax himself does become a much more interesting character compared to his last outing adding many comedic moments. <br/><br/>One of my favourite moments was definitely Stan Lee's cameo, this is probably the best Stan Lee cameo so far, he is first seen speaking to a group of 'Watchers' an extraterrestrial race from the Marvel comics and then in the end credits seen trying to stop the Watchers from leaving telling them that ""there's more stories to tell."" What is so great about this particular cameo is that it confirms that Stan Lee is in fact playing the same Stan Lee in all of the Marvel films including his earlier non-MCU ones. Although this may not prove the Stan Lee is a watcher, it does seem like it has some ties to the Watcher and is interesting because he always pops up in major MCU events as Watchers do, as a sort of bystander. So just a fun Easter egg that Marvel throws in there. <br/><br/>So the film was really great and I enjoyed the comedic aspects as well as the further character development that a largely self contained film like this managed to do despite having slight flaws like having the Sovereign popping up randomly felt like kind of a distraction but well i suppose they were just there to set up for Adam Warlock in the upcoming vol. 3."

I don't often write reviews these days but this is a laugh a minute fun ride with a great soundtrack (including Jay and the Americans and ELO). Great in jokes and surprising cameo appearances.

","GOTG 2 is a genuine entertainment and right now the best blockbuster of this 2017. I don't know whether it's due to contract issues or creative decisions but Drax has more funny moments than Rocket and it works quite good to me. Tender nice and the most surrealistic moments with Baby Groot and adventure and non solved sexual tension between Gamora and Star Lord. The first half of the movie it seems that there's not a main plot or a super-foe like Ronan in the first movie but once the subplots seem to come to an end the plot thickens and I think it won't disappoint anyone.<br/><br/>Probably the most noticeable lack to me is the soundtrack. I think the playlist for the Awesome Mix Vol 2 is not so good as expected despite having themes from ELO, Sweet, George Harrison or Sam Cooke (and not his best song IMHO) but the rest is more disputable.<br/><br/>Don't miss this movie if you want to pass two hours and a quarter of joy and fun."

","I wanted to love this film and there is a lot to like about it. Unfortunately, it is far too violent for a pg13 rating. It should have been rated R.<br/><br/>As a responsible parent (father of three) I had to do a lot of explaining on our way home. My youngest (9) asked: Why crew members were floating in space without spacesuits? Why billions of people were being killed by the celestial blob? ""Are they going to come back to life when the bad guy gets killed Daddy? No, honey they are all dead now. All those people would be dead if that really happened. Oh... This is a stupid movie Dad can we go home?""<br/><br/>On the way home I got a barrage of questions about why Ego was trying to kill everyone in the whole universe and why Yondu killed himself on purpose when he could have signaled the ship just like Starlord did to save Gamora in the first movie. Why did Yondu kill everyone on his ship? Weren't they his crew and friends? (I had to explain mutiny.)<br/><br/>My 14 year old boy loved most of the movie but even he thought it was too violent for a PG13 rating. ""Yeah, they screwed up with the ratings. but most of it was cool."" We all thought baby Groot was cool. After the credits rolled, I mentioned to my son that his room looked a lot like teenage Groot's room; he mumbled ""I guess I am Groot.""<br/><br/>There are some very funny scenes and some profound messages about relationships in the film.

","The incredible world conquering success of the original Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014 caught everyone by surprise, no doubt even Marvel themselves were shocked at just how well the odd and colourful tale of a ragtag group of universe saviours resonated with audiences of all ages.<br/><br/>With the success of his first film, director James Gunn and his team of now household names and actors had an added weight on their shoulders, placed upon them by a world that was now expecting a lot more from them and in a very rare cinematic feat, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is a sequel that delivers and in many instances, is arguably better than its well-liked predecessor.<br/><br/>No longer needing to set-up characters or explain the extended universe the Guardians of the Galaxy find themselves in, Guardians 2 wastes little time in throwing us back into Gunn's fun, fresh and often laugh out loud funny take on the Marvel property, that sees our lovable crew (this time with a scene stealing Baby Groot and more of Michael Rooker's blue space bandit Yondu) come across Kurt Russell's Ego, a space God that just so happens to be the long lost father of Pratt's Indiana Jone's clone Star-Lord.<br/><br/>Gunn holds nothing back this time around, no doubt given a greenlight from Marvel to let his imagination run-wild, as the film starts out with a devilishly ingenious opening one-take segment that sets the film up for its break neck pacing, that pauses only slightly on its way to a thankfully non-generic finale, that's only real failure is that it feels a little bloated in its justification to see Guardians 2 run over the two hour mark.<br/><br/>The travels to this destination however offer up the great cast rapport that was built up in the first film, everyone is just as good if not better this time around with Groot and Dave Bautista's Drax stealing a fair chunk of the films best comedic scenes, while the increased screen time of Rooker's Yondu allows for the films best action sequence, as the bandit leader alongside Rocket and Groot make a seriously cool break for freedom aboard a villain filled craft.<br/><br/>These knowingly cool scenes (accompanied by another foot tapping mixtape) and comedic ticks showcase a crew and a director entirely in charge of their film and Guardians 2 is a film in total command of its offerings and sets up perfectly for a third outing, as well as the long hyped meet-up of the Guardians crew and the Avengers ensemble for next year's Infinity War.<br/><br/>Final Say ‚Äì <br/><br/>Proving that Guardians of the Galaxy's success was no one-off event, Guardians 2 is a true crowd pleaser that will be sure-fire winner for anyone that enjoyed Gunn's first adventure and a further solidification that this ragtag crew of heroes and anti-heroes, is one of the coolest Hollywood properties going around.<br/><br/>4 wannabe Mary Poppins out of 5"

The comedy is good but even this is repetitive by the end, with characters routinely pulling the same comedic stunt over and over again.<br/><br/>So while Wonder Woman teaches us to love feminism, Spider-Man: Homecoming teaches us to love diversity - GotG2 teaches us that a dysfunctional family is better than a solid family. It teaches us that fathers are bad and at least two characters literally want to kill their dad. Seriously, this movie hates the father figure.<br/><br/>It teaches us (as usual) that blonde people are bad and in this movie they're depicted as golden seemingly to push that message even harder. They live on a planet called ""Sovereignty"" (seriously), they're rude and never leave the planet, instead preferring to play computer games.

"far2driven","4","2","6","13 August 2017"," Guardians of your Wallet...don't go watch it.
","I watched the first Guardians film back in 2015 and I was impressed by it. August 2017, When Guardians II hit the dollar theater went to go watch it. I had a few laughs watching the movie, but ultimately, I was disappointed. <br/><br/>I thought that the humor was immature and infantile, only a limited scenes were laugh-out-loud. The plot was ill-written; I could probably write a better plot. We wanted to walk out of the theater just a few minutes in. Totally unrealistic physical scenes that defy physics rules of this current galaxy.<br/><br/>I did like how there was just a bit of family sentiment (which many could relate to), like the scenes with the sisters fighting and learning the reason as to why. An estranged father returning to the dude's life, but with ulterior motives; and also the heart and sacrifice between a foster father.<br/><br/>At $200 million to make this movie, I think the $ should have been spent on feeding Africa. If the actors got a good fee, got paid well, great for them but I hope they offered notes to the producers on what they could improve. Walked out just a bit early before the end of the movie. While in the bathroom, I heard two guys talking about how they didn't like Transformer Last Knight. Almost went to see that instead of Guardians II. <br/><br/>I believe the first Guardians was legit; this movie was over-the-top unrealistic, they've must have been smoking some serious dope when writing this sequel. Too bad we couldn't see brotha Guillermo Rodriguez (Jimmy Kimmel), funny story behind that. From the Earth scenes. <br/><br/>I wouldn't spend money on going to go watch this movie. 2 out of 5 star review. Just go watch the first film and believe that their story ended like that with no sequels. Or go watch Ethan Hawke in the movie Maudie. In my opinion, it's unbelievable how many people are giving this movie high ratings."
"Semisonic","4","2","6","13 August 2017"," Bells and whistles and family values
","When a movie has a single major flaw, writing a review is easy: just be sarcastic and keep hitting the same spot from different angles. But when a film, despite its gigantic proportions, is flawed on so many levels, you're often at a loss to choose which flaws to pursue. GotG2 is the perfect example of the latter case. So where do I begin?<br/><br/>The first thing that comes to mind is that, unlike the first GotG film, the sequel has lost the ability to get its act together. Sure, the first Guardians of the Galaxy was far from being a ""serious"" superhero movie (maybe because having Iron Man and Captain America battle each other is serious enough for the Marvel universe), but at least it could, when the circumstances demanded, be mature and even touching, the ""we are Groot"" moment being a perfect example. That contrast deepens the experience, making you care about what's going on ever so more.<br/><br/>This film, however, feels as if, with Groot reduced to a twig childhood state, the same happened to the brains of the other characters: now they are constantly risking the lives of their own and their friends' simply to pester their sense of masculinity or for the sake of unhealthy banter, only to end up with some turd jokes. There are a few glimpses of maturity here and there, but when yet another film with Kurt Russell and Vin Diesel tries to build all its pathos upon the ""we're family"" line, it becomes just too much to handle.<br/><br/>Another thing that strikes you about GotG2 is how all over the place it is. The Marvel universe is seriously lacking villains right now. And if the Avengers can afford to simply fight each other in the absence of a better thing to do, the Guardians have to be supplied with a multitude of strangely generic or single-use baddies, especially since the family values doctrine demands some old baddies to become goodies. The vindictive golden lady might have been mildly amusing if her plot line was put in here for jokes only, but the ending credits scene shows otherwise, so it's not even funny anymore. And the figure of Peter's father, despite all its technical grandiosity, ends up kinda hollow inside (in all senses). So even when the good (or should we say infantile and aggravating?) prevails, there's no true satisfaction in it.<br/><br/>Finally, there's this weird glossy neon atmosphere all around this film. Everything is polished and sparkling and blinking with a million different colors. In that sense, GotG2 definitely takes after Doctor Strange: both films, despite all their potential, look like some generic Japanese/Korean action RPG game: too fast-paced, too jerky and, most of the time, too meaningless. Maybe the overabundance of shiny objects and slapstick jokes was meant to hide that lack of essence the films fail to admit.<br/><br/>All in all, I take GotG2 as a sign of geriatric dementia for the whole Marvel universe. True, the style and the looks are still there, but when it comes to charting course forward, there seem to be no true aim ahead, and, most importantly, no true understanding of why such aim should exist in the first place. This makes the Guardians franchise not just the ""style over substance"" type, but simply pointless."
"roblesar99","8","2","6","4 August 2017"," One of the MCU's Better Sequels
","In 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy arrived in theaters as the biggest creative risk that Marvel Studios had undertaken at the time. A ragtag group of superheroes comprised of aliens, a talking tree, and a cybernetic raccoon surely couldn't have been the easiest sell at the office. But the film ended up being an absolute blast, a refreshing blast of fresh air that still holds its place as my favorite film in the MCU. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't the blast of fresh air that its predecessor was, but it is an entertaining sequel that further develops the relationships between these characters while providing more of its predecessor's trademark humor and colorful action. Make no mistake, director James Gunn takes full advantage of the color spectrum here, crafting a film with loads of visual splendor. This is a gorgeous film to look at, the bleak gray color palettes of the DCEU be gone.<br/><br/>The film takes a place a few months after the events of its predecessor as we find the Guardians working for the egotistical Sovereign, a golden, space-faring race. However, when Rocket steals something he shouldn't have, the gang takes off on an adventure that leads them to Ego, Star-Lord's long-lost father, all while being pursued by Yondu's Ravagers, the Sovereign, Nebula, and having to once again save the galaxy. Sound like a lot? Well, it is. While Gunn does his best to handle the multiple plot threads, the film isn't as tightly-focused as the first, the story relegated to the background in favor of action, characters, and humor. The film doesn't suffer entirely because of its character-centric focus, however. The tense relationship between Gamora and Nebula receives some much-needed fleshing-out, while we also learn more about Rocket's struggle to come to terms with his own existence. These developments are welcome, but I can't help but think that they would have worked better had Gunn cut down on the sheer number of characters in his screenplay.<br/><br/>However, the ending provides a much-needed emotional punch that seems like a rarity in today's superhero films. While the climactic third act action bonanza doesn't do much more than provide an explosion of colors and sound, the film's final ten minutes are truly emotional. There are actual stakes in this film, which is something that cannot be said for a majority of the films in the MCU. It gets tiring watching the heroes just pack it up after the fight and call it a day, but that's not the case here.<br/><br/>If there's one area where Gunn succeeds in his screenplay, it comes in the humor. He cranks the humor dial up to eleven and the overwhelming majority land with flying colors. I was genuinely surprised with the number of raunchy jokes that Disney allowed. And not only is Drax's comedic timing impeccable, but so is his laugh. Dave Bautista can act (Drax's scene with Mantis on Ego's planet in which they both look out over the landscape is beautifully touching.) Three years after the Guardians' first adventure, I couldn't help but smile seeing them again on the big screen. Bradley Cooper remains a delight playing Rocket Raccoon, who's likely still my favorite member of the Guardians. Zo√´ Saldana continues her sci-fi domination with yet another strong performance as Gamora, who has some of the film's more emotional moments opposite Karen Gillan's wonderful Nebula. Chris Pratt remains as charismatic as ever as Star-Lord, but I did feel that a couple of his lines could have been delivered with a bit more nuance. And I will say that although I enjoyed Baby Groot's presence in the film, I did find myself feeling that Gunn was trying a bit too much at times to capture the magic of the first film.<br/><br/>The real stars of the show here, however, are Kurt Russell as Ego and Michael Rooker as Yondu. Ego makes for a complex individual and Russell handles his overall arc with skill. Rooker, who has long been an underrated character actor, actually delivers the best performance in the film. Unexpectedly winding up as the film's emotional core, Yondu makes for a fascinating character. Above all, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a film about family. Sure, during a scene or two I thought to myself ""Wow, when I did start watching a Fast and the Furious movie?"" but Gunn does a bang-up job exploring his ideas by way of Star-Lord's two fathers: Yondu and Ego. Reflected against the Guardians, who have found a family amongst themselves, the film manages to explore some admittedly well-trodden territory, but in a way that feels somewhat fresh and allows for a majority of the questions that were posed in its predecessor to receive a satisfactory answer.<br/><br/>While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to superhero sequels, I couldn't help but leave the theater in a happy mood (and I'm pretty sure I was the last one to leave because I don't think anyone was expecting 5 whole mid-/post-credits scenes.) It doesn't quite match the freshness of its predecessor, but it does succeed at being more than your run-of-the-mill blockbuster thanks to Gunn's wildly imaginative mind. Armed with another fantastic soundtrack, vibrant action sequences, solid performances and quite a bit of wit, the film manages to make up for its somewhat uneven storyline. And if there's anything in this film that's an absolutely unquestionable improvement from its predecessor, it's the villain. Give us more villains like this one, Marvel.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 (Great)"

First, Michael Rooker. He always plays a version of Michael Rooker, and does it brilliantly. But his character carried 90% of the heart of this movie, and Rooker succeeded magnificently at moving me while saying and doing very little, an acting stunt I always admire.<br/><br/>And Dave Bautista's Drax, who had the least to do in the first film of all the major characters, gets much closer to the centre of this film.

"duanekimball","5","2","6","15 May 2017"," Straight to Star Trek V status
","I've seen the original movie probably 5 times and really like it. This one has little to do with the first, which is good. However, unlike other franchises where the second movie improves, this goes straight to Star Trek V status IMHO. There are way too many jokes. This may as well be labeled comedy-SciFi. Everyone likes comedies, but the jokes are repetitive and I was wondering when a fart joke was going to show up. The plot/logic is just ""poke you in the ribs"" annoying. The first scene with the fight. Why? It's almost as if they had a purpose built arena to fight the bad guy with the batteries (which no one explains) there for the taking. The people who hire the Guardians clearly have defensive capabilities and somehow have knowledge of this bad guy coming and don't use them...even though throughout the movie, they are more than willing to.<br/><br/>Ego..Death Star..'nuf said<br/><br/>Lots of questions like why didn't Ego just take Starlord at anytime before his mother died. Ego clearly indicates that Starlord is very important to his plans.<br/><br/>And then there's Yondu's arrow. This is clearly 100x more powerful than the entire Guardians' arsenal. Him and Peter's ascent into space was exactly like Peter's and Gamora's in the first movie, yet....<br/><br/>Why does Ego have to sleep?<br/><br/>The whole time, during any shoot out, you'll be wondering when it will end because no one can hit anyone else. If they do get hit and crash. No big deal, they'll just bounce right back and repair it.<br/><br/>Little Groot is suppose to be cute and they over do that too...but that will get the kids into the movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, If you've seen Star Trek V, then you'll get the references when you watch this movie."
"ulmeto","9","2","6","8 May 2017"," The second movie isn't as good as the original, but still has the same greatness in its core.
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. The sequel to the great and already classic first Guardians of the Galaxy which became absolutely one of the best in its genre. James Gunn also written and directed the second movie, as he did with the first one. <br/><br/>This film is a continuation of the first Guardians of the Galaxy storyline, in which guardians are mercenaries, who work for money or something else of value. The came back to what they all know how to do, but now they have a name and their services are special. <br/><br/>The Sovereign had their home planet attacked by an Abilisk that was wreaking havoc on the world and trying to eat the planet's power source. Believing it to be beneath them to fight it themselves, their leader Ayesha hired the Guardians of the Galaxy to kill the beast in exchange for Nebula, who was captured by the Sovereign attempting to steal Anulax Batteries. <br/><br/>The action in this movie moves the story very well, as after the job well done Rocket steals those batteries and all the Sovereign fleet is on their tail. Then they go to an asteroid field, so far it is more looks like an Empire Strikes Back narration, but even some posters are very much Star Warsish so to have at least a couple similarities in the movie. Indeed, this movie has similarities with Star Wars in pace and a little in its storytelling. Great that all that fleet of autopilot Sovereign ships are destroyed by one mysterious man who appeared from nowhere just after Quill's ship was about to be destroyed. <br/><br/>Many great dialogs, a great premise of funniness and smart talk from Drax, or Rocket, interacting with Baby Groot, voiced by Vin Diesel, the humor is entertaining and hooking, it is built up by many good dialogs after which all the jokes make sense. From the start the atmosphere is the same just as in the first movie, but the scenes are showed with more advanced technology in cinematography which made the beginning a little new, more looking like higher budget film already. More attention is focused on Baby Groot, his new personality, what he is right now and how cute he might be. There are a lot of CGI and visual effects in this film, sometimes more than it was required. And one of the biggest differences from the first movie is that everything seems so expensive in the second one. To the end it felt like required for that terrain and circumstances CGI was overused. Vol. 2 lost in atmosphere to be more relying on fun and entertainment. But after all the movie still feels like the original Guardians. <br/><br/>Exploring Quill's parentage appeared to very fun, his father is a very complicated dude, there is a lot to be explored about him and the whole history of his origin in the movie. Peter and Gamora are still unsure about their relationship with each other, it is also explored in the film. One of the biggest parts of the movie is the ravagers, their code, which Yondu broke by kidnapping children. There are many clans of ravagers, it is a one big family led by Sylvester Stallone's Stakar Ogord. His role is more like a cameo, looking on what little screen time he had, he still made it fun and had a couple cool lines. This how James Gunn explores the Marvel Cosmic Universe, it became more big and wide-ranged, many more things are to be explored next. Some characters had such a wonderful development. Yondu is such an interesting character. He raised little Peter for good. Nebula is a great character as well. How it is to be raised by Thanos, more terrible details about that and her relationship with Gamora. A lot of emotional feelings to all those stories we have seen or heard about in those two movies, as James Gunn makes it all connected and actually also brings his great storytelling with his hidden philosophy just as he did in the first one, where he had drama, action, comedy and space-opera in one movie with many issues that he addresses to massive audience. <br/><br/>The second film does it all, but the pacing was a little bit more rough, some advantages of the first movie were sacrificed to bring more jokes and crazy good moments. The villain is not disappointing, but pretty much like Ronan The Accuser, very serious, but also to be made fun of sometimes. And really ,Guardians always make fun of their villains, but this one will be too powerful to be actually funny, while destroying the Galaxy. Ronan was funny, with his too over-the-top serious lines, maybe because he was too serious he was beaten, but this villain, in GOTG Vol. 2 is not. Not to spoil anything, but there are more, than was shown in the trailers, much more, so can't talk about villains a lot in this movie. But this one is horrifying in its convictions. <br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 of cause has a beautiful soundtrack. Peter Quill is that motor that aggregates common jokes, referencing to some older TV shows or singers from Earth. Overall, this whole thing is about saving the Galaxy again, but also about family and friendship, brotherhood. The second movie isn't as good as the original, but still has the same greatness in its core."

"fredschaefer-406-623204","8","2","6","6 May 2017"," Bigger and badder the second time around.
","GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 brings back the wonderful rag tag group we fell in love with in the first movie and builds on their first adventure in a film that is bigger and badder in a good way. GOTG 2 is real space opera, filled with alien worlds and creatures, some of them coming and going so fast the audience can hardly keep up, while giving us one great set piece action scene after another. At more than two hours, the pace might get winded at times, but the story never gets ponderous or self important; there is plenty of humor, great dialog from characters who clearly get a kick out of being who they are, these GUARDIANS are the complete opposite of the grim and gritty minimalism of LOGAN (not that there is anything wrong with the latter).<br/><br/>Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and the baby Groot are all back in the thick of the action in the title sequence where they take down a giant space ugly on behalf of a haughty genetically enhanced race called The Sovereign, a golden hued people who appear as if they were created by Auric Goldfinger. The heroes have to flee for their lives when Rocket is caught stealing from their employers; they are saved at the last minute by Peter's long lost father, Ego, the Living Planet, played the always welcome Kurt Russell. Soon, Peter, Gamora and Drax are journeying to Ego's home world where Peter will get to know his father better, while the remaining three stay behind and soon find themselves at the mercy of Yondu and his Ravagers, who have be retained by The Sovereign to track the Guardians down.<br/><br/>If there is a theme to this second GUARDIANS movie, it is family, and what constitutes one. Peter yields to the call of blood, thinking he has found a father, not understanding that he already had one in the person of Yondu; Gamora and her sister, Nebula, are at each other's throats, having been raised to do so by Thanos; Drax's slain family is never far from his thoughts, and all of the Gurardians have become parents to the baby Groot. This is a common trope in the Marvel universe, where various empowered individuals come together a form a family unit, be it a real family like the Fantastic Four or mutant kind in the X-Men. It takes awhile, but in the end, the Guardians learn that they are all the family each of them need. In the end, Ego lives up to his name and Peter learns who is his true family, while Gamora and Nebula find a way to settle their differences as Drax takes an interest in Mantis, Ego's empathic pet of convenience.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Dave Baustista are back in fine form, so too is the great voice work of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel as Rocket and Groot. If anyone gets a real star turn, it is Michael Rooker's blue faced Yondu, a bad ass with a heart of gold. He nearly steals the film right out from under the rest of the cast. Pom Klementiff makes for a good addition as Mantis. I really wanted to see more of Sylvester Stallone as the head Ravager, and sadly, for us TANGO AND CASH fans, there is no on screen reunion with Kurt Russell, but Sly does have a scene with his old CLIFFHANGER buddy, Rooker. <br/><br/>There is some clunky exposition in the dialog and not all the humor and one-liners will be to everyone's liking. The villain's motivation may seem a little thin, but Marvel has always been notorious for their underdeveloped bad guys. <br/><br/>If I have any bone to pick with GUARDIANS 2, it is that there is no attempt to link up this piece of the MCU with any of the other ongoing Marvel series; though Thanos is mentioned, there is nary an appearance of Josh Brolin's uber villain from the first film, nor any sign of the Infinity Gems, all of which figure into the upcoming Avengers film where the Guardians are set to appear. But this is a minor quibble as this film goes a long way toward fleshing out the MCU with appearances by The Watchers, Charlie-27 (a cameo by Ving Rhames), Martinex, Aleta Ogord and the upcoming birth of Adam Warlock.<br/><br/>Where Tim Burton clearly loved style, and Zach Synder loved his big themes, GUARDIANS director, James Gunn, really loves his characters, and it comes through in a film filled with heart and soul, and a great soundtrack filled with 70's gold."

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is a fun movie that reacquaints viewers with some of the most lovable characters ever to conquer the big screen. Pratt is engagingly rascally as Quill, and Saldana brings a sassy charisma to the no-nonsense Gamora.Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 delivers a similar experience to the one provided by its predecessor except with more of nearly everything. The blessing of a sequel is that it reunites viewers with familiar characters doing familiar things. But as might be expected, Baby Groot steals the film.To some degree, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is a more offbeat film than the original, with better gags, better action, and more visual variety. It is one of the rare sequels which wins the heart of critics as well as Audiences.<br/><br/>My Rating : 4.5/5"
"Colin0001","8","2","6","5 May 2017"," This second slice is even better than the first.
","I enjoyed this movie a lot. Its more emotionally engaging than the first one, and therefore, to me, its the better film. True, some sections seemed to lack direction, but overall I found it to be a success. I can say the film had better action sequences (Yondu's tour-de-force is something to see) than the first . The story felt like a real story, with a purpose and driven by emotions and wants. Rocket seemed lightweight though, even though he had quite a bit of screen time, I think his lack of emotional engagement with others is what made him a lesser character. The same applies to Baby Groot. Towards the end Rocket does begin connecting, but that may play out more in future films. The trailers had Drax being funnier than he is in the film itself. In the film, he is more of an action man. Finding out a bit about his back story helps his character development too. Marvel are on a delicious slow burn leading up to the Infinity War. So far, so good. In fact, it wasn't good, it was excellent."
"heatsink98","6","2","6","4 May 2017"," A whole lotta backstories
","In short, Peter Quill's father finds him in this movie. They spend time together on a far-flung planet, getting to know each other, and then we learn the family has a secret. And it's not good. All the while, the Sovereign and their drone fleet have it in for the Guardians, but that doesn't matter a whole lot. More on that below.<br/><br/>Plotting on the second outing with the Guardians is a lot weaker than the first movie. This one spends quite a bit of time filling in character histories. The beginning also slips into wooden exposition of what's going on and what the Guardians are doing. The dialog has moments of snappy interchange, though.<br/><br/>As for the overall plot, it needed work. Peter's father, played by Kurt Russell, is a character with immense power, and that causes a problem. He's so powerful, in fact, that he completely removes any threat to Peter and his friends for most of the movie. That makes for a dullsville plot. With a character like that in the mix, writing a strong plot is a huge task to pull off successfully. In Guardians Vol. II, it didn't work out well.<br/><br/>What we ended up with was a dragging section from 1/3 of the movie on, at least until we learn what Peter's father is really up to. Then, we're back in business. The problem is that it takes waaaay too long for that to happen. The Sovereign and their drone fleet, as well as Yondu's bunch, cause some problems for Rocket, but they're a non- factor to the rest of the Guardians until the very end of the film."
"ryanskywalker-87402","7","2","6","3 May 2017"," ""Sometimes, the thing you've been looking for your whole life, is right there beside you all along.""
","Character-driven ensemble pieces are fast becoming my favorite sub- genre within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. James Gunn takes all the style and flair from his first beloved (and slightly smug) space adventure, and adds a great deal more substance this time around. Too often blockbusters have taken the shortcut to meaningful character development, audaciously implying or declaring their heroes to be a ""family"" without putting in the necessary leg work. Guardians Of The Galaxy is one such movie, but its sequel goes about actually justifying it. It sure as hell earns that smugness.<br/><br/>Above all else, it gets its characters right. Gunn's working with a larger ensemble this time, and yet, somehow, nobody feels as short- changed as before. He shrewdly invests in some unexpected pairings, leading to a whole new wave of hijinks, heart and hilarity. This isn't the Peter Quill show anymore. Rocket & Groot aren't the only dynamic duo in the business. Each sub-plot imbues these heroes/anti- heroes with greater depth, even if it's at the sake of the story's momentum. We're able to explore powerful father-son themes, build on relationships featured in the first film, and bask in the incredible chemistry shared between this wonderful cast. Even the various antagonistic figures feel more fleshed out than the shouty-pouty- Ronan - and you're given a very strong reason to hate a few of them here.<br/><br/>The film walks a fine tonal line between high stakes sci- fi/adventure and light-hearted comedy - and to its credit mostly succeeds. The timing doesn't always work. Gunn undercuts a few key emotional scenes with the odd tired one-liner, but the goofy self- parody is, once again, quite endearing. This also leans more towards a Star Wars-inspired space opera. The stakes feel naturally higher, and splitting up the core group allows for multiple interwoven subplots - each one separated by a different visually stunning setting. It lends the story a sprawling sense of scale that proves that, in this case, bigger is indeed better."
"rosaliesummers","8","2","6","1 May 2017"," A sequel that is as equally good as the first
","I always expect to be disappointed with sequel movies, but that was definitely not the case here! Guardians Of The Galaxy Volume Two has just as much action and humour as it's predecessor, whilst also taking the time to expand the universe and focus more on the backstory and relationships between some of the characters, (namely between Quill and Yonda, and Nebula and Gamora). Although there is still a lot of humour, there are a few sad twists to the story and it has more emotional depth than the first movie.<br/><br/>As you would expect from any Marvel movie, the visuals and special effects were absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>The two characters who stood out the most for me were Baby Groot (the cute factor was off the scale, yet he still managed to be sassy at the same time), and Drax, whose bluntness and general craziness is hilarious. I also thought the new character of Mantis was a nice addition, although I don't know if she stays with the gang or not. Acting is superb from all the cast. I also really love Nebula and I'm glad we had some nice moments focusing on her and her history with Gamora.<br/><br/>The things that let the movie down were the soundtrack and the Stan Lee cameo. The first soundtrack was just so amazing, and although still good, I don't think the new quite measures up. I'll probably still buy it though. Also, I know they like to have a cameo every movie from Stan Lee, and sometimes it works, but other times it doesn't, and this time it really doesn't. I guess they needed some way to squish him in there but it's clear the only point of the scene with him in is to feature him, there is no other purpose. He's old, let the man take a break, jeez. Although most of the jokes were fantastic, the 'taserface' joke was annoying, as I've seen lots of people agree. Rocket in general was just not as good in this movie as he was in the first, being argumentative for the sake of it. I guess it lacks a little of the charm the first movie had too. <br/><br/>Overall, a great addition to the MCU! It's slowly building the hype towards Infinity War what with the brief mentions of Thanos and infinity stones. Definitely stick around for the end credits, there were several funny extra scenes that are worth watching."

"luigicastropernia","9","2","6","29 April 2017"," GoTG Volume 2
","First I need to apologize to James Gunn for doubting him, :( volume 2 is way way better than the first GotG movie. The humor is well placed this time (yep there are still a lot of them the whole movie) and they did not let Star Lord be just a comic relief character, (imagine him standing beside Cap and Iron Man you can now consider him somehow equal) thank you for doing that.<br/><br/>The whole team got equal exposure time even the new members and just like from the first movie that's enough time for the audience to love or appreciate each character throughout the film, you can say that this is the perfect superhero team movie ever made (learn from this Fox, learn from this so you can do X-men right) and it's even better than the Avengers movie for me to be honest because of the way all of their characters interact with each other perfectly and made the plot even better. Yes Baby Groot may have stolen the spotlight most of the time (you cannot resist his cuteness and actually no one can) but you can still say that this is a freaking Guardians of the Galaxy movie not just the Baby Groot show.<br/><br/>CGI is perfect especially during space travels and planet/system jumps. Yondu's new appearance made a lot of fan boys happy (yay for fan service). BEST STAN LEE CAMEO! (another fan service yay!!). Those aerial battle and fight scenes are still getting better and better (some of the fight scenes from the first movie are still the best). The main villain is not perfect but relatively this one is pretty commendable for an MCU villain. This villain is on par with Ultron in terms of development I think (you gotta find out yourself who's the main villain ).<br/><br/>All in all GoTG Volume 2 was a success <3 and I will rate it 9/10. Everyone will enjoy it including your friends,the whole family, Marvel fans, DC fans, casual movie goers, enemies, and yes I really mean it, everyone will enjoy this movie no doubt.<br/><br/>Other notes -Wait for those 5 post-credit scenes before you leave the theater. No major revelations for Infinity Wars but there's one for the 3rd GotG movie (brace your-fanboy-selves) and the other 3 are still enjoyable so they are worth the wait."
"mccaughanp","8","2","6","29 April 2017"," Stop comparing it to the first one, it's a completely different type of movie!
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is another unique and fresh addition to the MCU and like Vol.1, it's different to any other MCU movie. First of all I enjoyed the simplicity of the movie, because it didn't use the standard Disney Marvel how to make a movie structure. The use of Michael Rooker and Karen Gillian in Vol. 2 was a very good idea because it added more dynamic to Gamora and Peter Quill, which you will find out when you watch this movie. And you should see this movie because it's fun and throughout is hilarious. However my one suggestion to anyone wanting to go see this movie is to not sit in the very front row because there are a lot of jolts and fast paced action in this, so if you're looking up at the screen it can get quite confusing and trippy to watch. Everyone was good in this movie including Vin Diesels incredible performance as Groot which definitely deserves an Oscar. Stan Lee's cameo in this is actually quite interesting and in more than one scene."
"kermitkid","9","1","2","30 March 2020"," Still fun
","The best thing about Marvel is also the worst thing: They always try to outdo themselves with the next film in the MCU. Sometimes it really works like with this film, and Captain America 2 and 3, and sometimes it doesn't like with Iron Man 2 and Thor 2. But the advantage is they know how to keep making it better. They take fan's criticisms and complaints into account and try really hard to fix them. Such is the case with this film. Not that I had anything to complain about with part 1, but man, this definetely beats part 1 by a lot. Everything about this is better. The pacing, the story, the dialouge, the humor, and even the soundtrack. It manages to keep the style, spirit, and tone of everything we loved about the first film while also breaking new ground with it. It's very hard to make lightning strike twice, especially with a film with as weird a premise as Guardians of the Galaxy. By all accounts, the first film shouldn't have worked. Even more so the case with this film. Marvel has managed to do the impossible twice now. This is good, because it proves they're willing to take risks, but this is also bad, because now they'll be forced to outdo themselves every time, until eventually they'll be crushed by their own unattainable expectations. I'm very worried this will happen in the near future, especially as new films come out with new characters and new crossover films. Will we eventually be too greedy and want more and more and bigger and better each time until we're disappointed? I hope not. I know this isn't really a review of the movie, so much as it is about Marvel, but it's getting really had to keep this spoiler-free. Trust me, this is one film where you want to go in knowing as little as possible. Don't read the comics, don't use social media until you've seen the film. And I cannot stress this enough: Do not leave until ALL the credits have finished!!!!.
There is a total of 5 (Yes, FIVE) end credits scenes. And all are important especially as we gear up for Infinity War.

Producer: ""Who cares, just add loads of CGI to the jokes; it'll work.""<br/><br/>This was seemingly the mentality behind 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'. My word, what an awful movie!! The humor was so effective and funny in the first film, but here it is overbearing and so slapstick that only Americans will find it funny. This film is so thickly layered with humor and CGI that there was not an inch of seriousness or reality to the entire film. The feuding sisters, Gamora and Nebula, were so incredibly annoying and laughable that it was cringe worthy. I mean, honestly...!!<br/><br/>'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' proves one should never add too many ingredients to a recipe that works well. This was just overdone on every level. The action scenes were cartoonish, the visual effects looks like it was done in a hurry, the use of CGI is so heavy, at times I thought I was watching an animated film or a computer game. A LOT of time was spent on unnecessary silly moments, so much so that I often reached for the remote control to skip past these awful scenes.<br/><br/>There's also so much inconsistency in the film and the premise is preposterous, to say the least. There was nothing interesting about any of the characters. And why were there scenes when Drax all of a sudden had piercing blue eyes, while most of the times they were yellow-ish. They were never blue in the first film. Speaking of Drax, he was the only character I liked in the film, and only Dave Bautista made the film worth watching. I didn't consider Peter Quill a hero in this film, Rocket was more annoying than funny, and Halle Berry lookalike Gamora with her avocado facial mud mask was same old, same old. At least Baby Groot was adorable.<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed the first film, I absolutely loathed this one. Nothing here felt or looked real.

","Introduction:
I really loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy because it was surprisingly funny, had outstanding special effects and amazing characters. It was emotional and action packed and all was balanced very well. So when Guardians of the Galaxy 2 came out in cinemas I was very excited but also feared it would fail. After watching it for the first time I was relieved. It had everything the first movie had, although a bit weaker in some parts, but it still felt like a unique movie and a worthy sequel. Now I¬¥ve recently rewatched it and I¬¥ll give you my thoughts in this review!<br/><br/>
Review:<br/><br/>1. Story
Even when watching for the second time I felt like every scene had a place. There is still the good mix of elements that made the first one so great. The sci-fi aspect is even a bit better here in my opinion. When it comes to the humour it starts decently good early on, but gets a lot better over time. It definitely tries to get in more jokes than in the first movie which sometimes makes it feel a bit too much or predictable. The action is still amazing. It feels bigger but not better or worse. The movie has very emotional moments aswell, which I appreciate a lot. The new characters were introduced very well. I felt like each character had a purpose and good development. The dialog is interesting all the way. As already mentioned the jokes can be a bit too much but other than that, the movie manages to provide good dialog. A lot was done with expressions and it didnt always need words and that makes certain scenes very powerful and shows how talented these actors are. The pacing is great aswell.
(8,2/10)<br/><br/>2. Visuals
The worldbuilding is amazing. We have many changes of location and each feels unique, with their own species and ways. The story doesn¬¥t just happen to be in those locations, the locations are a central part of the story. The special effects feel fresh and very well executed. At several parts I noticed how good the cgi looks. It has a unique style and feels polished. The costumes/makeup give the characters even more traits and enables us to distinguish all of them. The colors are sometimes a bit too bright and colorful for my taste when it comes to the locations and a fight here and there but overall I really like the visual style of the movie. I honestly did not notice the camera techniques too much and that¬¥s not even a bad thing. It felt smooth and always fitting, it just didn¬¥t do anything too crazy. It got close when wanting to show the faces in emotional moments and I also remember it being used well in a very funny scene. Similar can be said about the editing. I really liked the transitions when multiple things happened at the same time. Cuts are barely noticed and that is a great thing to say. It¬¥s glides from scene to scene and it all just feels very fluid.
(8,2/10)<br/><br/>3. Audio
Like in the first movie music is a central part of the story. I have to say I love music and the way it is used here is just great. Just like the aspects mentioned before music is used to enhance the story. The song choices were well thought out and I honestly love what peter quill listens to :) The soundeffects are equally used. It makes the world come to life and especially helps the sci-fi aspects.
(8/10)<br/><br/>
Conclusion:
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 may not be as fresh and funny compared to the first movie, but it manages to introduce some new exciting characters and give them and the known characters good development and emotional depth. It¬¥s a well paced emotional thrill ride from start to finish with music and visuals that are a central part of the story and characters we love and care about. Despite it¬¥s little flaws, it¬¥s funny, action packed, emotional and visually amazing. For me this is a worthy sequel and I can really recommend you to watch it if you liked the first one.

","This movie follows the Guardians from the first movie as they meet an unexpected figure. Meanwhile, they are pursued by different dangerous groups and their pasts return to haunt them.<br/><br/>I did not like this movie. The acting was great as always, especially Chris Pratt's and Zoe Saldana as Starlord and Gamora, respectively. The visual effects, as well, were fantastic and in some cases even beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>However, this movie was very hard for me to enjoy. The story feels very clich√©d most of the time, and it suffers from a lot of poorly-written dialogue. Because of this, it was hard to take the story seriously or appreciate the cast's acting. It also had a lot of out-of-place, badly timed jokes about private parts. Most of the comic relief felt childish and poorly timed, to be honest. I wouldn't watch this again."

","I can't say I'm a big fan of comic book movies, but I actually really enjoyed the first GOTG, so I decided to give the sequel a go....I shouldn't have bothered!<br/><br/>This film is horrendous! The first scene was one of the worst I've ever seen and then it just got worse.<br/><br/>All through the film the CGI is awful, nothing is believable, acting is shocking, the jokes are constant, but unbearable and I don't know what the story was, as I was too bored too pay attention. Give me Plan 9 from outer space or The Room any day....maybe even 2012, although that might be pushing it."
"BA_Harrison","5","1","2","20 February 2019"," Far too much lame humour.
","God-like space traveller Ego (Kurt Russell) reveals to Peter Quill (AKA Starlord) that he is his father and tries to convince his new-found son to become part of his plan to assimilate the entire universe.<br/><br/>I'm one of the few who didn't enjoy the humour in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie: I just didn't find it funny. So you can probably guess how I feel about Vol. 2, which ramps up the level of comedy even further. I can't say I'm disappointed that James Gunn won't be directing part three (although I do think he was treated very unfairly by those in charge).<br/><br/>But Vol. 2 doesn't just suffer from an excess of bad gags: the plot is weak, the pop soundtrack is overbearing, at 136 minutes it's way too long, and the action is too far-fetched (even for a comic book sci-fi film featuring a talking raccoon and a dancing baby tree). Our heroes are thrown into numerous situations that would reasonably result in a very messy fate, yet they repeatedly manage to emerge unscathed. Suspending disbelief is one thing; accepting that a character can escape certain death time and time again is asking too much.<br/><br/>Admittedly, Gunn has produced a film that looks great, with some mind boggling special effects and mesmerisingly beautiful scenes that make wonderful use of colour, but with such a silly plot and execution that frequently defies logic and the laws of physics, it's hard to care too much about what happens to the good guys.<br/><br/>In short, this is the second best film to co-star Sylvester Stallone and Michael Rooker, Cliffhanger still clinging firmly on to first place.<br/><br/>5/10, simply for sexy insect alien Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and tasty blue bald cyborg Nebula (Karen Gillan), both of whom make watching just about worthwhile."
"cricketbat","8","1","2","28 December 2018"," I think I like this sequel more than the original
","From the opening credits to the final battle, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is highly entertaining. I think I like this sequel more than the original. It's a bit silly for adults, and it's a little too dark for children, but it feels just about right for teenagers. Is it a perfect movie? No. Do all the (many) jokes land? No. That doesn't really matter, though, because if you just sit back and enjoy the ride, you'll realize this is precisely what a summer blockbuster should be."

","The only thing that keeps me from rating this lower is that, occasionally there is humor. All in all this movie is one big bore. Scattered plot, too many subplots, stupid fight scene.

"gamergcfan","Null","1","2","27 July 2018"," Lacks what made the first movie great
","The first movie was great. It was exciting, packed with funny jokes, and very emotionally resonant. The plot was also good without being flaky.
However, this seriously falters when compared to the first movie. It lacks the oomph the first movie had due to its dragging pace and lack of good characters to make you feel for what happened. The jokes feel forced here rather than funny. It also lacks the emotional resonance with poor, forced melodrama (and the characters, again). Finally, the plot is uninteresting and doesn't make a lot of sense.
As always, good visuals, but there should be no reason for this movie to be rated a 7.7 when it is far inferior from the first movie."

"Sweetigal85","7","1","2","27 May 2018"," A dazzling, enjoyable mess
","I love fantasy and super hero movies but lately these movies have really been getting out of hand. They definitely sacrifice the plots for the special effects. I would be willing to bet that about five minutes of this movie was actually real while the rest of it was done on a green screen.<br/><br/>The special effects and Chris Pratt himself are in fact dazzling to watch. The acting is very good and the moments between Peter and Yondu were most endearing to me. It was amazing how much comic relief and senseless humor was crowbarred into the movie and yet the scene where Yondu sacrifices himself for Peter was still able to be so poignant amidst so much wackiness.<br/><br/>People seem to really like the soundtrack to the movie but to me much of the movie felt like a drug trip because of it. I personally do not care for the array of characters in the Guardian movies. Like, a talking raccoon and tree? What is going on here? I would have liked to have seen more scenes between Peter and Gamora and less nonsense between all of the others.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell's acting was amazing in this movie but the character that he played was very perplexing. I am not sure I fully understood what was actually going on in the end. But I am glad he got what he deserved.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I laughed my head off during this movie and I would definitely recommend it. I just think that it is not without flaws."

","When I watched the first one I enjoyed it so much, really funny and entertaining, but this movie is one of the worst I've seen in a while.

One of the most positive points of the last movie, the sharp banter is drastically contrasted by how cringe-worthy the banter is in this movie. Seriously bad dialogue, also just not funny in general."

"superdynamiteultraplatinumlee","10","1","2","10 March 2018"," Guardians of the galaxy is beast!
","Guardians of the Galaxies is the best movies ever. It has many humorous, action-fixed, and emotional scenes. All of the characters in this movie have their own interesting personalities.<br/><br/>The rating of this movie is PG 13, so most people can watch this. My first reaction from seeing first picture of the movie being released. I thought that this was going to be some nerdy science fiction movie. There's a green alien woman, followed by blue one with glowing red hair, a raccoon, and a tree like figure. The extraterrestrial beings in Gamora, Yondu, Drax, and Groot did not appeal to me. The movie came out in 2014, I did not pay any attention to it until 2016 where I watched the Guardians of the Galaxies two. The sophomore banquet committee decided that we needed a reward for all our hard work after a successful school function. So, everyone but me picked a movie (I am not much of a movie watcher). I thought it was going to be so lame because prior I had never really watched any Marvel movies. On a side note, I love Marvel because they produce so many attention getting movies.<br/><br/>The songs are really catchy and throw back like. On Spotify, I have added so many Guardians of the Galaxies sound track music to my playlist. Songs such as ""Hooked on a Feeling,"" ""Brandy, you are a fine girl,"" and ""Blue Sky"" are songs I listen to when I do homework. The audience will definitely fall in love with these songs.
Sorry this is an English assignment 
The futuristic space portion of the movie was very interesting. It showed us what it would be like if we lived on different planets and could travel between them. We see different type of other beings with different physical appearances than human beings.<br/><br/>There were many hilarious scenes. In those scenes, the characters use saracasm something the audience is very accustomed to. Somehow the movie directors made the script so that the characters constantly make fun of each other and argue and in the end, it ties to the theme of family.<br/><br/>This movie covers three of the persuasive elements: ethos, logos, and pathos (mostly pathos). The heroes in the story do ethically the correct thing at the end by saving the universe. Pathos is everywhere with the humor.<br/><br/>Overall, I think most people would enjoy this movie unless they have no sense of humor.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Movie counter arguments<br/><br/>This is the guys dissing the movie:<br/><br/>Where do I even begin? Oh my... this script could have easily been written by a 10-year-old, practically every move and line of dialogue were predictable, clich√©d, and downright cringy most of the time. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why this 'movie' gets any form of praise for the 'acting' that took place in this movie. The aforementioned acting was weak, not only did the story lack substance, but practically every interaction is inevitably guided towards infantile, unintelligent humor. The CGI/Animation were not up to the standard that we are accustomed to from Marvel, it was just flashy and all over the place. I usually try not to write any negative reviews, but this was just too much to handle. I am a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I was in awe as to how awful this movie was. Marvel movies have silly humor here and there but a good portion of the jokes are well placed in their movies, they can even be intelligent and memorable; but this... whatever this was... horrendous writing. If you are like me, and want to be up-to-date with what's happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and that's why you chose to watch this movie, you didn't miss out on anything.<br/><br/>Where can you even start? First off, your name is the movie casual enthusiast. So, why are you even critizicing this movie if you're an enthusiast. Don't put that as your username if you're not going to be enthusiastic for movie. Your username should be ""Comments that no one cares about."" Are you serious? You're saying that a 10 year old child could write a multimillionaire production. You must come from a different planet if that is possible. I bet when you were 10 years old, you didn't even know how to write your name. If everything was so predictable, please tell me that you knew Yondu was going to die. You couldn't predict that. If you thought the acting was weak, then you're downgrading the whole Marvel organization. They would've picked the most qualified actor to fulfill this part. If there was only unintelligent humor, then that means you did not laugh at all watching the movie. Please tell me that you didn't laugh at all, so that I can expose you for being a robot and turn you into the government. If you are truly a big fan of Marvel, then you would accept that this movie was awesome. This just proves to show that you are not a true fan. Next time, just stay home and read a book.<br/><br/>If you want to enjoy a fun filled movie with many action scenes, this is the movie."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","1","2","18 February 2018"," It always keeps a keen focus on its characters; a great follow-up.
","One of its biggest assets is its refreshing separation from the wider cinematic universe, free from the shackles of forced intertextuality, which allows it to be a self-contained sequel experience that succeeds in maintaining the spirit of the first even if it never reaches its quality. The final act is a little too big and over-the-top, some of the action focuses too much on CGI and the feature lacks a driving antagonistic force for much of the run-time but it is still a very fun and entertaining adventure that always keeps a keen focus on its characters. It's surprisingly emotionally resonant, too. A great follow-up. 8/10"

","Three years after a risk-taking gambit that turned into a roaring success, the follow-up to the ""G of G"" came with absolute self-assurance aiming directly at the summer blockbuster market, and hit its mark squarely. The entire company is back, but good old Groot who gallantly sacrificed his life to protect and save his friends is replaced by his cute offspring little young Groot, who has inherited his entire, rich vocabulary of ""I'm Groot"" (same voice, that of Vin Diesel). Introduced to this sequel is villain high priest Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki who, even with her face painted completely gold, is still beautiful as her Jordan Baker in the recent The Great Gatsby remake). The true villain however is Star-Lord's Quill's (Chris Pratt) finally discovered father Ego (what a name!) played by the inimitable Kurt Russell. He has every right to claim that name as he is a ""celestial"", that is a god, with a small ""g"" as he humbly adds. As you would expect, the villainy and treachery are revealed only towards the end, fueling a final face off between father and son.<br/><br/>There are a number of minor sub-plots. Also introduced here is Mantis (lovely French actress Pom Klementieff), a child-like species with emotion-reading (but not thought-reading) power, initially serving Ego and eventually, among other things, became the love interest of Drax (Dave Bautista). The romance between Quill and Gamora (another beautiful actress, even painted entirely in green, Zoe Saldana) is still held at a tantalizing stage. Given more attention is the sister issue between Gamora and Nebula (Karen Gillan, count 4 of beautiful actresses) moving towards sort of defrosting. An odd couple comradeship develops between Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) and Yondu (Michael Rooker), with full mutual empathy for the shared characteristic of abrasive behavior hiding a tender heart. Most touching, however, is that ironically, after finding his biological father, Quill finally realizes Yondu has always been the father he wanted. Yondu echoes that sentiment ""he may be your father, but I am your daddy"".<br/><br/>This movie gives the audience an sumptuous visual feast, cutting-edge set pieces and unabashed comic comedy - best summer blockbuster entertainment this year."
"alexandregatineau","5","1","2","30 January 2018"," What went wrong?
","Volume 1 was, to me, a good surprise. This one, the other way around. <br/><br/>I'll make it short: the first one was kinda ""ha, this is original right? You didn't expect that now did you?""
This movie starts good and inevitably falls in the ""big evil guy who wants to destroy the universe, we have to stop him"". 
So, some guy wants to destroy the world, our heroes unite their powers, but only the hero can defeat him, there's a sacrifice, let's celebrate and go home. <br/><br/>And something I can't stand is, the racoon stealing the expensive things that the beginning almost got everyone killed and is the whole reason the movie went this way. Just because an idiotic CGI racoon acted like an idiot, they clearly almost died. A bit too much. <br/><br/>There's really not much to say about this movie. Like volume 1, but meh."
"myfransson","5","1","2","27 January 2018"," Disappointed.
","I had very high expectations for GOTG2 and was really hoping for the same fun vibe, great music and characters. I was very disappointed. No real funny moments that kept you watching, the music was not the same quality and way to much sentimental stuff with Quill's father and Gamora and Nebula. Really did not enjoy the movie. Very big downstep from the first one. The only thing that kept me from rating it 2/10 was Baby Groot."
"phubbs","8","1","2","19 January 2018"," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
","The fifteen movie in the Marvel cinematic universe, the Guardians travel all over the universe trying to unravel the mystery behind Peter Quill's parentage. That's the plot right there, that's it.<br/><br/>So the start of this movie shows us the origins of Quill's parents with a de-aged CGI Kurt Russell, something we've seen before and is becoming more popular. Gotta be honest, this looked very impressive. Twas impressive with Michael Douglas in 'Ant-Man' and its impressive here with Russell. From there we zip straight over to the opening credits which roll whilst the Guardians are fighting a big alien monster. Amidst the chaos Groot plays and jigs to 'Mr Blue Sky' by ELO via Star-Lord's walkman. Its a quirky intro and certainly enjoyable...except for the choice of song, but that's just me.<br/><br/>So as I said the basic plot involves Quill finding his father who turns out to be a God-like celestial called Ego (Kurt Russell). Naturally Ego would like to rule the universe with his son at his side, and Quill is curious, but sharply declines after discovering Ego's dark secrets (he killed Quill's mum). Of course whilst all this is going on the other characters have their own little subplots. Gamora is fighting off her sister Nebula once again. Yondu has been hired to capture the Guardians by the Sovereign race because Rocket nicked some precious batteries from them. This causes Yondu internal conflict which results in a mutiny by some of his men. Groot is still slowly growing up, and Drax starts a slow burning romance with Ego's assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff). Oh and Rocket is still a wise-ass.<br/><br/>I think the main thing I noticed with this sequel was the increase in comedy...silly comedy. Its a little bit too obvious that Gunn is trying a little bit too hard with the gags, but anyway. In the first major space battle Quill and Rocket are arguing about who is the better pilot. Rocket remarks that later later on he will put a turd in Quill's bed. But not one of his turds, one of Drax's turds. Drax immediately laughs out loud and proclaims 'I have famously large turds'. Its at this point that I asked myself, are they actually throwing out dialog about poo? Putting poo in each others beds...like school kids would say? By jove they are! I also noted a few other scenes that did make me smile such as Drax ripping on Quill's secret crush on Gamora (unceremoniously revealed by Mantis who can read people's feelings).<br/><br/>There is a great little sequence where Groot must find Yondu's head fin so both he and Rocket can escape from his traitorous men. Groot takes about six attempts to find said item as he doesn't really understand and keeps coming back with all manner of things. A tad predictable but nicely done. Quill calling Rocket a trash panda was a good one although the following dialog was a bit laboured. Rocket trying to explain to Groot about which button (the death button that needed to be covered with tape) to press on the bomb to kill Ego etc...OK lets just say that most of the good stuff comes from Rocket when he verbally clashes with the others.<br/><br/>As for the main crux of the story which was Peter and his father Ego, meh...it was fine but nothing special in my opinion. In all honesty I don't really think they could of done anything drastically original here and what they did was perfectly fine. But the main problem simply was it was all completely predictable fluff that's been done before. Each step of the way, each beat was wholly formulaic frankly. Peter and Ego get along fine at first as Peter wants to learn more out of curiosity. Ego teaches Peter the basics of his God-like powers. As the subplots all start to come together Ego finally reveals what he's been up to (again its no real surprise) and Peter understands what he and the Guardians must do. Then after a long finale battle with the good guys on the brink of losing, unsurprisingly Peter suddenly conquers his own internal God-like powers and uses them to hold off Ego just long enough for the others to do their bit.<br/><br/>That's not to say there is anything wrong with all this per say, it works here, but I can't not mention how utterly corny and conventional it all is. Again in all honesty I also thought the ending was so so very soppy that it almost spoilt the movie. Sure the Guardians have now become a proper family so to speak (ugh! the whole family thing again?) and all the various plots are tied together nicely, but boy do they pile on the schmaltz. I did also found it quite bizarre how the Sovereign are so obsessed with wanting to kill the Guardians because Rocket stole their batteries, Especially as it looks like we'll be seeing more of the same in the next movie from these guys. Its also kinda funny how the makeup for this alien race consists entirely of gold body paint, literally just painting all the actors gold and that's it. Just seems so...made for TV-ish. Odd for such a big blockbuster.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite this essentially being more of the same from the first movie, I did enjoy this. I personally found the entire movie to be much tighter with better dialog, better action and a better array of characters. Ego being a surprise decent villain...clearly helped along by casting Russell. Also the combination of Drax and Mantis being a decent surprise double act. Whilst both movies do still feel very cliched and unoriginal, borrowing many elements from many sci-fi movies, for me its the quirky roster of heroes that sells the flick. I can't deny that Rocket is fast becoming a firm favourite of mine. Naturally everything looked slick and shiny, plenty of comicbook nods dotted around, and another retro soundtrack which I didn't really like this time truth be told. I actually thought many of the songs were completely out of place with some of the scenes, but that's just me (dunno what the kids think of these old tunes, do they even know what a walkman is?).<br/><br/>Yes I found this movie more enjoyable than the first (which I think was somewhat overhyped). Even though they are clearly trying a bit too hard with the goofy comedy and visual retro love letters to the 80's (although I do appreciate the retro goodness), generally I think Gunn and co have perfected this particular team of space cowboys. What they must not do now is push it too far and spoil it. But I will finish by asking, why am I not seeing a (preferably adult) Howard the Duck reboot yet? Surely I can't be the only one who thinks a Rocket and Howard team up needs to happen?<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"Bored_Dragon","8","1","2","12 January 2018"," Great fun
","I saw first movie when it was released, before I registered on IMDb and started to rate and comment movies. It stayed in good memory and I know I had good time watching it, but I don't remember it well enough to be able to evaluate it and comment more specifically. I have the impression that the sequel is somewhat weaker, but it keeps pace with the first. If you expect complex characters and a powerful story you won't find it here. This is entertaining SF adventure, packed with action and hilariously funny moments. If you watch it as a serious movie, then it will be bad for you, but if you look at it as an action comedy then it's great. The end was bit disappointing because they made it more serious than the rest of the movie and humor is what gives this film the strength. I'll wait for last part of this trilogy, watch all three together and then I'll be able to write more competent review. Till then, recommendation to all whose priority isn't objective quality of the movie but good fun.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The sequel to 2014's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' that surprised everyone who saw it, Marvel managed to assemble a team of heroes nobody had ever heard of and make an extremely entertaining and funny movie! The sequel is just like the first, with hilarious moments from all characters, fun action and a brilliant time at the cinema! This entry in the series is a lot funnier than the first as well, and possibly the funniest film in the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' to date! The film does suffer from sequelitis, as it always would have, the sequel wasn't necessary as the plot was thin and it didn't need to have a whole movie made for it. It was just mainly a cash grab to bring the characters back together and to please the fans. As the first film was so surprising, there were high expectations for the sequel and I felt in terms of what it could've been, it didn't reach those expectations but Marvel still presented us with an action-packed comedy fest that delivered on all levels of 'fun'. Overall, I'd definitely recommend to all audiences and to avid fans of the 'MCU'."

","'Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2' is the highly-anticipated sequel to one of Marvel's surprise hits - and it doesn't disappoint. Sure, it's not as novel or zesty as the original, but it's still one of the best sequels in a long time. It still looks - and sounds - great: vibrant colours, plenty of action, both in space and on strange planets and another killer soundtrack that will grow on people as well. Great use of Fleetwood Mac and Cat Stevens, in particular.<br/><br/>Peter/Star Lord (Pratt) is back with his rag-tag friends/family - Gamora (Saldana), the almost-love-interest; Drax (Bautista) who's both endearingly stupid and means well; Rocket (Cooper), the alienated racoon and Groot (Diesel), in ultra-cute baby-tree form. Yondu (Rooker), Peter's adopted father and Nebula (Gillan), Gamora's sister, are dragged back into the fray, as Peter's father finally appears - Ego (Bridges, charming as ever). There's some great cameos - Hasselhoff, Stallone, and, as always, Stan Lee (+ The Watchers) - and some good development of Mantis (Klementieff) and Kraglin (Gunn).<br/><br/>The main plot is all about family - Peter and his new-found father, as well as his odd relationship with Yondu (and Gamora); Gamora's love/hate relationship with Nebula; Rocket being lonely and struggling to accept that he cares for others; and them all looking after Baby Groot (excellent post-credits scene too). Obviously, a great final battle scene and plenty of laughs throughout."
"cliftonofun","6","1","2","27 December 2017"," It almost worked
","So this sequel - like many others - was a bit too much of everything. Too many characters, too many random deaths, too much 70s music, too many overt references to family, and WAY too much green screen. But the characters and humor still saved it, honestly. I laughed out loud throughout, and I still cared thanks to Rocket, Drax, Peter, and crew. If every cliche over the top sequel was this good, I'd be ok with it."

","This movie could not be easy to do. The first one had a nearly magical touch and the perfect level of humour, mythology and chemistry between the main characters. In a way it was like a music piece and every tone was matched perfectly. <br/><br/>The second one is not like that at all. The one thing it had going for it was a better enemy but the rest was just squandered in vey childish one liners and complete last of the first movies chemistry between the characters. The story is nearly non existent in this movie but that was the case in the first one aswell. But it didnt matter in the first movie cause all the other elements worked so well. In this movie the humour is not good at all, the first scene when groot dances feels like a disney movie and its to obvious and predictible. <br/><br/>Even the mythology looses its appeal in this over the top humour. It feels like the movie just want to land one liners all the time. It feels forced and its not funny and it messes up the story and even the mythology. <br/><br/>The good thing from this movie is Ego and Mantis. The main characters though are sometimes painfull to watch. Its kind of sad to see funny and kind of intersting characters get reduced to a parody of themselves."

This movie is fun, funny, has great effects and moves our characters forward a bit in their character arc.<br/><br/>I've read several critical reviews, I have no idea why people think super hero movie needs to be 100% believable or why a sequel needs to do much different than the original other than develop the characters a bit. Especially if the first volume was so successful, why vary from that formula much.<br/><br/>If you didn't like it whatever, that's you.

","I watched this movie when it came out in the theaters and also watched it again today. Going into this movie the first time, I had my reservations because of slight dislike of Chris Pratt in the first film. However, I was able to get past the dislike and enjoy every aspect of this movie except the plot. <br/><br/>The comedy from Drax and Mantis was wonderful, Rocket and Star-Lord also incorporated good comedy. Yondo blossoms and becomes lovable as well as the improved relationship of the sisters.<br/><br/>The plot, however, made me cringe. Yes, it was important to discover Peter's origin and why his mother said that his father was from the stars, but this movie could have ignored the Sovereign interaction and changed the idea of the plot. The plot of the movie starts by Ego saving the Guardians from the fleet of Sovereign warcrafts. As the plot progresses, Ego says he is the father of Peter and wants to show him Planet Ego. As obvious as possible, Ego ends up being the villian and trying to get Peter to help him take over the universe. <br/><br/>While the plot was weak, cringe-worthy, and extremely predictable, The entirety of the movie was enjoyable and fun-loving. In my opinion, I would give this movie a 7.5 because of the plot deficiencies, but all around an excellent sequel."

I hope they keep this quality up, 2-3 more movies of this quality and it will be a marvel flagship.<br/><br/>I recommend it to anyone, even if you're not big on super hero movies, this feels more like a mix between marvel and star wars, as wonky as that sounds it works!"

First of all the story is the same pile of garbage as before, just in a different movie. When will Marvel learn that they need to be more creative and take more risks like DC does. Secondly the graphics in this movie are so terrible and obviously fake that it just makes your eyes hurt. I didn't understand why the characters kept saying that the talking dog was a raccoon??? And I didn't realize that Groot was supposed to be a plant. Obviously the actors and the director no idea what the animation was supposed to be or what the animators were planning. Personally I would have fallen asleep, but the music was constantly blaring into my ears like a jet engine. And it didn't help that they chose the worst music from the 80s and 90s.

I must say that I'm not a big fan of this movie genre, but over the years I've built up enough experience to recognize a good movie. This one could be enjoying sometimes, especially the romantic dialogues between Drax and Mantis, and between Rocket and Groot. I must also admit that Chris Pratt's acting was great in this movie and that it gives it weight. This movie could definitely be shorter, as it gets boring and drags along.

","""How can you guys be friends? all you do is argue."" asks Gomora's sister. For most of the first half, I confess, I was asking myself the very same question. The script is 80% bickering, which makes Guardians paradoxically entertaining and not. The banter is the film's highlight, but its not easy to invest in a family that only ever points out the worst in each other. Rocket has enough material to be an insult comic.<br/><br/>Director James Gunn's strength is his ability to set up laughs both in dialog and in shot. He has a good eye for framing shots to make the most out of the visual gags. Just when you think the movie is starting to take itself seriously, he throws in another punch.<br/><br/>Perhaps it could be argued then that his weakness is restraint. The action set pieces are a circus of animation and disorienting camera work, and there are far too many colours on the palette (including pink). When everything is dazzling to look at, nothing is. The climax is an especially shaky fiasco, pitting the guardians against Quill's super villain father and his generic super villain plot involving control of the universe. Here we have Kurt Russell playing Kurt Russell, and never knowing how seriously to take himself from line to line.<br/><br/>The script makes it a priority to shed light on Peter Quill, but less for the sake of the character and more for the sake of embedding plot device; Isn't that always the case? It's a shame that Chris Pratt has nothing to bring beyond his face. Even his one liners fall flat, because he takes himself so darned seriously for the camera.<br/><br/>Stan Lee gets his usual funny cameo but more unexpected is a guest appearance by Sylvestor Stallone, who is just in the movie long enough (and not too long) to be good."

It's kind of hard to root against people who were robbed by the ""good guys"", even when the victims are ""conceited douchebags"".<br/><br/>On the whole it's an unsatisfying film.

How they made Kurt Russell look young again was a feat in itself!!<br/><br/>And in the midst of the action and non-stop entertainment there were comical moments like when Rocket was trying to explain which button NOT to press to Baby Groot, voice by Vin Diesel which is hard to believe, with Groot always trying to press the wrong button - was so funny!<br/><br/>For me, Marvel hadn't made a great super-hero movie until this one. Yes, the purists such as people like myself frown upon comic book heroes swearing, but these are modern day characters and it was not overly excessive.<br/><br/>Some of the predictable swarms of hopeless enemies cost this movie a star, but all in all it was a really enjoyable film and absolutely jam packed with fun."

The sister rivalry continues.<br/><br/>This film is a notch below the first feature, as are most sequels. This one tried too hard. The mix tape was great in the first feature. In this one they made it too much a part of the film instead of just background. The introduction of characters in the first feature, i.e. getting to know them made it fun and the warm and fuzzy feeling at the end made the film a classic. This one didn't have it. Kurt Russell would not have made my top 10 list for Peter's father. Johnny Depp would top it.

"zardoz-13","10","2","7","29 June 2017"," This Sequel Is A Blast!!!
","""Super"" writer/director James Gunn took moviegoers for an irreverent, interplanetary joyride, peppered with pop culture references, in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" back in 2014. Happily, Gunn's sequel ""Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 2"" qualifies as just as impressive with several surprises. If you haven't seen ""GoTG, Vol. 1,"" then you may have problems putting both the swashbuckling characters and their outlandish backstory into context in this imaginative, science-fiction, follow-up saga. Good sequels always dig deeper into the original characters and conjure up newcomers. ""GoTG, Vol. 2"" reassembles the same quintet and scrutinizes them in greater detail. Peter Quill, ostensibly the Guardians' leader, catches up with his enigmatic sire, Ego, and father and son surprise each other with their goals during the second act. We learn that Ego has been searching the universe for his long, lost son. Later, Yondu observes astutely about the grandiose Ego: ""He may have been your father, Quill, but he wasn't your daddy."" This father and son connection yields the ultimate surprise, too, but discretion prevents me from divulging specifics. The peculiar relationship that Quill has forged with Yondu Udonta, the extraterrestrial space pirate who abducted Quill from Earth after the lad fled from the hospital where his cancer-stricken mom died takes on an added dimension. No character changes as much in ""GoTG 2"" as Yondu. He evolves from a lowlife villain to an individual of integrity. Meanwhile, sibling rivalry keeps Quill's quasi-girlfriend Gamora locked into a never-ending feud with her jealous sister Nebula. Nebula hates Gamora with a passion because their evil stepfather Thanos preferred Gamora over her. Smutty-mouthed Rocket Raccoon remains as obnoxious as ever, but his bad-tempered attitude thaws during the third act. Good sequels send off the characters onto exciting new adventures against different villains. The Guardians are summoned to a remote corner of the cosmos again. The new aliens‚Äîthe Sovereigns‚Äîconstitute a petulant people with little sense of humor. When the Rocket infuriates them, the latter pursue the Guardians with a vengeance until greater powers interfere.<br/><br/>The last time we saw the Guardians, the Nova Corps had cleared them of all crimes and provided them with a refurnished version of his spaceship ""The Milano."" The arboreal, sentient-like, extraterrestrial Groot (Vin Diesel's voice) had sacrificed himself to save his companions, but Rocket Raccoon scourged up a surviving twig and has planted it. As ""GoTG, Vol. 2,"" unfolds, an arrogant race of gilded humanoids known as the Sovereigns have employed our motley crew to protect their priceless batteries from an enormous but absurd-looking trout with thrashing tentacles and thousands of thorny teeth. During this hilarious opening credits gambit, the roguish Star-Lord (Chris Pratt of ""The Magnificent Seven""), green-skinned Amazon Gamora (Zoe Saldana of ""Colombiana""), blue-skinned hulk Drax (Dave Bautista of ""Spectre""), and pugnacious Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper's voice) tangle with this cartoonish Cthulhu-thing atop a lofty platform that resembles an electric razor where the batteries are housed. During this far-fetched fracas, Baby Groot dances to a tune from Star-Lord's mix tape‚ÄîELO's ""Blue Sky""--oblivious to any peril the goofy trout-squid poses while the Guardians struggle to defeat their nemesis. The scene is clever because Gunn choreographs this blockbuster action scene with Baby Groot in the foreground rather than the contentious Guardians! Afterward, the grateful Sovereigns reward our heroes with nothing less than Gamora's deceitful sister Nebula. No sooner have our heroes proved their nerve to the Sovereigns than they find themselves in trouble with them. The contemptuous Rocket has taken it upon himself steal some of those valuable batteries. The incensed Sovereigns deployed a drone fleet to annihilate the Guardians. Conveniently, Peter Quill's biological father Ego (Kurt Russell of ""The Hateful 8"") intervenes and saves them from the Sovereigns. Ego invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to accompany him to his planet, while Rocket, Baby Groot, and Nebula stay behind to repair their crashed spacecraft.<br/><br/>Meantime, the haughty Sovereign Queen Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki of ""The Great Gatsby"") hires arrow-whistling Ravager chieftain Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker of ""The Belk Experiment"") to track down the Guardians. What Yondu doesn't realize is a perfidious faction within his gang of smugglers has been plotting mutiny. Yondu's grotesque lieutenant, Taserface (Chris Sullivan of ""Imperium""), heads this uprising. After they catch up with Rocket, Baby Groot, Nebula, the insubordinate Ravagers turn on Yondu and lock him up with Rocket. Nevertheless, Yondu and Rocket aren't idle behind bars for long because Baby Groot helps them to escape. Mind you, Yondu was already up to his ears in trouble with the rest of the Ravagers and their commander, Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone of ""Rocky""), who turned against him for kidnapping Peter Quill in the first place. If you saw the original ""G0TG,"" you know Star-Lord tricked Yondu when he relinquished the Orb. The wily Star-Lord replaced the Infinity Stone that had been in the Orb with a grinning troll doll. Yondu had payback in mind when he sold his services to the Sovereigns, but then everything went sideways for him. Nevertheless, once Rocket, Baby Groot, and he escape, they eliminate their adversaries.<br/><br/>The major revelation of the ""Guardians"" sequel concerns the character of Ego. Kurt Russel looks like he had a blast playing this imperious Celestial being who is a manifestation of a psychedelic planet that Ego created for himself. Basically, he is an amoral deity who behaves like the Greek god Zeus. During their brief stint on the planet, Peter and Ego begin on friendly terms until Ego slips up and reveals something terrible that alienates Peter. With its sumptuous CGI of alien galaxies and landscapes, ""GoTG, Vol. 2"" looks a hundred times better visually than its predecessor. If you enjoyed the greatest hits music in the original film, the sequel serves up even more memorable pop tunes and incorporates them into the psychology of the plot, too! As the fifteenth entry in the Marvel Comics Cinematic Universe, the tongue-in-cheek ""Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 2"" ranks as one of the best."

I did get past that though. There are a lot of stories. Some were weak and some were sincerely strong. The story of Ego and Peter could be very weak at times, but it got better as the movie went on. The Gamora, Nebula story was something. I did enjoy the chemistry between Rocket and Yondu. I did not like when Ego and Peter played catch. That was just dumb. The music is amazing.

We get a glimpse of the Watchers - a immensely-powerful alien race that observes but does not intervene. We learn the back-story of Nebula, who suffered amputations to her body that were replaced by cybernetic prostheses. We learn more about the Ravagers - both the internal gang politics on one ship and the loosely-organized network of galactic pirates that they have become. We see the unrestrained use of a kind of weapon (Rondu's arrow) that is original - we have never seen this combination of weapon attributes before.<br/><br/>And all this cosmic fantasy is leavened with familiar 80's music and references to Sam and Diane on Cheers and a way-cute baby Groot character and a humorous shtick involving a character named Taserface and the shock of Drax's lack of a verbal filter.<br/><br/>GOTG has the advantage of drawing from deep funds of creative ideas that are in over 50 years of Marvel comic books. Thousands of those comic book ideas were not-so-good (or downright bad) and will never again see the light of day but there were also hundreds of good fantasy concepts and character ideas. And Marvel Studios seems to have a combination of people and production values that is able to consistently turn out high-quality movie product.<br/><br/>The GOTG universe (and MCU)is exciting - rich in imagination with a wide-open creative future. In contrast, the Star Wars cupboard seems bare. An endless loop of fighter spacecraft battles, light sabers and taverns populated by weird aliens."
"clark_gillies","7","2","7","15 May 2017"," Went up a gear from first movie, but a somewhat weak script.
","The first Guardians of the Galaxy movie was something of a surprise hit, which I was really shocked at how much I liked it and felt worthy as a top 5 movie in my MCU list of movies.<br/><br/>Roll on a few years and I was well hyped for Vol. 2, and while it did not fail to deliver, few things left me not liking it as much as the first movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, the script feels like a very weak attempt to rewrite the plot to Return of the Jedi, done after a weekend of binge watching 1980's cult movies like Flight of the Navigator, Explorers and Flash Gordon.... with series 6 Red Dwarf added in..... also seems to be feel that far to great emphasis was put on the soundtrack (something about it did not seem to fit as perfect this time)<br/><br/>This showed, as the plot did seem to just plod along for long periods, with a wall of sound song hitting you in the face now and again.<br/><br/>It had a feel of one of those Simpson's episode where they try to put 5 or 6 short stories into one episode.... starts off strong with a battle happening in the background while Groot takes center stage to dance along to ELO.... we then get the group falling out with each other after escaping a epic space battle.... then seems to shoot off into 3 or 4 different stories.... Yondu feeling depressed because he lost the respect of his comrades and crew.... Rocket and Groot getting kidnapped and then teaming with Yondu.... Quill and his dad.... and Gamora and Nebula patching things up.... with all these stores rounding off and coming together for the final battle (plus there is a rather stupid Drax and Mantis scene added in now and again. <br/><br/>There also seemed to be a real shift in rank of characters, with Quill (while still the star) majorly relegated from his role in the first movie, and A LOT more emphasis and character development put into Gamora, Nebula, Rocket and Yondu.<br/><br/>Drax, while a lovable oaf in the first movie, is just annoying after 5 minutes, and Groot is effectively shoe horned in to provide the Minion's factor to sell merchandise. <br/><br/>The whole movie seems to be missing a real out and out bad guy..... and with it turning out to be Ego in the final 1/4 of the movie, you have went through a large chunk of the movie up to this point with no real indication of who are the good and bad guys (the gold people come and then go for long periods.... and Yondu crew does appear a tad Pirates of the Caribbean-ish at times as a side gag...)<br/><br/>One good grace is the way they have kept this out of the Avengers story line, yet still hint strongly that they share a universe and paths will collide soon enough.<br/><br/>All in all, still a solid MCU and anyone who grew up in the 1980's will love this movie."

","I loved the first one and couldn't wait to see this one because of it, but I wasn't as happy as I hoped to be. The main plot is really interesting, but it is shadowed by all the relationships possible between everyone. Quill-Dad(Ego),Quill-Gamora,Quill-Blue dad,Quill- Trash Panda. (Won't say the same relationships twice.)Gamora-her sister. Raccoon-crew, Raccoon-blue dude. Blue dude-his crew, blue dude-sylvester stallone and other dudes. It's just a lot of loving and being sad/happy and stuff. I guess it does make for an OK series on German television, but I didn't enjoy the whole destruction of the universe plot being in the background while they just discuss their feelings. The movie has some occasional jokes, that are a lot of fun. IMO Rocket Raccoon is the best part of the movie. It was actually fun to watch him. The visuals were really great, cool colours and stuff, and the music was, obviously, amazing. In conclusion, it felt like the movie was made for 8 year old's and their parents, and anyone else who might like the series was forgot about. That's why the rating 6/10 felt appropriate."
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","2","7","6 May 2017"," Bigger, louder and (slightly ) lesser
","Plot; The Guardians find themselves at odds with a host of adversaries while de facto leader Peter Quill discovers the truth about his parentage.<br/><br/>The first Guardians movie was like a breath of fresh air, breaking the (admittedly successful) Marvel/Disney mold with its colorful cast of wisecracking, misfit antiheroes. Vol. 2 can be forgiven if it lacks its predecessor's freshness, but it's still obligated to add some new dimensions, and it does. Eventually.<br/><br/>Cranking up the volume on everything people liked about the original, Vol. 2 seems at times as if it's trying a bit too hard to please. The humor is forced at times rather than springing organically from the plot or the characters. It's more ""Okay, time for Rocket to add a wisecrack."". The same can be said of the action. It's obligatory. Grafted on. That's not to say it's not well done, but it--like the film--feels like an animal doing tricks for a treat. But the third act is when the track laid on all of the various relationships really begins to pay off, and in every instance it does so as satisfyingly as you could hope. The basic sinew of the film is family, and it's that theme that gives the movie its beating heart.<br/><br/>The returning cast all wear their roles like a favorite pair of jeans, and newcomers all mesh well into the fabric of the zany universe. I enjoyed spending another two hours with these characters, and they and it can be forgiven if I enjoyed it just a tad less than I did the first time."

","The effects are undeniable, very cool, Chris Pratt is very handsome , but less funny than temperament, Avatar the heroine of the sisters was not what necessary throughout the film, finally did not know her sister does not appreciate, no meaning. The whole story, if it weren't for the raccoon that had angered the golden man, would you fight? The story can be directly from the Chris Pratt life history and his own father started.. <br/><br/>And then all the feelings of the line is not how to add, that the girl with the tentacles of the person who likes the tattoo that there is no progress, the most talked more, and then tease her looks. So the whole story only star and green face of the feelings of the great progress. I don't know why the big tree Groot becomes small, it is the tree of the son of man? If so, wouldn't you be named? Also called Groot. <br/><br/>I'm crazy, but I'm disappointed this time. They are very common, it is also very much, on special effects to attract attention, regardless of the outcome of the film to the universe and world peace, must let his dad dog, in fact we did not abandon boldly (change a point of view, if he did not make a contribution, is not they had courage as???) The end is still we are family, but I can not be happy with such a happy ending, but only 8 of the speed and passion to discredit the meaning. <br/><br/>The whole thing was a little disappointed, but others were happy. <br/><br/>Gelutete cute ah!!!!!!!!!!"
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","2","8","1 May 2017"," A huge bag of fun
","It was a worthy sequel. At first I wasn't too impressed by its story but it really nicely developed throughout the film and gives it quite a nice meaning although it was sometimes just a bit too much tearjerking. Still what I liked most of it was the great twists in the second half and that it was able to answer or react on many unsolved questions from part one and was still able to surprise and be unpredictable. The cast once again did a good job. Chris Pratt was once again proving to be the ideal actor to portray that character. The voice job of Bradley Cooper even better than in part 1. Zoe Saldana had her moments and I really loved Dave Baustia here who got way more to do and had some really scene stealing moments. Kurt Russell was ideally cast. Sylvester Stallone a bit wasted but I guess we will see more of him in future films of the franchise. The best of the cast was probably Michael Rooker. The effects and look was really exceptional. A bit overblown, especially in the first half, but really impressive nevertheless. The soundtrack was also great, even more effective than in the first film which I found surprising. And Baby Groot was just the perfect scene stealer. Really a fun ride. Some one liners did not work, but generally it was a huge bag of fun with the right amount of spice in form of surprises."
"abhishek-upadhayaya","7","2","8","27 April 2017"," Wisecracks and CGI don't make a good movie
","One of my favorite scenes from original Guardians of galaxy was the escape from the Xandar jail. There were some great comic moments, good teamwork, genuine moments of curiosity how the team will be able to break free. When you replace a good script with CGI explosions, you don't get the same impact. It is disappointing to see that after more than 10 movies later, Marvel still relies on the good old ""explosions and punches solve the problem"" technique. I understand the logic behind action in Avengers but I have never been a fan of cheap looking CGI climaxes, be it in X-men Apocalypse, Thor movies or Suicide squad. There is a reason that The Winter Soldier is still considered to be the best MCU movie so far with far more humane action and restrained with such great quality on television and Netflix we are getting, anything less than extra ordinary seems sub-standard.<br/><br/>The movie in one world is about Parenting, more specifically about Peter Quill finding his father and how other events unfold which endangers the entire galaxy. Movie starts with some real promise, story lines seems to be really intriguing in the beginning when the team splits up and go on their own individual adventures. What follows in 2nd half of the movie is less than satisfactory in terms of storyline, the novelty factor wanes off and it starts feeling like any other generic Marvel movie where even world ending stakes don't feel much.<br/><br/>That being said, it is quite a fun movie, better than a lot of movies proclaiming to be comedies. Drax, baby Groot, Rocket, even the newly added characters such as Mantis make sure you are laughing out loud many times in this movie. Even if you are not a fan of Marvel's movie making rule of 4 jokes per minute, this movie's humor level is much better than anything seen so far, it even beats Avengers in that regard.<br/><br/>It is definitely a watch, you will have a great time during its 130 minute runtime, its the hollow feeling once you have left the theatre which is the main concern."

"Thetwocentreviewbot","6","1","3","6 October 2017"," Back to earth
","After the amazing chemistry experience guardians of the galaxy left in movie goers mouths, Hollywood could not manufacture a sequel fast enough. As you would expect , like many sugary snax , the artificial taste was overpowering.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong the story line was hardly ravaging to the films enjoy ability. However , it lacked the brains of the first , or maybe nowhere just ran out of stock. There are only so many dance along schticks you can tolerate , I am groot? While the story line progresses there are so many dead points in the plot it is hard to not get sidetracked. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job playing Mike Meyers in the plant guru. Honestly the most annoying part of the movie was the fact that quill needed to hear the plant guru had killed his mom to shoot the guy. Three minutes into that character and I wanted too. <br/><br/>The good housekeeping routine between gamora and quill usually brought the flow from zero to snore in a second flat. The completely inane relationship arc between drax and the plant guru's rabbit , cat , dog , thingy was an interesting detour. Things get a little better as gamora and her sister throw it down for the WWE Intergalactic championship , and rocket and Rowdy Burns team up in a race for Ravager Redemption.<br/><br/>At the end of the day it is decided that quill has two loser dads. The plant guru succumbs to a make shift bomb for dummies that the stick manages to set off without any disco moves required. The plant guru is then treated to weed killer on the level of thirty to forty thousand kilos. Dad number two pawns himself to ensure the birth of the universes largest supply of fertilizer. He then is treated to a light show as he is dumped out with drax dirty laundry and rockets spare parts. Sylvester Stallone shows up. As final proof of his love for quill , the last remaining Zune is given to quill. Yes , the first officer gets the killer whistle arrow , while quill settles for the last Zune ever functioning. Imbicile indeed.<br/><br/>I got what expected a product Hollywood sequel . Not a bad one either. The film flow that powered galaxy one is a rare and random beast that shows up unexpectedly in all genres of film. As disturbing as this is the same energy created by galaxy one , is what won cher an Oscar for moonstruck. <br/><br/>6 of 10"

"scottiben","9","1","3","4 October 2017"," On the same level as vol. 1
","James Gunn's 2017 follow up to the surprise hit Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) does what Marvel has long struggled to do in its extensive cinematic universe, create a sequel that is on the level of quality to its predecessor. Iron Man 2, Thor: Dark World and The Avengers: Age of Ultron all are underwhelming compared to the first outing in each franchise and along with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a film that certainly captures the humour of the first film, and builds on the heart of it. <br/><br/>The soundtrack from the outset is exceptional, and this is exemplified by an opening scene that perfectly sets the fun yet heartfelt tone for the rest of the film. The supposedly intense battle against an enormous beast falls into background noise as watch Baby Groot dance his way around to Electric Light Orchestra's Mr Blue Sky immediately shows that Vol. 2, like the first, will not take itself too seriously. I loved the over the top use of bright colours, steering into the skid and not trying to fool the audience about the amount of CGI being utilised. In a way it actually makes you forget about the special effects as it becomes more stylised rather than trying to hard to fake action, this is continued throughout the film in particular on the planet that is Ego. <br/><br/>My one criticism of this film is occasionally the humour did feel forced, which I guess is necessary to still appeal to younger viewers, often the funnier moments came from the more subtly humorous moments. The exception to this is Drax, whose species takes everything literally and allows Dave Bautista to really show off his comedic acting, saving what could be fairly weak jokes into hilarious moments with his impeccable timing and delivery.<br/><br/>Vol. 2 faced criticism for supposedly undoing the character development of the new 'family' coming together by having the main Guardians fighting and arguing throughout the film. However, I believe this is simply more realistic as all families fight and a group of people with strong personalities are ultimately going to have conflict. The heart and emotional moments in this film I believe actually to be superior to the first, the relationships between Rocket & Yondu, Gamora & Nebula as well Peter himself with his father are all fantastic. For an action/comedy superhero film, there are moments that genuinely bring a tear to your eye. <br/><br/>The standout moment for me is when after revealing his extensive attempts of creating a celestial son, Kurt Russell's Ego then almost casually mentions that he put a tumour that killed Peter's mother in her head. It came at a time when Ego thought he had one Peter over, also the dolly zoom filmography technique used upon this revelation perfectly translates the shock Peter must be feeling to the audience. I loved that his reaction wasn't to typically ask 'Why?' but simply to immediately start angrily shooting Ego, a more realistic showing of the overpowering rage he must have been feeling. Once again the score is brilliantly utilised in the fight scene here, with Fleetwood Mac's The Chain being expertly integrated, credit to Gunn for this.<br/><br/>The casting of the main characters itself was outstanding but the injection of Kurt Russell in the sequel was a masterstroke. He perfectly plays the father figure when first introduced whilst also giving off a slightly uneasy vibe that makes sense upon the big twist. I also enjoyed the larger screen time given to Karen Gillan's Nebula and Michael Rooker's Yondu, two great tough characters who played bigger and less one-dimensional roles than they did in the first.<br/><br/>I would say as a whole the sequel isn't quite as funny as the first, however, it still has numerous laugh out loud moments and it is high praise to be anywhere near the first film. What elevates it to being of the same quality for me is the over-arching narrative and the emotional core that drives the development of the characters. There are more quiet moments of character development which whilst limit the action that may appease some viewers in the short term, ultimately results in a great emotional pay-off at the end of the film, particularly with Yondu's sacrifice. <br/><br/>Sequels to excellent movies are hard to make, and they are always going to face comparisons. However, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an exceptional follow up that leaves me actively excited for the third outing and hopefully an appearance from the Guardians in Marvel's upcoming Avengers: Infinity War films."

Why can't the actual universe be peaceful? Do you believe in a future full of peace everywhere, forever?<br/><br/>What would be a good idea for the next movie? I'd say use Chris's powers to reincarnate those who passed in this movie. He can bring them back with his powers, I was getting to like the guy with that arrow. He seems like a good guy in reality, just stuck in a jam in his life as that character. Like he was place where he was in life, but I can see he is in really learning & wishing to break free & remain in the path of the light of life & love.<br/><br/>I think the next movie would be neat to well, I guess we can't think God exists in movies, huh? Not the way of this World, huh? Let's all just have freedom of thought, so that one may guide ones self to eternal torment... Illogical thought IMO. <br/><br/>I think Chris Pratt portrays his characters very well *thumbs up brother*. What do we figure on a new-idea-movie? Something that boggles the mind & makes our minds wonder a lot, like what is that? haha Idk. Movies are fun.<br/><br/>How about Chris in Guardian's Of The Galaxy Vol. 3, Guardian's of what? Well I'd say ""Light""... Light is so cool when its immense & powerful by appearance, by sound, by feeling, by touch, by thought, by emotion. How about they build a new super-sleek & sexy starship with like 2 super powerful engines sorta like the Sr-71 or something or the XB-70 Valkyrie. Painted white & super bad ass looking & sounds awesome and can screech across a galaxy in a heart beat haha. How about some sort of Planetary travel & delivery of something far far away, like in another galaxy all together & need to get it there in time for something big? Suspenseful yet fun knowing the Starship is fully capable & what not. I think its fun going on planetary trips, that actually take some time & run into cosmic phenomenon & wind up blipping through to another dimension on accident & have to get back in time.

","Review: I really enjoyed this movie, just like the first one, and I couldn't help laughing through the whole of the first half. The witty script worked extremely well, and the crazy soundtrack, along with a decent storyline, made this epic sequel a must watch. The movie kicks off with the Guardians of the Galaxy saving the world, once again, and when they go to give the Golden Queen, Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), some precious batteries, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) decides to steal them back, and they end up on the run from Ayesha's soldiers. With nowhere to go, and there ship under severe attack, a little man comes out of nowhere, and destroys all of the ships that are attacking them. When they finally land the ship in the middle of nowhere, they are approached by Peter Quills (Chris Pratt), dad Ego (Kurt Russell), who takes them to his Wonderland, which amazes them all. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) finds the whole situation a bit weird, while Drax (Dave Bautista) bonds with Ego's righthand girl Mantis (Pom Klementieff). After listening to his dads plans for the future, and the reasons why he left his mum, Peter soon realises that his dad has an inner evil, which isn't good for the world, so the Guardians are forced into battle against the evil Ego. There are many other elements to the film but that is the core of the movie. With such a deep backdrop, including the evil Queen and the Ravagers going wild, the comedy was top class, and baby groot was a brilliant addition to the crew. You can definitely see were every penny of the budget went, especially with the CGI characters, and the action scenes were also pretty impressive. The first scene, were the Guardians are fighting the big monster, was put together extremely well, and it was a great opening to a great franchise. I think you can tell that I really enjoyed this film, and I can't wait for the 3rd movie. Great!<br/><br/>Round-Up: The question that I have about this film is, Are they going to join this franchise to the other Marvel movies? They don't really have super powers, and the Guardians are based in space, so I don't know how they would do it! Anyway, this movie was directed by James Gunn, 51, who also brought you the first movie in this franchise, along with Slither, Super and Movie 43. Judging by the ending of the movie, it seems like there is going to be a 3rd Guardians, which is rumoured that he will direct but there hasn't been any leaks as of yet. I just hope that they don't get all serious with the next one, because the humour is what makes this a unique classic. <br/><br/>Budget: $200million Worldwide Gross: $863million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their Sci-fi/action/adventures, starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Michael Rooker, Sylvester Stallone, Kurt Russell, Karen Gillan, Seth Green, Ving Rhames and Michelle Yeoh. 8/10"

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has made it into my personal top 10 list. The film is non-stop laughs and although there is some explicit language in the film it is very minor. I would say it is family friendly. The film itself is amazing the actors, the sets, the directors, the props, the writers, everything about it was on point from the first moment of the film. The soundtrack was also a clear favourite of mine as it created new emotions after finding out about Quinns real life and how he is the demi-god that he is. The only criticism I have to say about this film, is when Quinn loses his god-like abilities to save the galaxy. I thought by some miracle he would have them reinstated and he would once again be like a god among men. However, this did not happen and so it was a kind of anti-climax. Now he is just a basic astronaut, with cool weapons and aliens friends. Other than that it was amazing through and through. I would highly highly recommend this to anyone and everyone that hasn't yet seen it. Personally if you haven't seen it you are missing out on something big!!

","RELEASED IN 2017 and directed & written by James Gunn, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" chronicles the Guardians meeting Star-Lord's father, Ego (Kurt Russell), and visiting his beautiful planet, which turns out to be¬Ö (I'm not going to give it away). <br/><br/>The Guardians of the Galaxy first appeared in 1969 and in various Marvel comics of the mid-70s, like The Defenders, before appearing as the main attraction in Marvel Premiere in 1976-77. The Guardians are like the Avengers (or Justice League) of space, a superhero team with a revolving door line-up.<br/><br/>The popular 2014 film and this sequel were based on the 2008 version of the team, which includes Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper) and Groot or, more specifically in this movie, Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). Also returning are Gamora's vengeful sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan), and Yondu (Michael Rooker), the space redneck who kidnapped Peter Quill (Star-Lord) from Earth when he was a boy. Elizabeth Debicki has a significant part as statuesque Ayesha, a haughty gold-skinned queen. <br/><br/>The movie combines elements of The Avengers, Star Trek and Star Wars and is a thrilling blockbuster that's fun, but probably too goofy at times for people who prefer the dead seriousness of Nolan's Batman trilogy. As far as galaxy-traveling superheroes go, I prefer the more-serious tone of ""Thor"" and ""Thor 2.""<br/><br/>Despite that cavil, the movie's entertaining as an amusing space fantasy blockbuster. It includes loads of action, character-defining parts, several classic rock staples and moments of wonder, not to mention the highlight (cuteness) of Baby Groot. A lot of elements come straight from Jim Starlin's Captain Marvel and Warlock comics from the 70s, not to mention Stan Lee & Jack Kirby's stuff from the 60s, albeit more goofy. <br/><br/>THE MOVIE RUNS 136 minutes and was shot entirely in Georgia (Cartersville, Atlanta & Pinewood Atlanta Studios, Fayetteville). <br/><br/>GRADE: B"

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a 2017 Marvel superhero movie and sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy. The story follows the misfit team of superheroes that were introduced in the first film. Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket are all back to face some new and old challenges. After Rocket offends the Sovereign, a haughty and totalitarian race of gold- skinned aliens, the group must flee for their lives. The Guardians of the Galaxy are rescued by a strange and powerful individual who has many secrets in store for the team of heroes.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an incredibly fun film. With another fantastic soundtrack and amazing visual graphics, this action- packed film is another great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie is hilarious at times and heart- wrenchingly sad at others.<br/><br/>While most of the jokes are great, there are a few that fall flat. Unfortunately, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has a problem with hammering in a joke whether it works or not. Sometimes less is more and when a bad joke is drawn out for more than a minute it can become an annoyance. This over-the-top sense of humor applies to background characters as well. A simple joke about a murderous pirate thinking that something is cute turns into one scene after another of doll-holding and thumb- sucking murderers. Lastly, the film has a little too much of the heavy, emotional moments. Not every single character has to make a psychological and emotional breakthrough by the time the credits begin.<br/><br/>Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a good movie. There is plenty of action, drama, and comedy to satisfy any film preference. Incredibly moving at times, hilarious at other times, and intense action throughout the movie make this a fun and light-hearted film that is definitely worth watching."

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 had an absurd Hype, much of it obviously for the first film that is very good, and without a doubt top 5 best films of this cinematic universe of Marvel, and I was very excited, until leaving the trailer, of all Trailer of this movie I found everyone weak, and trailer is something important, but I hoped that at the time of the movie would be different and unfortunately I was very disappointed in the film, a superhero movie does not have to be something complex or so different, but it is a plot Zoe Saldana as Gamora is the best thing about this film, its relation with the Nebula, played by Karen Gillan. Is the best part of the movie, but the other arch are very annoying, Dave Bautista like Drax I found it very annoying in this movie and also in the past, it was a lot better, it even annoys his innocence, The Groot I think it's cool that he was just a baby, Kurt Russel, that Ego Peter Quill's father disappointed me, his scenes are very problematic, and his relationship with Quill did not convince me, and Michael Rooker As Yondu commands very well, Yondu next to Gamora are the best characters of the film, the outcome of the film is very good, I liked it a lot, not to mention that it is very exciting too, but the film has a serious problem of tone, sometimes He tries to mix a lot, the comedy of the film is very exaggerated, in the first film he was well balanced, in that it is very exaggerated, not to mention that they want to put music everywhere and this is very annoying in my opinion, and sometimes a scene that Was to be dramatic or epic and spoiled by it, the direction of James Gunn is good in some aspects, but he leaves it to be desired in others, the CGI of the film is well done, and the script is a bit confusing, sometimes happens a lot Thing in a short time, the film has 5 scenes post-credits and 4 of them Are unnecessary, only 1 was interesting, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 can please anyone who loves this formula of marvel, but in my opinion is one of the worst movie in the universe of Marvel, I hope that if you have a third party they do not exaggerate in jokes outside Hour.

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fun sequel that builds on the first film. I was drawn in from the title sequence as Baby Groot dances to Mr Blue Sky as behind him a monster fight takes place.<br/><br/>The focus is on Star Lord meeting his celestial father, Ego (Kurt Russell) living in his own planet and with a name like Ego you can immediately sense trouble.<br/><br/>Yet we also have character development as well, the relationship between Star Lord and Gamora intensifies but we also see it develop between the warring sisters as Nebula turns up wanting sibling blood.<br/><br/>We are also shone more light between Yondu and Star Lord, Yondu was supposed to deliver the infant Peter Quill to Ego but kept him for himself as he was small and thin, useful for some thieving. In fact Yondu gets the most character development here.<br/><br/>Drax also gets to shine with more comical interludes with Rocket and new character Mantis. Baby Groot is fun as comic relief.<br/><br/>The film soundtrack works in the context of the film with songs like Father and son (Cat Stevens) and The Chain (Fleetwood Mac.) There are even cameos from Sylvester Stallone and David Hasselhoff.<br/><br/>Visually the film looks great, it is very much a knockabout adventure than a superhero film without being bloated or self indulgent as some of the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.

"space_base","8","1","3","2 July 2017"," The surprise is gone... but the awesome is not!
","Writer/ Director James Gunn's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" from 2014 (wow, that was fast) is not only the best entry in Marvel's box office-busting Cinematic Universe in my opinion; it's one of my favorite films of this decade full stop. Gunn's hand-made aesthetic and an ever-present love for his characters and source material (along with stunning technical merits, gorgeous effects and color palette, game cast, and perfect comedic timing) cemented ""Guardians"" as the pleasant surprise of the year and a bonafide critical smash. Expectations were justifiably sky high for a follow up, then in steps ""Vol.2."" Luckily Gunn and co. stick the landing with only some leg wobble. Yeah, much of the surprise is gone. We know these characters and we know the quirks. But the characters are still fun to be around and the quirks a joy to roll with in an MCU of near endless iterations and routines. Most satisfying, the ensemble of outcasts (our heroes) have evolved from the last outing. Rocket isn't just comedic relief. Baby Groot isn't overused. Drax is as giddy as a hyena. If Starlord isn't as charming or charismatic as the last time it's because his relationship with his father, Ego (Kurt Russell), is the dramatic center of the show. Gamora is underutilized but her subplot with her sister Nebula hit home. Most surprising is Yondu (Michael Rooker); who is given so much depth and emotional gravitas that he emerges as the most memorable aspect of the film... and maybe even the single best thing about this instalment.<br/><br/>Unlike it's predecessor, ""Vol.2"" is a comedy first, and a space opera second. This is a bit of a problem, especially in the first act. Vol.1 used humor to spice up a believable sci-fi world and awesome characters. Here, it feels forced: notably in a first half hour that's part franchise reintroduction and part stand-up routine. The comedy does become less scattershot however, as does it's relatively loose (and sometimes distractedly unfocused) plot, the further into the running time we get. Equally unfocused is the development of Ego, Peter Quill's father, who is seminal to the plot. I always love Kurt Russell, and he's as solid as ever here. I just wish so much of his role didn't involve lengthy exposition.<br/><br/>But like ""Vol.1,"" Guardians 2 is a brilliant piece of visual film making. The colors pop, the action's exciting, and Gunn infuses all of this with his now signature handmade, fan-first energy. There are also moments of pure joy and heart that rival (if not surpass) the best bits of the first film. The final half hour or so is pure bliss. We are still firmly in the upper echelon of summer blockbusters with this one.<br/><br/>Many were expecting perfection with this one... expectations that could possibly be never met. But ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2"" delivers a brash, funny, action-packed delight that's hard to knock. It's heart is in the right place. It's characters? More than welcome for the inevitable ""Round 3."""
"superbenji26","Null","1","3","1 July 2017"," Guardians Of The Galaxy Volume 2 Review
","In Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 Starring Chris Pratt, The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage. <br/><br/>Guardians Of The Galaxy was one of the riskiest films Marvel Studios had decided to take on but, it ended up becoming a smash hit. James Gunn has to follow up that film which will be tough to improve on an already great not only superhero film, but just a great movie overall. Now onto Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2, does it live up to the first movie or does it fall short?<br/><br/>Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 is nearly on par with the first movie while somehow maintaining originality in the sequel. I was afraid that baby Groot was going to be overused and become a crutch on this film but luckily I was mistaken. Baby Groot is used sparingly and when he is used, it pays off in either great adorableness, or utter hilarity. The ensemble cast shines again in this film especially Dave once again showing his acting chops in his transition from Pro Wrestling. Kurt Russell makes his debut in the MCU as Ego The Living Planet. Kurt comes across as charming and beautiful much like Peter Quill himself. <br/><br/>The film is less of the normal superhero film's heroes journey ending with the final showdown with the big bad villain. This film is a character study, James Gunn smartly splits up our main characters from each other in the film allowing to us to learn so much more about every character. He gives us even more reasons to love this ensemble of great characters. He continues to expand the cosmic world of the MCU with amazing colors, and a great cameo from Sylvester Stallone but I won't spoil that for you. Guardians is one of the great superhero sequels, but that's to be expected from the MCU, James Gunn knocks it out of the park again, but I can't go into plot details without giving away spoilers but the Story is great and not forced upon the world. Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 is a worthy film that is unique in it's own way, but once again is plagued by a flip of the switch villain who suddenly becomes evil. <br/><br/>Guardians Of The Galaxy Volume 2 is a Solid 8/10"
"trescia-1","8","1","3","30 June 2017"," It's No Kung Fury
","In 2015 a new cinematic age began. In that year, the movie ""Kung Fury"" appeared in a world that had been ready for its release for many, many centuries.<br/><br/>But some things take time. Now, at last, we have entered the ""Post Kung Fury"" age and all smart-aleck behavior, from here on out, shall be judged on how well it stacks up when compared to the great touchstone film itself--Kung Fury. <br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fine piece of movie-making. It contains all the wonderful things from the first movie, and it succeeds in not boring us with a pointless recap when we could always just go to IMDb and read the synopsis. But we're living two years AFTER Kung Fury. AFTER. You can't just press-on like it was 2014. <br/><br/>Kung Fury marked the dawn of a new age. There was smart-aleckry PRIOR to Kung Fury, and smark-aleckry AFTER. We are living in the Year 2 A.K. (two years after Kung Fury) so a lot of the humor here, which would have been knee-slappin' good three years ago, is now just starting to grow a bit...stale. <br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 is like your uncle who desperately tries to be hip, and works very hard at it, but is always six months behind. GOTG Vol. 2 is often embarrassing because you know they are working so darned hard, and it's so sad to see how far they are from the new normal. Every time some ""clever"" thing was said, I kept hearing the words ""That would explain the laser raptors"" in my head. <br/><br/>Yeah. Sure it was funny, Uncle Pete. (Just not that funny). You try and you try to make a big, tent-pole movie about monsters and fathers and raccoons and then you work your fingers to the bone for you kids and what do you get? I'm tired of trying to please you. Next time, you can make YOUR OWN hyper-expensive super-ironic superhero movie.<br/><br/>Oh. That would explain the dinosaurs."
"johnmckenzie-23398","6","1","3","17 June 2017"," Like Modern Families...In Space.
","I feel this movie inhabits an early teenagers universe. A lot of the characters to me have a 'bickering family' type quality. Reading some of the other user reviews: 'astonishing easter eggs that will have you standing on your seat' another that 'James Gunn has done it again (has done what again - oh another movie?) Also one said ' All our favourite characters are back' (Well they're not MY favourites - sorry.) One reviewer mentioned being part of a (film) industry screening. Maybe that is why there are so many positive early reviews. <br/><br/>I feel many characters are difficult to get to know. Rocket sounds like a New York street hustler; Gamera has the sister/enemy subplot where she will not trust her sister. To complete the whole family thing we have Starlord (Why did the movie have to reveal his characters real name?) meeting...you can guess, right.<br/><br/>Kurt is the best character in this movie. At least he is a 3 - dimensional character likable but a bit unlikable when you realise what he's done. The others have early-teen personalities as well. David Bautusta laughs at everyone, the New character that 'feels emotions' is always sad until she can laugh with Dave - who's laughing at her. Michael Rookers character is too adult for this movie. He's head of a mercenary group and plays it like he enjoys hurting people - even if he does it with a whistling arrow. Is that supposed to make us think his character is funny? <br/><br/>Squeezing in what I think are basically unfriendly characters creates bad role models for kids. Would be good if James Gunn can 'do it again' in the final trilogy part of this movie where all the regulars get a smack on the ass and told to go to bed."

","I strongly recommend this film, if only for the CGI and special effects. In terms of visuals, this is the richest film I have seen. Between the characters, the backgrounds and the effects, it is sometimes difficult to take all of it in. This is a film that requires multiple viewings if one wants to appreciate all of its magic. I think I will watch in 3-D next time.<br/><br/>It starts with a battle scene that is actually funny, thanks to Baby Groot. <br/><br/>The alien creatures are among the best ever depicted in a film, outdoing ""Star Wars"", for example.

"ryandannar","5","1","3","28 May 2017"," Guardians 2: Dazzling visuals and a nice soundtrack, but the writers were hardly even trying.
","""Guardians of the Galaxy 2"" is a messy, irreverent fever-dream of a comic-book space-opera. Its characters are dumb but as likable as puppy-dogs, its script is about as hokey as a CBS sitcom, its plot is full of holes one could drive a Mack-truck through, its visuals make up for their CGI-fakiness by amping-up the color-saturation into neon-overdrive, and it's all set to an overtly nostalgic 1970's rock soundtrack. How can that be bad? Also, how can that be very good?<br/><br/>All of which is to say that I think I liked this sequel better than the original ""Guardians."" It was certainly a bit more fun to look at, containing a few environments -- the ""Sovereign"" planet, and the ""Ego"" planet -- which were grandly imaginative spectacles of fake- looking and weightless but nonetheless striking CGI work. That, and many of the outer-space battles -- as well as a ""space fireworks"" scene at the end -- were as gorgeously colorful as the prettiest sci-fi screensaver. The original ""Guardians"" strived for this kind of over-the-top neon-daydream airbrush-art sci-fi book-jacket quality, and it came close. The sequel, however hyperjumps smack dab into the heart of that territory, and pushes the look as far over the top as I'd hoped it might.<br/><br/>The film's plot is a little cleaner, a little more satisfying, than the original's. There were so many threads involved in the first film that all I can remember, at this point, is that it had something to do with the Guardians trying to keep something called an Infinity Stone out of the hands of a variety of forgettable villains. Thanos was somehow involved. Was Loki in the film? I can't recall. The entire plot was about chasing or protecting a MacGuffin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin), and the climax -- where somehow the Guardians were able to hold a bare Infinity Stone without dying, after the film had taken pains to inform us that such a feat was impossible -- kind of summed-up all my feelings about the film. Why care at all about a story, when the story is so ready to break from its own established rules and logic for a cheap ""wow"" moment?<br/><br/>""Guardians 2"" provides a feasible-enough explanation for that unlikely climactic moment: Starlord's father is an immortal, god- like being known as a Celestial. This makes Starlord half-immortal, or something. Well, truthfully, it makes Starlord exactly as immortal as the plot needs him to be at any given moment, which is pretty convenient for the plot.<br/><br/>This episode of ""Guardians"" in fact focuses on the newfound relationship between Starlord (Chris Pratt) and his immortal father, Ego (Kurt Russell). Ego appears out of nowhere in his cosmic egg- ship, just in time to save Starlord and his crew from certain death at the hands of The Sovereign, a race of golden-skinned aristocrats whose ire has been provoked by the Guardians' theft of the very merchandise the Sovereign had hired them to protect. Why steal the very merchandise you've been hired to protect? The only actual reason is because it provides an excuse for some early-film space- battle action. But the film has some fun trying to answer the question of ""Why?"" anyway, and eventually lands on the notion that Rocket (the foul-mouthed raccoon) just wants to be loved. That plays every bit as shallow as it sounds, but that's what passes for depth in a film like this.<br/><br/>Anyway, after Ego's perfectly-timed rescue, the Guardians' wounded ship crash-lands on a forest-planet. Ego lands alongside, introductions are made, exposition-dumps occur, the next phase of the plot is set-up. Most of the crew then climbs aboard Ego's Eggship for a quick hyperjump over to his home-planet, a fantastical gardenscape known as Ego. Yes, as it turns out, Ego and his home- planet are in fact extensions of the same entity, an incorporeal energy-force which can seemingly manifest itself as anything it desires. This is a neat idea, but this isn't Star Trek, so the most interesting question the film can come up with about Ego's nature is whether or not his human form has a penis?<br/><br/>Naturally, Ego's motivations are not as innocent as they first seem, and The Sovereign aren't lost for long. Stir-in a sub-plot involving Yondu, Starlord's ""tough-as-nails but not"" adoptive father, and a mutiny aboard his cosmic pirate-ship. Add a measure of cutesy family-comedy in the form of Baby Groot, a CGI film-mascot who's only ever as smart, or as dumb, or as strong, or as weak, as the film needs him to be in any given moment. And there you have the sloppy concoction which comprises ""Guardians 2.""<br/><br/>Honestly, this film is fun in an episodic kind of way, and I'm sure that's all it aspires to be. But then, I have to admit that much of the fun was spoiled, for me, by the fact that the film just refuses to respect the logic of its own storytelling. This is one of those films where absolutely anything might happen at any moment, regardless of how ridiculous it might seem, regardless of how out- of-the-blue it might be, regardless of how un-earned the development might seem. Exciting! Things! Happen! But those things are robbed of any weight or meaning by the fact that the film refuses to take its own plot seriously. It's all action with little to no consequence. As soon as you realize that, any kind of suspense or drama is completely gone. At that point, all that's left to do is just drink-in the colorful CGI fireworks and laugh (if you can) at the episodic goofiness."

","Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is a not bad fantastic film of Marvel which is a sequel of Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). The film was directed by James Gunn, the shooting took five months. A little about the plot. It's set in the future. A main character (a son of an earthling and an alien), who's a part of a crazy team, finds his father (Ego) and together they go to an unusual world. Then the viewer finds out that Ego is a mad celestial and his plan is to capture the world. But Guardians stop his and save the Galaxy again. Now, characters. Peter Quill (the main character) is the captain of Guardians, he called himself Star Lord and he's the most charismatic member of the team. Gamora is a woman with green skin and perfect sword fighting skill. Drax is a good warrior and a brave alien. Rocket and Baby Groot are the smallest members of Guardians, but don't underestimate them. Also we can see Ego (an ancient crazy alien) and Yondu Udonta which educate Peter and replace him father; however, Quill understand it when Yondu sacrificed himself for the sake of Peter's salvation. Guardians of the Galaxy based on comics (as well as all films of Marvel Studio). I think, the producer made many fans happy. This movie has very vivid special effects and great film score. But personally I feel that I can't give 10 out of 10 to the film, despite all the advantages. The reasons of it are firstly weak plot of Guardians¬Ö and secondly film's focus on the children's audience. Finally, Guardians of the Galaxy is a good action film, but I wouldn't watch it again."

I believe that audience should watch this film on the big screen to feel all the beauty of graphics. The film good for watching after a hard day.<br/><br/>I would like to praise the musical accompaniment, it fits perfectly with what's happening.<br/><br/>Surely you must agree that actors matched perfectly. The acting is great, the actors managed to convey most of the feelings of their characters.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of the Marvel and I think that this is one of the best films of this Universe. In general, I advise everyone should watch this movie in cinema. You will not regret."
"the_wretched26","7","1","3","25 May 2017"," An entertaining and witty film, which is almost completely ruined by silly plot twists and cheese. Thank god for Baby Groot.
","Guardians 2 is a clever and entertaining sci-fi / action romp with amazing pop culture references and wit, which towards the end, is almost completely ruined by ridiculous plot twists, poor leads, and layer upon layer of cheese. Thank god for Baby Groot.<br/><br/>Peter 'Star-Lord' Quill (Chris Pratt) and his gang of guardians, while getting up to their usual mischief, stumble across Peter's real father Ego (Kurt Russell) ‚Äì a living breathing planet. Everything seems to be going just fine until Gomora (Zoe Saldana) senses that something is up.<br/><br/>Like the first film, Guardians relies on its humour and its soundtrack, which is a fantastic mix of past pop hits. The humour goes deep into slapstick territory on a number of occasions, obviously to impress the kids in the audience. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. At least there were no overly sexual and egotistically lame jokes like Peter's 'Pollock' joke in the first one.<br/><br/>Majority of the jokes are pop culture references which are thoroughly enjoyable. That Mary Poppins moment was the icing on the cake. On top of that, there was always Baby Groot to make you laugh. Without his adorable whimsy, some of these scenes would have lost their appeal altogether. That opening credits scene was PHENOMENAL, and such a good scene to set the tone for the film. Wild colours, banging tunes (see Spotify playlist), beautiful monsters, and Baby Groot. I even got used to all the green screen CGI which doesn't often happen. A job well done to the VFX crew.<br/><br/>Another stand-out character was Nebula, brilliantly played by Karen Gillam. Her character arc over the course of the film is so involving and you feel sorry for her. She also has a subtle sense of humour that makes her a bit human, despite all her machine parts and general Terminator chic. She's one actress to keep an eye on in the future. I expect great things.<br/><br/>Most characters have equal screen time when it comes to humour and they're all pretty good, but special mention must go to Yondu (Michael Rooker) and his speedy fin and arrow scene, and Sovereign High Priestess Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) and her golden army, who seem like spoilt millennial gamers. However, surprisingly, it's lead couple Peter and Gomora and their love story that is just so mind- numbingly boring and predictable. Gomora is about as much fun as a postal worker, and Peter is just¬Ö well Chris Pratt ‚Äì trying to show depth but doesn't quite know the definition of the word.<br/><br/>And unfortunately, he brings the plot down with him. The third act (which is way too long) is all about working out his daddy issues which are neither convincing nor particularly interesting, and then when it finally ends, you've got scrolling credits of GIF-like character dances, written dialogue and of course, the after-credits scenes. It went from fun action/adventure to franchise universe overload. Less is more.<br/><br/>But, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is overall an entertaining watch. A Saturday night movie to catch with family or friends. Safe fun. Check it out in 3D if you want the full experience.<br/><br/>More on moviebarf.com"

","I so wanted to love this film, as I did the first one. I guess then that the danger with having hit the bullseye first time is that you can only go one way... Which is not to say this film is a total ""bust"". It's not, and with characters that worked so well in the first film it would be hard to make a complete turkey. But here's the thing... it's WAY too long, and there are a LOT of sequences when nothing much happens, or if it does you don't really care. The plot is fairly ridiculous, but then it's a Marvel film so you're not expecting Hitchcock. At times it does moralise a LOT about families and family values and all that, and fair enough families are important, but it gets a bit sappy in parts. The good points are the action sequences, and there are a fair few of them, Rocket has much more screen time this time (a good thing), and Baby Groot is cute. Drax's character though only just about comes off this time, and Quill is a tad wasted in his parts. So is it worth a couple of hours of your time? Well... it would definitely be worth 90 minutes or so, for sure. My cousin and I just thought that over 2 hours stretched things too far. In addition to which if you're wanting to hear ""Fox On The Run"", which we were, it's not in the film at all, unless you count the end credits, and a long way down in those..."

","I didn't care much for the first Guardians Of The Galaxy, I'd never heard of any of the characters (except for Rocket & Thanos) before seeing it & went in not expecting much. It was okay, good even, but nothing I'd be talking about after seeing it.<br/><br/>So as you can imagine I went into Vol. 2 thinking the same thing. <br/><br/>I haven't been this pleasantly surprised since Fury Road.<br/><br/>It's a huge improvement on the first film. The characters feel more genuine & likable, the soundtrack was great (both original score & music tracks), the humour (for about 90% of the film) was spot on & the story was very well executed.<br/><br/>From looking at a few reviews, & seeing countless comments on Facebook pages, I was rather concerned about Groot being made into some overly cute mascot, not unlike the Minions, but his role in the film was great & it didn't feel like they were cheaping him out at all.<br/><br/>I still had a slight issue with Rocket & the delivery of some of his lines, like in the first film. In the serious/dramatic/action scenes he was great, no complaints here. But whenever there's a scene where he's suppose to be funny it felt rather forced. Like the whole scene with Taserface, it started out quite well but they dragged Rocket's dialogue out far too long for it to be funny. & also all the crew laughing at his jokes just felt like some kind of forced laugh track.<br/><br/>Yondu was great in this film. One thing I did like about vol. 1 was Michael Rooker's performance & he had a much larger role in this film that followed nicely from the first one. More of his back story & relationship with Starlord was revealed & he came of as a spectacular character, if not slightly overpowered with his arrow.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt delivers as usual. Again, I felt his humour in the first film was really forced & felt totally artificial (like the opening & final battle dancing) but in this one he really delivered. His references from his own time on Earth were very enjoyable, right from the music he grew up with to forming a giant, celestial Pacman during the final battle.<br/><br/>I did feel as though the introduction between Starlord & his father was a bit lackluster. They already made it clear at the start of the film that Starlord still feels strongly about who his father is after the high priestess mentions it to him. But when Ego lands & tells him straight away he's his father it was just sort of a ""Oh, okay."" kind of moment. It reminded of Kowalski from Fantastic Beasts when he was first told that magic was real. Didn't seem to have much of an impact. But throughout the film the Relationship between Starlord & his father flourished nicely.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend this film to anyone & I am really looking forward to the next installment in the series. Whether that be another stand alone Guardians film or (most likely) during Infinity War."

","Look, here me out on this one. I love the MCU, I love James Gunn, and most of all I am a huge admirer of Guardians of the Galaxy. However, I have real difficulty discussing the pros and cons of this film. I cant say it was either really good or just average. Taking the plot into account = quite basic, not the strongest. Character development was quite strong, and there were some fresh faces that were warmly welcomed. I wont say it was BETTER than Vol. 1, but I wont say it was as good either.

"QuintLives","7","1","3","12 May 2017"," Solid sequel but falls short of the excellent original
","The original Guardians of the Galaxy is my favorite Marvel Universe movie and probably my favorite movie of 2014 (either that or John Wick). I was completely unfamiliar with them until the movie, but I loved the characters and the tone. The film reveled in unabashed wackiness in a way that reminded me of stuff like Flash Gordon, Big Trouble in Little China and Howard the Duck (more on Howard in a minute). The sequel is much of the same. This is a really fun movie with great characters, but it does fall short of the original largely due to some narrative restraints. <br/><br/>The plot largely revolves around the team finally meeting Star Lord's father (played by one of my favorite actors, Kurt Russell). Star Lord, Drax and Gamora go off to investigate the father while Rocket and Groot are taken as hostages by Yondu's crew (Yondu, played by the awesome Michael Rooker, is the blue guy with the flying arrow). To discuss any further would require major spoilers, so I will leave it at that.<br/><br/>The issue with the film is an almost inevitable flaw with a series like this. In any story about the formation of a team, there are four basic stages: Stage 1: The team members don't trust each other; Stage 2: A threat forces the team to learn to work together; Stage 3: Something causes the team to become conflicted and/or separated; Stage 4: A new threat brings the team back together. For reference, Captain America: Civil War is Stage 3 for the Avengers and I'm hoping the next Avengers film will just dive right into Stage 4. Stage 3 is almost always the least entertaining part; it's the dramatic lull before the status quo is returned. It's the film equivalent of a ballad at a metal concert; it's a good time to grab a beer before the fun stuff comes back. The middle act of Guardians 2 is essentially stuck in Stage 3 with the team divided in half and individuals resolving their own issues. It isn't bad, mind you, but watching Peter resolve his daddy issues, Yondu ponder his role in Peter's upbringing and Gamora and Nebula discuss their sibling rivalry isn't as fun as watching them battle space mutants. All of this drags down the pace of the film while the audience waits for the inevitable status quo to return in the form of big space battles. The beginning and end of the film are a hell of a lot of fun, but some running time could have been trimmed in the middle. <br/><br/>Now let's address the biggest issue that is weighing on my mind: Disney and Marvel, where the hell is my new Howard the Duck movie? The reveal of Howard at the end of the first Guardians is my favorite post- credit scene since the first Iron Man and it's the only one that has never been followed up on. Sure, we get a glimpse of Howard in this movie too, but he has no lines and is only seen for a second as if to taunt me. I kept waiting for Howard to show up with a bigger role throughout this entire damn movie and, at the end, I was left sitting there duckless like an idiot. <br/><br/>Despite a meandering second act and a disturbing anti-duck agenda, Guardians is still a solid sequel that is worth seeing in theaters. If I sound overly negative about it, it's because I love the original and had high expectations that were not quite met. So go see it, enjoy and hopefully I will get my damn Howard the Duck movie."
"Quietb-1","7","1","3","12 May 2017"," Long and loud.
","If you saw Guardians one you know what to expect and two deliveries. All of your favorite characters are back in one form or another and there is an interesting good guy bad guy who seemed to have escaped from The Blue Man Group. In case you are wondering Zoe Saldana is green.<br/><br/>Be prepared for a complete assault on your senses. The movie is so loud it seems the Kurt Russell character decided to keep his brain in a cave to avoid the noise. In regard to the Russell character the plot spins into a shaggy God story.<br/><br/>The few quiet moments are refreshing. The dialogue is sharp and often funny. Characters yelling at each other is not conflict. Seems like all families have issues.<br/><br/>The movie looks great on the big screen and should be seen in a theater environment. There are plenty of things during the credits including the promise of another sequel."
"dolcela","9","1","3","12 May 2017"," Peter Quill searches for a lost father
","TITLE: ""The Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2"" <br/><br/>This is a very comedic and funny movie, while still having the plot of a superhero similar to those of superhero movies. The comedy is littered throughout the film as a ragtag group of friends travel across the galaxy to save it. <br/><br/>This movie takes place in about current time, give or take 5-10 years. In this movie we have Star-lord or Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Rocket (Bradley Cooper as voice), Drax (Dave Bautista), and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) who set out to learn more about wills parentage after the last ""Guardians of the Galaxy"".<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, I think that it is a great family movie. It has a lot of comedy in it both adult references and lots of little jokes. The movie references a lot to ""daddy problems"" in the characters and connects many of the characters together through the similarities. This is one of the biggest themes in the movie, I think that the biggest moral in the story is that your biological father may not be your true dad, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>This is a good movie for the family, although it leans more towards the adult audiences. There is a lot of comedy for the adults while still being innocent for the kids. ""Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2 is rated pg-13. I think that this is one of the few movies to be better than the one before. <br/><br/>I give it a 9/10 stars"

","The bad: I felt like they missed the mark on the scenes that should tug on your heart strings. Believe me, they tried. But I wasn't emotionally attached. The dialogue left much to be desired. They injected too much humor. I wasn't as connected to the characters as the first one. The fight scene near the beginning wasn't hitting the spot. You'll know what I mean when you see it. I'm sure some people loved it, but not me. That sets the tone for the movie, and they didn't pull me in then.<br/><br/>The good: Acting. The characters were top notch.

"tomgillespie2002","6","1","3","10 May 2017"," Somebody at Marvel should have reeled Gunn in
","After Marvel had struck gold with The Avengers in 2012, raking in over a billion dollars at the box-office, it seemed that the studio could do no wrong with their roster of superheroes, with Iron Man 3 going on to also break the billion mark in 2013, despite being one of the weakest in the franchise. When it was announced that they would be bringing the Guardians of the Galaxy, a relatively obscure, space-dwelling gang of misfits to the big screen, to some this seemed like their biggest risk yet, and one that could stop the Marvel Cinematic Universe in its tracks. James Gunn's spunky, colourful and idiosyncratic blend of B-movie quirkiness and big- budget thrills struck a chord with the audience, and this group of minor league superheroes only really known to comic book fans suddenly became a household name.<br/><br/>For fans of the first movie, there is plenty to enjoy in the sequel, which takes its 'Vol. 2' from the new playlist of '70s and '80s favourites on the soundtrack, usually pumping out of the retro walkman belonging to the group's leader, Peter Quill, AKA Star-Lord (Chris Pratt). Taking place almost immediately after the climax of the previous instalment, the gang are all present and ready to take on an intergalactic monster hoping to steal some valuable batteries from a golden, near-perfect race called the Sovereign. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is stern-faced and struggling with her feelings for Quill; Drax (Dave Bautista) once again gets all the funniest lines and is the best thing in the movie; snarky weapons engineer Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) seems eager to push everybody away as he tests his newly-forged bond with the other Guardians; and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) is a big-eyed baby, clumsily fumbling from one scene to the next and inspiring the most ""aaahs"" from the audience in the process.<br/><br/>When they inadvertently p**s off the Sovereign's leader Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), the Guardians find themselves marooned on an island. They have their arses saved by a mysterious figure who introduces himself as Ego (Kurt Russell), a character glimpsed in the opening flashback scene via some immaculate de-ageing CGI enjoying a courtship with Quill's mother. Ego is a Celestial, an ancient being who has manage to build an entire planet around him. To give him his full name, he is Ego the Living Planet, and he is also Quill's father. Themes of family run throughout the film, with Gamora constantly fighting with her returning sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), Drax forming a sibling-like bond with Ego's assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Groot playing the role of the baby everybody is responsible for, and of course Quill's daddy issues. Also returning is blue-skinned Ravager Yondu (Michael Rooker), the guy who kidnapped Quill from Earth and raised him like a son.<br/><br/>Marvel directors have been vocal in their support for the hands-off approach taken by Kevin Feige, the man overlooking the entire Cinematic Universe, which goes some way to explain how they can attract such enormous talents as Taika Waititi and Ryan Coogler. Gunn has been given the key to the kingdom here, and he throws all of his Troma-taught wackiness at the screen. Space battles and gun- fights fill the screen, and while there's a bright, almost psychedelic visual pizazz to it all, there's a real lack of dramatic weight. Somebody at Marvel should have reeled Gunn in. With the constant quipping and '80s references going on, including an appearance from Pac-Man, it never really feels like the characters are in any danger, and even less so the galaxy. There's also an insistence on trying to squeeze humour out of every single scene. I don't remember one joke failing to land back in 2014, but there are plenty of moments in Vol. 2 that had me frustratingly straight- faced. In particular, one running joke involving a character named Taserface (Chris Sullivan) long outstays its welcome.<br/><br/>The film is as its most effective when exploring the quieter interactions between the wide roster of characters, and the Freudian issues brought along with Ego and his uncertain intentions. While the Fast & Furious franchise insists its mythos is built around 'family' by having Vin Diesel inform us so every 10 minutes, the Guardians genuinely feel like a tight unit brought together by their own troubled pasts. Rooker brings a lot of heart into his role of surrogate father facing a major turning point in his life, after he is exiled from the Ravagers by higher-up Stakar (Sylvester Stallone) and faces a mutiny led by Taserface. Gunn ultimately tries to bring too much to the table, piling on the jokes and special effects-laden set-pieces, as well attempting to introduce new characters who will surely play a larger role in future instalments. I left the cinema back in 2014 overjoyed and eager to see it again. Three years later, I left with a headache and a sore backside, but still with a fondness for the characters."
"targe1314","6","1","3","8 May 2017"," A fairly good fun ride but definitely NOT as good as #1
","We knew going into this that Rocket and Groot, with strong support from Draxx, would carry this film. We saw that in the trailers, as we saw very important pivotal joke moments ruined for us before we got to see them in the movie. And this all came to pass.<br/><br/>Rocket, Groot, and Draxx, do indeed carry this movie, with some minor support from the excellent Michael Rooker character Yondo.<br/><br/>Look for Chris Pratt to be pretty much yawning and getting a paycheque in the background, with the complete miscast Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone (really???) getting into the franchise and ruining it.<br/><br/>Another big disappointment is the main bad guy race. I was a huge fan of the Kree and Ronan the Accuser in Vol 1, and I thought Lee Pace did a fantastic job in that movie.<br/><br/>Compare that to what we get in Vol. 2 - Golden Snobs who play video games to attack you with their spacedrones, led by a petulant young queen who struts around in her golden cape pouting at people and things.<br/><br/>We have lots of tear jerking in this one too, so thank god for Rocket's smart ass mouth and Draxx's off the wall humor. We have Chris and Gamorra dancing and making googly eyes, we have Gamorra and Nebula making up as sistas, extremely quickly and with no development, and we have the wonderful character of Yondo getting slain as the sacrificial 'good guy death' that we seem to always need in a sequel.<br/><br/>AND we see Starlord's classic vintage 80's WALKMAN get destroyed!<br/><br/>So in one movie we see THREE of the tentpole structures from the first movie that carried it, namely, the eternal hatred rivalry of Gamorra vs Nebula, the constant threat of the deadly and resourceful scavanger Yondo, and the retro 80's theme of StarLord's ancient WALKMAN and MIX TAPES, all completely DESTROYED!!!!<br/><br/>But don't worry, as marketed, BABY GROOT IS CUTE. The number of teenage girls fawning and awwwing over him, including my own daughter, was a tidal wave of vomit all on it's own. Yes, the marketing engineered living Cupie doll was very cute, and pretty much had to carry the movie at points on his tiny leaf sprouting shoulders.<br/><br/>But in the end, as one might expect, it was Kurt Russell literally playing GOD, as a planet sized life form that somehow has troubles killing the good guys with his energy tentacles at the end of the movie. It was painful watching Kurt and Chris work through this awful material, even when they were deliberately making fun of it it came off as awkward and awful. We end up wanting to spend the entire movie with Yondo and Rocket in jail, trying to get baby groot to bring them stuff to break out with (the highlight of the movie). We end up feeling like Gamorra when she takes a walk out to the fields away from Kurt's Shangri-La 60's acid trip palace, because, THIS PLANET SUX! Yes it does, Gamorra, wish we could take a walk too."
"orlando-somera","8","1","3","7 May 2017"," Inspired but could have been better
","This is a fun movie even though it falters a bit near the end. The first third or so expands on the promise of the first Guardians and is pretty exhilarating especially when you consider how wild it is. There's an odd kind of irreverent humor on display that is almost certain not to be matched anywhere else.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt as Peter Quill is really quite good. He plays it with such a light touch that he imperceptibly elevates the entire cast. He's clearly worked out a lot of the nuances of the role in a very intelligent way. Bautista as Drax is the most improved character. He actively contributes to the action instead of mostly being a prop. He also adds something elusive to the humor as if he'd done this a million times before. Why they hadn't used that more in the first film I don't know.<br/><br/>Keeping this short by skipping over some of its other good parts, the problem with the last third or so is that it tries to put across a rather difficult idea while generating a lot of noise and action that mostly misses. Still this is an ambitious movie that deserves the millions it'll rake in."
"judywalker2","4","1","3","7 May 2017"," Not much fun
","I loved the first Guardians for its mix of action and comedy; but this movie substitutes comedy and silliness for a decent story. I don't know much at the Guardians from the comics, but I hope their story on paper was better than this. I was excited to see them introduce Kurt Russell as Peter's father but come on they couldn't do anything more interested with him. The story was kind of childish with too much forced family melodrama and dumb jokes. Also for a movie you'd like to bring you kids to there were too many adult references and too much violence. These characters were interesting in the first movie but a whole lot less interesting in this one."

","Its more action packed than the first one, a laugh riot and so much fun to watch, but still a notch less than the first one.<br/><br/>Like the first one, the start of the movie is so much fun that it gets you excited. It starts with, obviously, the Guardians kicking some ass in the Galaxy and helping a planet where people are literally made of gold, yes literally. So somehow, they get into trouble, and circumstances let Peter Quill (Star Lord) meet his mysterious Dad (Ego) for the first time.<br/><br/>It answers few questions from the first movie that why Peter was able to hold a damn Infinity Stone. So anyway, like always with superhero movies, the galaxy gets into trouble and Guardians have to save it, with of course some new team members.<br/><br/>The action, the CGI and 3D effects are top notch, as you would expect from a Marvel movie, or any big budget Hollywood movie for that matter. It has the same kind of comedy that you would expect if you have watched the first movie. Just when you think its getting serious, someone will say or do something funny, but few times I felt it was unnecessary, it almost gets predictable if you have jokes everywhere.<br/><br/>Star Lord, Gamora, Rocket, Nebula, Mantis were great, but Drax(Bautista) was just delightful. Baby Groot is just so adorable, kids would love him, I want to adopt him. But what really stole the show for me, was Yondu. He had more depth in his character and I liked the unpredictability of his actions. Kurt was fine as Ego.<br/><br/>Even though its full of action and unique comedy, it gets a little boring in between. There are great moments in this movie where you can't take your eyes off but some dialogue scenes slowed down the movie. But still great fun!! P.S. This one has multiple post-credit scenes so don't leave the theater till the end."
"galahad58-1","7","1","3","7 May 2017"," Not as Guarded
","Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 is a mediocre film. It has wonderful visuals and 3D is well worth the price.<br/><br/>As for story: it is badly written and has a lot of filler that is unnecessary. The movie tries too hard to be a comedy instead of a Marvel movie and that takes away from the entire film. The mutiny by the Ravagers was a wasted moment; the consistent Taser Face jokes were repeated way too often; Stallone (and his character) are just filler and have no purpose; and Mantis (an original Guardians) is badly written and used. Baby Groot wears thin after the first ten minutes and the continuous Baby Groot puns are useless. The entire story line with Nebula is a waste of time - how she only wanted a sister instead of a rival has nothing to do with the story and only gives a doorway to having one more additional character for future movies. <br/><br/>Cast: Chris Pratt is alright as Star Lord. He will never be a strong actor and he fills the role, but he does not have the presence that Chris Evans or Robert Downey have in their respective Marvel roles. Zoe Saldana just is awful as Gamora (she was in the first film too) and I am not sure why she is in demand for these roles - she destroys Star Trek with her bad interpretation of Uhura and she is just so dry and lifeless in everything that she does. Michael Rooker is outstanding and has the best presence and lines in the film. Kurt Russell does a nice job as Ego, but he doesn't come across as that super villain that you need to save the world from. Rocket Raccoon is funny as usual. Drax is the second best character in the film and Batista brings a lot of life and character to Drax - Saldana could learn from him. Sean Gunn steals scene after scene as Kraglin and should have had more screen time than Gamora or Mantis.<br/><br/>Overall I give the movie a 7 for the visuals, Michael Rooker, Kurt Russell (who was pretty good as the villain) and Rocket Raccoon. Some of the best parts of the movie were the cameos - David Hasselhoff, Ben Browder, Stallone, Ving Rhames, Michelle Yoeh and Jeff Goldblum (to name a few)."

","First, don't get me wrong. It was definitely a visually stunning movie with the same light-hearted characters we all came to love in Volume 1. However, things all seemed a little forced and cheesy in the second volume. I thought, personally, there could have been a little bit more action and less expository between the characters. I am all about character development, but every scene seemed to be another sad sob story with another one of the characters. Also, in the end, it never really seemed like the universe ever needed saving."

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is just as enjoyable and funnier than the first movie that was a surprise hit at the box office in 2014. There was no way that you had the ""I've seen it all before feel"" nor was it recycling ideas from the first movie for the sake of it. The original cast returns and it was a delight to see them pick up where the left off from the first movie.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees the return of Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). This time, the misfit quartet have been hired by Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), leader of the Sovereign race to protect valuable batteries from invaders in exchange for Gamora's estranged sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), who was caught attempting to steal the batteries. After it is discovered that Rocket has stolen some batteries for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. When the Guardians crash land on a mysterious island, they are rescued by a mysterious figure who reveals himself to be Quill's long lost father, Ego (Kurt Russell) who offers to take him back to his home. The antagonistic Yondu (Michael Rooker) also returns but finds himself forming an alliance with the Guardians to prevent another threat against the universe which nobody saw coming.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt, once again, is a delight to watch on screen and he makes a welcome return as Peter Quill/Star Lord. Zoe Saldanda, Dave Battista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper and Michael Rooker also return in their respective roles from the first movie. Kurt Russell is one actor that can do no wrong and here he is fantastic as Ego. Sylvester Stallone pops up in a small role which may possibly pave the way for a bigger role in a sequel. Baby Groot had the best role in the entire movie.<br/><br/>The story keeps the movie interesting, the stars light up the screen, the visual effects are dazzling, the are plenty of perfect moments of humour, and the soundtrack just puts a smile of your face.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is another winner for Marvel Studios and the sequel is a welcome addition. Going by the end credit scenes, a third movie is looking very likely and rightfully so.<br/><br/>Buckle up and enjoy the fun.<br/><br/>7/10."
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","1","3","5 May 2017"," Guardians of the Solar System
","When Guardians of the Galaxy came out in the late summer of 2014, the world once again fell in love with an admirably ambitious, yet uncharacteristically shaggy space opera. It was at once a travelogue, an adventure story and an ensemble piece that smartly borrowed from golden-age blockbuster ephemera to give us something truly ballsy for the time. The fact that the potential franchise was yet another loop in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's rapidly expanding armor was but the icing on a very fulfilling and very expensive cake.<br/><br/>Three years later, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is put in a very precarious situation. Due to the MCU being a nay unstoppable force at the cineplex, the exploits of Peter Quill and his band of bickering mercenaries no longer have the element of surprise. Quality special-effects, impeccable casting, expert-level character work are now not just unexpected surprises, their bare minimum pass/fail aspects of these kinds of movies. Show me a villain with world-destroying ambitions; yawn. Find me a roguish, white, male, American lead with daddy issues; next. You have a talking racoon, they have a Hulk.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 picks up with our motley crew cashing in on their savior status while working for a civilization known as The Sovereign. After defeating an inter-dimensional monster to the crunchy tunes of Electric Light Orchestra, the plot is kicked into high gear when Rocket (Cooper) steals a handful of powerful batteries. This puts the Guardians on a collision course with The Sovereign, Yondu (Rooker) and his returning band of space pirates, the revenge seeking Nebula (Gillan) and a new character, that just might hold the key to Peter's (Pratt) lineage.<br/><br/>Part of the reason for the original film's success was its ability to feel fresh and new while never doing anything actually risky. Even so, the finished product managed to artfully ape irreverence and feel organic; a mix that Marvel fans ate up if only for the sake of novelty. Here however everything seems to be stapled into the same world as the rest of them, complete with perfectly mimicked story-beats and predictably playful Easter egg hunts. If one were to pick a spiritual forebear to Guardians 2 it'd be Iron Man 2 (2010) who similarly took the runaway success of its prequel and made everything more self-contained and character oriented. Some may claim that means it's more intimate, I'd claim it feels like the series is running in place until the rest of the larger universe catches up.<br/><br/>At least this movie isn't as sloppy and emotionally empty as Iron Man 2. We can thank that on the fact that the Guardians are a goofball ensemble and not just one goofball pining for a liquid lunch. James Gunn's script, while lacking the gusto of the original, takes a few decent cues from Empire Strikes Back (1980). It finds an opportunity to split our cast early and forces them to examine their own particular hangups to the structure of clever bookmarked editing. This guarantees that if a plot point does become sloppy or uninteresting at least the integrity of the film proper doesn't suffer for it.<br/><br/>Guardians 2 also benefits greatly from a unifying theme, that being an honest examination of family and what being part of a close-knit group of people truly means. Both Peter and Gamora (Saldana) go through struggles of blood and birth, Yondu opens up about his fidelity to Quill, Rocket comes to terms with knowing the very people he's pushing away aren't going to give up on him. If a short straw is to be drawn thematically it goes to Bautista's Drax whose only real task is to assimilate newcomer Mantis (Klementieff) into the fold. Yet even then his mirthful laugh and steely unironic gaze serve some of the only moments of true feeling in a movie alarmingly light on them.<br/><br/>At its best, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a mildly entertaining romp through a visually pleasing space-age universe complete with a likable gallery of oddball characters. At its most craven and cynical however, the film feels like nothing more than a stopgap. One who clumsily mistook the forfeiting of stakes for irreverence and thought a barrage of forced 80's references was a substitute for wit."

"pdmajumder","8","1","3","5 May 2017"," GotG 2 keeps the show running
","Three years after the release of the unexpected MCU hit, Guardians of the Galaxy, comes its successor, GotG Vol.2 which is still just as much of a ""wild-child"" as the first one.<br/><br/>The first MCU movie of 2017 draws some similarities to the first release of the year before (Civil War), as instead of dealing with an imminent, world-threatening situation throughout the course of the film, the story takes us through the lives of the characters and their histories. The occurrence of a huge, devastating event was never a part of the film's objective anyway, as there will be enough of that in the movies to come. But that doesn't mean the movie is any bit less fun. In fact, as you may have read in some other reviews, they take the fun-factor up a couple of notches-- a move that has garnered some mixed responses. To me, the humor (which is a very important part of the Marvel movies, especially the GotG franchise) is well suited and timed with just a few exceptions where it didn't feel as effortless as Volume 1.<br/><br/>But in all fairness, they did a great job of keeping the charm maintained and indeed created a film that is in no way inferior to the first. We just may feel used to it and the craziness might not hit us as favorably since it is not novel anymore. Some of the characters from the previous film whom we had thought, belonged to the side, opposite to that of the heroes, slowly change and turn a new leaf. This is done very cleverly so as to not make the transition seem awkward or abrupt. Perceptions are changed by the end of the film and enough reasoning is given behind any past cruel behavior. <br/><br/>Ironically, however, the one character that was supposed to be heroic turns out to be quite different as revealed in the twist of the third act. This however, does make up for the lack of a significant and almost indestructible antagonist (as is the rule of the MCU). But not to put the ""Gold people"" down, they serve their part well and keep the tempo going in the beginning, adding an extra layer to the problems our guardians eventually start facing before having to defeat the biggest one of them all. We all want explosions and lasers and they make sure we get tons of that. <br/><br/>But since the task of saving the universe is realized only towards the end, I almost couldn't connect with the seriousness of the issue. The gravity of the situation was not portrayed casually but certain parts in our protagonists' fight against the villain seemed like they had unfairly played out in their favor (as the character they're up against is immensely powerful). The end is still satisfying, however, as all tension between the characters is resolved and bonds are strengthened. It also gets a bit emotional as we witness a well-honored demise of an integral figure towards whom I found, to my surprise, I had unknowingly grown a liking. <br/><br/>The effects and the music get us charged up every time there is a high-octane fight sequence. Also, did I mention, Baby Groot is (of course) unbelievably adorable and this particular attribute even saves his life at one point. Drax delivers the comedic lines perfectly although both of these characters' potentials could have been better utilized, as in the first movie. On the whole, this film is a brave second installment. Comparisons will always be made but this film does win in its own way and clears away some personal issues so that the future films won't have the burden of lingering questions to face anymore. It is the bridge to Vol. 3 (which is DEFINITELY happening). The third post credit scene, out of the five, introduces a crucial character from the Marvel Comics but who, if reports are to be believed, surprisingly, won't be seen in the major upcoming films. For all Marvel fans, this film's minor flaws won't diminish the thrill at all. After 14 great movies, if there's one thing you should know, it is that Marvel can never REALLY go wrong. It is a solid package of entertainment and character- driven storytelling, setting the tone for the other two mega movies that we're going to be spoiled with this year."
"jmarinko925","8","1","3","5 May 2017"," Another action packed, fun filled, hilarious Guardians Film!
","I went and saw Guardians of The Galaxy 2 last night and it delivers the goods as expected. High throttle space adventure with humor and action at every turn.<br/><br/>The film will also address and answer some question's we (the viewer ) may have had origin wise after the first film and naturally opens up doors for ongoing Marvel multiverse sagas.<br/><br/>I did not see the first film in the theatre even at the suggestion of a friend telling me how good it was. Although I am a comic book fan I could not get my head around the whole raccoon shooting a machine gun aspect. I was wrong. Dead wrong ,the first film leaves you loving every one of these characters and I would not make the same mistake twice.<br/><br/>Guardians 2 picks up shortly after the end of the first film. The soundtrack Awesome Mix Vol.2 provides an excellent backdrop to the scenes it compliments. Chris Pratt's Star-Lord is wonderful once again as he plays the all heart and soul heroic lead. Zoe Salanda returns as the lovely Gamora who in addition to the her kick ass no nonsense character from the first film has personal conflicting issues of her own to address in this installment. Dave Bautista's Drax the Destroyer entertains and shines throughout the entire film his humor, misplaced sincerities and fighting reckless abandon make him a favorite of the guardians for me. <br/><br/>The team is missing some muscle as opposed to the first go round as Groot is now Baby Groot no longer the bad guy bodying henchman once again voiced by Vin Disel. What Groot lacks in physical stature in this film he certainly makes up for in charm. It is worth noting that while short handed groot's strength we see the Guardians functioning and fighting in cohesion as a team which is a joy to see.Rocket voiced by Bradley Copper's space tech weaponry alone is a special effects vision to experience.<br/><br/>We are also introduced to a good amount of new exciting characters as well as some outstanding cameo's. Strong supporting performances as well from Karen Gillian as Gamora's sister Nebula who returns as well as many others. Mantis a new character in the Guardians saga is characterized by Pom Klementieff and provides the film with an emotional and sincere aspect as well.<br/><br/>My personal favorite in the film is Michael Rooker's Ravager Leading space pirate Yondu Udonta. The character is fun exciting, funny,emotional and and in certain moments in this installment downright excellent. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 humor, action , excitement and emotion throughout. Definitely a movie you see in the theatre,definitely should not be missed."
"TheJediWay9","8","1","3","4 May 2017"," Bigger-But Not Better-Than The Original, ""Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2"" Offers Plenty Of Character, Action, Emotion, And Remains Damn Fun
","""Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2"" is the sequel to the highly successful ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" movie released in 2014 that introduced us to a band of misfits brought together to save the galaxy. In this installment Star-Lord is determined to learn more about his heritage: who he is, where he came from, who his father is, and meets his father (played by Kurt Russell) while he and the other Guardians have to eliminate a threat and save the galaxy once again. <br/><br/>Vol. 2 isn't necessarily better than the first one. It suffers from what I like to call ""sequelitis."" It is bigger however, but not from an action standpoint, but rather a character standpoint and I appreciated that. When this film has the choice of giving us a gigantic action over a heartfelt character moment it will chose the character moment. It is a character driven film, with the action scenes, while there are quite a few, far between each other. <br/><br/>The first 20-30 of the film really doesn't have a focus and feels a bit choppy. It feels like a sitcom released to theaters and not all of the jokes land. There are a lot of jokes and moments of humor and at times during this opening of the movie it became too much, almost as if the movie relied on them to keep you invested. <br/><br/>Some of the characters are a waste. Drax doesn't do much in the movie. He kind of just hangs out. That was disappointing to see, as Drax was one of my favorite parts of the first movie. Another miss was Stallone's character. Stallone should have been kicking ass in this movie. Instead he is sidelined only appearing in the movie for a measly 5 minutes of screen time accumulating two scenes. It was a huge miss, and really could have had Stallone play a big part in this movie, though it does set him up for a much larger role in the third installment. <br/><br/>The action scenes were really cool to look at. The visual effects and CGI were top notch. Everything in these scenes were edited and filmed in a very good way. The CGI on Baby Groot was seamless. <br/><br/>I like how the movie focused on Star-Lord's heritage and the numerous relationships these characters have with each other and certain things. This is why I pay to see movies like this because we have the characters that we have grown to love. <br/><br/>The villains are lame. They're just gold people that the movie sets up and doesn't really do anything with. Malekith from ""Thor: The Dark World"" looks amazing compared to them. These gold people are probably my least favorite villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date and proof Marvel hasn't fixed their villain problem.<br/><br/>Still a damn good time though. When the action, humor, and emotions mix together and mesh very well the movie flows with much more force behind it.<br/><br/>I am going to give ""Guardians Of The Galaxy: Vol. 2"" an 8.0/10."

","The title says it all. I question I got immediately via text from my dear friend. Now to answer that question, kids, let me begin at beginning. <br/><br/>The GOTG vol. 2 is one hell of a ride with crazy and mostly BEAU-TI-FUL visuals which are really eye-popping in 3D. The screen is constantly filled with beautiful colours and well made CGI that will make you question: ""wait... are the visuals better than Dr. strange?? "" <br/><br/>The important chemistry between our dear guardians is heavily present and I love it. The little baby groot gets his own mini show in the beginning(not telling in what way or form), but that brings me to the humor; Forced, in small portions.. Sometimes the humor doesn't click for me and feels a little it on the nose, but for the most part you will live with LOADS of laughter in your memories. Drax along with MANTIS? steals the show in terms of humour.. <br/><br/>""Then why do people feel the need to be caution about their excitement of their films as reviewers like ""jeremy jahns"" have said us to be in a way?"" Well... The only thing that sticks out as sore thumb(in this almost great film) is the story... not the story perse, but the story structure. We are used to the whole act 1; buildup, act 2: explanation of evaluation of the conflict and act 3: resolution. They change that up a bit, which makes the first two acts feel like the story is lacking. It's not bad by all means, but people expected a dense story like the first one and this just doesn't give that. <br/><br/>Having said that, the actors were great, the chemistry was there, yondu & drax(and mantis) stole the show for me, the action was great.. i cannot wait for the next installment and i will see it again tomorrow because it's a damn good movie. <br/><br/>So the answer that darn question in the title: No, because when the first one is great in trilogy, it's hard to make a better one.. you can only hope it matches that level and for me it almost got there. <br/><br/>8 out of 10 guys. Go see it. Don't listen to JEREMY this time. <br/><br/>p.s.: most disappointing thing in the whole movie was that there is NO tie-in to avengers infinity war or thor rag..."

","The first film based on the Marvel Comics was a huge cinematic success, so expectations were high for the return of the group of superheroes in the sequel, directed by James Gunn (Slither, Super). Basically the Guardians of the Galaxy: Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zo√´ Saldana), Drax (Spectre's Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot, now Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) successfully defended Xander from Ronan the Accuser. The Guardians next successfully protect valuable batteries from an inter- dimensional monster, for Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), High Priestess and leader of the Sovereign race, in exchange for her prisoner, Gamora's estranged sister Nebula (Doctor Who's Karen Gillan), who attempted to steal the batteries, but was caught. But Rocket steals batteries for himself, a fleet of drones from the Sovereign attack the Guardians' ship, a mysterious figure destroys the remaining drones, but the Guardians crash-land on a nearby planet. Later this mysterious figure reveals himself, ancient Celestial being Ego (Kurt Russell), who also reveals he is Peter's biological father, he invites his son, accompanied by Gamora and Drax, to his home, while Rocket and Groot remain to repair the ship and guard Nebula. Yondu Udonta (Slither's Michael Rooker) and his crew were exiled from the greater Ravager community for child trafficking, Ayesha hires Yondu and his crew to recapture the Guardians, they successfully capture Rocket, but Yondu is reluctant to turn over Quill. Nebula convinces Yondu's lieutenant Taserface (Chris Sullivan) and a mutiny to release her, imprison Rocket and Yondu, execute Yondu's loyalists, and assist her to track down and kill Gamora, who Nebula blames for the torture inflicted on her by their father Thanos. While imprisoned on Yondu's ship, Rocket and Yondu bond, Groot and Yondu loyalist Kraglin (Sean Gunn) free them, destroy the ship and kill the crew as they escape, though not before Taserface tips off the Sovereign fleet. Ego explains that he is one of the god-like Celestials, he exists in the form of the planet on which they are standing, he assumed the form of a human to travel the universe and interact with other species, eventually coming to Earth, meeting and falling in love with Quill's mother Meredith (Laura Haddock). After Meredith's death, Ego paid Yondu to collect the young Peter, but he never delivered his son, he had been searching for him ever since, Ego teaches Peter to manipulate Celestial power. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and attempts to kill Gamora, she fails, after a fight between them the pair reach an uneasy alliance, discovering skeletal remains filling the caverns of the planet. Ego reveals to Peter that in his travels to thousands of world, he planted seedlings upon many of the planets, capable of terraforming into new extensions of himself, but they can only be activated by the power of a second Celestial. Ego impregnated countless women to give to birth to children who would be able to access the power, all failed, so Ego killed them, until he found Peter. Ego uses his son's power the activate the seedlings, which begin to consume the worlds they inhabit, Peter is hypnotised into helping his father, but fights back after Ego reveals he deliberately created the cancer that killed his mother. Ego's pet empath Mantis (Pom Klementieff), who can feel emotions from touching a person, has grown close to Drax, she warns him, Gamora and Nebula of Ego's plan, then Rocket, Yondu, Groot and Kraglin arrive. The reunited Guardians reach the planet core, where Ego's brain is housed, they also fight off Sovereign drones, Rocket creates a bomb from the stolen bomb and instructs Groot to plant it on Ego's brain, while Quill battle Ego with his newfound Celestial capabilities, allowing the Guardians to escape. The bomb explodes, killing Ego and causing the planet to disintegrate, Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill, he realises Yondu spared him as a child from the fate of Ego's other offspring, he was Quill's true ""daddy"". In the end, Gamora and Nebula reconcile, but Nebula still chooses to set out to find and kill Thanos, a funeral is held for Yondu, attended by dozens of Ravager ships, while the Guardians set out to continue their protection of the galaxy; Groot is growing back to normal size, being a bratty teenager; Ayesha has created a new artificial being, named Adam, to destroy the Guardians. Also starring Sylvester Stallone as Stakar Ogord, Tommy Flanagan as Tullk, Farscape's Ben Browder as Sovereign Admiral, Rob Zombie as Unseen Ravager, Gregg Henry as Grandpa Quill, Seth Green as Howard the Duck, Ving Rhames as Charlie-27, Michelle Yeoh as Aleta Ogord, Miley Cyrus as Mainframe, David Hasselhoff and Stan Lee as Astronaut. Pratt is still a wisecracking hero with ""Awesome Mix"" cassette tapes, but he also gets to be vulnerable, Saldana as the green-skinned warrior is still cool, fuzzy fast-talking sidekick Cooper is still fun, along with Diesel as the now younger walking tree partner who only says ""I am Groot"", Russell is a good choice as the father with a dark agenda, and there is good support from Gillan and Rooker. The plot is pretty easy to follow, the lead hero finds their origins, only to find out later his father has plans for galactic domination, the high octane chase and fight sequences, and CGI and makeup special effects are most impressive, and the soundtrack of more ""awesome"" songs is great, including ""Mr. Blue Sky"" - Electric Light Orchestra, ""The Chain"" - Fleetwood Mac, ""Bring It on Home to Me"" - Sam Cooke and ""Father and Son"" - Cat Stevens, a really enjoyable, fun science-fiction action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Very good!"

'Friggin' only he didn't say 'friggin' is Disney's way of showing they are getting liberal in their language. 'Dick, penis and a couple other words thrown in. Boring. All the computer graphics. Computergasming the entire flick. So, many movies are like watching a samo samo computer game. Violence, terrible dialogue, lame songs. The movie all looked and sounded the same to me. Killing and blasts of color."

","I can't seem to find a way to care about this story. The characters have no chemistry, maybe because they don't really care for the story either. The movie is very clich√©' and the effort at poking fun at itself seems tired and weak. I stopped watching halfway 'cause seriously, who really cares where the whole father-son bullsh*t is going?

"Sci-FiHorrorFan","9","1","4","13 August 2017"," I thought swords were your thing and guns were mine but I guess we're both doing guns now I just didn't know that.
","This was a Fun movie and I liked it but I do like the first movie more. I thought the comedy in this movie was pretty good and I like all of the main characters. The film has some very funny lines of dialogue.I loved the line Chris Pratt used about the guns and swords and it was funny to me because he said it in such a dry way.I think it was the way he said it that made it funny. There were also some nipple jokes at the start of the film which I will admit I found funny.I especially enjoyed the scene when Rocket Raccoon makes fun of Drax, that scene had me laughing my head off. I also laughed my head off at the scene where Drax is laughing at Peter Quill because he finds out he has a crush on Gamora. I don't know what it is but Drax just has this way of cracking me up. I thought the baby Groot was a cute new addition to the team and I laughed my head off at the scene where rocket raccoon tells Groot not to press the button and then he goes to push it anyway.I thought that was a classic scene.I also liked the scene where the Raccoon calls out to his friends who are busy fighting the bad guy to get him some tape so he can cover up the button so baby Groot doesn't push it, and none of them has any tape so he asks them for duct tape instead and none of them has any duct tape either and I love how the raccoon yells out not one single person has tape! I don't believe this!. That scene was hilarious comedy gold in my opinion.<br/><br/>I'm surprised some people find this movie disappointing because I didn't feel that way at all.I will admit the story may not be as Great as the story in the first movie but the Action scenes are still very good and the characters are all likable and funny and they have good chemistry together much like they did in the first movie. I don't see much wrong with the movie I thought it was fun and funny and the special effects were fantastic! And Rocket Raccoon was a BadAss in this movie!.<br/><br/>The only problem I had was the story it wasn't as interesting as the story in the first movie but that didn't subtract from my enjoyment of the movie at all. The movie is still Fun and Action packed and the movie has great visuals that I found captivating. I also liked the new female character Mantis that is part of the guardians of the galaxy team I thought she was kind of cute for an alien and I thought she was very likable. It was also interesting to see Nebula again who was a villain in the first movie. It was also good to see Kurt Russell and Michael Rooker in the movie too.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked about the movie was the emotion that was added in. There were times when it was funny but there were other times when more emotion and seriousness was added and I thought the movie had the right mixture of both things. Despite the emotion that was added the director was still able to keep the movie Fun and interesting. I thought James Gunn did a good job directing and all of the actors were good in their acting too.<br/><br/>Frankly I don't understand the hate for Marvel films because they are so much Fun to watch! And the Action scenes are outstanding! And well done!. I guess marvel haters don't like Action which is too bad because this movie is full of good action scenes! And the gadgets that the guardians fight with are pretty cool too. Marvel has a pretty good track record when it comes to their movies and I enjoy most of them and if people enjoyed the majority of previous marvel movies then I recommend this one, This is a very good movie!."
"TopDawgCritic","10","1","4","13 July 2017"," This sequel is just as good!
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1. was a real hit for me in every way possible, especially the characters and particularly Chris Pratt. I really felt there would be no way to top that one. I was sort of right... Vol 2 didn't top it, but is equally just as good!<br/><br/>The main reason is that they chose a slightly different path, but kept the same amazing directing and writing by James Gunn, the outstanding VFX with great action and comedy that made the first one so great. The only difference was more of a character build-up of Peter Quill's past about his mother and newly discovered father played by Kurt Russell. It was also a treat to see Sylvester Stallone in this film.<br/><br/>It's a perfect 10/10 form me, just like the first film!"
"spencergrande6","8","1","4","4 July 2017"," Even better than the first
","Even better than the first. It's even funnier for starters, more colorful and eclectic, but more importantly it has a more character- driven plot -- everyone is given something to do and each individual sub-plot is special in its own way.<br/><br/>Yondu comes out of nowhere to steal the show from everyone else. Michael Rooker does a lot with a single posture and look (see -- him standing in the brothel window) that helps to solidify his place within this Galaxy as more than just another aspect of the plot. And of course his Mary Poppins line absolutely killed.<br/><br/>It's pretty amazing how big this cast gets here, and how the film somehow finds a way of balancing every storyline. I think a lack of a big special effects driven middle helped out a bunch there, and made the ending battle that much more special -- for once it mattered and didn't just feel like another inevitable step on the boilerplate template.<br/><br/>Some of the criticism I've heard surrounding this movie, especially from what I would have considered ""hardcore"" fans of the original, has to do with how this one just felt like an ""episode"" and that it didn't matter in the grand scheme of things. I took that mean -- oh no there were character archs and personal growth and the MCU and its Infinity War wasn't furthered in any substantial way. Does anyone really care that much? These characters have solidified themselves so much more in the canon of this universe. And these people also love ""Star Wars"", and you know, every one of those is an episode and the second part of that is mostly character so...man I really hope that isn't the consensus on this one."
"Mike_Devine","6","1","4","4 July 2017"," Second time's not the charm for 'Guardians'
","On the heels of the ultra-successful Disney/Marvel offering 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' the studios have followed up with another action/comedy slugfest in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' The film is not as original as the first, but it builds on a lot of the elements that fans loved - namely the characters themselves.<br/><br/>Of course, we get to see the core group of Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) in action, and a few additional faces we recognize from the original get more screen time (especially Nebula and Yondu). We also get to know the biological father of Quill (played by Kurt Russell), who is a pretty gregarious character and serves as a foil for Quill himself. This father/son relationships is the primary focus of the film and helps elevate the story line to give it a bit more substance than a sequel of this kind normally would.<br/><br/>While there are a lot of instances where we've ""seen this, seen that"" littered throughout 'Vol 2,' especially the comedic banter between the crew and the crazy acrobatic CGI stunts, we get to see a little bit more character development here, which adds a nice balance compared to the first film. This includes the relationship between renegade sisters Gamora and Nebula, which is a case of sibling rivalry gone awry. Despite these improvements, it's fair to say 'Vol. 2' is basically on the same level as the predecessor. This includes the signature soundtrack that has defined the franchise.<br/><br/>'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is not the best Marvel effort by a long shot, but it's a sign that there is a healthy pipeline of films in the works."

"Aaron1375","10","1","4","30 May 2017"," The Guardians of the Galaxy are back because the galaxy is once again in peril
","I rarely watch trailers or anything anymore on upcoming films due to the fact I watch very little television these days and I find a lot of trailers give away too many things so I was not sure what to expect from the second Guardians film. I really enjoyed the first film and I am happy to report that I really enjoyed the second film too. In fact, I would have to say I enjoyed this one just a bit more than the first film due to the fact that the first film was more of an origin tale, while this one the Guardians were together right from the get go. I enjoy seeing them do their thing as every member is unique and amusing in their own way. The actors and actresses also do a phenomenal job of portraying the makeshift team of outlaws/superheroes. The villain of the piece is cool too when you take into account of what he truly is, I will not go into any detail here, but any Marvel fan would know what he is called in the comics.<br/><br/>The story has the Guardians at the beginning of the film protecting some sort of energy devices from some sort of interstellar creature as baby Groot dances through the opening credits. After the team fights off the foe they proceed to collect their payment from a race of very pretentious gold people in the form of Gamora's sister Nebula who has quite a bounty on her head. Well, Rocket proceeds to insult the gold people and also steals the very batteries they were hired to protect. After a space battle that ends with the Guardians crashing on a planet, they encounter a man claiming to be Starlord's father. Starlord, Gamora and Drax accompany this man and his companion Mantis to Ego's (Starlord's dad) planet where this man tries to be Starlord's dad, while Rocket and Groot watch over Nebula. Unfortunately, soon an old friend comes to find the Guardians in the form of Yondu and his band of pirates. There is also something strange about Starlord's dad that Gamora does not trust.<br/><br/>Really good film, like I said what makes it so good is the characters and the actors and actresses portraying them. There really is not a weak link among them. I could not even tell you my favorite as they all bring their 'A' game to the table. I enjoyed the expanded roles of Nebula and Yondu and I like how Gamora and Nebula are so awesome at fighting and are trying to kill each other, but in the end they are almost like typical sisters! I like the wisecracking Rocket who kind of got them all in the mess by stealing the batteries and Drax and his strange oblivious ways is always good for a laugh. Kurt Russel does a good job as Starlord's dad too. I had heard Sylvester Stallone was in the film, but his part was a bit minuscule, I am thinking that maybe it will be expanded in the next film.<br/><br/>So, yes, I enjoyed this film immensely. Like the first movie there is just a good mixture of heart, action and humor to appeal to me. Took me awhile to finally see it too, mainly due to the fact my fianc√© really wanted to see it, but she passed away so it also made me sad as well. She would have enjoyed it too, I know as she would have absolutely loved Baby Groot. If you do see it, be prepared for not one, not two, not three, not four but five scenes during and after the credits."
"princesskec","5","1","4","19 May 2017"," Good, but could of been better.
","I absolutely loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy, it was witty, interesting, and had one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. So walking into the second film I had high hopes. Sadly I was let down. The plot was lacking, there was a lot of ""serious"" moments in ridiculous times and unnecessary character development with Rocket, trying to make him have more complex feelings than needed. Also they built up all this stuff with his dad only to be defeated easily. I feel as this movie could have been condensed to 30 minutes, and probably was just made to show you how they get to the next movie. Having said that, there was still funny moments, and some really cool action scenes like the first movie. Also the soundtrack was still very good as well as the CGI used to make space."
"rajacs","7","1","4","19 May 2017"," Good to watch.

"alfCycle","7","1","4","15 May 2017"," Lots of fun, not quite as good as the original
","This movie is a lot of fun. It brings back most of the things that made the first film so enjoyable, including lovable characters, great humor, action and amazing music. I would say that this sequel probably has even more humor and laugh out loud moments than the first. Also, baby Groot just puts a smile on your face every second he's on the screen. However, parts of the movie just seemed a bit too overblown and it felt like it was maybe 10 minutes too long. I'm all for long movies, but that third act just seemed to go on a bit longer than it needed to and the non-stop barrage of special effects action was kind of exhausting by the end. At least that's the feeling I got while watching. Maybe that would change on a second viewing. Anyway, I did enjoy this movie a lot, but it didn't quite stand up to the overall experience of the original.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>************SPOILERS************<br/><br/>Recommended for those that enjoy more of K-Billy's super sounds of the 70's, hot shot renegade smart alecks with big hearts, planets with big brains, daddy issues, sibling rivalries, complicated family trees, green is the new black, gold is the new white, literal interpretations of the spoken word, emotionally unstable talking space rodents, dancing baby talking space plants, robo-space-hookers, man/planet hybrids, this is your life mannequin reenactments... <br/><br/>...but that's just like, my opinion, man<br/><br/># Of Times Watched: Once"
"daddyxj-1","7","1","4","14 May 2017"," Vol.2 is a Mix Tape
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a mix tape of the good and the bad. The movie was decent overall but the move had a sadness going through it that felt out of place and just not what I (and I think Audiences) are going to look for. So when I say this is a mix tape it's not really so much the movie, it's how you feel about it after you watch it. You don't really know if you enjoyed it or were disappointed that you really didn't get what you expected.<br/><br/>OK so what I like about it... effects, production design, action and the humor (sort of). The look of this film is like a Christmas tree full of color and blinking lights. The images pop and made me think any frame in this movie I could pause and use it as a wallpaper on my computer. Lots of CGI but good CGI that gave the movie a very beautiful Sci-Fi look I liked a lot. (There is even an alien made of crystal that was cool). And the look of Ego's planet is worthy of an Oscar production design nomination. The best action sequence was almost reminiscent of the best action sequence in the Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and was very fun to watch. And the humor ....well it wasn't the jokes that were spoken it was the visual humor that made me laugh out load. The vocal jokes spoken by Drax were very bland and Rockets jokes seemed forced. And the banter between the characters got kinda annoying.<br/><br/>Now what I didn't like. The Story...It took most of the movie before you realize ""oh OK this IS the story"". To me, it felt like the whole movie was a set up for the climax. You're led into a series of sequences that are caused by the characters that you think are set- ups for the real story but nope they are the story. Even though the scenes are entertaining you can't help but think ""ok can we get past this and get on with the story"". And see that is where I'm mixed at...The Is a Character Driven Action Sci-fi Film! and I put the emphasis on Character. There is so much character building in this film that you now know your heroes better than you did in the first film and that is the point of the movie. We keep preaching as movie goers how much we want quality in the movies we pay a ticket to see then when we get it we dislike it...at first (for me personally: Alien 3, The Empire Strikes Back, Spiderman 2). I think I will like this film a lot better when I see it again because now I can watch it for what it is and not what I expect.<br/><br/>Like I said This is a Mix Tape but not a bad mix tape. I think if you go in not expecting to see a rehash of the first film you will be pleasantly surprised. BUT Vol. 3 better bring it, lol!"
"mb1456","7","1","4","11 May 2017"," A Noisy Entertainer
","It's a good action movie with beautiful special effects that hold your attention from start to the end. But although it has racy action, at times I felt it needed more drama or stillness(that way I liked the predecessor) than more of zip, zap, zoom! But this movie is laced with more humor when compared to the previous one and therefore made it quite watchable for me. All the lead actors are good but my favorite performance would be Karen Gillan as Nebula, she's very expressive and also Michael Rooker as Yondu. In one or two scenes, I felt Chris Pratt looked quite aged(I felt it was the makeup), they could have gone easy on the close up shots. Verdict - a bit too noisy for me but still fun and bam bam action, you could like it."
"matthewssilverhammer","7","1","4","10 May 2017"," I Can't Stop This Feeling Deep Inside of Me. Guardians, You Just Don't Realize What You Do To Me
","Guardians¬ÖVol. 2 will definitely please fans of the first film (i.e. basically everyone) in the irreverent space-saga. Sure, it's bigger spectacled and deeper themed, but its real strength lies in its smaller moments of character and humor. In fact, when the words being spoken aren't jokes, corny exposition and telegraphed subtext sneak to the surface (""Sometimes we don't realize what we need is right there all along.""). Thankfully, director Gunn deftly redeems each less-than-stellar story moment with cheeky jokes and surprising humanity. If the first was New Hope, then Vol. 2 is Empire, as we find Starlord (Pratt) dealing with his own daddy issues (Russell), as the universe at large is fighting a bigger (though possibly related) battle. The action scenes have cinematic flair and dramatic heft, but the charm is still 100% dependent upon its tongue being so firmly placed in its cheek in subversive and unexpected ways. The music is a smile-inducing mix of 70s and 80s power pop, Rocket is still drolly hot-headed, Drax is still hilariously literal, Baby Groot is adorably violent, and new addition Mantis fits in snugly. So why isn't this consider among Marvel's best for me? Well, as a longtime Marvel Studios zombie, I hate to admit it, but these MCU outings are finally starting to feel a bit same-y. Lots of parental problems, brightly colored CGI, a standard build in impressive action scenes to a final with the Big Boss, all punctured with good-natured humor. Luckily, the formula is a good one, and with Guardians, what it lacks in dramatic intrigue, it makes up for with irreverence for its own seriousness, helping it stand out from the larger superhero pack."
"sc_mackinnon","6","1","4","9 May 2017"," Like most movie sequels before it...
","This movie leaves you wanting. Yes, the characters we've all grown to love are back, but any real dialogue and interaction are dampened by 2 things: *** too many frickin' crashes and explosions ***!! They really got in the way!Towards the end, I actually found them to be distracting. Add to it a lean plot, and too much weepy 'we're family' whining; those things really dragged on the movie. I found 2 additional things to be pointless. The first was killing off Yondu. Why?? The character added much to the first movie! He was wasted in this one. Second...what the hell was Sylvester Stallone doing in this movie?! Dumb. Overall, the movie tried a bit too hard. But, I wouldn't go do far as to say 'skip it'."
"eagandersongil","7","1","4","6 May 2017"," All less than the first. Less groot
","One of the greatest merits of guardians of the galaxy is not to get serious, it makes it less silly, incredible as it may seem, its whole mood is turned to humor, we have a movie where the characters call themselves family after 2 great adventures , And not after 20 minutes of film, we have well-built characters and a very reasonable plot, although everything in the film is a bit less than the first. Telling the story of the quintet of guardians, the script follows the clich√© of all the films of heroes, but also features some very interesting dramas and sub-plots, which makes it stand out a bit, the film is not completely generic and its minor scope , Of course, that in the whole is common, but ""Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 ""is a silly film but at the same time passes all seriousness at the right point, his script is good, fun, comic, clich√© and at the same time different, because his greatest success is to develop the mood of the characters situations, because in question Of history is weak and even forced. Technically the film is very well done, its action scenes are great, although well computerized, its effects do not let it transpire, its makeup is great and the assembly is good, we even have a risky sequence in the film, its soundtrack follows with songs Very good, but without a hit that is the face of the film as in the first, and his rhythm has problems, however fun it is, it tires at a certain moment, something that does not happen with the first. We have to highlight the wide range of actors of name that participated in the film, such as Kurt Russel and Stalone, but even so, there is nothing to be highlighted in terms of acting, except the fluffy Groot that steals the scene whenever it participates . Finally, ""Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 ""is an extremely entertaining film, full of problems, but with one more thing."

","When I watched Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014, I couldn't imagine it would be one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen. It was so funny, inventive, original and packed with memorable characters, I just loved it. So, as you can imagine, I was really excited to see the sequel. Did Vol. 2 match my expectations? Hum, not exactly. It could have been much worse but it should have been much better. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is more like Age of Ultron or Iron Man 2 than The Winter Soldier or The Empire Strikes Back. Let's analyze it: <br/><br/>PROS: <br/><br/><ul><li>The opening sequence: it perfectly captures the spirit of the first Guardians. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The soundtrack: it's okay, it fits into the movie, although it's not near as memorable or as good as Vol. 1.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The visuals: stunning. The cinematography and special effects are definitely better this time around. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Baby Groot: you can't hate him. Every time he's on screen you can't take your eyes off him. He has 3 funny moments, but I felt he could (and should) have been used a lot more. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The characters: We learn new, surprising things about some of them. That helps us to understand and even sympathize more with them.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The action scenes: they're good, not incredible, original or memorable, just entertaining (even though there is very, I mean very, VERY little physical fights and a lot of spaceship battles).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Surprises: there are compelling plot twists (but none of them are particularly original), there are some great cameos and fun post-credit scenes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The acting: just like the in first movie, is amazing. Everybody fits their roles perfectly.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Mantis: a good addition. She's a funny and interesting character, but I don't see anybody after this movie saying ""Mantis is my favorite character of Guardians of the Galaxy"".</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is a sequence with Yondu, Rocket and Baby Groot that is just incredible. One of the best moments in the whole MCU for sure. I just loved it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There are some heartfelt and touching moments.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The movie is never boring.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It's great so see the characters we loved in the first movie back. As usual, their interactions are fun to watch.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The 3D: good, although unnecessary.</li></ul><br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/><ul><li>Unfocused story line: The movie takes a long time to really start; there is too much characters and too much going on at the same time.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ego: I was expecting much more. Kurt Russell is fine, but I can see this role been played by any other decent actor. The character is much more a Living Exposition than a Living Planet.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The villain(s): weak and forgettable, just like 95% of the villains of the MCU.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A lot of forced humor: the original had it but this time there is even more. Vol. 2 is funny but the original is much much more.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lack of originality: this time, almost nothing feels fresh, memorable or inventive.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The main characters evolved very little compared to the original and most of them are given nothing to do during most part of the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There's not enough tension or excitement.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is not as good as the original or the best MCU movie ever, but it's a satisfying follow up. It has some misses but more hits. It didn't let me crazy to see Volume 3 or increased my excitement for Infinity War, but it was a fun ride. Just don't go see it with crazy expectations because otherwise you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a good time at the movies, this is the movie you should see.<br/><br/>PS.: You don't have to watch every single MCU movie to understand Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Watch only the first Guardians, that's enough."

","Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2 is a beautiful concoction of a great soundtrack, engaging story line and a well chosen cast. <br/><br/>I believe this film is one of Marvel's better projects along with the likes of the hugely successful Captain America: Winter Soldier.

","Reviews are not something I normally do, but, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 was worth the keyboard time. It starts as it continues, plenty of humour, plenty of action, plenty of mystery. The Sci-Fi as you would imagine, is unreal. The cuteness of baby Groot can not go unnoticed in this epic blockbuster. His scenes are among the best in the 2+ hours I spent glued to the screen. Marvel have done it again ladies and gentlemen, this movie does exactly what was promised. ""Does what it says on the tin"". Very pleasantly surprised, and enjoyed it throughout."
"srdjan_veljkovic","6","1","4","30 April 2017"," It's OK, but not as good as the first one
","There are quite a few nice things about this movie. Baby Groot is cute. Do watch through the credits to see a great Teenage Groot ""cameo"". :)<br/><br/>There are a lot of other good jokes. It tries something different, which is very refreshing in the time of remakes, reboots and rehashes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's not as fun as the first one. Some of it is by design, the stories here are very sad, the two main ones both having to do with Star Lord's father figures. But, it's much more than that. The characters are simply not having so much fun even for the parts that they're supposed/expected to have fun in, and we, as the audience, follow.<br/><br/>Also, the movie doesn't hold together as good as the first one. It feels like ""Saturday Night Live in Space"", with a touch of sad family drama.<br/><br/>The idea of casting Kurt Russel as the villain was interesting, but didn't work out. Such casting ""against character"" was done before with success, but here it fails. It's partly because the character is silly. It's not the basic idea of a living planet that's the problem (hey, it's a comic book movie!), but, what it does, how it does it...<br/><br/>FWIW, the main villain of the first movie, though all he did was go around and say ""I accuse!"" was better (in the context of such a movie, of course).<br/><br/>Though one does feel disappointed after watching it, one also feels that it's OK, sometimes things just don't work out. As far as modern movies go, comic book ones especially, this is a good one."

","I was very excited to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 because the first one is my favourite Marvel movie.<br/><br/>I was really satisfied with the end product because it is a very fun blockbuster movie and I expected it to be nothing else.<br/><br/>I was laughing throughout most of the running-time of the film and was having a lot of fun with the characters and action scenes. Many characters are much more developed in this film (specially Yondu, who was f*cking bad*ss).<br/><br/>I of course loved the soundtrack (although not as good as the first one). I also have to give credit for the style of the film, because most marvel films don't look colorful or alive. This one had a great color palette and the use of a new camera improved the film in my opinion.<br/><br/>Some of the ideas of the film are very cool and it is not afraid to make bold choices (which differs to some other marvel movies).<br/><br/>I really don't know what to think of the score because it was very present throughout the film and it kind of spoiled some scenes (for example, someone is saying something and the music turns really evil and you get the scene kind of spoiled in that way).<br/><br/>Now lets move into some negatives. There were more than a few times when you could clearly notice the Green Screen, it looked kind of cheap.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the film is its script, which is filled with TONS and TONS of exposition which is never good. There was a time in which you felt you were taking a Marvel Lore Class.<br/><br/>There were also some very cheesy lines that ruined some scenes. Also, at one point the crew is divided and you jump back and forth between the two scenarios. One is clearly much more fun than the other one and you just want to go back to that one instead of watching the other one.<br/><br/>In the end, I got what I expected. A fun summer movie that will make you laugh and hunt for Easter eggs while giving you a good time."

","I loved Vol. 1, and while I didn't love 2, I really liked it. I even shed a tear or two. Rocket and Groot were fun as always, but my favorite scenes were between Mantis and Drax. The only real disappointment for me was the soundtrack. I walked out of the first Guardians movie buying the soundtrack on iTunes before I even got to my car. It's still one of my favorite movie soundtracks. This time around, I didn't even contemplate buying one song from Vol. 2."
"tysonwong","9","1","5","31 May 2017"," What an excellent movie (NOTE: SPOILERS AHEAD)
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is just as good as the first one but for different reasons. First of all, everything that was good about the first film (e.g. the humour, the relationships of the characters, its music) is here. For the first half hour, baby Groot steals the film with his dancing at the start of the film, offering a distraction to a battle the Guardians are having with a monster, or eating sweets on a fast moving ship. Michael Rooker is also great in an expanded role as Yondu. All the characters seem to enjoy themselves for the first half of the film.<br/><br/>However, all films need a villain and the film offered two characters who could have been the main villain but neither of them was. In fact, the main villain was Ego, Peter's father, which was highly unexpected but did work quite well and when a major character died, it was fairly sad but he/she will probably come back."

Strap yourselves in because we're going on a thrill ride.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 offers a more relaxed movie than the first and took a more casual and laid back route. It started off a bit slow and almost felt at times like you were watching a sitcom while hanging out with the coolest people in the universe, but wondered where it was going, but once it did it was a thrill ride to the end. <br/><br/>One thing that Vol.2 needed to solve was the villain, as the villain in the first movie was a bit generic and didn't have many traits. I'm pleased to say though that Vol.2 did solve this problem with Kurt Russell making an outstanding villain proving that not all bad guys wear dark capes. <br/><br/>Visually it was stunning (I just love the retro feel which can appeal to all audiences both young and old) and the CGI was immaculate and somehow the Guardians can say a joke that I otherwise would find a bit lame but just works in this movie! And don't get me started on the music... I'll leave that there! <br/><br/>Overall Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is slick and stylish movie that will be the most fun you'd have had in the cinema for a long time!"

","The film was OK. I mean, the far off 3D shots were something fresh, the acting was good, the production values were good. Yet I could see right off the bat that something was off. You know when something is off where everything in the plot is related to family (pardon the pun): it means no more ideas.<br/><br/>While Guardians 1 was fresh and unexpectedly good, the sequel took the subtleties out and enhanced everything else: special effects, family drama, toilet humor and above all, spin off seeds. That's how you get dialogues like ""Ow, my nipples"" and ""We're not friends, we're family!"" (which could only have worked as a parody of Fast and Furious).<br/><br/>So instead of exploring strange new worlds, we again collapse the entire story to the dynastic relations between a few characters: Quill's dad(s), Gamora's sister, Nebula's dad, Rocket's similar other, Yondu's surrogate dad, and so on, while everything else is just pow pow, pew pew! and some really pathetic jokes. They even added a new member that feels and sometimes manipulates emotions. Oh no! Not Deana Troy!<br/><br/>By the end I was tired of childhood trauma's expositions and group therapy like teary embraces. Stuff is not supposed to make total sense in a Marvel story, but they went so overboard that I couldn't care anymore. And no, I am not excited about the Ravagers spin off (or tip of the hat to the 60s Guardians from the comics), the Adam Warlock spin off, the Stan Lee spin off or any of this crap. They only needed to make Guardians 2 as good as the first. They failed."

","I am not a big Marvel fan. I know, i know, Americans take their comic books as well as comic adaptations pretty serious, but i'm European and to be honest I've never read them. So I basically know them from cartoons and movies. But I'm a movie fan and I can see that Marvel is doing a good job regarding it's cinematic universe. Although i personally favor a more dark and serious tone in movies most of the time. The light entertainment often floats by, except it's as hilarious as a Scott Pilgrim or nearly everything Matthew Vaughn has done. And the universe of Guardians of the Galaxy also falls under this category, why i genuinely liked it.<br/><br/>And without further ado, that also applies to the second part. Yeah, the story is a little bit less interesting, the soundtrack a little bit less great and the action scenes a little more stupid, but i'ts still a hell of a ride. Easily the best part of the movie are the likable and interesting characters as well as their relationships. And director James Gunn knows how to use this in the best way possible.<br/><br/>I can only say, please give us more of this and don't mess it up by adding them to the rest of the MCU. Please don't!"

"samyoung-82648","8","1","5","12 May 2017"," More enjoyable than GoG Vol 1
","My expectations weren't too high after GoG. The series is a love letter to pop culture with an extra dash of retro thrown in. However, GoG Vol 2 managed to add some heart and made you want to care about the characters.<br/><br/>Zoe Saldana was the dark horse of this movie. She always plays a stereotypical female ninja warrior that people roll their eyes at. However, in GoG2, she finally grew up (despite not being able to stop shouting as she always does) and she finally started acting. Chris Pratt was good, but just can't quite pull off the emotional scenes. Elizabeth Debicki took her role a little too seriously and almost managed to ruin what could have been the first female idiot in the whole Marvel genre (and rest assured, we are getting tired of flawless females - are there that many people with glass egos?). By contrast, Chris Sullivan played an excellent male idiot as Taserface. The biggest letdown for me was Kurt Russell as the stereotypical 1 dimensional villain with no real purpose.<br/><br/>The movie retained its good humour. The characters largely played off one another to great effect and humour. The pacing and special effects were excellent. If it hadn't been for the one sexist line ""there are many little girls out there"" (echoing similar sexism from Hillary Clinton), the movie may have managed to pull off a little more heart. Adding blatant sexist politics at the crescendo of your emotional scene creates a somewhat underwhelming anti-climax.<br/><br/>Definitely a solid film. Worth seeing. It looks like Marvel are steering characters away from the arrogance and ridiculousness of characters like Black Window, and it's about time. We just need to add a half-decent flawed female character. Maybe next time."

It was on cable a couple of times and I was only able to glance at it.<br/><br/>The trailer to Volume 2 was excellent and made me want to see it. I was lucky to see the film on its opening day in Tokyo.<br/><br/>People were laughing and crying. It's a long while since I've enjoyed a film so much in the cinema. <br/><br/>Some of the dialogue could have been better, but the great chemistry between the cast, the motivation of each character was so well conceived. I just forgot about everyday life.<br/><br/>The attention to detail was excellent. From props to individual makeup. <br/><br/>I wish I had clapped my hands as well but some people burst into applause. <br/><br/>Refreshing. Totally refreshing. In spite of being CGI characters, Baby Groot and Rocket felt as real as any other character. Rocket, in fact, is kind of sexy... which is a very strange thing to say.<br/><br/>""There's a difference between being a father and a dad.""<br/><br/>What a beautiful sentiment.<br/><br/>The use of Fleetwood Mac's song was excellent.<br/><br/>Original and inventive.

"pailoong","6","1","5","10 May 2017"," Has its moments, but its uneven tone makes it hard to enjoy
","Let me start by saying that I, like many others, am a fan of the first film. If I'm being truly honest, I'm a big fan of the MCU as a whole. I eagerly await the next installment in the series and this film was no exception. That's why I left the theater kind of disappointed. I was expecting a different film from the first (in fact, I detest blatant rehashes of previous films such as ""The Force Awakens""). It starts with a battle against a monster wanting to devour some batteries, but instead of seeing the action we get what seems like an eternity of Baby Groot dancing. I felt like I had wandered into a bad kid's film. After some dialogue and space battles the story continues, but then takes an unexpected turn into dark territory when the Ravagers mutiny against Yondu and execute his loyalists by putting them in the airlock and releasing them into space, mocking them as they slowly die in what is revealed to be a mass graveyard of dead, frozen bodies. It was like half the script was written by the writing crew of Veggie Tales and the other half by Frank Miller. The film can't decide if it wants to be cutesy family fun with Baby Groot being front-and-center or if it wants to be dark and gritty, and as such the charm of the previous film is lost. <br/><br/>Another disappointment was the Chris Pratt. He seemed tired, reading his lines like he just woke up from a deep sleep. There were moments here and there when Star Lord shone through the screen in all his sarcastic glory (the scene where he tells Ego about what he wants to create made my sides hurt), but then went back to Ambien Lord. In my opinion, Dave Bautista steals the film as Drax. His raucous laughter, chemistry with the other characters (especially with the cute-beyond-belief Mantis), and his brutal honesty made for the most entertaining moments of the film."
"daddylovesisaac","5","1","5","6 May 2017"," Was OK, kinda sucked tho
","I went with my dad to see this film at the IMAX, and expected it to be good. Which it kinda was, but this film kinda sucked in some ways. Was a little too edgy, despite its cool-style action and 's***' sort of cursing. However,the characters in the film were kind of boring, despite one of the characters (Groot) kept repeating 'I am Groot' over and over. When he was saying it, it sounded a bit like he was actually saying 'I am Gru' as in the villain from Despicable Me. But despite that, I guess it was just part of the little creature's character. There was also another character who was kind of a female villain, she was completely gold but I don't know her name. Anyways, the opening sequence was quite good, there was this monster who wanted to kill them. But there's just something wrong with the ending sequence, the last shot of the film being one of the other characters, Rocket's tears running down his eye. Anyways, this film was good, I just didn't like it that much. I'm not saying the film sucked altogether, it was good but bad in some parts."

","I saw ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"", starring Chris Pratt-Passengers, Jennifer's Body; Zoe Saldana-Columbiana, The Terminal; Dave Bautista- Spectre, Riddick; Kurt Russell-the Fast & the Furious movies, Vanilla Sky; the voice of Bradley Cooper-War Dogs, The Midnight Meat Train and the voice of Vin Diesel-the Fast & the Furious movies, The Pacifier.<br/><br/>This is a sequel to the 2014 comic book movie of the same name-except for the Vol. 2 part-and it carries on in fine form; In fact, I think it's better than the first one-And I really liked the original. It's directed by the same director as the first one, James Gunn and I guess the theme here is Daddy Issues. Chris/Peter Quill/Star-Lord finds out about his biological father, Kurt/Ego-FYI: Any comic book nerds, like myself, will know about the celestial Ego. Zoe/Gamora and her sister both have issues with their father, Thanos, who does not make an appearance here, but he is talked about quite often. Of course, Dave/Drax is hilarious in his interpretation of situations and Bradley/Rocket & Vin/Baby Groot are as delightful to watch as always. I enjoyed the music; still full of familiar classic rock songs and this movie is just filled with cameos-I'll only give you one here, Sylvester Stallone and no, there is not a Tango & Cash reunion. Some of the cameos you will spot right away but I always read the end credits and I saw some that you might miss-some are in group scenes and some just do voices. Stan Lee makes his usual cameo, not once, but twice and Oh yeah, the end credits has 5 scenes! 4 during the end credits and 1 at the very end, so make sure you stay for all of them. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi action and violence, language and sexual situations-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 16 minutes. I definitely enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."

","This time it's about finding your place in the universe and about family. While this installment in the franchise falls short in terms of story than the first one, it retains the humor which made the first film a success with both the audience and the critics. The best quality of the film is that the humor seems almost unintentional, as it should be. The writers have managed to creep in humor even in the most heated scenes, which breaks the intensity to an extent, but still, the humor works like magic. This one of the very few problems the film experiences. You can't help but laugh, but that distracts you from the story a little. It's rather lighthearted.<br/><br/>It's about family this time. That sounds rather Fast and Furious-y, but it is not cringe-worthy as it is in the Fast and Furious franchise. In this film, it is subtly hidden, it is an 'unspoken thing' Also, they don't say 'family' as much as the Fast and Furious folks do. It is not just about Star Lord's family, as one might expect from what has been shown in the trailer. Every single member of the Guardians of the Galaxy has to come to terms with how they are and where they belong. And it's these characters that keep the film together, it's what they are willing to do find those answers that keeps the film going. The story is just the background, but unfortunately, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 cannot be considered to be among the likes of those glorious character-driven films of the past. In his sense, James Gunn reinvents the Marvel Movie once again. This one's not about big explosions and over the top action like all of them are, though there is some action in this film. <br/><br/>We can't truly review Guardians of the Galaxy film, without talking about its music choices. Awesome Mixtape Vol. 2 is not as awesome as Awesome Mixtape Vol. 1, one would find. But that, I think, is an intentional decision made by James Gunn. The first Mixtape was full of Rock, Dance and early Pop music, representing that these young Guardians have not a care in the world except to be awesome, but as time progresses their view of the world, or in this case, the Universe changes. They grow emotions, which they will find, hard to find, and so, they have to express them. They are expressed in this film through the Mixtape Vol. 2, it still has its dancy-ness, but there are also old and slow songs in their which speak of love and relationships. And that is why I think it is intentionally less awesome.<br/><br/>The characters are improved upon what they were in the first film. The only sad part was to find Baby Groot saying 'I'm Groot' in its adorable voice less than I anticipated it to say. Everybody struggles to come to terms with their self, expect Drax, Drax is too cool to be sad for long. Nebula takes Gamora's place to call out the stupidity of the Guardians. Yandu matures in an exceptional way, but he still has that smugness about him. Every character is well executed, which I expected James Gunn wouldn't be able to pull off.<br/><br/>In a line: Marvel has another one in its bag of blockbusters."
"ThomasDrufke","7","1","5","4 May 2017"," Guardians of the Galaxy: Ego Strikes Back
","If there's one thing you can always count on with Marvel Studios, it's the humor. That is, that there will always be tons of it, in whichever project, and however serious they are, there will always be plenty of humor. With some films that doesn't work out so well (I'm looking at you Doctor Strange). With other films it fits in nicely, like Guardians of the Galaxy. It's that humor above all else that keeps Volume 2 afloat.<br/><br/>However, even a series as funny as Guardians can have its bumps and bruises, that includes some mistimed jokes. But I think what hurt this sequel was the uneven pacing. Volume 2 took the Empire Strikes Back approach by spacing out the team for most of the film. This approach proved to be both good and bad for the film. On one hand, it gives us fresh dynamics like with Rocket, (Baby) Groot & Yondu. Or Drax & Mantis. Or Gamora & Peter/Gamora & Nebula. It all plays out as nice character depth for all of them as the group dives deeper into the (Fast and Furious style) fact that they are all the only family each other has. <br/><br/>With that said, spreading out the characters really slows down the pacing. In fact, you don't even really know what the films actually leading to until there's only 25 or 30 minutes left in the movie. Basically, we meet Ego the Living Planet, played by Kurt Russel, who is also Peter Quill's father. Surprise surprise, Ego turns out to be hiding a whole lot more than expected and Peter and the Guardians are forced to take him down. But this all doesn't happen until very late in the game. So much so that the third act feels so incredibly unbalanced since the first hour of the movie doesn't seem to be leading towards this at all.<br/><br/>Luckily, there's a lot about Volume 2 that I was thrilled about. First and foremost, this is the best looking Marvel film to date, without a doubt, bar none. It's the first film to be shot with an 8k resolution camera, called the Red Weapon 8k. Every single shot in this film is oozing with gorgeousness, which is one of the reasons I would like to see the film again. Being that it's one of the few Marvel space opera's, it probably has the most difficult time looking as good as it does. Everything in the background and foreground is fake. Heck, even Groot and Rocket are fake. But you wouldn't know it by looking at it. Perhaps they built some sets, but they couldn't possibly build everything, and it all looks so dang real.<br/><br/>Also, as I previously mentioned, the humor is on point 90 percent of the time. This is probably where James Gunn's brilliance comes in the most, his ability to perfectly time the humor in with the action. It's also pleasing that it's not only spoken humor, there's plenty of physical humor as well. Drax particularly stands out in this regard, as does Mantis, Rocket, and of course Baby Groot. I can complain over and over about some of the pacing issues and how the overall dramatic beats of the film didn't necessarily work for me, but the film is a blast from beginning to end, there's no denying that. But I think it needed a little bit more balance between the drama and comedy if it wanted to pull off some of the third act feats that it tried to, and I think this film could have used a little bit more time with the team together rather than separate.<br/><br/>A few last-minute tidbits to comment on: I could care less about Nebula and Gamora's relationship. There's something about it that just doesn't resonate with me. I have to believe Sylvester Stallone's role will expand in Vol.3 because he got absolutely nothing to do. And lastly, the 5 post credit scenes were probably unnecessary, especially if none of them tied into Infinity War.<br/><br/>+The best-looking Marvel film to date<br/><br/>+I love Drax<br/><br/>+They didn't exploit Baby Groot as much as I expected<br/><br/>+Plenty of great humor<br/><br/>-But the dramatic moments don't always hit<br/><br/>-Serious pacing issues<br/><br/>-Spreading the team out hurt the film<br/><br/>7.6/10"
"domtaylor","8","1","5","1 May 2017"," While it's not as good as it's predecessor, Vol.2 is still an entertaining space adventure with good humour and action that stands as one of the MCU's better films.
","'Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2' is the follow up to 2014's excellent 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. In this sequel all of the main cast return along with writer/director James Gunn who,this time around, penned the script alone. The film catches up with the Guardians several months after the events of the first film and centres around the meeting of Peter's father, Ego.<br/><br/>On the whole this second instalment is extremely fun. It does however lack the charm and surprise of the first film. The characters are all great and are given some decent dialogue that is filled with attempts at humour which sometimes works but unfortunately often falls a little flat. There are only few laugh out loud moments here, unlike in the first film, and a lot of the jokes elicit less than a smirk. That's not to say that the shortcomings of the jokes are a detriment the fun of the feature, though; the overall light tone of the script and the comedic nature of the characters contribute to a constant sense of entertainment. <br/><br/>The cast are all on top form, especially Michael Rooker as Yondu who's character is developed more than in the first feature. Baby Groot surprisingly wasn't overused and didn't take up the majority of the screen time as I expected. The character was fairly good and had some funny moments, although I much preferred the innocence and aggression of Groot in the original film.<br/><br/>One standout aspect of the original film was the retro 70s soundtrack that led the action and emotion and here we get another plethora of classic 70s tunes that accompany the Guardians. While I preferred the utilization of the soundtrack in the first film, 'Awesome mix vol.2' was implemented well into the feature and included some great songs that added to the fun.<br/><br/>The action scenes in this film were all constantly entertaining and felt fun. Gunn once again directed them with style and the witty remarks by the characters during the sequences really added to the fun. The third act did however get a little too big and generic, heavily relying on CGI-fuelled extravagance, but luckily it retains a key focus on character throughout.<br/><br/>The film had an emotional payoff, which really worked and provided some great moments for the characters that we have grown to care about over the course of the two films.<br/><br/>Overall 'Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2'is a thoroughly entertaining film ,that retains a sense of fun and character throughout, that never comes close to being as imaginative and original as it's predecessor. It is a film that has excellent character moments that make you really care for them and provides plenty of joy, even if a lot of the jokes fail to make you laugh as much as the film makers clearly intended. 8/10."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","5","30 April 2017"," Lacks the novelty value of the original but delivers for the fans
","In 2014, the original ""Guardians"" was a surprising hit and, like many others, I was totally won over by its original bunch of characters and fresh tone with rich colours, witty script and zippy action. Three years later, the next outing for these space heroes is again directed and co-written by James Gunn so it is very much a case of back to the future. This sequel does not have the novelty of the initial film but the reprising of style will ensure that it is another massive success. One thing that has changed is that, whereas the first ""Guardians"" was the break-out role for Chris Pratt as Peter Quill (aka Star-Lord), since then he has become a major star with hits like ""Jurassic World"" and Passengers"".<br/><br/>There is a wonderful opening with a background battle between four of our superheroes and a giant squid while - a minor twist on the original lineup - Baby Groot dances to ELO's ""Mr Blue Sky"", the first of a succession of musical tributes to the 1970s. The closing credits provide much more than the traditional single clip of other Marvel movies with a host of textual and visual tit-bits. In between, the action rarely stops with a luscious use of colour for both characters and sets, but for much of the time I had little idea what was going on. I mean: a demi-god called Ego who has trouble sleeping. Rollover, Freud. Best just to enjoy the ride."

","Guardians of the Galaxy starts Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel, and I won't tell you what is about since I did not knew coming in for this movie and it made the experience even better. This is one of the funniest movies of this year and I had a blast. The performances throughout the movie were great, with Chris Pratt showing a lot of emotion. The characters really surprised me, they are really well developed, every character is given a decent enough backstory to really care about them. The chemistry between the main leads was really stellar. The main villain in my opinion is not as good as other Marvel villains, as his motivation is very brushed off. I really liked how now Star-Lord is emotionally engaged with the story and he wasn't just forced into the story. The ending overall really did not surprise me except for one ballsy decision made to a character that I will not spoil, and that it made the ending more emotionally enriched. There is some problems with the script, as a previously stated the ending is somewhat clich√É¬©d and there is a lot of exposition throughout the movie, but the characters are really well developed and they are really likable. I also liked how they included more laughs in the movie and I was constantly laughing a lot throughout the movie. So the script is 50/50 for me. The direction was honestly great as the ways that the action sequences were directed were fantastic and really entertaining. The decisions made at the end really surprised me and I really like how this movie did not have unnecessary connections to Infinity War, like Avengers: Age of Ultron did. The green screen is awful, I would have preferred that they were more practical backgrounds as the green screen is really noticeable and it took me away of some of the scenes. At the end, I had a blast with this movie and this is a great way to make a great summer blockbuster with interesting and convincing characters. 8/10"

"Equalizer16","8","1","5","30 April 2017"," Somewhere between Age of Ultron and Doctor Strange
","The MCU continues by returning one of the greatest things about 2014, but of course facing a great danger, living up to the first one.<br/><br/>We find our mismatched reckless Guardians on a job protecting the high Sovereign from a giant shark squid thing with Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) dancing to Mr Blue Sky creating another iconic musical opening in a more dramatic but fun sequence. From there, our main leader Star Lord (Chris Pratt) gets re-acquainted with his long lost father played very pleasantly by Kurt Russell and as before a whole heap of trouble awaits.<br/><br/>As far as what happens beyond that point is not for me to reveal of course, but it is very hard to explain as the plot doesn't seem to actually choose a direction. I know this is really what should be expected of this half comedy half science fiction adventure but it was something that the first one got. However where Guardians lacks in narrative it heavily makes up for in laughs.<br/><br/>What I believe James Gunn and the rest of his writers and producers have done is basically thought: Wow the fans love that combination of comedy and action, lets just do that classic sequel thing and crank that up to 10. This would usually be a criticism but Guardians 2 gets away with it. Obviously it does not match the magic of the first film, but satisfies very much as a sequel. But the film is not just surface, the film really takes its time to express this meaning of family which is actually really moving and provides more layers and atmosphere to the characters than the first one did. It takes a similar pathway to Star Trek Beyond, story-wise and structurally securing itself as great popcorn entertainment.<br/><br/>Like what the LEGO Batman Movie did, the jokes never stop coming, consisting of many laugh out loud subtle and visible jokes but also a lot of jokes that don't really cause much response and quickly die, but enough for you to most certainly pass the Kermode and Mayo's six laugh test. A little too many laughs particularly coming from Drax in this one.<br/><br/>The entire cast returns with a clear joy and privilege to be there as they each steal minutes of the screen to show off their wacky personalities, from Drax's maniac laughing warrior, to Rocket's quick witted sharp shooting genius. Russell chews up the script in his own manner, but Sylvester Stallone's brief appearance is nothing to get excited about.<br/><br/>Now earlier, as I mentioned the cranking it up to 10, Guardians 2 mostly certainly accomplishes this through its visuals, which create a rainbow themed colour scheme for the galaxy and show off more corners unknown to its audience. The action becomes non-stop as well, with little moments for you to take a breather. During the final act of the film, I do believe I felt the spirit of the comics come alive. But they got to fill that extra 15 minutes with something, which I personally feel they could loose. At times I wanted the film to move pace slightly as the film felt like it was just killing time on several occasions. Certainly never boring but just could move quickly at points. But I shouldn't really complain when a lot of this time is filled to add more layers our characters.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is a very fun and enjoyable time but much louder on its visuals, humor, and action. It would certainly not be disappointing to the Marvel fans, may not be the first film but its not Thor the Dark World (wink wink). 8.4/10"

","Guardians of the Galaxy<br/><br/>Months after saving the world, The Guardians of the Galaxy will do so again. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) located in one of his adventures to his father, Ego (Kurt Russell). He and his team must know if ego is his father or a phony.<br/><br/>Let's start with the actors. It is part of one of the bad things. The proceedings during the movie is not in the film, as well as the interactions between them are very poor or unnecessary. But the character I liked the most was Drax (Dave Bautista). The first was the worst of the film for his performance. But in this film I don't know if your character has improved but I'm better now than in the first. His voice sarcastic, his jokes out of place... words out of place.<br/><br/>The proceedings were not so much because of the effects, good. The effects in the film, the colors are impressive in the film. Especially in the planet Ego, all very beautiful.<br/><br/>The GREAT! Problem that I have with the film, is that the protagonists do not have a clear objective. Already,Star-Lord knows his daddy and must discover who he is. OK, what then? Hence the film creates unnecessary interactions between the main characters with the Drax-Mantis Rocket-Yondu, side effects, and what interested us most was the Gamora-Nebula interaction. This interaction becomes a bit rare, of love and hatred. Returning to the subject of Limbo after meeting the pope of Star-Lord, our heroes are is this ""Limbo"" in that unnecessary interactions were executed. But after that time (which is almost the entire film) The film returns to be moved.<br/><br/>The jokes in the film... In all sides!!<br/><br/>At the post-credits scenes (if they are 5) have a lot of eye...<br/><br/>Infinity War...<br/><br/>Very Funny 8/10"
"jackson-regurge","6","1","5","29 April 2017"," The Guardians 'russell' up a good one!
","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 sees our heroes from the first film reunite with a couple of new characters but with new villains, new discoveries and an awesome new soundtrack! <br/><br/>The acting is good but the tone of the film is very light hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously so it is hard for acting to shine out. Having said this, I thought Kurt Russell's performance was very captivating. <br/><br/>As for the visual effects, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 doesn't disappoint. The film has truly spectacular visuals. The movie also has excellent cinematography which highlights these effects superbly. <br/><br/>Overall, the sequel is not as good as the original. However, this is to be expected as the first is hard to beat. I personally think that the humour was slightly over done. At times it wasn't necessary, but I did laugh a lot and was very thoroughly entertained. I would give the movie 7 out of 10 and I am looking forward to seeing where the franchise goes next."

","Even though I am saying it was an OK movie it's definitely not thanks to the story in the movie. It is clearly and purely commercial. It's only for the money, it doesn't serve a purpose in the MCU. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that it was a bad movie. You will laugh throughout the entire movie just like the first one, you will like the characters even more. The cast gave a stellar performance and the visuals are top-notch. Things bad with it? 1)the story(basically non-existent, as I said before, it does not serve a purpose), 2)the villain. I watched the double bill at the cinema so I watch one after the other. You can definitely see how much better the first one is in comparison to this but it does not mean that this movie is not worth watching. It's definitely worth watching. Enjoy the film!"

"ericstevenson","10","1","6","27 May 2017"," Not as good as the first, but still awesome
","Watching this movie, I felt it was great to have these wonderful characters again and it was even better than I thought it would be! It's probably because it's a movie that just keeps getting better and better. It was weird because I'm so familiar with Marvel Comics given that I've read a lot of the Marvel Encyclopedia. I still find all these new characters I hadn't heard of! The best part is probably always getting introduced to characters that are all relevant to the story with distinct personalities.<br/><br/>It seems like it's become standard to mock the Transformers movies when looking at great action films. Okay, they're making like a dozen of those so it's justified. It was not just a rehash of the original film, but instead a great look at the true origin of the main character. I was somewhat familiar with Ego, but I can't really tell if this is a faithful representation of the character from the comics. The best scene is probably the one with the arrow just hacking through all these guys. The film just looks gorgeous.<br/><br/>It's incredible how we manage to just feast our eyes on these beautiful colors. Everything is so wonderfully detailed and it never comes off as gaudy. The characters are probably even funnier this time around. There's too many memorable lines to count. I love the conversation about how Groot hates hats and how Manti is still beautiful on the inside. One laugh out loud moment was when Gamora said she could just kill him if he (Ego) was evil. Turns out, they do! ****"
"sanjusupercool1","9","1","6","26 May 2017"," Marvel does it again with Guardians 2
","This was a great flick. I liked it even better than the first . Many new characters are introduced and I pretty much liked them all. Mantis was the standout for me. In the first movie i did not like drax much but in this one he was probably the most funniest character. James Gunn loves these characters and i could definitely see it . The conversation between the guardians is great and witty . The movie is very ambitious since it tries to tackle many different subplots and it mostly succeeds . But there are a few instances where it just didn't work for me and that is one of the negatives i have for the movie . Another negative is that the film puts more emphasis on humour rather than action and you are given a hint of this in the opening sequence. And thats about it for the negatives . I had a total blast with this movie . Definitely check it out in the big screen and watch it in 3D . I am not a great fan of 3D but this movie is better is 3D."
"dasant3","6","1","6","10 May 2017"," Entertaining but not as surprisingly good as Vol 1
","Is this movie entertaining? Absolutely. The color-palette is gorgeous. The action is easy to follow. The story is as well. It deepens our understanding of the characters that we met in the first movie. And it's funny. In fact, from the beginning of the movie, we're fed the information that this film is going for fun, laughs and action. It is no surprise, therefore, that that's all we get. A 137 minute (and you better stay for all 137 credits and all, you don't want to miss any of the 5 post credit scenes) romp through 700 galaxies (or at least a few of them) to get to know the meaning of who your family really is.<br/><br/>What was a surprise was that this movie pushed significantly harder against the PG-13 rating than most of the other films. I found some of the violence against bad-guys a little harsh. Additionally, I thought the references to sex-bots, fornication on a universe scale, and the references to a god's (little ""g"") manhood a little out of place, unnecessary even to the overall plot of the film. It seemed the deliberate marketing of Baby-Groot and the ""Disney-fication"" of the MCU would entice 12, 10, perhaps even 8 year old to the seats. I didn't find these to be easily pushed aside for those ages in post-movie discussions. In addition, I thought the reach for sentimentality at the conclusion of the movie, while effective in many ways, lost its edge for me in light of the cantankerous and callous treatment of the above issues by the script and characters within.<br/><br/>I will recommend the film. But I'm a bit disappointed it didn't effectively reach a higher bar standing on the shoulders of its predecessor. It should have in my opinion. And I'm afraid it won't hold up as well to repeat viewings. It's in the top third of the MCU of movies with CA: Winter Soldier, CA: Civil War, Iron Man, and the first GotG. I was kinda hoping it would've been in the top 3."
"shobanchittuprolu","8","1","6","5 May 2017"," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is a perfect sequel with several LoL moments throughout and who cares about the plot when you are part of such awesome team.
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 (2017):<br/><br/>I generally never favor super hero films because of wafer thin plots and clich√É¬©d screenplays but they always comes out as blockbusters because of stunning VFX. Except of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy,the only other super hero film which I loved to my heart is Guardians of the Galaxy.It is the only superhero team which I ever wanted to join as the Guardians team is a perfect fit for me.The entire ridiculous but fun connection among the team members really is a treat to watch and this is the few movies which inspires us that ""Being yourself even in the toughest times eases your stress"". So how is this most anticipated sequel?<br/><br/>Plot:<br/><br/>The film picks up just a couple of months after the end of the last story -- finding the team of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper), and the young, innocent baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) still working out the kinks in their newfound roles as galaxy savers. Unfortunately, one of their employers -- The Sovereign, led by the gold alien Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) -- winds up not having patience for their learning curve, and when Rocket steps out of line, the Guardians find themselves once again on the run.Because Ayesha leads a powerful and large army, this spells big trouble for the titular team, but they wind up getting help from a surprising source. After evading capture and crash landing, they discover that they have been assisted by an alien known as Ego (Kurt Russell) -- an incredibly powerful being whose true form is a living planet... and who is also Peter's biological father. Along with Ego and his odd, empathic assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Peter, Gamora and Drax travel back to the mysterious alien's home world. Meanwhile, Rocket and Groot are left at the crashed ship to watch over the recently-captured Nebula (Karen Gillan), but this turns out to be a challenge after Ayesha puts a bounty on the Guardians, and Yondu (Michael Rooker) and his disgruntled team of Ravagers come to try and collect.<br/><br/>Plus Points:<br/><br/>1)Guardians of the Galaxy team: Forget Avengers and Justice League.Guardians of the Galaxy is the team which everyone wants to join even as a clerk in their spaceship.The entire team is so ridiculously fun that whatever they talk,even in dreadful situations,will make us laugh out loud.Of all the characters,Rocket and Groot,are the most funny and kick-ass characters in the film.Baby Groot is so cute and evoked lot of laughter.Drax is so funny and humane in this film than the previous part. Gamora looked sexier than the first part.Peter Quill is asusal funny and his weird flirting with Gamora is hilarious.Last but not least,(Spoiler Alert) Yondu is like Severus Snape of Harry Potter with an emotion end to his character.<br/><br/>2)Humor: The unique feature which makes this regular super hero movie to be so special is its humor.GOTG is one of the best hilarious movies I had ever seen.All the characters are so hilarious and their witty lines evokes laughter in the hall.Especially the scene where Rocket asks Quill to find a tape,that scene is so funny that it is one of the rare moment where I fell off my seat laughing.There are lot of such hilarious scenes and is a perfect treat for GOTG fans.<br/><br/>3)VFX: As usual,GOTG Vol.2 has stunning visuals with beautiful locations and awestruck action sequences. 3D is brilliant which showcasing immense depth.<br/><br/>Minus Points:<br/><br/>1)Wafer thin Plot: GOTG Vol.2 has less plot which could be well suited as a TV episode but who cares about the plot when you watch GOTG team.<br/><br/>So,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is a perfect sequel with several LoL moments throughout and who cares about the plot when you are part of such awesome team.<br/><br/>My rating 8/10"
"Dannyboi94","8","1","6","1 May 2017"," One of the best MCU sequels!
","I didn't go into this movie with very high expectations, mainly because I was one of them fools who valued a critics opinion beforehand. But I was very surprised once I walked out the cinema. This movie is brilliant, far better than I expected it to be.<br/><br/>Guardians of the Galaxy is my favourite MCU movie, it was funny, mature and visually breathtaking, this film is no different. From the very first scene, we get a look at how the Guardians work with each other, and the chemistry between all the characters is done to absolute perfection. My least favourite character from the first movie, Drax, is now one of the best characters in the entire franchise, he shines in this movie, and has some of the best lines in the film. Also, Baby Groot - just wow. I wasn't expecting them to have handled him so well, he wasn't over the top, or trying to be too funny - he just was!<br/><br/>Like all Marvel movies, this is visually stunning, with incredible blue/green screen effects, some of which are so well done it is hard to believe that most of this film took place in a studio. The make- up, the costumes are brilliantly done. Also the soundtrack, sound and very well directed action scenes.<br/><br/>However, while this film is great, it does have its flaws. Unlike the first movie, this film takes place in either space or one planet. There isn't much going on in this film, aside from Peter getting to meet his father, that's it, with a few other sides things happening. I wasn't overly fond of the Nebula and the Gamora part, I believe it was forced in there, and didn't really add much to the overall story. <br/><br/>But even better than the actual main plot of the story, the best part in the scenes with Yondu, he was incredible in this movie. Not only do we get more time with him, but his character has an emotional arc this time around.<br/><br/>Every character has their time to shine in this film, and each has at least one epic moment. This would have better a better film than the first, if it was not from the rather slow middle-part, and some unnecessary scenes, but it is still one of the best MCU movies, and one of the funniest films of the year so far.<br/><br/>8.2/10"

Roll on number 3!"
"eden-rabatsch","7","1","6","25 April 2017"," Temper expectations, fun but not like the original
","This will be a fairly short review because if you are at all familiar with the first Guardians of the Galaxy or the Marvel Universe, then the characters and actors, directors and writers will be well known.<br/><br/>The second volume explores Peter Quill's/Starlord's parentage and unfortunately as a narrative hook it is a dead end. It requires a huge amount of exposition to set up Ego (Kurt Russell) as the God like father of Peter and the plans he has for his son now he has found him.<br/><br/>The second hook involves a race called The Sovereign who also end up hunting down the Guardians. This is all incredibly messy as the chess pieces are forcibly moved into place to swell out the structure and give us the ending we all want.<br/><br/>The film looks great and all the cast turn up...this was not phoned in. The charisma of the leads and the use of Baby Groot for humour keeps momentum going but it just feels like the wheels spinning faster but going nowhere. I can only assume that Gunn was trapped by requisites in the lead up to the Avengers: Infinity War which restricted what stories he could explore.<br/><br/>My 11 year old son really liked it. It will make a mountainload of money so if you temper expectations it might make for a more fun experience."

But, I did just see the film and with my compulsive need to be IMDb's most prolific reviewer, I decided to contribute yet another review.<br/><br/>The fist portion of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2"" impressed me. In particular, I found myself laughing very often at Drax (Dave Bautista), as he was hilarious and often said the most horrible and inappropriate things. He was, to me, the best thing about the film. As for the rest, it was just fine until about midway through the movie. Then, the plot and what happened after that didn't make a lot of sense (such as multiple baddies suddenly becoming good guys/gals) and instead the picture solely focused on insanely big and explosive special effects. It's as if they were telling you to turn off your brain and enjoy the rest of the film on a very primal level. As for me, I didn't wanna turn off my brain and thought the second half of the film was a HUGE disappointment. The first portion, I'd give an 8 or 9...I really liked it. The second, I'd give a 2 or 3....I really hated it. Overall, 6 seems fair."

","The surprise comic book movie of recent years, has built on its original premise, and provided another slice of fun, frolics, humour and originality. We have a motley crue of intergalactic hired hands who simply can't do anything without some fun and action.<br/><br/>We have here more an equal footing for most of the characters, although that's not to take away from Chris Pratt as the main lead. We have the beautiful Zoe Saldana as Gamora, the lovable big muscled Drax, the wily Rocket and the now adorable Groot. There's around 3 or so different strands of story in this film, and to the credit of all, each interlinks without stepping on each other's toes. Which is quite a feat.<br/><br/>Really, the main crux is the camaraderie amongst our crew. Are they a unit or are they really a family? As they encounter life-threatening situations, they are moving towards the family aspect, and it's just heart-warming.<br/><br/>The whole film is sci-fi, but is wrapped up in a pseudo-retro feel from the early 1980s, and the soundtrack is as big a star in this as in the original.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this space voyage, there are old friends back in this and new ones too, and to my surprise, it's not over crowded, the writers have done so well.

","After Marvel's risky foray with relatively unknown characters and which were at odds with the tone of the films presented so far in its universe, Marvel managed to make ""Guardians of the Galaxy a world pop phenomenon by conquering a resounding box office around the world. , and continuing its shared universe, Marvel Studios again commissioned James Gunn to script and direct this new adventure, with the difficult mission of further expanding this vast Cosmic Universe, and he did it with praise. previous film returned for this sequence, which manages to be bigger and better in several aspects.<br/><br/>The film begins with Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), leader of the Sovereign race, hiring the Guardians to protect valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional monster in exchange for Gamora's sister (Zoe Saldana), Nebula (Karen Gillan), who was caught trying steal them. After Rocky (Bradley Cooper's voice) steals some batteries, the Sovereigns attack the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. These drones are destroyed by a mysterious figure, but the Guardians are forced to fall on a nearby planet. The figure reveals itself as Quill's father, Ego (Kurt Russell).<br/><br/>From there, several side events start to unfold and James Gunn, no longer needing to introduce the heroes, now takes the opportunity to strengthen the relationships between the characters. We can follow Peter's relationship with his previously unknown father, Ego. It is interesting how the relationship between them is built, starting in a way and then gaining new contours as new revelations happen. At the same time there is Peter's passion for Gamora (who is still reluctant to admit his feelings).<br/><br/>It also explores the relationship of hurt from the past, but also of love between the sisters Gamora and Nebula and even the unlikely approach of Rocky and Yondu and the humorous scenes in the relationship between Drax and the new addition to the cast, Mantis (Poe Klementieff ). Not to mention the relationship of love and care that everyone has with Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel), which is nothing more than the baby of the family. We can also not fail to quote Michael Rooker, when we find out a little more about his past, about the reasons that led him not to hand over Peter to his father, the actor helps to fill his eyes with tears until they can no longer hold back. From hateful, Yondu Udonta becomes that guy you really wanted to give a tight hug to.<br/><br/>James Gunn is not concerned with making connections with other Marvel Phase 3 films. He manages to make a film that competently develops his own universe. The visual effects are still incredible. Even though the film is mostly shot in chroma-key, we don't get the feeling of something out of place. On the contrary, the ships and planets visited are different from those seen previously and add even greater complexity to this infinite universe. The planet of the Sovereign race and the planet of Ego are the exponents that reflect this care in the creation of these planets.<br/><br/>Following the same recipe from the previous film, we cannot fail to mention one of the most striking characters in the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films, his soundtrack, which once again features classics from the 70s, with dancing hymns like Brandy (You 're a Fine Girl), Come A Little Bit Closer and Bring It On Home to Me.<br/><br/>""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" matches and even surpasses the first in all aspects. The script is full of humor, which guides all the action. And the jokes work and fit very well in each moment and the technical part stands out and delivers a lot of fun to the viewer. It takes over two hours to fly and leaves us with the feeling that there could be much more."
"bjdeming","2","0","1","9 February 2020"," Disappointing
","All I could think after watching this is that it must take a lot of hard work and skillful direction to make something that so thoroughly undercuts everything that was fun in the first film.<br/><br/>It's a pretty movie. But it's so stupid, and not in a ""comic book"" sense -- in a way that makes you lose your suspension of disbelief. Just a couple of examples: The crash landing on Ego, with two people hanging out of the ship, who aren't injured at all, while the ship is almost totalled; also, SO much exposition. This movie talks to you but it doesn't show you much except CGI and Stark-style wisecracks.<br/><br/>Good points: Nebula, Yondu, and Kraglin are interesting characters -- they each have something of an arc here. And Chris Pratt really nails Peter's emotions in the aftermath of his father's manipulation and then death. Also, that Pacman appearance was wonderful.<br/><br/>And it's a pretty movie, as mentioned. I suppose they had to streamline the Guardians tale to fit it into the larger Marvel Studios architecture. But in doing so, they lost something that really made that first movie a treasure."

"marcigabrielle","9","0","1","31 December 2019"," Why not take the blue pill?
","Excellent movie. I only review the rare ones where I see something I don't see in others, and this one deserves it.<br/><br/>Ego, as the name indicates, is the ultimate ""I, Alone"" story, the brain in a vat, Descartes initial preposition when, all you have to start, is your thought. And Ego creates the world around it. The role of the observer as creator of reality is, now, a pop culture clich√É¬©, almost, due to the popularization of the Double Slit experiment and the strangeness of quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>So here we have a massive Boltzmann Brain, arisen from a sudden entropy dip, floating alone in space, creating a world from the elementary atoms. Of course it could be done, once you have quarks and leptons in theory you can create anything. But here comes the two basic philosophical issues with this movie:<br/><br/>a) the beauty is overwhelming --no other movie comes close, the scenes on Planet Ego leave Naboo in shame. And Ego wants to spread his power, manifested in such beauty, all over the universe: why not take the Blue Pill and live in that reality? Isn't that what religions promise in the end, either a state of union with God in Abramic religions (and that is what Heaven is), or arriving to a sublime state of non-existence, united with the universe, in the Eastern religions (Nirvana, The Ninth Consciousness, Xanadu, etc.).<br/><br/>b) The scientific standard at this point is taking us to a final state of nihilism: universes pop here and there, like some form of White Hole or one of those instantaneous matter/antimatter pairs in the false vacuum full of the dark energy of their annihilations. It's possible our entire multiverse is just part of just bubbles that barely exist for a femtosecond or less --but since we're inside, subject to that tiny bubble's gravity, time is much longer for us, and it seems our multiverse lasts billions of years, when in fact it's gone in an instant to an external observer. Yet, in all our scientific reasoning, we have forgotten some fundamentals --and the Measure Problem in cosmology stands tall. If the universe is supposed to die with rising entropy, how is it possible it ever achieved its initial zero-entropy state to begin with?<br/><br/>There is hope. A sliver of it. We may come not from nothingness, but from something else. We don't know what. But perhaps it's too fast to embrace total nihilism. Perhaps in our rush to get ""red pilled"" we're imbuing our own very human pessimism into the world, and if there are no gods out there guiding our destiny, that doesn't mean there is no destiny at all.<br/><br/>Have we reacted wrong at discovering the lack of the Father? Like Quill, we may have forgotten to consider that which we always have taken for granted. We exist, in some form, even if as an hologram or as a computer simulation, but we do. Isn't that a solid starting point? Why agonize over some ""creator"" who may have been our father, but it's not our daddy?"

","I just watched Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first one, but this one less, so as it's very disjointed, the soundtrack is not as fun and not all of the humour lands. It had too much humour (including long running jokes) just cos everyone loved the humour in the first one, doesn't mean we needed more of it here.<br/><br/>Yondu (Michael Rooker) was by far my favourite character here (he steals this movie). Give us a Yondu movie, Marvel. Kurt Russell is great, (The young CGI Kurt is great) Nebula was great, her scenes with Gamora were good too!! They were Gamora's best scenes. It's Starlords movie (as about 90% of the movie is about him and his Dad) and Pratt is surprisingly subdued.... Maybe because Russell is so charismatic. I really enjoyed the Stan Lee cameo.<br/><br/>Baby Groot is ok but Drax doesn't really do anything except be comic relief which is fine. Rocket who I loved in the first movie is a bit of a idiot here, but he has some good lines here and there. The Gold people were ok at the beginning, but they should have just been left there.<br/><br/>Sly Stallone pops up, and seems very out of place. It's like he is just playing his Toymaker character from Spy Kids 3-D. Although Iike his post credit scene, and would love to see a RAVENGERS movie.<br/><br/>Sadly, despite the fact that I cried at Yondu's death and funeral, I don't think I'll ever feel the need to rewatch this one."

The talking skunk and the tree are less annoying than in the first film, and the story is packed full of action, humour and fun. Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone have their tongues planted firmly in their cheeks and Zoe Saldana is great as the bad-ass Gamora. Not as good as the original - maybe because the soundtrack isn't, it is a touch too long and don't expect it to engage your brain too often - but it is entertaining nonetheless."

It has a better soundtrack, a better story, a better villain in Ego, played brilliantly by none other than 80's icon Kurt Russell. It also has some great vistas that I've never seen before in a space opera. All the sequences on Ego's planet are beautiful to behold, they're literally why the term eye candy was coined. Star Lord's battle with Ego at the end is both fun and heartbreaking at the same time.

","I loved the first movie. Story, musics, acting, effects, jokes everything was good. But seriously, how can you like that story in this movie? Especially after watching the first movie. There was a main story in the first movie and there were side stories surrounded by. Main story was great, and the other side stories are good too. But this movie only has one main story, it's bad and boring. The bad character Ego one of the weakest bad characters. He speaks too much and their stories are not interesting at all. When he was talking, I stopped watching the movie for five minutes and started taking care of my phone because I was really bored. After watching a character with a comprehensible purpose like Ronan in the first film, it was persecution to watch a villain like Ego. Ronan was awesome, Ego was sucked.<br/><br/>The music was as good as the first movie. Acting was good too. Baby Groot and Drax were my favourite in this movie. Effects are good but in some scenes cgi was very obvious to see. Jokes were also as beautiful and funny as in the first film. The conversations between the Guardians of the Galaxy crew were beautiful and funny, as in the first film.<br/><br/>If it were a beautiful story and a successful bad character, it could have been a movie as good as the first movie. But in this way, it's just a boring movie that will never be watched again from the beginning. It's just a movie from Youtube that can be re-looked at fun and important scenes.<br/><br/>I want to finish my review with these words. ""We are Groot."""
"JaruJaruJ","10","0","1","16 May 2019"," The Best MCU Movie By a LANDSLIDE
","I'll keep this brief. The action, effects, acting, story, comedy, and characters were all fantastic, which would have been enough to get it a 9/10. However, what boosts it up to 10/10 is just how dedicated this movie is to giving wish fulfillment to the comic fans.<br/><br/>As a comic fan, the moment I saw that the Ego planet ACTUALLY had a face, I was blown away. When I saw that they had Ego walking around as a human, I just assumed that would probably be the most we'd get, and I was fine with it. I assumed that showing Ego, a planet with a face, was just too silly and absurd for them to put in the movie, and I accepted that. But the madmen DID IT! They put it in! They didn't have to, but they did! That was probably too wacky for most average movie-goers, but as someone who has read the comics featuring Ego, I cannot express how happy I was for them to be so faithful to his original depiction. Sure they changed plenty of stuff for this movie, but I'm fine with that. I get that some details about characters just don't translate super well to film. But that's not what matters to me. I just wanted them to be faithful to the IDEA of Ego, the core qualities that made him such a fun character in the comics, and they did it! They gave a planet a flipping FACE!<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm not just some weirdo obsessed with planets with faces. I'm just so blown away that they would care enough to try and bring that to life in film. That faithfulness to the spirit of the source material is what gets this movie a 10/10. Fantastic."

"jtshiau-44276","10","0","1","16 February 2019"," ""Rocket Raccoon"" absolutely steals the show in this phenomenal addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fantastical and phenomenal addition to the marvel cinematic universe, and a brilliant movie on its own. The ensemble main cast of characters were all amazing in their own rights and each had intense character arcs to back up their flaws, motivations, aspirations, and decisions. The storyline was action packed and full of heart/whimsy, able to grip onto you and keep you entertained and invested in its 2 hour + runtime. The cast did an amazing job portraying their roles and did the characters justice. Rocket Raccoon was especially well written in his own story and proved himself (in my opinion) as one of the best characters in the film. The humor sprinkled in the movie was exceptionally executed and well-placed. All the quippy one-liners landed perfectly and made sense for each of the characters and brought light to some of the more serious events. Heart is also prevalent in this movie, as there are plenty of emotional scenes that gravitate you to the story and characters. The VFX (mainly for Rocket, among all the other things) was surprisingly well done and quite the visual spectacle. The soundtrack consisted of both classic lyrical/ nostalgic compositions and symphonic orchestral pieces-both were spot on and added greatly to the film's quality. Yondu's role in the film was also very much essential and did it's job, giving us investment to his character and giving us raw emotion when he unfortunately sacrificed himself to save Peter Quill. The villan (being Ego) was mostly well written and had a believable god complex as compared to some of the other big bads in recent movie history. Though half the time he was there for expository purposes, he was a relatively compelling villan and was a good contrast to how human the Guardians have become. The subliminal messages woven in this film were fantastically well written and executed as well (being ordinary isn't so bad, and family doesn't always have to be by DNA).<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is one of the best Marvel films to date and a phenomenal addition to the MCU. Rocket Raccoon is surprisingly the best character of all and therefore we are equally surprised that half of the plot is centered around him and his story (not at all a bad thing.) Congratulations to everyone who worked and wrote for this film, because it's a fantastically enjoyable ride that you won't want to stop watching."

"johnbell863","7","0","1","10 December 2018"," Good cgi
","Sure this movie has its flaws, but they are few and far between and they pale in comparison to the spectacular visuals alone. The landscape of Ego's planet is beautiful, same with the space battles and the makeup, and the fourth act has some of the most brilliant cgi in the mcu. I have to agree with Youtuber Jeremy Jahns that I was expecting a more complex core of Ego than a giant brain, but nevertheless it's an amazing treat for the eyes. The plot is creative and I think the story of Starlord's father was incredibly interesting, but those visuals made this movie a pretty damn good sequel. There was one thing in my opinion that kept it from being a great sequel, and that was the few instances of forced humor througout the movie. Examples I can remember are everyone laughing at the name Tazerface, the space fruit not being ripe, and the baby Groot schtick. I really don't know if the Tazerface thing was in the comics or not, but it just made me uncomfortable to watch all these characters bursting out laughing over something that warrants a chuckle at best. I know the MCU is family friendly and humor is the best way to ensure that, but the jokes need to be... jokes. They need to make the audience laugh, not the characters, and I just wasn't laughing at a number of these jokes. But this movie's visuals were so captivating I don't even really care about the cringey jokes, the images of reality-warping space jumps and fights with a cosmic superbeing eclipse them. Really cool soundtrack, too. The Chain by Fleetwood Mac was kind of the theme song, and it fit smoothly. Above all, this was a good sequel because it built on the original without mimicking the plot in any way, and that's all I really want in a sequel."

","The Guardians Of The Galaxy are back in Vol. 2, which focuses on who and what the father of Chris Pratt (the leader of the ""G.O.T.G."") is. On the run from petty, golden colored creatures, the Guardians run into a man (played by Kurt Russell) who saves them and explains to them that he is a Celestial being - basically a god, virtually immortal with great powers. Pratt, always wanting to know who his father was and why he was abandoned, now has an answer to his questions, as well as someone he can yell at for being an absentee father.<br/><br/>It isn't long before father and son hit it off; but Russell hides a secret that may rip the Guardians apart and destroy the Universe. As if that wasn't bad enough, the golden colored creatures and other assorted enemies make their appearances at all the wrong moments.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2"" is the scene when a major character makes the ultimate sacrifice to save a loved one. It almost brought a tear to my eye.<br/><br/>If you loved ""Guardians Of The Galaxy,"" you will like this sequel. It comes close to reaching the quality of the first, but comes up a bit short. The jokes are more numerous but some feel forced and aren't that funny. Some of the action sequences also feel too cartoony; but overall I very much enjoyed ""G.O.T.G.

","Guardians of the Galaxies is one of the best movies ever I personally have every seen. It has many humorous, action-fixed, and emotional scenes. All of the characters in this movie have their own interesting personalities, which makes the production more appealing. 
 First off, the rating of this movie is PG-13, so it is mainly targeting the teenage group of people. My reaction from seeing first snapshot of the movie being released. I thought that this was going to be a nerdy science fiction movie. All I saw were these strange characters: a green alien woman, followed by blue one with glowing red hair, a raccoon, and a tree like figure. The extraterrestrial beings did not appeal to me: Gamora, Yondu, Drax, and Groot. Just to put this out there, I am not much of a movie watcher. I do not venture out to civilization that much. Without the strong encouragement from my friends, I probably would have stayed home and would have done nothing. Walking into the movie theatre, I thought that this movie was going to be so lame because prior to this experience I had not watched any Marvel Produced movies, so I had no idea how good this movie would be. On a side note, I now love Marvel because due to their wealth of success in recent years.
 The element of this movie that reached out to me the most were the songs because they are still really catchy and throw back like. On Spotify, I have added so many Guardians of the Galaxies sound track music to my playlist. Songs such as ""Hooked on a Feeling,"" ""Brandy, You are a Fine Girl,"" and ""Blue Sky"" are songs I listen to on a regular basis. In my opinion, the audience will definitely fall in love with these songs.
 Another cool aspect of this movie is the futuristic space portion. It showed us what it would be like if we lived on different planets and could travel between them using space ships. We see different type of other beings with different physical appearances than human beings. This movie features a possibility for the future if our technology can advance that far. 
 Personally, I think I have a huge sense of humor. There were so many hilarious scenes that attracted my attention. In those scenes, the characters use sarcasm something the audience is very accustomed to. From the bickering between Rocket and Peter Quill to Drax's very literal understanding, I had a great time enjoying the movie. 
 This movie covers three of the persuasive elements: ethos, logos, and pathos (mostly pathos). The heroes in the story do ethically the correct thing at the end by saving the universe, which makes them perceived as heroes. Many young adolescents look up to and admire heroes. The logical part of this movie is how the group of guardians figure out a way to defeat Ronan. Pathos is everywhere with the humor.
 Overall, I would give this movie a 10 stars out 10 for its awesomeness.

Where can you even start? First off, your name is the movie casual enthusiast. So, why are you even criticizing this movie if you're an enthusiast. Don't put that as your username if you're not going to be enthusiastic for movie. Your username should be ""Comments that no one cares about."" Are you serious about a 10 year old child being capable of writing a multimillionaire production? You must come from a different planet if that is possible. I bet when you were 10 years old, you didn't even know how to write your name. If everything was so predictable, please tell me that you knew Yondu was going to die. You couldn't predict that. If you thought the acting was weak, then you're downgrading the whole Marvel organization. They would've picked the most qualified actors to fulfill their parts correctly. If there was only unintelligent humor, then that means you did not laugh at all watching the movie. Please tell me that you didn't laugh at all, so that I can expose you for being a robot and turn you into the government. The movie can't only have intelligent humor or else not everyone would understand the jokes such as yourself. If you are truly a big fan of Marvel, then you would accept that this movie was awesome. This just proves to show that you are not a true fan and a hater. Next time, just stay home and work on your elements of persuasion."

Don't put that as your username if you're not going to be enthusiastic for movie. Your username should be ""Comments that no one cares about."" Are you serious about a 10 year old child being capable of writing a multimillionaire production? You must come from a different planet if that is possible. I bet when you were 10 years old, you didn't even know how to write your name. If everything was so predictable, please tell me that you knew Yondu was going to die. You couldn't predict that. If you thought the acting was weak, then you're downgrading the whole Marvel organization. They would've picked the most qualified actors to fulfill their parts correctly. If there was only unintelligent humor, then that means you did not laugh at all watching the movie. Please tell me that you didn't laugh at all, so that I can expose you for being a robot and turn you into the government. The movie can't only have intelligent humor or else not everyone would understand the jokes such as yourself. If you are truly a big fan of Marvel, then you would accept that this movie was awesome. This just proves to show that you are not a true fan and a hater. Next time, just stay home and work on your elements of persuasion."

","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is the sequel of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" which starts from where the first one finished. In this movie, we watch the Guardians of the Galaxy trying to find the truth behind the past of their leader Peter Quill / Star-Lord. After saving the universe from their previous enemy Guardians of the Galaxy are ready to fight a new one now who wants to rule the universe, something or someone from their leader's past.<br/><br/>I liked this movie as much as the first one. For one more time, Marvel makes a masterpiece at the same level as the first movie, it was for one more time funny, interesting and had a well-written script. I enjoyed it because it was also very different from all the other Marvel movies. In addition to this, it has to be mentioned that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" combines very well the visual effects with soundtracks, and fight scenes with emotional and funny moments, something that is very difficult to be successfully combined. I liked the interpretations of Chris Pratt who played as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana who played as Gamora and Michael Rooker who played as Yondu Udonta. Vin Diesel's voice as Baby Groot was simply hilarious for one more time like the first movie but it was much funnier since Groot was a baby now. The direction which was made again by James Gunn was simply beautiful.<br/><br/>To sum up, I have to say that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" it's an amazing movie with plenty of humor, funny and some emotional moments as well. I strongly recommend for everyone to see it because either you watch it alone or with a company you will have a great time and I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much."

","This movie is similar to the original, the main difference being a higher budget. The story is fun and absurd. The effects are great. The characters are entertaining - though a few are caricatures. The cinematography was fantastic. I don't have much to say about this movie except that everything was done beautifully. As Marvel movies go this is one of the better ones. If you're looking for a fun time, watch this movie. This movie is funny, its fantastic, and if I were to make this review longer, it would just be more of the same praise for pretty much every aspect. There were very few bits which annoyed me with contradicting logic, and overall this is just a great film."

","Marvel didn't get much recognition this year. Having three films with so great reviews, they ended up with only one Oscar nomination with barely a chance of winning it. However I am still proud of James Gunn and his team. Because noone expected it. Thor: Ragnarok was shining the most, being super different and unexpected. With Spider-man on the other hand - because everyone loves Spidey, Guardians were somewhat forgotten.<br/><br/>The film was somewhat a fanfiction of the previous one. It was completely a child of James Gunn and I don't believe Marvel Studios had much to say about it. Guardians Vol 2 has no impact on the wider MCU story and director had almost complete creativity management on his side.<br/><br/>Effects were indeed hard to forget. They were dealing with the Earth-like CGI and cosmic ones. Ego himself was a beauty, speaking of both the ""man"" and the ""planet"", of course. I can't imagine how long actors worked only with the green screen. Everything spacey had to be done by the computers, no wonder. There wasn't much Earthly sets, which is fun. A lot of films make the universe as something very human and Gunn kinda tries to avoid it as much as possible. And don't forget of Baby Groot. Pure damn CGI. (more at heromngmnt.com)"

","Guardians of The Galaxy has so much potential, being a Marvel movie based in space. This new installment, although a good movie, still leaves a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>The story is something that's been done before and the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise doesn't really bring much new to the table in that department. Same with the villain he might even be blander than the villain in the first Guardians. Though something it does do better in Vol. 1 is character development. Every member of the guardians are genuinely interesting and doesn't come off nearly as one dimensional as they did in the first one. <br/><br/>This franchise has struck gold with it's soundtrack again. The special effects are up to Marvel's standards and the camera work doesn't do much special.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie was good (other than the drawn out death scene plus funeral at the end) so give it a watch."

","I guess in hindsight it was bound to happen , but Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is a bit of a letdown. The chemistry is there for our galactic heroes and all of the actors do a tremendous job in their rolls, but the real issue in this film is that it gets bogged down in the exposition from Ego (Kurt Russell) which just slows the pace of the movie. Aside from these 'explanation scenes', the rest of the movie is a fun as the original and sets up the Marvel Galactic Universe movies to come for years.<br/><br/> There are so many great performances and a lot of it has to do with the chemistry of the group. Michael Rooker continues to be one of the most underrated actors in film and deservedly gets more screen time in this episode. James Gunn's character development is very impressive with some of the b-level characters from the first film being fleshed out even more here and it gives everyone their moment on screen."

","GotG Vol. 2 is one of those rare sequels that was better than the original. Maybe it's just that the characters have grown on me more or the fact it was a better story but I found myself far more interested this time around. I'm still not running out to purchase GotG comic books but this movie is a nice addition to the ever-growing MCU. There were more laugh-out-loud moments as well as more heart-touching moments. I think a couple of the heart-touching moments were a bit out of place if not just a little too trite; still they were tolerable. <br/><br/>The pervasive message was that everyone needs family whether that family be an adopted family or blood family. Of the handful of very apparent presentations of this message I'd say one or two of them were done well--meaning it aided the story instead of looking as if it was shoe horned in there. <br/><br/>By and large I can't complain much about this film.

","I really liked this film, but I wanted to really LOVE it. The only thing that prevented me from loving it was its fear of emotion. There were so many moments in this film that were high in emotion until they were struck down by unnecessary comedy. There were also some great emotional moments that weren't ruined, but there could have been so many more. Much of this unnecessary comedy came from Drax. It seemed to me that Drax wasn't the same character he was in the first film. In Vol. 1, Drax barely understood humor, while in Vol. 2, he is always either laughing obnoxiously or trying to make the audience laugh. It would seem that James Gunn knows how to create humor and knows how to create emotional moments, but he doesn't know when to keep them separate. I am assuming that Nicole Perlman was able to keep James Gunn in check while writing Vol. 1, but having full control of the script in Vol. 2 resulted in a tonally inconsistent film just a step away from great."

","We all know that Marvel movies are a good indicator of entertainment movies. But even, it would seem, in an entertaining movie Marvel often manage to put some hidden meaning.

I admit, going to this movie I expected to see an easy entertainment film and did not expect that James Gunn will be able to invest in the film so much good morality. The characters themselves are better worked, and the villain came out better than Ronan from the first part. The movie itself turned out to be very colorful and exciting. Of the minuses only in places, disgusting humor. And so, this is a great sequel."

I was grinning from start to finish at how much of a stylized powerhouse it was, though I wasn't a fan of the Guardians being separated for most of the story; their interplay is the strongest element, but when they are together it always hits.

","There is no question that the first Guardiand Of The Glaxy is better but this one is certainly not bad. It's all visually nice to see, with great make-up, and the good necessary special effects for a sci-fi movie. Dave Bautista as Drax is definitely the funniest character, and also Pom Klementieff as Mantix. The characters of Rocket and Baby Groot add also a funny touch to the movie. Zoe Saldana as Gamora is even in green a beautiful woman to watch. The only minor point that I would mention is Chris Pratt. I just think he is a below average actor, he's just mediocre. Too bad they didn't choose somebody else to play the role of Peter Quill. For a sequel the story is certainly not bad, but it's more about the visual effects and the humor. So If you did like the first one I can't see any reason why you wouldn't like this one."
"fuzzymax-76787","9","0","1","10 November 2017"," As uniquely vibrant and quirky as the first, with even more heart, Guardians vol.2 is yet another entertaining addition to the MCU.
","Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2 is perhaps 2017's most underrated film. Most critics argue that the sequel lacked the freshness of the original film. However I disagree; whilst it isn't without its flaws, this installment of the Guardians franchise is still remarkably entertaining. James Gunn's flamboyant directorial style is outstanding, and while the script can't match it, Gunn has still crafted something unique and hilarious. The character development is one of the film's strengths, along with the perfect cast. Chris Pratt slips back into his role as Star Lord with ease, proving to be the most inspired casting choice in the superhero genre since Robert Downey JR as Iron Man. Zoe Saldana does OK once more as Gamora, but is outshone by Karen Gillian's Nebula, who's character has one of the film's best arcs. Bradley Cooper returns as Rocket, with pleasing development throughout the film, and Plom Klementieff proves a welcome addition to the ensemble as Mantis. Dave Bautstua's Drax is used perfectly in this film, hogging the humour and standing out among the core guardians, and Groot, now an Infant, is still loads of fun. Ego, a new character played by Kurt Russell, is a mixed bag, with his arc feeling uneven, but Russell's performance being solid; his character is integral to the film, as we quickly find out. Finally, Michael Rooker; Yondu, the heart of vol.2, with an extended role from the previous film. His portrayal is fantastic. Overall, Guardians vol.2 is thin on plot, but big on excitement, humour and heart, which makes it very watchable. Perhaps it isn't as good as the original, but it comes agonizingly close."
"jamesrupert2014","7","0","1","10 November 2017"," Pretty good, for a CGI-driven sequel...
","Like most sequels, ""Guardians of the Galaxy 2"" lacks the freshness and novelty of the original. The main characters, while still entertaining, are a bit predictable, having had their shtick well established in #1. The primary villain continues the trend for 'super-heroes' to be combating some kind of god-like foe, (presumably mundane villains are no longer sufficiently challenging), which allows the special effects/CGI teams to pretty much include any image that they find interesting (or easily rendered(?)). The film is fast moving and colourful (although I am getting tired of space looking tie-died √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú a little of that goes a long way) but the images come so fast that it's difficult to really get any real sense of at what you are looking. The climactic battle is overlong and confusing, being full of the 'swarms of ships' that is so popular in the current crop of CGI-driven movies. These criticisms aside, GotG2 is fun entry in to the movie Marvelverse. Michael Rooker's 'Udonta' returns and is put to good use, the new character, Ego's empath-servant Mantis, is a worthwhile addition to the story, and there is lots of quality Rocket time (I liked the scenes where the furry mercenary takes on an army of Ravagers). Good, but not great; watchable, but not rewatchable (at least by me)."

"Tehmeh","7","0","1","6 November 2017"," Thank God for Michael Rooker
","I really liked the first Guardians, and while I am getting tired of Marvel/Disney blockbusters, I wanted to give this one a shot because the first one actually felt like a movie instead of a spoke in some corporate wheel. I'm glad I did, because it's quite good. It's basically ""just"" a popcorn movie, but it's not without heart. I have gripes, but more about those later. <br/><br/>""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2"" is pretty much the sequel most people probably expected. Likable characters, amusingly weird tone, effective themes and a brisk pace. You get another soundtrack full of good songs and they're used well, which isn't an easy thing to do. Most movies fail trying, because the intent behind it is cynical and based solely on cashing in on a trend. It works here though, and that's a good thing considering how bland the composed soundtracks in Marvel movies are, so at least we get something meaningful to listen to.<br/><br/>I don't know if I want to say much about the story. It's not engaging as a sequence of events, and the ""lore"" really doesn't matter to me. It's not great in that way. What matters here is the emotional resonance. Yes, we've seen and heard thousands of stories about family, friendship, finding one's place in the world and such. More often than not those stories feel forced, insincere and hollow. Here, they pretty much nail whatever they tried to accomplish. We get some nice, warm and even romantic moments along with sad reminders of loss, loneliness and other things we're all familiar with. When a popcorn movie manages to take you through that ride and end it just right so that you don't feel cheated, it's an accomplishment. <br/><br/>The cast is fine, and whenever the movie focuses on the characters it's so much better for it. That's where it shines - although sometimes the performances (or more likely the writing/directing concerning those characters and/or scenes) seem a little disingenuous as if they're just repeating certain antics. But fear not, because Michael Rooker takes over and steals the show. He is blessed with unstoppable charisma and he keeps this movie together. Even when he's spouting bad lines, he's entirely convincing and lovable all the way. Only Zoe Saldana can match him at times, but Michael Rooker is the best actor in Guardians 2, and at the same time his character Yondu is the best thing in the whole movie. Turns out we need him to be just that, because there are times when he has to carry the film.<br/><br/>There are two things holding Guardians 2 back. First one is some of the fantastical space action and parts of the plot involving it. At times it's fine and character-driven, and there are inventive little fun things weaved into the mix, but sometimes I felt like I was watching a video game with a very mediocre narrative. I wasn't invested and I was desperate to feel something. Here comes the second problem, which is far worse: the movie understands the first problem, and tries to cover for it with ""funny"" lines and wacky moments in order for us to feel something about the characters again. When it works, it's a nice distraction. When it doesn't, it's something straight out of bad sitcoms but just without the laugh track. Yes, I know this movie is supposed to be silly, but when it's trying too hard it loses its charm and it takes me out of the movie. If something is not funny or emotionally meaningful, don't try to force it or it becomes even worse than it was. And if the movie is having a moment, don't destroy that moment with a horribly-timed bad joke or a gag. Some of that stuff really took me out of the experience.<br/><br/>In the last act, this movie dives deep into mediocrity, but soon after finds its groove again and rises with astounding confidence. Just when I was about to give up, I was thinking of ""Logan"", where the last act totally lost me and I couldn't believe how disappointed I was - I couldn't even enjoy the few good last shots of that movie. Here, it was the opposite. When it was over, I felt rewarded. It hit me emotionally in a way that good directors know how to do. I gave James Gunn some crap about a few questionable character moments (if he's responsible for them that is, who knows with these billion-dollar franchises), but he seems to be a really good director, and I must respect him for writing the movie too. Characters aren't just cheap plot devices for him, most of them have real arcs. He knew when and how to dive deep into them when it was necessary and deliver sincere drama with blunt force. In the end, it was the ride I wanted it to be, even if I had my problems with it along the way. It feels like a movie made by someone who loved what he was doing, which is rare.<br/><br/>I guess that's it. Guardians 2 is not as surprising as the first one, but it's not a soulless sequel either. It's not the corporate product I feared it would be. While the story isn't that great and the characters don't always feel as genuine as I'd like, it still packs some emotional punch, a heart if you will. Some jokes and moments didn't work for me at all, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't amused, moved and entertained. Add Michael Rooker's exciting performance, and we have a movie that's easy to recommend for most people. Some grumpy, cynical people like me will have to adjust their expectations, but kids will love this. They'll eat this up like no tomorrow, and for once it's a good thing because Guardians 2 isn't cynical, exploitative or politically preachy as too many movies seem to be."

The group is saved by a Celestial, Ego (Kurt Russell) who claims to be Peter's father. Meanwhile, Yondu (Michael Rooker) is being ostracized by the other Ravagers and faces a mutinous crew.<br/><br/>This is a visual overload of wildly colored space fantasy with unending quips. The first Guardian is refreshing for that idea but it gets a little repetitive with a sequel. The freshest scenes are Nebula's obsessive murderous rage against Gamora, and Baby Groot's inability to get Yondu's hat. There is some heart with Yondu and the sisters. It has some fun but a lot of it feels overloaded. At times, I pine for more of the quieter moments to let the characters deal with their feelings or simply reset my color receptors. Kurt is Kurt and is really perfect as Quill's father. I want the movie to take its time with the emotional turmoil but like a lot of these superhero movies, the pacing has to maintain its freight train momentum.

I saw this movie on a plane, and am going spoiler free in this review. <br/><br/>Movies viewed on planes are a unique viewing experience due to the endless interruptions in three languages, roaring jet noise, sad airline food, cramped an uncomfortable sets, etc. The viewer has to really be into the movie to not drift off and watch Paris Can Wait.<br/><br/>You could say if a movie enjoyed by an air traveler has to be great.<br/><br/>To that end, I absolutely loved this movie. I watched it three times in one flight. The characters are great and the actors are allowed to act. Mantis was hilarious with her funny way of pronouncing her lines. Drax deserves an Emmy for 'best guffaw'. Gamora is a bit moody for some reason with corresponding dark makeup. Possibly because she 'ain't getting' nun' from Star-Lord, which is weird, but whatever.<br/><br/>GREAT MOVIE."

","The first Guardians was great because it was balanced. The big bad wasn't too big. Our heroes were outmatched but not too much. etc... All very disappointing.<br/><br/>This film has a promising start but we come to the point where we realize that the big bad is too big. The cartoon series went a better route with Peter's father being J'Son. <br/><br/>Now I have a bias against films where the bad guy is too powerful. Other films have suffered from the same thing. <br/><br/>That being said it was a good film. It could have been better."

","The first installment of this saga was one of the biggest surprises of 2014. Its hilarious jokes and the visually mind-blowing action scenes plus a cast full of chemistry elevated a movie with a simple superhero plot to one of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).<br/><br/>GOTG Vol. 2 is pretty much the same, but with some family issues. I'll answer the question that everyone has on their minds: ""is it better than the first one?"" ... No. Honestly, I think the former is far better. Not that this one is bad (it isn't), but one of the main reasons the first film was successful was because everything was new and different. They used the more dramatic and suspenseful moments that we've seen over and over again in every single movie ever made and placed a comic relief moment in the middle or at the end of the scene. Even if the joke didn't land, it was still so original that most people really enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>The humor is as hilariously great as in the first film. Some jokes are indeed pushed too far and it ruins some scenes that could have received a better tone to it. Most of the comedy is successful mainly due to the incredible cast. Once again, Chris Pratt nails it, not only as the funny guy, but in the dramatic scenes he's compelling as well. Zoe Saldana (Gamora) and Karen Gillan (Nebula) have a lot of screen time together and, while the former really delivers, the latter ...¬† delivers too much, she overacts most of her scenes and that kind of threw me off.<br/><br/>However, believe it or not, the real star of this film is Yondu (Michael Rooker). This character has so much development throughout the movie and it's a joy to watch Rooker's amazing performance. As expected, the relationship between Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) is adorably funny and Dave Bautista (Drax) keeps surprising me (definitely the best wrestler-to-actor transition since Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson).<br/><br/>As for final praises, the soundtrack is great once again (even if some of the choices are clearly some plot points), the action sequences are good enough and the visuals are amazingly stunning.<br/><br/>These are the things that I (and most fans, I guess) expected, so until here I'm pretty much fine with the movie. The problem is that this second installment has a lot more issues than the first one ... For the first hour-ish, I spent the whole time thinking ""is this going somewhere? Who's the villain? Is there a villain? Why do I feel bored? This joke is still going on?"". The aim of this film isn't quite clear until the second half of the film and once I get there, there are a lot of pacing issues and the story becomes uneven (even if it has some thrilling action scenes spread through it).<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailers, Kurt Russell (Ego) is in this movie and he's great as always, but the main story that the film follows (with Kurt and¬†Chris being a big part of it) didn't captivate me that much because there are so many subplots involving the other characters that when all of it comes together, it doesn't connect very well. It's like the film couldn't figure out what to do with so many supporting characters, they're just ... There.<br/><br/>There's also this civilization that you can see in the trailers (they're all gold ... they're all painted gold for some reason) that work fine for the opening scene, but they keep showing up throughout the film and it's just another thing that bothered me. This is definitely the more ""stand-alone"" movie from the MCU's Phase Three. There isn't a single tie or set-up to another film from the universe and the fanboy in me wished that it had something on it (even the FIVE post-credits scenes don't show that much).<br/><br/>Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't better than the first one, but it stays true to my expectations. The whole movie is hilarious, the cast has an unbelievable chemistry and Michael Rooker steals the show from Chris Pratt, who also has a great performance. The visuals are stunning, the action set pieces are good and the soundtrack keeps being awesome. However, there are some issues: the pacing is off, the comedy becomes forced, Karen Gillan is the worst part of the film, even if the Nebula-Gamora subplot is interesting, and the main story isn't as captivating as it should be since the supporting characters are terribly misused.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"

","The Guardians are back in a brand new movie that is almost as good as the first movie. The characters we know are still the ones we love plus ones that we look more into or are new that earn our smiles.<br/><br/>Starting with the Guardians, they work pretty well together, even though they still bicker and fight, they still know they need each other, as Drax said, they're family. This movie introduced a new Guardian, Mantis, who is a great addition that brings cute innocence, amusing powers and a great bond with the rest of the team, especially Drax. We also expanded on a few other characters that debuted in the first movie. We looked more into Nebula and how her childhood was under Thanos. It's very disheartening and I can understand her cold demeanor and sort of hatred towards Gamora. Gamora saying that she just wanted to survive, with Nebula countering by saying that she wanted a sister was well done and sort of heartbreaking. I really want her to join with the Guardians and I also sort of want her to be the one to deliver the killing blow to Thanos. Another character we focused on is Yondu, who has great scenes with both Rocket and Quill, as we come to realize why he kept Quill as he loved him like a son. His (SPOILERS) tragic death at the end of the movie, just after being announced a Guardian, was beautiful as he tells Quill that he was his real father, not the person he found. Kraglin also had more to do in this movie as he was more than just Yondu's right hand. It looks like he might be joining the Guardians or lead another faction of the Ravagers, so could be fun.<br/><br/>The villain in this movie proves to be one of the greater villains in the MCU as Ego, Quill's dad, played by the outstanding Kurt Russell. He delivers on every level with humor, evil plan, emotional scenes, abilities and strong defeat. <br/><br/>The action and effects of this movie is awesome too. Couple of examples of this are Yondu, Rocket, Kraglin and Baby Groot's escape from the Ravager ship with incredible background music and awesome shots of Yondu's arrow in action. For visual effects, Ego's planet looks completely surreal and gorgeous. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is just as great as the first film. It also helps people bond like Yondu and Rocket, and Ego and Quill. <br/><br/>The humor in this movie was actually sort of hit and miss in this movie, which is disappointing, given that it was so strong in the first film. For example, in my opinion, the ""Taserface"" joke was dragged out for such a long time and just lost all juice. Another joke that didn't really deliver was Nebula eating an unripened fruit. It was mentioned so many times before the scene came along that when it did happen, it was just easily expected.<br/><br/>Still though, this movie is awesome and a complete joy to watch. And did I mention how absolutely adorable Baby Groot is?<br/><br/>+ Guardians return, with great new ones, including those already introduced in the first movie + Tremendous Villain + Balanced humorous, action and emotional scenes + Soundtrack + Baby Groot! - Humor missed a bit too much<br/><br/>Final Score: 9.1/10"

","It's been a very long time since I last saw a movie this great. Previous installment of Guardians of the Galaxy was just a funny pleasant entertaining experience. This one is deeply touching and explores family relationships and quirks to the very heart. A bit strange characteristic for an action sci-fi comic, isn't it? But this is its main strength - in combination with great characters, dialog and story. And yes, it is even more entertaining than the first film, every second a colorful visual effect, nice classic rock-n-roll music, crazy action, superb humor. Groot is adorable. A must see, if you ask me."

","This movie contains action, romance, humor, and even suspense. Though it is lengthy, the time does not drag on because the events keep you on your toes. The series of events are closely related to one another and also tie back to the first movie, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". Furthermore, none of the events were too far fetched. They were realistic in the sense that it's not too difficult to fathom, let's say, flying spaceships, a talking raccoon, etc. The story line could easily be tweaked to be realistic in today's society. Overall, I think what made this movie so amazing was how relatable it was. It was a movie that had a little bit of something for the whole family!"

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was a easy comedy as its predecessor. I haven't laughed that hard in a movie for a very long time.

James Gunn has a reason for this music and it's that all the youngsters in this life would hear all this ""old"" songs. <br/><br/>GotG Vol. 2 is a very funny movie and the movie has a way to show everybody that you don't have to have a clever plot, only a very funny one."

"CountJonnie","7","0","3","28 May 2017"," Hilariously funny, which brings us to the problem
","Where GotG1 took us by surprise, in a time where cinemas are overloaded by superhero movies, GotG2 fails to do the same. GotG1 built on characters who were lesser known and succeeded in making them likable by combining background stories, with a decent build-up and great comedy thanks to flawless timing, while staying connected to the mainstream MCU.<br/><br/>GotG2 had the opportunity to build further upon the stepping stones that GotG1 laid out. Since the backgrounds are now known, GotG2 had the chance to pick up the pace where GotG1 sometimes felt slow and chaotic. But instead of picking a pace, GotG2 chose to focus on comedy which was there abundantly. After 45 minutes of jokes, you get the drift, but the movie doesn't. Star-Lord is witty and funny, Rockey is sarcastic and funny, Drax is dumb and funny, Groot is cute and funny.<br/><br/>During the 2nd half where the movie tries to turn to action and character work, while feeding us bits of information as a promise to part 3, the audience's patience may already have worn out after countless jokes that hurt the pace. The heroes are funny but offer nothing more than they already have. The villains feel empty and pointless. The plot is rushed and so disconnected from the mainstream MCU that his movie feels as a filler that could have been let out.<br/><br/>The only character that rises above it all is Michael Rooker as Yondu, who single handedly provides more character and more development, than all the other characters do, despite the messy script. So is it a bad movie? No it isn't. Should you skip it? No you shouldn't. But IF you skip it, you won't miss very much."

","The sequence to GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY sticks to most of the good things that made the first movie such a success. It's a more colorful vision of Sci-Fi than what we see in oh-so-many gray dystopias. And it's warm-hearted and light-headed, never taking itself too seriously. And even though self-irony pervades almost every image, there is some genuine sense of suspense in at least some of the action-packed scenes. The movie has some hilarious new side characters, in particular the arrogant queen of the Sovereigns‚Äîall painted in gold. The sensitive ""Mantis"" and her interactions with Drax add a tint of cuteness. The performances of the main cast, the likes of Zoe Saldana and Chris Pratt, was as good as we come to expect.<br/><br/>The plot's main theme surrounds the discovery of Chris Pratt's past. This piece of the story is interesting enough to keep you going, but it's also not particularly deep and moving‚Äîa somewhat slower pace and a bit more 'feel' for the depth of the characters would have helped here, but then, oh well, there'd been less time for all the fun action! And so VOL. 2 of the guardians is a blooming and buzzing action sci-fi adventure with a somewhat shallow story ... but it's entertaining nonetheless! If you liked the first one, this is definitely recommended."
"generationofswine","9","0","4","26 May 2017"," An Honest Review
","Well, the soundtrack rocked. It was wonderfully classic. Wonderfully sentimental. Wonderfully awesome again. And it was fun how music suddenly became their thing as a team.<br/><br/>Baby Groot was fun, funny, and adorable all at the same time...and it worked because he was also a lot more violent than the adult Groot, which made it stand far and away from the overly saccharin nightmare that he could have been.<br/><br/>Star Lord unfortunately matured a bit. He wasn't anywhere near the...can I say d**che bag here? Jerk is too strong of a word and you never really got the impression that he was really an idiot in the first one. In any case it was that annoying quality that made him such a great character in the first movie.<br/><br/>In the sequel Peter has grown and some of the traits that made him so fun to watch are still there...just muted as he became more of an adult.<br/><br/>It works for the plot, and he is still a lot of fun to watch, but a part of the appeal was that he was sort of Peter pan and it hurts wa6tching someone like that grow.<br/><br/>The only really weak point was Mantis and only really because she was clearly going to join the team and clearly not doing much of anything.<br/><br/>As the whole, you have another departure away from the overly serious...or sometimes moderately serious cape flicks...which a refreshing getaway, so long as its understood that Guardians and the like are departures from the norm and not a harbinger of Batman & Robin camp again."

","I had a great time watching this! Vol2 is as charming and funny as the first one and i appreciated how they devoted time into expanding the GotG universe and exploring character development/relationships instead of trying to come up with a plot that would tie in the Guardians to the general MCU. I personally enjoyed the Rocket/Groot/Yondu part of the story a bit more than Peter's and Gamora's personal story lines. It was more interesting to me and Rocket and Yondu freaking MVPd both their humorous but also their heavily emotional scenes. The Drax-Mantis dynamic was also a great addition. As for the villain part of the story...well... I did not really care for the Sovereign Race sidestory and i wished that after their role as plot device was done and over we would not see them again but the post- movie scenes suggest otherwise. Pity. And Ego. I don't know. A typical megalomaniac who wants to destroy the universe just as many others before him. Though it still baffles me how a being who began its personal quest because it was eager to not be alone decided that its purpose in the universe was to be all there is. It sounds kind of stupid???"

So many things in this movie had to step up with the second installment not having the evil villain Ronan and the depth he added, and i feel like people stepped up perfectly. Drax for instance showed us that his humor ranged farther than his inability to sense sarcasm, and Yondu and Kraglin played perfectly by direction James Gunn's brother Sean Gunn stole the show in my opinion. In conclusion Guardians made me laugh like I expected, and it also gave me many more goosebumps than I had expected and it turned out to be a great second installment in a budding cinematic franchise."

Villain character was boring, stupid....in one word a complete moron...villain are meant to be villainous, vicious, selfish to the core not like a half baked cup cake. The role of Yondu was fun and brought life to this movie. Baby Groot is a typical character whose place changed the tempo of the movie.

","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a thrilling new entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie is perfect for the family, especially for teenagers and above. The two hour movie follows the first installment, taking place a few months later. Based on the comic of the same name, this fantasy movie really proves that Marvel still hasn't lost their touch. The team is back with Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket Racoon (Bradly Cooper), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), and of course Baby Groot (Vin Diesel). The story also has many other returning characters, such as Yondu (Michael Rooker) and Nebula (Karen Gillan). Once again it's directed by James Gunn.<br/><br/>It begins with a creative and unique way to reintroduce the team, on a mission for the Sovereign, a super-elite race of genetically engineered sparkling gold humanoids. We then see their ship crash down on a deserted planet, where Peter's long lost father, Ego (Kurt Russel), with his innocent assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff), picks them up. Ego brings them to his planet, where most of the movie takes place. Some stay behind to repair the ship, splitting the team up in a very ""Empire Strikes Back""-esque fashion. Most of this movie has overwhelming amounts of Similarities to ""Empire Strikes Back"". The effects in the film are spot-on, it makes you believe that they are actually happening, including some that make jokes all the better. Rocket Racoon's effects are nailed once again and work fluidly with the other actors. <br/><br/>The acting is generally pretty good, with just one or two missteps in the whole film. Chris Pratt doesn't always convince the audience of being depressed, but everything seems relatively solid otherwise. There are some dramatic changes in tone, but you can look past some of them, given the weight of the situation. Nebula does not really fit in the movie, as she is too serious, compared to the light and joking tone of the rest of the cast. The soundtrack is extremely good and fits the movie well, but it doesn't live up to the hype of the first movie's soundtrack does. The music is still perfect for the film, and I would recommend buying the soundtrack. Not all the jokes land, but they don't distract from the rest of the movie, which is still hilarious. Drax's oblivious, but genuine, dialogue tends to be the best, followed by the charming Baby Groot gags.<br/><br/>This is an all-around spectacular film. The good far outweighs the band, and will easily be remembered as a great comic book movie, with lots of laughs and plenty of heartfelt scenes."

","There's always a problem with that difficult second album, when the first was such a fresh take on the powerhouse/sometimes trying super/comic book hero genre that has literally taken over Hollywood since 2008.<br/><br/>The first GOTG was original, genuinely funny, and had a lot of heart. Plus it finally gave Howard The Duck the box office hit he'd been waiting for for nearly thirty years.<br/><br/>So Gunn was going to have to do something special to usurp his original. <br/><br/>And has he?..........no he hasn't.<br/><br/>GOTG VOL.2 is still a vibrant, colourful piece of cinema, but it loses its way in the second act,thanks to Gunn trying to emulate James Cameron's trope of making the nuclear family a pivotal point of his narrative. <br/><br/>Yes, it's great that we finally discover Quills origins, and Russell is truly wonderful as Ego, looking like a cross between Michael McDonald and Barry Gibb, but during this pivotal part of the plot, the rest of the guardians are given very little to do.<br/><br/>Gamora feels like a spare part in this film, she is either a thorn in Quills side, or an angel on his shoulder, and does very little else. Drax has become more of a silly comic relief this time, rather than unintentional as he was in the first film, spending much of the second act being detrimental to Mantis. Rocket Raccoon does a little better, he is one of the funniest things in the film, but again, apart from his acid tongue and finding Yondu, he's also sidelined.<br/><br/>So thank heavens for Yondu and Groot. Yondu plays such an important role to the whole story, that he could almost be a primary character, and he shares some wonderful scenes with Groot, especially the hilarious scene where he is trying to get Groot to find something from a draw.<br/><br/>Stallone pops up in an extended cameo, and when we first meet him, you are thinking to yourself 'what's the point of him being in it?' But it all makes sense in the end.<br/><br/>There are some wonderful set pieces, the escape through the asteroid field is a highlight, and the film is book ended by some really standout action scenes, even though the finale reminded one of The Mummy.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's not a bad film by any means, the scene shared by Quill and Yondu is very touching, but you can't help but think that this could have been so much more.<br/><br/>And to those moaning about five stingers in the credits, it made the credits go faster for me, even though I kept asking myself 'Why is Goldblum's character from Thor: Ragnarok featured in a picture?'<br/><br/>And it was good to see Howard again....."

What it is not is a movie that will challenge the original in any capacity when it comes to the joy the original is to watch. <br/><br/>The feeling you get watching the opening sequence is basically the feeling I got throughout the movie. That feeling is basically the feeling that what you are watching is entertaining but seems as though it is something you have seen done better before. <br/><br/>It really was an impossible task to ask this movie give you that all out joy the original did but the comparisons are inevitable. <br/><br/>I don't want to give the impression that I did not enjoy Vol. 2. I did enjoy it. It gives you most of the answers you were looking for at the end of the original. The special effects are taken to the next level and are nearly flawless. The music choices are along the same lines with the original and give you that tap your foot, sing along feeling of the original as well. <br/><br/>I will see it again and post an update to this review.

Well, when it came to visuals my expectations were more or less met even if the Stormtrooper level of shooting was awkwardly bad at times. It wasn't marvelous but no complaints. The main characters worked out fine together, just like last time. The rest sucked.<br/><br/>The only characters that had a real reason to be in this movie was the guardians, the villain and to some extend extra daddy Yondu.<br/><br/>The golden people in the start? Attacked with spaceships twice and that was it, didn't matter to the plot at all.<br/><br/>The sister of Gomora? Completely pointless, first tried to kill her sister then they suddenly become friends again, after that she is unnecessary. <br/><br/>Yondus gang and people that stopped working with him etc? Worked as motivation for him to join the guardians and help out but played a far too large part for just introducing Yondu.<br/><br/>Yondu? Nice seeing him again after the last movie as he is an interesting character. He matters in this movie as it is pretty much about the main characters backstory, where Yondu was more or less the father. There is also a quite nice scene with him in the end.<br/><br/>The plot? You don't know what the movie is about until Ego aka biological daddy suddenly turns out to be a bad guy with a weird motivation. I think that happens 20-30 min before the movie is over, which makes the story from there on far too stressed and fast. The only things that mattered in the movie before that is that Ego picked up the main char and that Yondu got thrown out of his gang by mutiny. This could have been done in 30 min, then 60 min could have been spent on getting to know Ego and gradually showing how he was a bad guy instead of it coming out of thin air. Make it like that, meaning 90 minutes long, and it could have been a decent movie.<br/><br/>The only reason I don't give this movie 1 or 2 is because the ""jokes"" where Drax and the antenna girl don't have any social barriers and speak the truth all the time were hilarious and made parts of the audience laugh out loud, including me."

The script left much to be desired yet the film dragged on. Most of the special effects are amazing, but some of them are flat out bad. The movie relies quite a bit off humor that is hit and miss.

Also, some of the jokes are not appropriate for younger viewers. Even Drax became really funny and it makes his character not as interesting. I just wish they kept the characters personality the same as the original. Yes, you can throw in more jokes but is just too much. Also, seems like the characters are way more advance in strength and speed. Example, in some of the scene they show our beloved characters getting smash with things and they don't even have a scratch on them.

The jokes were funny better than the first one but some jokes drags too much which fells meh OK you can stop now....<br/><br/>third the gold people... i hate them as villains... they were just there because the film has to have some antagonist... They were badly developed... <br/><br/>fourth Drax the destroyer doesn't destroy anything.. he is just there for comic relief which worked by the way and good though.. The actor who played Nebula was bad.... <br/><br/>Other than these problems the movie is pretty much entertaining and is a very good fun movie... No its not as good as the First one... That doesn't means its bad.....7.3/10....."

It's like a Jekyll and Hyde version with stupid killing for filler with zero purpose--not even funny. Lazy work!<br/><br/>The most dramatic difference was how they paid for a great soundtrack in the previews and then used only a couple recognizable songs in the movie but the one in the preview wasn't even one of them--they used some cheap obscure stuff that didn't add a thing to the film. I LOVED the first film, loved the tongue in cheek style, the light touch of people banding together who have more in common than they might think and the music! Please people quit trying to squeeze every blasted penny out of a profit margin by first misleading in a preview setting and then cutting costs on something as important as plot and soundtrack.

","Loved the first one! Being such a fan of sci-fi I was so excited and satisfied that finally there was another brilliant universe in our midst. It had a bit of Empire strikes back/ Raiders /5th element to it. And a Magical element that hasn't been seen for so long. The sequel was good... but a step down for the original's magic. It was almost overdone and over exaggerated all the characters that were originally so brilliant and didn't need a boost. I so hope the third one returns back to it's humble witty funny awesome self!"

The characters had great chemistry together and I adored them. I also loved how they also included emotional weight to the film. Star Lord, Gamora, and even Drax had some drama included to their characters which is a great thing. The story is interesting and the action scenes look fantastic!

","This movie is every bit as fun and exciting as the first. Right from the opening credits, you're hit with same kind of punch that Gunn dealt with the original. For the first third of this movie, I would say it hit you left and right, joke after joke, and that's what I liked the most. It focused mainly on the camaraderie of this group. What sells the first Guardians of the Galaxy for me is the chemistry between the group, and the back-and-forth they all have. The way Gunn writes these characters, and how he layers the dialogue to create a perfect symphony is incredible. And we got that for the first third of this movie. Then, the characters split up. While what each of them were doing was interesting enough, that camaraderie and that chemistry was missing. It left a hole in the movie, and the static energy of go go go came to a halt. I don't think these characters are compelling enough on their own. If we ever got a Drax (Dave Bautista) or a Gamora (Zoe Saldana) spin-off film, I don't think it would work. Even Star-Lord. It's when they're together, and they are playing off of each other, that's when they are incredibly compelling. But separating them in the manner that Vol. 2 did just froze the momentum..."
"ericostendorf","9","0","2","7 May 2017"," Guardians of the galaxy vol. 2 is awesome!
","I absolutely loved the first guardians movie. It is my personal favorite marvel movie and my second favorite superhero movie (with my favorite being the dark knight). So i was very excited for this movie. Did the movie disappoint? Oh, hell no! Could it be better? Yeah, a little bit. So let's talk about the things that i really liked. The acting in the movie is awesome, of course some of the old cast members are back and i love the cast. I think everyone is doing a really good job. And of course the guardians are extremely likable and none of the other characters are annoying. I'm not the biggest CGI fan, but as long as it looks good, it doesn't bother me. The effects and the cinematography were amazing. But you can expect that from a marvel movie. Also i really liked the story, at least most of it. The characters get so much more depth in this movie. That's good and not so good at the same time. I think the middle part of this movie drags on for a bit too long. I found myself being a little bored at the middle part. But my biggest dislike is that the movie doesn't really know what it's trying to be in like the first 30 minutes, and we as an audience don't really know what the plot is going to be. But overall i really loved this movie. It definitely lives up to the original and i'd love to watch it again. 9/10"

It really distracted me from the story line and could have used more dialogue.<br/><br/>Second was the reference to a certain TV star from the 80's...the first one or two times I laughed but after that it just got old and drawn out..."
"subxerogravity","8","0","3","6 May 2017"," It was awesome! A lot funnier than the first movie but not the action adventure the original was.
","Don't get me wrong, Vol 2 is a high adventure worth going to see, but nothing like the one that came before it on the entertainment scale.<br/><br/>You assumed that they got the origin over with in Vol 1 and they can just focus on the Sci-Fi space adventure in Vol 2. Under that assumption, I though Vol 2 was going to be a whole lot better, but that's not the case.<br/><br/>The movie is mostly about the origin of Star Lord played brilliantly by Chris Pratt, with far more funny references about the fact that he has not been to Earth since he was an 80s kid. As we discovered in the last movie he's half human and half something else and in Vol 2 he discovers his ancestry (And its connection to Kurt Russell starring as his father).<br/><br/>It's a really exciting film if you are a comic book fan who is familiar with what the story is unfolding, and the visual effects are nice in the film. The Sci-fi was high end as a lot of the alien worlds looked really cool.<br/><br/>And is ridiculously funny. Dave Batista's character as Drax the destroyer was less destructive and more comedy relief, which was funny to see Batista do(but I don't think is the full purpose of the character). Plus, any character interacting with Baby Groot was the best thing ever. Baby Groot was just too cute.<br/><br/>It's just that the action in this movie is not as good as Vol 1. It's like Avengers vs. Avengers: Age of Ultron. Vol 2 gets too personal with the development of the characters and their connection to one another that makes it more like a light hearted comedy, which was really funny and really entertaining, but different than what I was expecting and what made Vol 1 so amazing. It's like the difference between what they do on an episode of Star Trek (Which is what Vol 2 kind of feels like) vs. what can be done in a Star Trek movie. Both are great, but I am watching a movie.<br/><br/>Give props to the James Gunn who returns as the writer and director of this film, but I do see why Marvel has a thing about not hiring a director twice. Just like what Joss Whedon did with the second Avengers movie, Vol 2 was more about the inner turmoil than about them Guarding the Galaxy. So far that only worked out with pure excellence in Captain America: Civil War, possibly because introducing new characters and exploring the relationship between one another took nothing away from the action in Cap 3.<br/><br/>I was expecting a Sci-Fi high octane blockbuster, I got a fast past comedy set in space. I'm not mad, it was still a great ride (but better the first time around)<br/><br/>http://cinemagardens.com"
"venu_aleck","7","0","4","6 May 2017"," Humorous in places but predictable too
","I won't rehash the story-line here as everyone will know that by now. Instead I'll talk about other elements.<br/><br/>The movie has some nice visuals and action sequences but they seem to be spaced out too much with more drama in between than the first GOTG. Rocket is an obnoxious character here while he seemed to be just a sarcastic quick witted character in the first one. His change at the end didn't make much sense because it wasn't Peter Quill who ""gets"" him.<br/><br/>What I liked about this movie is that it showed other worlds and other alien cultures in a manner similar to humanity and the animal kingdom. The filmmakers raised the philosophical question that just because some species don't look like us or feel like us or think like us, is it morally alright to annihilate them completely and make their world in our image? This is the question faced by Peter Quill, albeit he attacks his father for another reason altogether (which by the way was COMPLETELY predictable and I saw it coming a mile away after the big reveal!).<br/><br/>The filmmakers show different alien cultures and civilizations on other worlds who are pretty much the same as us in terms of basic survival. They eat, they live, they reproduce and they too fear death like us. In addition, living in space has made Peter Quill VERY VERY tolerant of other cultures and species. So much so that he falls in love with Gamora who is neither white skinned (as he is) nor dark skinned but..... GREEN SKINNED!!?? Peter represents something divine in all of us which needs to come out to the fore. The film makers could have easily made Gamora a White Woman but chose a black actress and then made her skin green in colour to send us the message that we must accept people as they are. A good message in of itself.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, it sometimes drags on a bit and in some places it is so completely predictable that you might as well have been reading the script when it was written.<br/><br/>Good for a once see but will not hold up well on repeated viewings."
"trpakonen","8","0","3","6 May 2017"," Why do we Honor our Father
","Visually stunning, using all fractals. But again the message is way more than disturbing. Do our fathers and mothers demand respect because of their ""Ego""?<br/><br/>Respect is the outward expression of our internal Honor. They ""brought us into this world and they can take us out"". It is similar with our Father. He does not want any forced worship. But he does require and deserve it. Doesn't crave it like the others. The fact is that the buck stops somewhere. Ask any 3 year old child why and this tiny Root will inform you. Even so, I noticed on the poster, he did not even deserve a place in the picture. They did that to his name 7k times in a very important book. How sad your reasoning...He is nothing but Good. He makes the sun rise and shine on the un-thankful and disloyal. All can do what you want, when you want because of his Goodness. For now anyhow. And the last part, what do you think you can get people to rebel at the end of the 1000 years with a move theme? Now that is grandiose. There will be no one who laments the disappearance of the blue man. Not a one."

"LaLaLandSucks","7","0","5","6 May 2017"," It's an Okay Addition to the MCU
","This is quite an experimental film coming from Marvel. There are risks, but there are also safe spots. I thought a lot of the comedy hit for comedic reaction, but a lot of it screwed with the tone of the film and continuity of the Marvel universe. I don't think it's a bad thing to 2x the comedy up for Guardians of the Galaxy, but Gunn needs to know how to put them in the right spot so he doesn't create a chain of uneven continuity errors. There were parts near the end that should've been taken more seriously instead it was very insulting. There are a group of villains that are forced to be there that Gunn should've just shown for 2 minutes and move on with one main villain. They do end up having a purpose by the end, but they are just a plot device to be used for the next film. I feel like Marvel should've made the decision to make this a complete standalone instead of teasing for the next. The main villain is a bit better developed, but really too over the top and just completely silly. I like the character development throughout the film even though two of them did nothing. I feel the worst development out of all of them is Drax. They do keep some serious aspects of him, but he's quite uneven and becomes an almost different character. At times, he was so over the top that he ended up being comic relief throughout. Like, actually trying to be funny. The humor isn't bad, it's not completely cringeworthy like the other previous Marvel films, but it's just becomes a mess for the narrative. The visual effects are good, but there are several parts where the visual concepts just look bad. There is not much use of the 8K camera, but when there is, the dynamic range is incredible. Hopefully, Disney decides to adapt to a full length 8K Marvel film in the future. <br/><br/>Overall, this was a fun movie even though being deeply flawed. I give it a 6.7/10."
"ReelLifeReviews","7","0","1","5 May 2017"," A fair follow up
","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 - Another larger than life offering from Marvel, but one that doesn't reach the heights of its predecessor.<br/><br/>When the first installment came out in 2014, it was nothing short of a complete experiment by the studio. There was no popular hero or mainstream IP to tout, but rather a collection of no-name characters and an 80's soundtrack. This very well could have been the beginning of the end for Marvel. The result was a resounding success, becoming the 10th highest grossing superhero film of all time. How did they follow this up? With poop jokes.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the last one was an upper-echelon comedy, but this one is pretty much lowest common denominator when it comes to material. Along with the aforementioned topic, they throw in a handful of crotch jokes too so the 10 year olds could chuckle. Too often what could be heartfelt moments quickly get turned into jokes or are made light of right away so as not to pull in any emotion.<br/><br/>There are some fun action scenes, but how they're executed ultimately ends up hurting the movie in the long run. In the first 20 minutes the characters are seemingly unfazed by massive amounts of punishment, removing any sense of tension for what they might encounter in the remaining 2 hours.<br/><br/>There are of course plenty of positives in the movie. It takes the time to flesh out the majority of the characters, which is something that is skipped over all too often in large ensemble pieces. You really come to know and care about these characters. What started out as a disadvantage prior to the release of the first one, has far and away become its strength. And the opening credits with Baby Groot might be worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>There have been some great movies this year that were basically undone by poorly executed third acts (looking at you, A Cure For Wellness), but this one is not among them. While a good amount of the film was just OK for me, the summation brought my score up considerably. Underneath the surface level jokes and bright visuals, is a lot of heart and an important message. Not bad for a bunch of no-names."
"regula1","8","0","1","5 May 2017"," A Formula Only As Good As Its Variables
","In my estimation, every Marvel movie has to have its own formula, which only really becomes evident in its sequels. Iron Man has Tony's creations turning against him. Thor has his brother issues to deal with. Captain America gets drawn into philosophical battles.<br/><br/>For Guardians of the Galaxy, their formula seems to be: 80s references, cool soundtracks, and trying to work together. In the first film, these all worked together to make an incredibly fun movie.<br/><br/>The second time around, well, the formulas the same, but somehow it just doesn't add up to a greater product, or even an equal one.<br/><br/>don't get me wrong, there is still a lot to love about this second outing of the space Avengers. This time, we find the Guardians in the midst of what they said they would do at the end of the first one: hero work and crime.<br/><br/>Once the hero work is done, and the crime comes back to bite them, the Guardians are stranded on a planet where out of the blue Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is reunited with his long-lost father, Ego (Kurt Russell). It seems to be a happy reunion, but of course not all is what it seems.<br/><br/>This movie does what all good sequels should: continue where the previous film left off but expand on what's come before. This expansion (those who see it will get the pun there) is most seen in the development of the characters of Yondu (Michael Rooker) and Nebula (Karen Gillam), mere supporting characters before, now with extra depth and both do a superb job of complementing the main heroes.<br/><br/>Where Volume 2 falters is in the usual pitfalls of both sequels and Marvel. The soundtrack in particular, while adequate most places, had only one scene where the song perfectly complemented the scene and will be remembered as being the Come A Little Bit Closer scene. It's a shame, since the first one had the Come And Get Your Love opening rat- mic scene, the Hooked on a Feeling and Pina Colada Song prison scenes, and the Ooh Child dance-off finale.<br/><br/>Plus, without spoiling everything, once the true villain is revealed, this film proves that Marvel has yet to make a second compelling villain to match Loki.<br/><br/>With all that being said, there is plenty, PLENTY, of things to enjoy in this film, and while it may prove not to have the timeless quality the first one has, it is still a damn good ride that I would gladly ride again, and so will you."
"trevor-82944","6","0","5","5 May 2017"," I am Groot!
","Okay, just let me say really quick: I am absolutely obsessed with of Baby Groot! While he was amazing at the end of the first movie, now he has legs for rocking, defining him as the pop culture king for an entire generation!<br/><br/>Now onto the rest of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which I should call absolutely freaking awesome! We all thought James Gunn outdid himself with the refreshing ball of excitement in a period full of blockbusters trying to be all edgy and stuff. Yet he outdid himself again with a funnier, sadder version of the original, guaranteeing howls of laughter from all ages. Yes, I said sadder, because the production crew did not shy away from an upsetting plot twist, only to segue into the quiet, touching final moments. U-huh, touching, as in, something unexpected happens that leaves a rather reflective note about all that you just saw.<br/><br/>Gunn has made the most emotional feature to come out of Marvel Studios thus far, as well as the funniest by a mile. The jokes are bigger in saturation than Volume 1, setting off the most memorable opening credits sequence since Deadpool, thanks to everyone's favorite talking tree! He could have benefited if he were written to be more than just a comic sidekick, but whenever you laugh, perhaps half those moments will be because of him.<br/><br/>Everyone else in the cast also delivers their fair share of belly-laugh moments, especially when Drax gets his own chance for romance with a bug-eyed mistress named Mantis, who can feel another's feelings with a touch. These two create the most moving romance, as well as the most quotable!<br/><br/>Yet it exists not just for laughs, between their snappy arguments, the encompassing theme of family actively affects almost the whole cast in some way. It answers a question never consciously asked about Peter's backstory: where did his parents come from? In addition, Gamora and Nebula confront their open-ended sisterly conflict from before. However, the conclusion to Star-Lord's father's story feels rather dissatisfying, I mean, it is not dark or depressing, just not fully realized enough.<br/><br/>To top it off, the laughs get a bit too consistent, giving no real time to breathe during some of the moments of drama; but it still managed to jump back on its feet and reconnect us back to the characters.<br/><br/>Speaking of characters, the fivesome explore more territory of their galaxy in a very down-to-earth sort of approach. New places are seen such as a snow planet filled with robot hookers, a vivid planet built by man himself, remote-controlled battleships run by gold people, and the woods behind a Dairy Queen in 1980 Missouri, where an alien plant thrives. One minor complaint though; I can't quite buy into Star-Lord's space environment as a world that could inspire future storytellers, since everyone speaks English, unlike more carefully plotted out alien worlds including District 9 or Avatar.<br/><br/>One last complaint: aside from all the old songs, the original soundtrack resembles the soundtracks of all other films under a similar genre these days. Although a flaw as minor as this one may not even be easily noticed; too many great qualities outnumber the bad ones. I also ought to highlight the phenomenal standout performances that display the best of Marvel Studios, particularly by Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, and Michael Rooker.<br/><br/>What else can I say? Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 outdoes Marvel's branding, letting go of the offensive dehumanizing stereotypes from all the previous Cinematic Universe endeavors. This franchise appeals to more than just the youth market and their parents; anybody can have a blast! The older folk will love the nostalgic soundtrack as well as some surprise cameos by familiar faces; the teens will love the wild action balanced with some smart humor; the kids, if parents oblige to the PG-13 rating, will want to dance with Baby Groot; and everybody, no matter how young or how old, will love the timeless bonds about family.<br/><br/>Can't wait for spidey to come out in July!"

"trublu215","7","0","4","4 May 2017"," It doesn't deliver like it should but that doesn't mean you won't have fun.
","Guardians of the Galaxy was a surprise hit in 2014. No one expected the film to do the business it did, especially me. However, the film delivered on every single thing you would want out of a summer blockbuster. It had heart, action, comedy, thrills and the right slice of drama to make it a little better than your average summer film. Now, fast forward 3 years and we've got its much anticipated sequel. Many fans will absolutely love this film and rightfully so. James Gunn has done a great job with these two films and it will definitely be enjoyed even if it is half the measure of the first film.<br/><br/>First off, the movie is good. It is light, funny and definitely digestible. There is not one moment where you find yourself lost or wondering what is going on. That is a definite plus for a sequel. Sure, having a handle on the source material or, at least the first film, will help but it isn't really needed. Considering there has been a plethora of Marvel Universe films since Guardians of the Galaxy, not needing to brush up on some plot points is a good thing. While I could easily go into a 10 page essay on this film and its quirks and why it works, I am giving a short, sweet spoiler free review here. So, in short, the film itself is a decent sequel to a great movie.<br/><br/>The cast returns and delivers even more banter and jeering at each other than the first film which adds to the characters. Chris Pratt and the voice work of Bradley Cooper really tie this film's characters together. Supporting cast members such as newbie to the series, Kurt Russell or seasoned alumni Michael Rooker, all deliver with Rooker giving a career best performance here. The man is so good in this film, you forget which side he's on. It's not that you love to hate him. It's that you can't wait to see what he does next. The film's strong point is its cast and James Gunn knows it. He uses it to his complete advantage. We care about these characters, no matter how other worldly they end up being. That is a true testament to James Gunn as a director. He really does an amazing job both as a filmmaker and screenwriter. But, no matter how good of a job he does, the film is a bit of a mess at times.<br/><br/>Now for the problems it has...there are quite a few. The biggest issue facing this film is that it is too similar to the first. There isn't enough to distinguish it from the original and that is a bad thing at times. It doesn't allow for the freshness and inventiveness that the first one had and that was where a lot of its magic happened. Truthfully, the only way to distinguish both films apart are the soundtracks. While both soundtracks are awesome, they're both different in a lot of ways. From Blue Suede to Fleetwood Mac, that's the big difference musically...but visually, it's more of the same. That's probably the biggest and only complaint that I have with this film. As much as I like seeing these guys and gals kick some otherworldly ass, I still wish there was just a little bit more to it than what we got.<br/><br/>Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a complete rehashing of the first film with a new character here and there and a revamped soundtrack. While many will be happy with the end product, those of you who are wanting something fresh and new will have to holster those expectations. The film is definitely a crowd pleaser and will go over quite well with audiences and fans. At the end of the day, I think that is all James Gunn and Co could dream of getting."
"leubner85","7","0","4","3 May 2017"," a so-so sequel for Marvel's nerdy outsiders
","The USP of the Guardians films remains the deft writing by James Gunn. If the Avengers film scripts are the charismatic Alpha frat heroes, Guardians of the Galaxy represents the wisecracking nerdy outsiders. Which, let's face it, is always going to play well with a comic-book- movie audience. The space pirate steampunk aesthetic gives the movie a distinctively battered and cranky appeal. The story, which sees Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) unravel the question of his true parentage, goes heavy on themes of family and redemption. Still, in the generic, effects- heavy blitzkrieg of a final act, the film loses both the human(ish) connection and the scrappy maverick spirit that sets it apart from its Marvel stablemates."
"Eshan_2110","7","0","4","2 May 2017"," Character driven fun
","Guardians of the Galaxy 2 takes the audience on a fun but ultimately personal adventure with the rag-tag outcasts that we met in the first film. <br/><br/>GotG 2 throws you straight into the action, as the team tackle a job for Ayesha and the Sovereign (or rather, the gold people) And in typical Guardians fashion, something doesn't quite go right, which leads to the Guardians being chased by the 'golden people.' Upon this journey, we meet Ego, who claims to be Star Lord's father. The introduction of Kurt Russell as Ego was a great addition to the cast because of his charisma. He's easy to like and I found myself wanting to learn more about his intentions. His side-kick Mantis also helps add a lot of humour to the film. The dynamic of the team is the films biggest strength and really made for an entertaining viewing. The family dynamic has slightly developed since the first film, especially with Groot now in his youngest form. I have to say, I really did like the way they animated Groot, but I do feel like James Gunn really did push for the ""awws"" from the audience, of which I heard plenty. There is a general feeling that the group are a lot closer (except for Star- Lord and Rocket who continue to bicker like brothers) and it is clear that some time has passed since the first film, as they are now sort of cult heroes in the universe.<br/><br/>Each character has their moment to shine, especially Yondu, who is given a lot more on screen time this time around. Dave Bautista did really steal the show as Drax, as he did with the first one for me. His comedic timing and deadpan humour was a real treat. On the topic of humour, the film delivers on laughs however I do feel that at some point some of the things characters say does feel out of place. For instance, jokes about a specific character's looks often fell flat.<br/><br/>Whilst the scale of the final act is large, it unlike other Marvel films, is not fixated on expanding the universe and is instead self- contained-preferring to develop the characters and their arcs. This is something I appreciated but in a strange way, made the narrative feel insignificant and quite forgettable. The final set piece also takes away from the more human nature of the narrative. There were some pacing issues throughout the film. I felt that things just sort of happened for the sake of progressing the narrative and that the film felt absent of flow in some parts. <br/><br/>I think the one thing that separates the Guardians from any cinematic superhero team is the family dynamic because it genuinely works. The characters, colour and soundtrack are vibrant and help to create a charming adventure. The way in which in the team interact alone is enough to recommend watch this film."

It struggled to re- engage when they got back together but it felt bloated, self indulgent and dragged out.<br/><br/>By the time the third act kicked in, some of the chemistry came back but it was lost in an orgy of energy tendrils, crumbling rock and CGI overload. Once one cliff wall has crumbled without a real sense of peril, you kinda feel yourself becoming a little bored.<br/><br/>Don't get wrong I love the team but after shining so strongly at the beginning, it felt burnt out by the end which no amount of blue screen FX could repair. The strength of the film is in the team's interactions and I can't help but think they should have been focused on a little more than the obligatory flashes and bangs that had to dominate the last act.<br/><br/>One final word about the mix tape. It was over played to the point where you weren't sure if they thought of the scene or the piece of music first. It smacked of 'try hard' with a little of 'what about this cool song that we got the licence to play 15 seconds of'? I did go into the film trying to keep my expectations low but I have to say that ultimately I was disappointed, especially after the really enjoyable opening part."

","If you were surprised by the first movie, then this movie will look like a generic action flick Hollywood offers now-a-days. Especially first half of the movie was not entertaining at all. Second half saved the movie from being complete disaster. Action sequences were nothing special. Many jokes fell flat too.<br/><br/>Some of the characters were very boring. I liked Ego: The Living Planet very much. Yondu was also very good. Pratt was fine. I didn't find baby groot interesting enough though.<br/><br/>MCU seems to have a problem of their 2nd installment of a franchise. Iron-Man 2, Thor 2, Avengers 2 and now GOG 2 all have some serious problems. Only CA:Winter Soldier was better than it's original (which was a flat movie).<br/><br/>Hope GoG 3 will be better."
