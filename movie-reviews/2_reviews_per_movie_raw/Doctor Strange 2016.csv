","I was not prepared for the visuals this movie offered. Nevertheless, I absorbed it in its full glory. It was easy to enjoy this movie not only because of its visuals but also because of the quirkiness and lovable characters. A must-watch!"

","This movie is fantastic. I truly enjoyed watching it! <br/><br/>Unlike most other movies of Marvel franchise, there is a heavy emphasis on character development. This keeps audience glued to the story on a deep cellular level.<br/><br/>The movie is littered with spiritual themes which adds further depth to this already amazing story.<br/><br/>Those who like movies and TV series of medical genre are in for a treat. As the title suggests the story involves a doctor.<br/><br/>I also like how the story blends in and moves forward, in prefect synchronization. Particularly given the complexity of the plot. Quite a tribute to the three screenwriters.<br/><br/>Great movie, can't wait for the next one!"

","Doctor Strange follows a surgeon who, after suffering from a major injury, sets out to search for healing. Instead, he ends up learning about magic. <br/><br/>The movie opens with a scene that is both darker and funnier than most Marvel superhero movies I've seen. It sets the tone really well, and it actually manages to carry that all the way through. It is comedic, yet it maintains a level of urgency or threat to the entire situation that the characters constantly find themselves in, keeping the audience intrigued for most the entire duration. <br/><br/>The special effects were probably the biggest selling point for this movie. For me, anyway. I made a point of getting it on blu-ray, and it paid off. The effects are pretty trippy (for lack of a better word), and that's really all I'm going to say about them. I wasn't sure they always made sense in the context of the movie, but they were still pretty cool. <br/><br/>Unlike other Marvel superhero movies I've seen recently, this one is actually funny. The character of Stephen Strange is actually fleshed-out and realistic to an extent. He's an engaging character with plenty of faults and just as much charm. He's a fun character, and I get the feeling Eggs Benedict Cucumberpatch felt the same. In fact, basically the entire cast seems to be having a jolly ol' time making the movie. There's just this air of fun surrounding it. <br/><br/>The writing is actually pretty good, with dialogue that comes expected of a particular character, and a plot driven in a direction that makes sense and ceases to be boring. I never found myself questioning a character's decisions due to pure stupidity, nor did I find myself dozing like I have through the last few movies. It manages to build an intriguing world without revealing too much or boring the audience with lore and exposition, yet it gives us just enough to keep us interested. <br/><br/>Overall Doctor Strange is both fun and funny, clever and pretty, well acted and well-written, and is just an all-around great movie. It's a step in the right direction for Marvel, and I'm hoping to see them continue in this direction. In the end I would recommend this movie."
"mrpicky","7","10","11","14 February 2017"," Marvel at its finest
","I had low expectations for this movie after the trailer and boy that was a pleasant surprise. Doctor Strange is one of the best Marvel movies and definitely FX masterpiece. Strong story line, strong characters and stunning visuals. Mavie has it all covered with tons of humor on top of it. We are introduced to a new superhero and a new mystical universe. Its a classical character journey of main character from the gutter to saving the world, but there is so much more to it. We have some power, ego and responsibility dilemmas, teacher-student relationships and I cant stress enough how much work went into visuals. But Doctor Strange has its downsides also. Jon Spaihts and Scott Derrickson lack of talent in dramaturgy is very obvious. Many important scenes were done carelessly and lack dramatism they needed. Also many poor cuts made into the final edit. This movie could be so much more."

","I'm not a big fan of Marvel and, in my opinion, their movies are mostly overrated. This one isn't. This is probably the second best Marvel movie, after ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". If you expect a movie to have depth and the point, you should skip, not only this one, but whole Marvel production, but if you are looking for fun you are at the right place. Visually it is amazing. I recommend watching it in theater or at least on a TV as big as possible. Standard computer monitors or, God forbid, tablets are out of question. Although 90% of this movie is pure action and fighting scenes, compared to most of the genre, story and characterization are more complete and Benedict and Tilda are excellent. Sure, like in all Marvel movies, there is a certain amount of humor and finale is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in Marvel movies. The way Strange finally defeats the enemy is at the same time unbelievably stupid, unbelievably clever and funny to tears. I gave it 8/10 within all the movies I ever watched, but within the genre, it is pure 10/10.<br/><br/>8/10"
"aweynand96","3","323","513","6 November 2016"," Visually impressive, but utterly uninspired. Could have been great
","After seeing this movie, and then seeing the other reviews for it online, I felt the need to write my opinion in order to share why some did not like it and why I feel it could have been far better under different direction.<br/><br/>First of all, I generally like Marvel's films. They manage to put out new stories virtually every year and incorporate new characters into their ensemble. They've also mastered the art of masking each film as original and fresh, and for the most part it's just a fun time at the cinema. But the problem is that eventually, while you will always be able to pick new heroes from the massive wealth Marvel has created through comics, the formula, the acting, the uninspired scripts and classic gimmicks will become stagnant and even begin to bore the audience. <br/><br/>I wanted to like Doctor Strange, and I, too, was convinced by the trailers that it would be captivating and interesting and thought- provoking. But twenty minutes into the movie and I could already tell how this was probably going to go.<br/><br/>The acting was to be expected given the cast they chose, but nothing stood out. Benedict Cumberbatch played a convincing Doctor Strange, but his character was completely static - I felt no indication that he had changed in the slightest by the end of the film (which is what the filmmakers were lazily trying to portray), and I couldn't even figure out why he suddenly wanted to fight the enemy in the first place. The rest of the characters were poorly fleshed out, and I found myself caring little for any of them, a phenomenon that did not occur when I watched ""Iron Man"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". The jokes and wise-cracks felt especially childish this time around, and even out of place in the face of sincerely substantial ideas such as alternate dimensions and the fabric of time and space. Additionally, the pace simply felt rushed and awkward, and like I said before, I just couldn't find myself caring for any of the one- dimensional, superficial characters.<br/><br/>The plot was formulaic, which is typical and expected of Marvel; hero suddenly has powers, hero is confronted by conflict larger than himself, hero acts selflessly to save the day and the girl, hero returns and the film ends with some good old fashioned comic relief (Wang laughing, in this case). Normally I could enjoy this, but combined with the tepid acting, shallow characters and strange pacing, the whole plot and film just felt... tired. Even with the great visuals (which were truly impressive and to the benefit of the movie), I simply didn't enjoy it. I wanted more, a more interesting script that had at least a couple memorable or provocative lines rather than none, a stronger character arc, a better and more menacing villain (spoilers aside, the final confrontation was COMPLETELY underwhelming and mildly ridiculous), and, all-in-all, a more enticing movie. <br/><br/>I really think ""Doctor Strange"" could have been a lot better of a film, but I feel like the filmmakers were just flat-out lazy this time around. While I do recognize the cash-cow that is Marvel, I just hope this isn't the beginning of the end for their good movies, movies with at least a little bit of substance. They still plan to cram over a dozen heroes into Infinity War, and if as little heart and care is put into it as was put into this one, it could be a very bad, shallow, exhausted film.<br/><br/>3.5/10 for great visuals and a relatively coherent plot."

","I was lucky enough to be among the press-junket last Wednesday to witness this movie! I usually rate movies by different aspects, but i'll also answer some questions my friends had about this film which I also had myself!<br/><br/>Acting (10/10): This cast is amazing! They embody their characters instead of trying to act like the character. Benedict as Dr. Strange was a portrayal right out of the comics! Tilda as the ancient one killed it!<br/><br/>Action (10/10): Wow! I could argue the action in this movie being on par with the scenes in civil war. It was so incredible watching this scenes with million pieces moving yet focus sing on the main characters. Wide angles, long shots and great choreography. what else do you want?<br/><br/>Story(8/10) : This movie had a solid story and you believed what, how and why things were going on! Villain was good and actually a memorable one for once(stab, you're welcome dc fans). It was not flawless though. The pace kind of slows down before the final act which was unnecessary!<br/><br/>Cinematography/VFX 10/10: The images in this film blew my mind! There is a scene in the beginning where the ancient one shows Dr strange ""the magic"" and it is great! Some serious mind-bending stuff combined with great visuals to let it manifest itself to the audience. Most artistic movie yet of marvel.<br/><br/>Overall, i'd give this movie an 8.5. Though this isn't THE best marvel movie, it is truly one of best out there. After the disappointing Jason borne, jack reach er etc. we finally have a movie that lives up to the hype! GO Watch this movie in Max 3d if possible, because it is worth it for once!<br/><br/>Some questions that my friends asked:<br/><br/>""Is this better than civil war?"" - Well visual-wise on par, but story-wise civil war is better for many reasons including the fact that civil war had a lot of background information to work with. This was more of a standardized origin film. <br/><br/>""Is there a post-credit scene?"" - Ah yes sir! Apparently there are two, but we got to see only 1. <br/><br/>""Is this the most mind-boggling thing you've ever seen on screen?"" - Ehm yes and no. Yes, because the effects were amazing and things I've never seen before. No, nothing was so mind-blowing that it made me think different of the world or something."
"paulofigueiredo2580","5","233","375","1 November 2016"," Strange movie
","I had fun seeing this movie. It's an overall good popcorn flick. But if you are, as i'am, a little demanding about movies, you'll feel in the end that they gave a great amount of attention to the digital/special effects aspect of the movie and very little to the screenplay. In the end, if you're one of those weirdos who stay and watch the credits out of respect for the crew who made the movie possible, you'll notice that digital, cgi and special effects have huge teams of dozens of computer geeks who master an art that fills 90% of today's action movies. That's saying a whole lot of the movies industry these days.<br/><br/>The movie has a relaxed tone to it, almost like Green Lantern. The protagonist is egocentric and stubborn. His confidence is often mistaken for arrogance. The jokes are of bad taste. The dialogues are light and deprived of any seriousness. Even in the event of an eminent apocalypse, Dr. Strange manages to throw his puns and bad jokes. The multiverse of presented almost as a gratuitous event, a mundane truth accessible to anyone of travels to Kathmandu. There's no secret, no effort to achieve it. You only need to knock at their door, and the Ancient One will teach you right away the secrets of the astral plane. There's no sense of urgency, like for instance the urgency that drives Neo to find the truth about the Matrix and his decision to swallow the red pill. <br/><br/>This plot is old and recycled. It takes the Hero's Journey myth and put it to practice. And we've seen it a thousand before: Talented yet self centered person is set to trial and loses his talent/strength. Seeking redemption, finds a tutor. The tutor teaches humility and new found power. An enemy emerges. Tutor dies in fight. Apprentice seeks revenge, wins battle, takes the tutor's position. More or less, this formula is old and we all know it.This movie is academic in this sense. But it somehow works. It's light mood dialogues and absence of seriousness makes it digestible. <br/><br/>Well... at least until the last battle. Dormammu (one of my favorite marvel villains) is so poorly portrayed. Worst only Galactus in Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer. And the battle, the solution found by Dr.Strange to defeat Dormammu makes absolutely no sense. The Eye of Agamoto controls time in a dimension where time exists, but the the Dark Dimension of Dormammu there's no such thing as Time. So, how could the Eye even work in a dimension where the concept of time does not exist. How did even Dormammu succumbed to a concept to which he was not captive of of? Did the Eye of Agamoto invented time in the Dark Dimension? Of course not. It's just a bad plot decision. It's simply lazy writing.<br/><br/>The way they confuse so many time the realm of metaphysics with hard science like quantum mechanics, is astonishing. Like they were trying to mask the comic book nature of Dr. Strange (a sorcerer who is able to travel between dimensions with his magical powers) with quantum physics Wikipedia vocabulary. The confusing and unnecessary discussion between Strange and the Ancient One about the nature of the Multiverse, shows an attempt to minimize the ""magic"" of movie and make it sound more ... ""scientific"". Dr. Strange, in the book, is a magical entity. His powers are far beyond known science as he can do things modern science finds impossible. So the attempt to rationalize such character is in my opinion a big mistake. <br/><br/>Overall, is an entertaining movie, with cool special effects, pleasant acting and light atmosphere. Good Saturday evening flick. Don't expect lots of brains in it."
"ibynadat","10","460","759","20 October 2016"," A fantastic, excellent and glamorous movie with everything. A class act
","Without giving away too much, Benedict Cumberbatch just kills it. He is one class actor. Cumberbatch rocks as Strange and pulls it off with ease. The impressions his portrayal gives us is that he was born to play the role of the ex-neurosurgeon turned Sorcerer Supreme. Such is the talent of the lead cast, that it represents just how good the movie was overall. Every normal movie watcher will love the action, humour, adventure and fantasy throughout the film.<br/><br/>A solid new character introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with loads of potential. Cumberbatch solidifies and anchors his role in the MCU as Stephen Strange in a similar fashion to RDJ doing so with Tony Stark.<br/><br/>A must watch! Enjoy!"
"mortimerdiego","8","33","48","11 February 2017"," visually mind-blowing
","In terms of the quality of the film as a whole, I would give Doctor Strange a 7, but because of its visual effects and implications for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I am totally giving it an 8. Let me explain.<br/><br/>Watching this in theaters with the sometimes too-loud sound, seeing the buildings and streets give way and rotate and otherwise bend themselves completely to a person's whim, immediately made me think of Inception. But this was even more hectic. This wasn't imaginary, this was real.<br/><br/>Another thing. Finally in the MCU we have some sorcery, direct utilization of magical energy for combat. Discussion of other dimensions; even traveling between them at will. Doctor Strange's final outfit is just wicked cool. If you know the character from the Marvel comics, then you'll know that he's pretty damn powerful. Unfortunately this is an origins film, that is, it reveals how Doctor Strange became Doctor Strange the Sorcerer Supreme; the real deal will come in the third Avengers film hopefully.<br/><br/>As a follower of the MCU who's seen basically all of the released films to date, I was eagerly awaiting this one, and I was not dissatisfied. The music was riveting as usual per a Marvel film (Giacchino), the fight sequences intense, the otherworldly conflicts enormous. I'm so glad this guy's joining the Avengers in their imminent battle with Thanos, or at least I'm pretty sure he is. Now all that being said, Doctor Strange wouldn't fall in my top 5 MCU films; Captain America, Avengers 2, for example were much better, but it's part of the MCU, and therefore is a must-see for any MCU fan.<br/><br/>I also noticed a lot more wit and almost off-character humor in this film than in other MCU films. And of course, as all the MCU films are taking place chronologically within the same universe (or multiverse?), there are several references to the bigger pictures, i.e. the Avengers."
"krieg8814254","Null","213","366","24 October 2016"," Wonderful and Amazing Escapist Entertainment
","Way back when I first heard that Doctor Strange was being brought to the screen I was a bit worried. How could they translate the complexity of character and his true coolness but stay away from the cheeseball stuff? Dress a guy up like the books and remain true to the seriousness of the character? Well, they managed to not only pull it off but deliver one of the best hero origin films ever made.<br/><br/>The director knew that you had to establish and truly care about the character. Making it grounded but still trippy really helps give it a flavor unlike any other comic adaptation. The Harry Potter meets Iron Man meets Ant-Man flavor was there yet it all feels unique. The MCU magic is there literally. Everything established in the Captain America films and both Avengers pays dividends in a way here. The universe has been established wonderfully and this film does the best job to date playing in that universe. Everything and every scene packs some sort of punch and resonates with true style and heart. They really let the action flow but also allow for key development of the overall story and over concept. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. ALL the characters even the ones with smaller roles get to shine. This heightens the tension, so often missing from lesser comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. Add more than a dash of thriller aspects and a few new characters that steal every scene that they appear in.<br/><br/>I honestly can't think of one way to improve this film. The result is a movie that's just flat out exceptional and that honestly delivers the best visuals I've ever seen in a movie."
"Ramascreen","9","186","320","23 October 2016"," An incredible mindtrip
","Wow! DOCTOR STRANGE is an incredible mindtrip. Its VFX alone makes Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' look like some kind of beta test. And this film is so much fun, it's hilarious, it's got some of the most complex, most elaborate action sequences I've seen all year, and I can't stop geekin' out about the cloak of levitation. This is Benedict Cumberbatch making his grand entrance into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>Directed by Scott Derrickson who helped provide the script, DOCTOR STRANGE is about a successful, talented, arrogant neurosurgeon, Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). Suddenly, a tragic car accident leaves Strange's hands permanently damaged, which means he can no longer perform surgery. After trying western medicine, he hears of a man who was badly injured and then got miraculously healed, this leads Strange to the secrets of a hidden world of alternate dimensions. Under the teaching and guidance of the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) Strange unleashes metaphysical abilities and ultimately takes on the responsibility of protecting earth from mystical threats.<br/><br/>Created by Marvel's legendary artist, Steve Ditko, the character Doctor Strange is a very unique one because he's not a product of some kind of technological armor, he's not a nordic god nor a space alien, and he doesn't get his powers from super serum nor gamma rays, and so kudos to Marvel Studios for taking a chance on this one of a kind character because it makes for an unbelievably fantastic origin story on screen that's just different from the rest of the bunch that Marvel has introduced to us so far. And there's just something refreshing about that.<br/><br/>What a great cast, they could not have picked a better lead star, Benedict Cumberbatch knocks it out of the park. Whenever Strange gets a bit cocky, you can see a little bit of Cumberbatch's Sherlock attitude kicking in there. But Strange is more quick to sensibility whereas Sherlock would still have to put them all through his reasoning filters. And Cumberbatch's sense of humor is absolutely sharp. There's a ton of funny moments in this film but they never take away from the problem at hand or what Strange has to tackle at that very moment.<br/><br/>I'm Asian but I'm not bothered by Tilda Swinton playing the Ancient One, I understand this is supposedly the film's biggest controversy but the fact of the matter is that once you've seen DOCTOR STRANGE, you'll understand why Tilda is perfect in this role. The woman is an impeccable actress and she exudes the specific wisdom needed for this because in many ways, when you deal with a monastery-like setting where people learn martial art and philosophies about self- control, the expectation is that the master would preach parables, analogies, or metaphors in bestowing that wisdom and Tilda does it with ease like David Carradine's Kwai Chang Caine from the old ""Kung Fu"" series.<br/><br/>Mads Mikkelsen's Kaecilius, I gotta say, is not my favorite villain in MCU, I think Mikkelsen does a fine job but the character just doesn't land for me. But I gotta give Scott Derrickson and his co-writers much credit for introducing as many elements as they could from Doctor Strange comic books including Dormammu, and so those who watch the film and may be confused by the jargons, like the Eye of Agamotto, can go to the comic books and discover why it is important to include those in a Doctor Strange movie along with the manipulation of space, energy and time which is also another big deal. And that leads me to what I think is the film's most amazing appeal,.. seeing buildings bend over on itself, characters teleporting, and the insane things that the cloak of levitation can do because it carries its own consciousness. It really doesn't get more of a movie magic than DOCTOR STRANGE.<br/><br/>-- Rama's Screen --"

","Another MCU movie that the bandwagon is giving stellar reviews to even though it sucks.<br/><br/>The movie follows the same basic formula as all of the other MCU movies. There's quips, there's jokes, there's a McGuffin, there's a 1-dimensional villain.<br/><br/>Movie's sole purpose is another lead-up to the next Avengers. The mystical artifact Strange uses turns out to be an Infinity Stone. ""Shocking"". If I had a dollar for every time Marvel did something that took me by surprise, I'd be flat broke, because you can see this stuff coming from a mile away.<br/><br/>I swear, I almost walked out when I heard the wifi password joke. Not to mention the stupid cape being alive so they have more comedy in the movie. Comedy? My mistake, I meant cringe.<br/><br/>Marvel Movies have a tendency to love to have the hero getting betrayed by someone they thought an ally. Baron Mordo is a friend of Strange and his group in the movie. He's a villain in the comics. Anyone knows what is coming from a mile away. He doesn't go full bad guy in this one, but expect him to be full on evil in the sequel.<br/><br/>Another thing nearly every single MCU movie does is the fake-out death. A character will die and then in the next movie or even just in the post-credit scene of the movie they died in they'll pop up alive and well. Seriously, go back and look. Wong dies in this movie and Strange just reverses time and brings him back. The only character I think has stayed dead is Quicksilver. And there were rumors he was going to pop up alive and well somehow in the New Avengers scene at the end of Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>The warped city stuff isn't as revolutionary is people claim. Considering Inception did it 6 years ago and that horrible Devil May Cry reboot did something similar as well.<br/><br/>Movie is getting stellar reviews, which doesn't mean much. At this point Marvel Studios could just release a 2 hour movie that is just the main character sipping a glass of tea while sniffing a dog turd and it would still get critical acclaim.<br/><br/>You know why it's so freaking hard to enjoy Marvel movies these days? When everyone is on the bandwagon and everyone attacks you if you have a different opinion, and when the movies are praised for being ""amazing"" when in reality they're just actually ""just okay"" or only ""halfway decent"", it makes them movies feel worse to me because when they don't live up to what critics and the fanboys say it is. <br/><br/>Like Civil War this year. Everyone called it a ""Masterpiece."" Then I saw it and the whole movie only functioned because of the gaping plot holes. But if you point out said plot holes you get vilified.<br/><br/>I think this movie might be the last MCU movie I bother seeing. They all feel the same, follow the same formula, and the fanboys make going to see them insufferable. Maybe Spider-man: Homecoming could be good, but since they have Vulture, Shocker, and Tinkerer (3 1- dimensional villains) as the villains of the film, it looks like the movie is already setting up to be the same movie with different characters we've seen about 15 times now. Just watch, I bet that the plot ends up being Vulture trying to steal a priceless artifact and Spidey has to keep it from him, and then in the post-credit scene it's revealed to be an Infinity Stone so they can do another ""Look, look, shared universe,everything tied together"" moment that are tired at this point.<br/><br/>Why did I give it a 1? I'd have given it a five, but the over-hyped nonsense from critics and the Marvel fanboys just makes these movies feel worse than they actually are to me. A mediocre movie ends up feeling like complete trash when everyone is calling it one of the best movies ever and then you see it and it's just ""kind of sort of okay"" Especially when the only thing I thought was good in the movie was the special effects. I also enjoyed the special effects in the Transformers series, but as we all know, those movies suck, and no amount of great special effects will save a crap movie.<br/><br/>Movie also shows the problems the MCU will be facing soon. Dr. Strange is a D-list character at best. After they lose Iron Man, Cap, Hulk, Widow, Thor, Nick Fury, and the other characters that the MCU was built on, they'll only have Spider-man and a bunch of C and D-listers holding their shared universe together."
"spencergrande6","7","45","72","14 December 2016"," More of the Same, But Different!
","Perfectly enjoyable fun. Sound familiar? Doctor Strange being a different kind of hero doesn't really excuse most of this film's conventional plotting.<br/><br/>There's a much more interesting film in here, one in which Mads Mikkelsen isn't the main villain (yet) and getting in the way of the hero's journey and in which Tilda Swinton is even more ambiguous. Her obvious parallels to Stephen are perfectly apt and yet not allowed enough time to breathe and spin. It's all a last minute reveal and then a call to arms because plot and all is well because plot.<br/><br/>A lot has been made of the ""trippy"" special effects, and I guess they are compared to the traditional visuals employed in these types of movies. But let's not get carried away. Besides the travels through space and mind it's mostly buildings moving around like they're in Inception.<br/><br/>I didn't buy the last end credits scene. Useless and not earned. I'm sick of hero's with photographic memories. Let the hero be exceptional on their own merits. Action scenes could be less choppily edited.

","This is my review of Doctor Strange (spoiler free) <br/><br/>**** (4/5) <br/><br/>SINCE 2014s GUARDIANS of the Galaxy stomped all over the box-office with it's over $800 million boot and Ant-Man repeating the same process a year later, the Marvel Cinematic Universe have developed quite a knack for bringing to life virtually unknown origin stories in quite a spectacular fashion and that brilliant record shows that Doctor Strange will be no exception. However it may be the weirdest and strangest addition but by no means it is nonetheless an enjoyable addition as this cognitive story offers manipulative sorcery, clever screenplay, mind-melting action and mind-bending CGI it's fair to say that this will not be forgotten anytime soon. Get the thought out of your head that you never could see Benedict Cumberbatch in a cape, as he pulls it off so well along with that and the glorious devil look-a-like goatee that it looks like he was born to play this role and his brilliant performance shows it. The whole concept here is that this was strange from day one and the story written and directed by long time fan and look-a-like Scott Derrickson using his own vision this origin story is brilliant, and to put it lightly mind-blowing and is certainly a vast improvement over his last feature Deliver Us From Evil his vision and his screenplay are very clever and cognitive as the screenplay alone will manipulate the mind. In terms of the CGI picture the sorcery of Harry Potter meets the clever screenplay and the reality defying, world building dream worlds of Inception and imagine if those two joined forces and had a baby, well Doctor Strange is that baby weird concept but that's this in a bag. <br/><br/>It may surprise you to know that the insanity that is this movie starts out ordinary with Dr. Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) working his normal shift as a show off neurosurgeon in a hospital along with his colleague/life partner Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), until he is the victim of a terrible car crash (might this be a lesson to never text and drive) and shatters almost every nerve in his hand and has to undergo several procedures in order to get better. Until he finds an elegant solution which is nicely done in this addition he has to go to the stunning Nepal near the Himalaya mountain range and has to learn the path to power and the kind of responsibilities it holds. However at some points he almost gives up on life and sees no more strength to learn but continues on. <br/><br/>Naturally some origin stories of this style are terribly rushed and get to the action rather quickly and although at some points this does take a while to settle but with the clever screenplay and brilliant time bending and world building powers it's set out rather well, granted there are a couple of times when some of the scenes are just stuck together and some take a while to get with the story but who cares when the final result and the final battle are so eye achingly impressive, filled with a kaleidoscope of building splits, moving floors and also a levitating cape it's almost as if he stepped into a dream world but as the story goes on he realizes that its all too real. <br/><br/>It's quite the spectacle.<br/><br/>The first act is used to just settling into the story and introducing the many characters played by big international players, and also training with magic which is done in a very intriguing way as the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) shows him the powers of the mind and he looks very impressed as he has gone from a none believer to becoming a learner – this scene is both inventive and has a colourful kaleidoscope which looks amazing in 3D. The second and third acts are when the world literally turns upside down for Doctor Strange as he has to face Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and a great and powerful entity that he serves but he learns that his power is stronger than he thinks. Interestingly Kaecilius gives Doctor Strange some advice and also a shock which we won't spoil. During the second act there is a beautiful training lesson with Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) – this is brilliantly done with some very inventive CGI that shows the way he moves looking like he is flying. At one point there is a battle that has never been seen before in any film of this style and that is an astral projection battle between Strange and Lucian (Scott Adkins), which is just a gob smacking few minutes during the battle, and while they are at it they scare Christine this adds a bit of comedy to the scene. The clever screenplay also adds some hilarious moments where they are needed proving that the director can make a serious film with insane CGI and even add some comedy to the final production.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange may be one of the strangest and possibly the most insane addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe but is still nonetheless entertaining and this proves that Marvel are keeping a better record with kick-ass origin stories, that are a spectacular CGI f**kathon and if the end result is this entertaining then that is a record that shall continue for decades, much better than the record currently obtained by the DCEU who at the moment need a miracle to overcome the disastrous films they've made lately. Easily one of the best films this year and shall be remembered for ages and who knows may even repeat the box-office record set by Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man. This is a strange world.<br/><br/>VERDICT: The Marvel Cinematic Universe shines again with manipulative sorcery and cognitive storytelling as this may be the strangest addition but still delivers some kick-ass entertainment.<br/><br/>8/10 powerfully manipulative."

","The story of Stephen Strange, a neurosurgeon-the otherworld defender of the universe-is like a surname. A difficult destiny is the character, which he was able to push into the comic world, gently, with varying success. Charisma uncle is not deprived, but very much chakras-mantras-boddhisattva, accompanying his forces and abilities, went against the brute force of the reader's usual superheroes. At the end of the era, they forgot about him altogether, with a nostalgic smile hidden in that box of the sixties, where beads-rosaries, Pucci's prints, preparations for the expansion of consciousness and faith in the possibility of changing the world with a broad smile lay already.<br/><br/>In the tenth years of the twenty-first century, in which everything new is a tolerantly fused old, the name of Strange again surfaced. It was sparkling, you can say, in the name of the Marvel genius, to make money from the air density of scripts, good visualization and simple humor. While DC breaks both to itself and the spectator with its three-hour, high-flown epics, Marvel, though slightly podraasteravshy old lightness, is still the same trampled caring and mummy road - eat, viewer, our gruel. Do not push (it will not be difficult - we promise). Do not burn yourself (here's the PG-13 rating). Do not be fooled (we sent you sentries so that you will not forget, as it was in the previous thirty-two films). And how about writing a powerful wizard with esoteric powers and psychedelic patterns in this template template? Yes, a trifle, it is not even worth the trouble, it sits like poured.<br/><br/>It helped that Dr. Strange, who appeared to the world not in the best times for comics, is in itself simple as a one-color Rubik's cube. It was not initially difficult - for perception it was complicated by the surrounding situation of a tent under LSD. Reject unnecessary - and get ""I do not want to be a hero - it's dangerous! - I must be a hero. "" This is what the Marvel script writers used, revealing the hero exactly to the extent that it will help him to be adequately sequenced, trikvelizirovatsya and otsylnichat in the future. But there is one detail in ""Strange"", which makes it a curious movie for watching not only the fans and ordinary lovers of beautiful bubuhs, but also the comedian who is tired of comics, can bring something in a bowl with strong tea. It's about philosophy.
The Strange's world is, first and foremost, a psychedel, which was desperately lacking during the fighting. The fact that the hobo-neurosurgeon was flown once inside the consciousness warms the soul of some pathetic five minutes, and the rest of the time the Mr. Doctor runs on foot and fights with sparks. Not enough skills were not enough for the creators of special effects (the transformations of the buildings were very impressive, Nolan's team puts the class), how much imagination to show something out of the ordinary. Let's say that there was no need to get out of the way because of the desire to not stretch the target audience - which is sad, because walking around the universe of Doctor Strange is at times more fun than drawing another Zakovi, a standard eastern market or a three thousandth Hydra bunker. Believe me, comrades from Hollywood - we are courageous, we are not afraid, we will be happy to see your fantasies. Do not be shy and do not limit yourself, and then, smelling senses, Asgard was our last gift in terms of visualization raisins.<br/><br/>And a skeptical raised eyebrow is given to Marvel for another fused villain. Honestly, you simply did not know to which project to attach the extensive fan base of Mads Mikkelsen. However, this is empty: complaining about the clichés in comic films is like yelling at the wind, so as not to blow.<br/><br/>Enjoy watching"

","This movie has become one of my favourite marvel movies.<br/><br/>Each and everything in this movie is perfect. As you know Benedict Cumberbatch is classy actor. He has done very good job in this movie. Everything is available in this movie humour, action, drama. You know this is marvel movie so action is very good and graphics, VFX are unbelievable. A former neurosurgeon starts a journey of healing only to be drawn into the world, and become a sorcerer how awesome this is.<br/><br/>I am waiting for the sequel.<br/><br/>You must watch this movie.<br/><br/>Enjoy!!!"
"Anaslair","9","26","41","26 February 2017"," And this is why I love Cumberbatch
","This was my first time on IMAX and I actually did not know about Doctor Strange so I went into it fully open-minded.<br/><br/>And you know what This was actually pretty good! Granted, some things were not very realistic and the character development was much too quick in certain parts but overall this was very well achieved.<br/><br/>The movie is reminiscent of Inception and Matrix and I absolutely loved the first scenes, featuring the Ancient One.<br/><br/>Cumburbatch played this character wonderfully. He is witty and egocentric and even though there is development to the character he never ceases to be true to himself. Some of the humorous moments are simply hilarious. He seems to have been born for this part, much like Iron Man seems to have been created for Robert Downey Jr.<br/><br/>All the other actors performed brilliantly as well, though. Tilda Swinson was simply amazing and her interactions with Cumberbatch were so much fun and awe-striking. Rachel McAdams did great as well; it's not easy to shine in such a roll but she was very good and believable. Mads Mikkelsen as the villain was also superb. I had not expected such a humane approach to him.<br/><br/>I had a great time watching Doctor Strange and definitely recommend it."
"mitash","9","19","29","2 March 2017"," thought Benedict to be an underdog..!!
","Initially i really didn't hope that doctor strange role would be pulled off by Benedict but evidently i am wrong he's the one born for this role..! humour was one of the things i liked about the movie..it was great and subtle..the kinda needed in the film. It may look like that movie won't be able to keep up with it's pace but one'll surely realize that it's going over and over as the movie progresses."
"YourMyWifeNow","3","186","356","17 November 2016"," Emperor's New Clothes
","Despite the visual similarities to Inception, Doctor Strange (in 3D) looks incredible. In places it's breathtaking. Without a doubt, this is the closest to tripping you can experience in a cinema. However, all this eye-candy fails to hide the fact that underneath it all is a terrible, terrible, by-the-numbers film. It makes the same fatal error as Finn fighting Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens. The villain is powerful and experienced, but our hero, who is a beginner, manages to defeat him. This is only one of dozens of 'groan out loud' moments. <br/><br/>The script is poor and the 'jokes' are misjudged. If there's one sure fire way of preventing your film from aging well, it's by inserting jokes about Beyonce. <br/><br/>I can understand why Mads Mikkelsen did this film, as I'm sure he was well paid, but it's probably the worst film he's appeared in by a mile.<br/><br/>Lazy and formulaic. I give it 3/10 only because it looks so good."
"rbradleyactor","3","85","156","7 November 2016"," Fantastic Visuals, No Logic
","While Doctor Strange should be praised for its' amazing visuals and CGI effects, the movie is filled with a less than logical plot line and various plot holes, such as Doctor Strange throwing people into portals while they still have their Sling Rings, not using his cape in many various scenes with which it would have been extremely useful, being accepted quickly and without test into the temple simply because of his ""dedication"", and Strange being able to master the art of sorcery better than the dozen or so other sorcerers, who are almost completely ignored in all of the action scenes throughout the movie, while Strange is shown as extremely skilled and powerful at his newly learned skill.<br/><br/>This movie is for the circle-jerking Marvel fans that take shallow actions sequences and expensive visuals over a good plot. This movie does not have a shred of logic after the first 20 minutes, completely ignoring it for the purpose of looking dope and having intense fights."
"Red_Identity","Null","89","165","6 November 2016"," Pretty average
","I think this film hugely benefits from being something at least a little different from most Marvel films. It's different in the focus that is on magic and sorcery and all of that. However, it's still quite familiar in its arc and predictable beats. The cast is fine, although nothing ever really great. Swinton manages to rise above her material, as predicted that she would. Rachel McAdams also adds a lot of heart to her character, who has a lot of screen time but who is really likable. The action sequences here are really impressive and they make a lot of the film worth it. As it is, it's not bad at all and it's enjoyable, just nothing too memorable."
"monsterwarriormage","1","185","362","4 November 2016"," Dr. Generic Superhero Movie
","Let me get this out of the way first. Yes, the visuals and special affects were amazing. It was nice and polished. But that is a given for a super hero movie. You can CGI a hurricane or atomic bomb if you wanted to. Pretty colors are standard.<br/><br/>Yet, what is not cool is Marvel and Disney producing this cliché trash year after year. And,boy was this movie predictable. It was filled with plot convenience and plot amour as if they think the audience are a bunch of monkeys. <br/><br/>First, the backstory was rushed and poorly done. They show him do ONE operation to establish he loves his hands. Then, he loses his hands after screenshots of his manhattan loft and Lamborghini. And why should we feel sorry for him? Cause he is rich and has the means to retire or just teach brain science? Screw convincing backstory, we need to rush and spend the budget on pretty colors. It was insulting to expect we should be vested in this character. <br/><br/>Then, after Dr. Gary Stu moves east he meets the right people at the right time in overcrowded Tibet in 2 minutes. Out of plot convenience, they train the guy cause maybe they were bored. An few moments he is a martial arts master. In his first fight, the bad guys dispatch all the ally wizards, but Dr. Strange as a rookie gets a 10 minute fight scene and masters all the magical items at the most convenient time. He gets a magical cape to solve all his problems and even fight for him. I don't mind overpowered assholes like superman or Thor cause you know what you are going to get. But, Dr. Strange has a horse shoe up his ass or the screenplay was written by a 13 year old.<br/><br/>From then on, the movie is save the earth from Doomsday with people pulling random powers out of their ass. I like rules in super hero world. It's someone of a level playing field in batman or even some other marvel movies. But, in Dr. Strange, the possibilities are endless cause it's magic. So, what is the point of even caring. Here is some time travel. Here is some magic spears. Here is some magic portals. Let's fly. The movie is literally just special effects and you will get bored.<br/><br/>They are not original effects either. If you have seen inception, you have seen Dr. Strange. If you have seen any Harry Potter movie, you have seen Dr. Strange.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie is crap and you could find some equally entertaining videos. Don't feel bad if you take out your phone to check email or multitask watching this in theatres. Your fellow audience isn't going to be missing critical scenes from getting distracted. You could literally walk out and walk back in for 10 minutes and know what is going on, it is that cliché and generic. Avoid this movie and wait till it is available on Redbox."
"Equalizer16","8","107","204","25 October 2016"," Absolutely fun and what Marvel do best
","This isn't really a review, more or an informal statement.<br/><br/>So this has been the number one film I've been looking forward to all year (yep more than Civil War and Finding Dory) for a few reasons, one its a marvel Movie which I am a big fan off, Doctor Strange is a great character and story, and Benedict Cumberbatch is my favourite actor. (just to say I have more a right than a lot of other people to say that Cumberbatch is my favourite actor as I have been following his career for 6 years now since the first episode of Sherlock) All this in one is just brilliant.<br/><br/>Although this year I have been very nervous about whether it would be good or not. Don't get me wrong the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) have never made a bad film) but after some of the bi disappointments this year (Batman vs Superman, suicide squad, X men Apocalypse ( I like it but the majority of society doesn't)) and that the director Scott Derrickson has only produced not great horror films, I did worry slightly.<br/><br/>But I am so glad to breath a proud sigh of relief, as Marvel have done their job as usual in creating a great fun action film with a great story and well executed performances. A really solid piece of blockbuster entertainment and fantasy.<br/><br/>Doctor Stephen Strange is brilliant but arrogant neuro surgeon who's use of his hands fails him when he is victim to a car accident. He will then become so lost that he seeks help and guidance in the Ancient One, who teaches him in art of the dimensional and mystic arts to become a defender of his world to stop an approaching evil.<br/><br/>First Cumberbatch, brilliant executes the role of Stephen Strange, an ignorant surgeon who becomes to obsessed with his ego and then transforms into the mystical sorcerer supreme. I was concerned about Cumberbatch's accent but its absolutely fine so no worries there. What I love about Cumberbatch is that he can tackle countless roles and characters which is what is very clear here, by displaying elements of being an ass-whole (excuse my language) becoming a strong confident hero and also a quirky humorous fellow.<br/><br/>A big hats off to Tilda Swinton as well delivering an awesome performance as the mysterious Ancient One, showing off her wise craftsmanship as a teacher and skills as a defender of the dimensions.<br/><br/>The story is a solid great structure with comfortable direction by Scott Derickson, just a bit rough around the edges in a few moments, but nothing to make me go mental over the internet.<br/><br/>One of the big aspects of this film is the heavy visual effects, giving us a hint of Christopher Nolan's Inception at times (best film ever made). This wonderfully developed visual artwork really puts you in the realms of dimension and transports you to worlds never seen before in the MCU. I wouldn't be surprised to see this nominated at the Oscars.<br/><br/>This is a key aspect that sets Doctor Strange from the rest of the movies, as it enters a whole new universe of super hero. But that what I love about Marvel is that the super heroes aren't really typical super heroes. (Cpt America, is a super strength patriot, Thor is a God, Hulk is a green monster, and Doctor Strange is a sorcerer) Doctor Strange was everything I wanted and needed it to be, a really solid good, fun, Marvel movie with a spot on performance by Cumberbatch, can't wait to see him in the future movies. Great fun Loved it 8.6/10"
"t-sai771","4","119","229","15 November 2016"," Nothing Spectacular
","I went into the movie among high hopes. My friends told me it was fantastic and there were scenes that were ""out-of-this-world"". So entering this movie (with a certain elevation) I had high expectations. But it fell incredibly short.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting. Monologue, boring, no worth while story, the hero who just entered the arts of magic is now suddenly one of the best in the business in a short amount of time, etc. etc. Now I understand that it's a Marvel and Superhero movie, but that doesn't change the fact that the script is entirely the SAME for every Marvel movie on the characters are changed.<br/><br/>This movie was (for lack of a better term) boring. There were only three of those ""out-of-this-world"" scenes and those scenes were done well (save for the first. Focusing on a violently shaking your head side to side while flashy colors are beaming around you is lazy film directing at best).<br/><br/>The movie was not what it was hyped up to be by my friends, other critics, and reviews. It is a generic action flick with terrible attempts at comedy with the usual on-liner and unbelievable looks of ""How did you..."" then to ""I just did."" and act all innocently.<br/><br/>In short: This action/""comedy"" movie is generic, bland, boring, with few action scenes just to make sure you are distracted by the endless, meaningless conversations. I expected more from this type of movie. 2/7<br/><br/>P.S. This studio has become arrogant and lazy."

Then after a series of neat screen writing coincidences, a man playing basketball tells him to go to Nepal to fix himself up, so he does a Kwai Chang Caine/David Carradine from KUNG FU, but not as well, and meets two British thespians (one in a bald cap) on the set at Pinewood and/or Shepperton studios, one of whom rescues him from muggers in a creepy alley like in, well, everything you've ever seen, but not as well.<br/><br/>Then for the next eighty minutes it's a rinse and repeat of 1) endless fight sequences like THE MATRIX but not as good, with CGI like INCEPTION but not as good, 2) standing around in rubble making speeches full of words and names we don't understand nor care about; and 3) a scientifically calculated sprinkling of lame humour including jokes about wi-fi and Beyonce.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the middle there's a scene where he's not very good in training, then has a shave and brushes his hair and is suddenly amazing. And another fight. Or two. There's some more chat about villains and the dark side, but not as good as STAR WARS, and I don't remember what anybody's true motivation was for anything, emotional or otherwise. All this is then covered in a thick brown gravy of forgettable score that tells us exactly how to feel.<br/><br/>Further along there's a sort of climax similar to the end of SUPERMAN II but not as good, with a super villain who wears 70s glam rock purple eye shadow, then another bit of the climax that looks like a pumped up version of the end of FANTASTIC FOUR where Dr. House now has a cape and manages to outsmart a shouty CGI head by making him bored and frustrated, which is a little odd because the shouty CGI head lives outside of conventional space time, and in doing so probably wouldn't care that this might go on for a while.<br/><br/>Then, at the almost end, the thespian in the bald cap dies like Obi Wan Kenobi in STAR WARS but not as well, the glam 70s rock super villain and his roundhouse-kicking minions get dispatched in exactly the same way as Gen Zod in SUPERMAN – THE MOVIE, but not as well. After that Dr. House's best mate, as they always do, gets a bit annoyed at something and decides to go off to be the villain in the sequel. Dr. House talks a bit about the upcoming sequels with another mate then stands next to a window looking serious.<br/><br/>At the end there's a caption on screen telling us there's going to be a sequel.<br/><br/>And that's it. The epitome of average."

","I don't normally go these types of films, and I should have learned my lesson after going to see the latest Star Wars instalment last year. I had read the special effects in 3D were worth the admission price alone, so I thought it would at least be entertaining.<br/><br/>It started off well enough with Cumberbatch playing a self centred neurosurgeon. But from the moment he arrived in Nepal I didn't have a clue what was going on. Very quickly, Strange had picked up all sorts of supernatural powers by reading a few books, and after a few rumbles with friends and foe alike, was suddenly fighting to save planet earth.<br/><br/>There was an array of 'Red Dwarf' type gadgets which we were supposed to take seriously and Strange mastered them all. Even the 'magic cape' flew towards him. <br/><br/>I really couldn't have cared less about any of the characters, and it was a relief when the Ancient One (lol) finally died and Strange did not resurrect her by turning back time.<br/><br/>Needless to say Strange saved the planet, and I think the moral of the story was not to use your mobile phone while speeding in your sports car."

But are special effects enough to make a movie? I don't think so. There is really no story. No tension. Why no mind-games? One might expect these with Benedict Cumberbatch as the lead. Why wasn't Dr. Strange faced with some terrible ethical dilemma? The climactic scene is pathetic, with no drama, no suspense. Do truly evil beings REALLY always keep their word? Sophomoric writing throughout, and some good actors trying hard to make something of it, but they were doomed to failure."

The last time they went for source material that sounded pretty odd on paper was Guardians Of The Galaxy, and director James Gunn and his team gave us one of the best reviewed and most loved films within the genre.<br/><br/>The stellar cast and marketing certainly had many people thinking this had potential to be up there with the best. It certainly is one of the most entertaining and is a welcomed addition to the MCU.<br/><br/>The one element that people were most nervous about is that would the mythology work on screen to fit into other Marvel movies. Yes there is a lot of mythology, and I certainly got swept away with it. I understood it by the end of it, it got me excited when certain things were happening and it made me think how the other Marvel superheroes would cope with the mystical power of Doctor Strange.<br/><br/>With the film going into magic effectively, it will be hard for some people to take it seriously. I can confidently say that the cast and crew certainly knew when to take it seriously and inject some fun into it. That will be a big reason for this to be a big success in the box office and with the critics.<br/><br/>The cast is probably the most high-calibre Marvel have ever conjured up, and they did a good job. Benedict Cumberbatch was the perfect choice for Dr. Stephen Strange. You believed his origin story and transformation. He IS Dr. Strange. Tilda Swinton was terrific was The Ancient One. I am big fan of her work and she definitely brought it in this one. Sadly, there were moments where I was confused as to why her character was not there. But that is the fault in the departments. Chiwitel Ejiofor and Rachel McAdams were serviceable as the main supporting roles. Benedict Wong also had great comedic relief when needed. The big question in any Marvel movie recently, is if the villain will be a memorable one. While Mads Mikkelsen's character was certainly not the worst, it still was not a strong one.<br/><br/>The strongest parts of the film for me were the action and the visual effects. The action is certainly some of the best in the MCU and in all of Marvel's films. They make great use of the abilities are characters had, and it had moments that even Christopher Nolan would have liked to have used in Inception. I loved those moments as I consider that film to be perfect. The imagery that the visual effects used was mind-blowing and really messed with your mind at times. The fantastic opening scene and use of visual effects will certainly give you a taste of what is to come.<br/><br/>The only stopping me from giving a very good rating is the writing and story development. While it is perfectly fine and serviceable, it is nothing exceptional. The writing was nothing to shout about, and the story development felt the standard Marvel structure that I have seen with many of their features.<br/><br/>That being said, there is lots to enjoy and I had a lot of fun with this. The action and visual effects is some of the best from this studio. A lot of the acting was great and helped the source material make sense to the mainstream audience. Another thing that worked like all Marvel films do, is the comedy. There are some good laugh- out- loud moments that are all well executed, and never felt forced or out of place.<br/><br/>Another usual thing with Marvel films is the credits scenes. In this particular one, there is both a mid and post credits scene. The mid- credits scene is a cool idea, but I felt the execution of it pretty much felt like an spoon-feeding moment to tell everyone what is coming up next. The post-credits scene was better executed and was a nice tease to see which path the next Doctor Strange installment might go down.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

","Poorly scripted film, with no intention (or in any event achievement) of character development. The result - I just did not care what happened to who.<br/><br/>An example - Dr S is a top notch surgeon who must have achieved top notchedness by amongst other things assessing risks. So - said Dr decides to drive a car at silly speeds, in silly weather, in a silly way and then decides it would be cool to forget the driving and take a phone call; and look at a medical image.<br/><br/>Another example - Dr S gets a right kicking in Nepal from some serious heavies.

"mcmvision","4","58","119","9 November 2016"," Not as good as I expected
","So, we are getting magical now. From the trailer I was hoping for a thrill ride of a movie. I saw the movie in 3D and the Inception-like effects were the most anticipated by me to see. To be noted that I never felt sick by 3D but those effects were so 2005, like in a bad computer game, that a felt a little sick. The effects in Inception are top-notch compared to this version. I mean, Marvel Studios has now enough money to make great special effects, why are all the effects in the mirror dimension so bad? Remember Legolas from LotR jumping around? So bad were the effects. The other special effects of the movie were OK.<br/><br/>The story was OK, but not great. There was never a real villain. Mads was great, as usual, but the role was not interesting enough. The Ancient One was not good at all, just annoying. This was a very bad role for Tilda, who was always great, but now... she is just not convincing. She was just there, stiff, forgettable and bland. <br/><br/>Forget about the plot holes, just focus of the fact that Dr. Strange saves the Earth just a few scenes after he learns how to open a door to another dimension/ place. Maybe his photographic memory is helping him, but he has no time to practice, he just beats wizards that practice magic for some years now, and he also is smart enough to save the world. As the movie unfolds you have the feeling that from the learning of spells stage, Dr. Strange jumps directly to the saving the world, and it just feel like there were a lot of missing steps, or scenes. Maybe they will release an extended version, because like this, the movie feels chopped.<br/><br/>I know that people are going to praise this movie, because everything Marvel is gold, but for me only the first movie of every superhero in the MCU was good. All the sequels were just bad, and cashed on the success of the franchise. Now Dr. Strange was not so good from the beginning, so there is place for improvement in the next one."

","Hearing praise from a family friend for Captain America: Civil War,I found the flick to revive my interest in the Comic-Book movie genre. Sadly missing the chance to see it on the big screen,I was pleased to spot find the latest Marvel issue on DVD,which led to me going to meet the good doctor.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Credited as one of the best neurosurgeons, Dr.Stephen Strange walks round with an arrogance of knowing that he is the best. Checking patient reports as he drives home,Strange gets in a terrible crash that leaves him without the use of his hands. Sinking into depression,Strange is shocked to learn during rehab of a patient with a broken back,who went to ""The East"" and came back walking home. Locating the ""healing temple"",Strange soon finds his broken hands opening another dimension.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Doing well at wearing a fake US accent oddly similar to the one fellow British actor Hugh Laurie used in House, Benedict Cumberbatch gives a very good performance as Strange. Aware of his brilliance, Cumberbatch gives Strange a comedic line of arrogance,which are handled by Cumberbatch with a grit of Strange having to find superpowers to save his own life. Losing his eyes for CGI specs, Mads Mikkelsen still finds space to get his teeth into a boo-his performance as Kaecilius,while Tilda Swinton gets into the mystical groove as Strange teacher The Ancient One.<br/><br/>Keeping links to the Marvel Universe limited to an end-credits scene,the screenplay by co-writer/(with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill) director Scott Derrickson rolls out a fizzy mix of Martial Arts Action and shiny Comic-Book origin magic. Despite the ending being abrupt and Strange's ex being pushed to the sidelines,the writers make the flaws ones easy to forgive,thanks to Strange's new psychedelic world giving the Comic-Book origins a refreshing spin.<br/><br/>Bringing ""magic"" into Marvel flicks,director Derrickson and cinematographer Ben Davis present a spectacular kaleidoscope world,seamlessly looping real locations with overlapping CGI that superbly alters the ""real world"" appearance. Sending Strange round the planet of every universe, Derrickson bravely dips into surrealism,as Strange discovers his powers in a cosmic wave of purple planets and gold/green psychedelic tides,as Strange becomes the strangest Marvel superhero."

","Is there anything more kiddie than a Disney Marvel production that disneyfies characters from the original work and turns them into punching bag for cheap laughs? We get it, the majority of people going to the theater for MCU films are kiddies. That doesn't mean you should change the original work and overwrite the author's intentions for lame jokes and laughs. What is the reason in this case with Tilda Swinton and the Ancient One? It's lame, unnecessary. <br/><br/>Marvel also mishandled the response with Swinton outright lying by saying that the character was never meant to be Asian. Of course it was. From Wikipedia: ""The character who would eventually become the Ancient One was born in Kamar-Taj, ""a hidden land high in the Himalayas"". This was done of course for the kiddies sjw who can't handle strong man characters.<br/><br/>As mature marvel fans we should all boycott these terrible kiddie mcu films.

"keyope","3","59","123","2 November 2016"," By the numbers fluff
","I'd read some gushing reviews about this film in the press that claimed it was a masterpiece of originality, so I decided to go watch it. My gut instinct with superhero films is that if they're made by Marvel they are very formulaic and if they're made by DC they tend to be an overlong mess. This film just confirmed that I should trust my gut instinct. Benedict Cumberbatch is well cast, in fact I don't think I could quibble with any of the actors performances, but the script was a typical superhero origin film with no surprises. They gave Dr Strange spiritual powers instead of the usual ""medical experiment gone wrong""scenario, but that just added to the feeling of overall silliness about this film. Nothing in the script made me care about any of the characters and plot-wise this was an attempt at ripping off the Matrix but with magic instead of Kung fu etc. And for the umpteenth time in one of these films it ended with a big CGI fight to save the world. I mean really? Can't these people come up with anything different? The sight of Cumberbatch and the rest running around the city streets in their silly capes and LOTR style costumes was laughable. I've seen some terrible films this year, like Suicide Squad, Star Trek Beyond, Ghostbusters, Batman v Superman, Independence Day, Magnificent Seven, to name just a few. What a complete lack of originality we're having dumped on us this year. I think Independence Day was the worst one but this runs it pretty close. Really naff."

","Doctor Strange is basically about Dr. Stephen Strange, A brilliant yet arrogant doctor. Who got in a car accident (As we all seen in Trailers.) And found The Ancient One in Nepal who got stunning powers then asked by Strange to teach him to become also a powerful human. I found this movie pretty damn great! Saw it on 2D, Even though it's not intense as 3D. You can still see the intensity, the awesomeness of this movie. The first Pro is Cumberbatch. He did a very great job in this movie. The visual effects is also very good. Even though it's not as good as The Avengers and The Winter Soldier. It's still a little better than Civil War. McAdams did also a really good job. I like her in Spotlight and Southpaw. I also like Chiwetel Ejiofor. I like him on 12 Years A Slave that's why i owe that on DVD. Overall, this movie is a great powerful movie. 9/10"
"michaellaing71","8","33","65","25 October 2016"," One of the Better, though not the best Marvel film
","Right lets get to the Elephant in the room. Tilda Swinton isn't Asian (in the comic the character comes from (Kamar-Taj (Near Tibet)) (In the film they say she is Gaelic). Doctor Strange is an American comic, created by Americans and the film is funded by an American studio, so I don't particularly care that the film is catered for an American/European audience. I also don't care that Baron Mordo is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, when the character was originally white coming from Transylvania. What I care about is the performances and I will get to that in a while.<br/><br/>Right now we have got that out of the way, lets get on with the review. Doctor Strange is one of the most interesting characters from the Marvel universe and generally Marvel studio's had done a very good job bringing the character to the big screen.<br/><br/>Story, Direction, Cinematography and effects The film isn't particularly ground breaking and Doctor Stranges ark isn't something not seen in many of the Marvel films and doesn't hold too many surprises. The script is generally good, though I would say the villains are under written and they lack much dialogue and character. Whilst the villains are under written the opposite is true for the heroes, with some really great dialogue for Cumberbatch and Swinton (more on performance below). Marvel are very good at getting the tone of the film right, between humour and seriousness and again they succeed with this film, there are several laugh out load moments, less than Guardians of the Galaxy but enough to be enjoyable. The serious moments have enough gravitas to forward the story line and make you wonder if everything is what it seems.<br/><br/>Director Scott Derrickson does a good job of directing and Ben Davis's cinematography is great. Doctor Strange is very much an effects film and it must be very hard to do the cinematography for a film like this. The effects are very important to this film and generally they are very good. I watched the film in 2D but I did get the feeling they were designed for 3D, this can feel like a conflict of interest and does lose something in translation unfortunately but even then it doesn't hugely harm the film.<br/><br/>Acting Benedict Cumberbatch has done a good job bringing Doctor Strange to the screen. Doctor Strange is not a simple character and Benedict manages to show both the good and the bad without making him unlikable. The character does go through an obvious ark through the film.<br/><br/>Tilda Swindon is a great actress and for me and she lights up the screen when ever she is in a scene. She really inhabits the character and gives a great performance.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor, again another very fine actor and to begin with he is very good but as the film goes on, he isn't given quite enough to convince of his final position in the film, which is a real pity.<br/><br/>Benedict Wong is great fun in the film (when he is in the film) and is in much of the comic relief (though not the butt of).<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is OK but she isn't given a huge amount to do beyond the first act.<br/><br/>Mads Mikkelsen unfortunately isn't given enough to really bring his character to life, which is a shame, the character is a little understated, which is a pity as he is another exceptional actor but Marvel often don't quite get their villains right and unfortunately, this is the case in Doctor Strange.<br/><br/>Scott Adkins has been doing some good work in a lot of roles, often playing the main henchman is big movies (though he has stared in a few films). Unfortunately, the character is completely under developed and could have been built much better. What he does bring is his martial art skills, which whilst again being slightly wasted are used enough to create a good action scene in the film.<br/><br/>As for the other henchmen/woman again they are very under developed and it just feels like they are the to be taken down by the protagonist.<br/><br/>Score and sound design.<br/><br/>The score goes through various moments but ultimately there was something that bugged me, with it which I only realised towards the end. It has been done by Michael Giacchino who also did the modern Star Trek films and the riffs of the film are very similar (its similar to the way James Horner scored Battle Beyond the Stars and then did a similar version for Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (though I much prefer Horner's score over Giacchino)). This is not to say that that Giacchino score is bad, it isn't it matches scenes well and there is some good stuff, I just wish there was more original sounding stuff.<br/><br/>The rest of the sound design works really well giving an epic feel Conclusion I really enjoyed Doctor Strange despite its problems and I would be tempted to go and see it in 3D just for the effects. At the heart of the film are the strong performances of Cumberbatch and Swinton and they make the film worth watching on its own. I don't think it is Marvel's best film but it is a good entry and does enough to make it fun and interesting."
"FlashCallahan","10","32","63","25 October 2016"," Doctor Strange....or how I stopped worrying about comic films...
","So Marvel have gone and done it again, and raised a new bar in this wild comic book genre that has taken over Hollywood ever since Tony Stark injured his chest...<br/><br/>Dr. Stephen Strange life changes forever after a horrific car accident robs him of the use of his genius neuro-surgeon hands. <br/><br/>When medicine fails him, he is forced to look for alternative therapy, in an unlikely place, known as Kamar-Taj. He quickly learns that this is not just a place for healing, but also the front line of a battle against dark forces bent on destroying our reality. <br/><br/>Before long Strange, armed with newly acquired magical powers, is forced to choose whether to return to his life of award winning surgery, or leave it behind to defend the world as one of the most powerful sorcerers that has ever lived.......<br/><br/>The comparisons to Inception and The Matrix are there, and they are wonderfully reminiscent of those two films, if you look beyond those two behemoths, you find yourself comparing this work of genius to Russells Altered States, and even in some instances Kubricks 2001 and Koyanisqattsi.<br/><br/>If The Winter Soldier was Marvels venture into the political conspiracy thrillers of the seventies,then Doctor Strange is Marvels psychedelic trip into a wonderland of visceral set pieces, delicious special effects, and a plethora of wonderfully talented actors putting in some truly great performances. AKA, there is no chewing of scenery in this film.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch is wonderfully egocentric as the titular character and for the first act, he is a very unlikable and selfish person, which when you consider that this is a franchise opener, it's a risky choice for the studio, but thankfully it pays off well, as he discovers to respect his new found power.<br/><br/>Swinton is the Morpheus of the film, clearly enjoying every second she has on screen, and makes for one interesting and memorable mentors we have seen in a while.<br/><br/>Mikkelsen almost dominates the film as the villain, another wonderful actor clearly enjoying his role, because not only is he a very formidable villain, he is quite amusing when he isn't destroying the earth.<br/><br/>Ejiofor is good, but it's pretty clear toward the end of the second act that there are bigger things to come from his character in later films, as for the majority of the film he is Basil Exposition, and explaining the wonderful philosopher the film has.<br/><br/>McAdams is wasted in her role, and although she is always watchable, she has no need to be in the film, as she never appears to be in any danger like Pepper Potts or Jane Foster got into.<br/><br/>But all in all, it's a tremendous achievement, the film is dazzling, with some truly groundbreaking, almost drug induced effects, and there are some subtle, but very clever references to the Marvel cinematic universe.<br/><br/>It gets straight to the point with the narrative, and it's humour is wonderfully over the top, particularly the exchanges Strange has with Wong.<br/><br/>My only gripe is the obligatory cameo from Stan Lee. They used to be quite endearing, but now they are becoming quite annoying, and this one really took me out of the film, particularly when you consider the scene that is playing.<br/><br/>But all in all, this must be the riskiest Marvel movie yet. But it pays off, never fails to entertain, and dare I say it??<br/><br/>It's easily the greatest film in the Marvel cinematic universe, just beating Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>Essential viewing..."

","Firstly the only thing that made me enjoy this movie a little was watching it in 4DX. Marvel's formulaic movies are really beginning to let them down. Benedict Cumberbatch was probably the person that could have done this film justice had all the other pieces of the film been more developed. There is an issue Marvel have in their films where the love interest is so superficial and you don't become invested in the 'love' they supposedly have because it is underdeveloped. Rachel McAdams was wasted in this. Then we get onto the villain. Mads Mikkelsen played Hannibal Lecter and was intimidating and scary. But here he just lacked depth and motivation. I don't know what lets down Marvel villains more...the script or the tone of the films because none of them are ever intimidating."

Just another overblown monstrosity to cram in your face while doing the same with 17 cups of popcorn.

","Recently I think people have forgotten why we go out of our way to see a film in theaters. To me it's to experience something unique, entertaining, just to have fun. Almost every studio these days, it's all about the NEXT film, the bigger and better film. With Doctor Strange it comes to a new level, it's got flare, originality and that's why I think it's above most comic book films.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong I adore the team films and I love sequels but one day for me they'll get boring, that's why we need films like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange to show we can have original concepts yet still strive in a larger universe. The greatness of the film of course comes from it's ability to have an excellent story and it's visual storytelling to be through the roof.<br/><br/>Let me first say that in my opinion Benedict Cumberbatch is a superb actor who gives an outstanding performance as Dr. Strange, who at times is an ass but at the same time he's able to portray him as sympathetic. He allows his character to ""consume"" him and gives his whole which shows and results in him becoming one of my favorite characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Despite the lack of her in the first half Rachel McAdams also gives a great performance outside her usual rom-com roles. She wasn't one of those defenseless love interests, she had a part to play and I love that. All three of the mystic team; Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, and Tilda Swinton, as the infamous ""Ancient One"" are all fantastic in their own rights as well. Mads Mikkelsen, oh my god, he is so good in this. I've seen him in close to nothing and now I want to watch every things he's in.<br/><br/>Scott Derrickson, who I've never seen a film from, manages to have all these components put together beautifully and uses slick and smooth direction to enhance the experience and result in a hell-of-a ride. His pairing with the best cinematography I've seen all year result in the most beautiful looking film all year. Okay but seriously Doctor Strange has the best visuals I've seen in along time. It's just oozes magnitude. I was in shock and in awe for every sequence, my eyes were glued to the screen and I was so happy for that.<br/><br/>Although it follows the mainstream marvel origin story, Doctor Strange still manages to not feel like every other superhero movie. Of all the Marvel Studios' origin story's like Iron Man and Thor thankfully Doctor Strange is in the top tier. I'm really excited to see where the MCU takes this character because he has a lot of potential and had a great start here."

The visuals were absolutely eye popping, but the story had me 100% invested in seeing how it would turn out. It's also one of the fastest paced movies I've ever seen, moving along at breakneck speed for the first half.

","The next franchise in the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes with mystical and magical powers in 'Doctor Strange', which is a damn good start to this new character. 'Doctor Strange' was created by Steve Ditko and first appeared in Strange Tales #110 back in 1963. 'Doctor Strange' or Stephen Strange is a highly intelligent surgeon who is in the top of his field. In an accident, he loses the use of his hands, which leads him to seek out alternate methods of healing. This brings him to a mystical and magical place across the globe where he meets 'The Ancient One' amongst other sorcerers that help him heal spiritually and physically.<br/><br/>Whatever Strange had learned or knew before this, is out the window, as he learns of other worlds, universes, and powers beyond imagination. Soon enough, Strange has to help defend Earth, much like 'The Avengers' do, but on a different scale. While 'The Avengers' keep us safe from big monstrous physical threats on Earth, 'Doctor Strange' protects us from magical and mystical threats from other worlds – which in due time, we will see everyone come together and team up to fight some evil forces. At least I hope. Filmmaker Scott Derrickson was chosen to direct 'Doctor Strange', which seems like a ""strange"" (all the pun intended) decision given his resume, which includes mostly horror movies – 'Deliver Us From Evil' and 'Sinister' to name a few, but it turned out to be a great decision along with his writing partner C. Robert Cargill, who was formally a film critic from AintItCoolNews, who co-wrote this film.<br/><br/>The result is simply fantastic and a great start to the 'Doctor Strange' universe. Derrickson and Cargill have done a swell job in conjuring up a great origin story and executing each character's development here. From showing what kind of man Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) was to his transformation to the superhero we see later on – it all works. Cumberbatch is excellent too here, hitting all of the right emotional notes as well as performing the physical aspects of the role nicely. The script has a slow burn approach to it in the first half of the film, but is sprinkled with excellent comic bits and action sequences. This slower approach is necessary to really connect and feel for Strange and it works out perfectly, as if you went on this powerful journey together.<br/><br/>The only gripe I have, and mind you, it's a small one, is the relationship between Strange and Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), which feels rushed and tiresome, as it's been done before. Perhaps, there just wasn't enough time to really dig deep into it. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo was excellent and almost had a 'Serenity' quality to him, but was a very conflicted character, and he performed that very well. Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius was also fun to watch, but not the best villain w've seen. His makeup looked great and he did a great job, but there needed to be something more from him. Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One was perfect for her role and Benedict Wong as Wong stole every scene he was in.<br/><br/>The visual effects were out of this world as some of the bigger action sequences had things I've never seen before in a movie. It was done on such a grand scale too that I was entranced in everything going on through the film. Now I'm not a fan of 3D, but if you have the option, see 'Doctor Strange' in 3D. The visuals are insanely good and it was indeed filmed with 3D IMAX cameras, and not converted like most movies are these days. It simply looks phenomenal. I can't wait for more 'Doctor Strange'.<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

","For Doctor Strange being the fourteenth outing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe you would be forgiven for wondering whether by now things had become rote, stale and all too predictable as the allotted characters slot into place. It is with great enthusiasm and joy then that I can report that this entry is bar Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel's riskiest outing to date.<br/><br/>Stephen Strange is an egotistical, cocky, suave son-of-a-bitch and yeah as it turns out he is also a doctor; one that only helps those that have a 100% chance of being fixed up or cured. One day though he has a terrible accident leaving his hands broken and therefore any hope of him continuing his work is soon put to rest. Upon learning of a secret temple that may be able to fix him he travels and is taught the wise old ways of an ancient being. Soon Dr Strange will be the only hope that this world has to be saved from the oncoming doom that threatens it. <br/><br/>First things first let's get the bad out of the way and then onto the great. Rachel McAdams is fine as Christine Palmer (I had to look up her name beforehand, never a good sign) but is sadly underwritten. She has no depth, we know as much as she had a relationship with Strange, conflicted as it may have been. But we don't actually know her as a person, given this much time, eight years in fact it's sad that Black Widow remains the only female character in the Marvel Universe that has been served well. A minor quibble to be sure but the product placement in the first act at least is irritating and shoved blatantly in your face. To the point of embarrassment with Adidas and Coke being the main culprits if you require solid proof.<br/><br/>The acting talent here though is supreme, from Cumberbatch to Mikkelson. Cumberbatch of course imbues personality and a roughness of edge to his character without borrowing too heavily from Robert Downey Jr's performance as Iron Man. You only care more about him as the film approaches its truly dazzling climax that is a wonder to behold. Mikkelson's character may not be the easiest to sympathise or come to terms with but he's always intriguing to watch (Casino Royale was proof ten years ago) so it's a shame it's taken this long again for him to come into the fold as a central villain, that get this, actually poses a threat to our heroes.<br/><br/>The action dazzles; a mix of Star Trek's action pounding thrills and humour in the strangest of places with a dash of the visual wonder of 2001: A Space Odyssey for good measure. It must be said that it is not often if at all that I compare a Blockbuster to Kubrick's masterwork. Marvel once again defies expectations and for once a film in their universe does not climax with a gigantic blue lazer beaming up into the sky. Yes the consequences of the battle may be earth shattering but the film is too steeped in its lore and characters for it to be formulaic in its approach in the slightest. It borrows off of Inception without feeling like a rip off and mixes up the Marvel formula just enough to ensure that a feeling of seeing this all too often and before, not once, not even for a fleeting second seeps into the picture. DC could learn a trick or two from Marvel and perhaps may need to if they are to ensure their survival.<br/><br/>Scott Derrickson is to be sure a strange (see what I did there) choice for this project, not least because the majority of films with him at the helm have been horrors and none taken to all that kindly by critics. Based on his work on Doctor Strange however, should be a primer for things to come; intelligence, craftsmanship and action handled with rare skill and offering up sympathy for its characters.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is best viewed off of impulse with knowing very little about the title character. Its central romance may be underwhelming but rest assured that this is the only element of the entirety of the film that disappoints. The action thrilling, the stakes personal, real and potent, the characters interesting and a film lover's wet dream come to life in terms of the visuals anyhow. If you pass up the chance to see Marvel's latest on the big screen then maybe it's time that you had your mind expanded tooÂ…<br/><br/>A"
"joeytwomugs","2","40","86","15 November 2016"," This movie makes Suicide Squad look like art.
","I'm not a comic book fan (I did see it with one who was also disappointed though), however I do generally like the Marvel comic movies. To me, the films should be able to stand on their own though because if they are relying solely on the people who have read the Dr Strange comics they will have lost the vast majority of their audience.<br/><br/>Now for the review... This movie makes suicide squad look like art. The FX are overdone, the director hasn't really known how to express certain concepts and so has just resorted to quite cheap looking whizzing lights. The acting is okay but Cumberbatch is characteristically wooden and his character is unlikable (not his fault the character is supposed to be unlikeable). The female master (whose name escapes me for the minute) is too one dimensional to care about, the result being that there was no-one to root for. I barely remember the bad guys, they were way too (and I hate to use the phrase again) one dimensional and too many of them to focus your dislike on any of them. The plot also gets a bit iffy toward the end but I don't want to spoil it. ;) I know this is supposed to be on the periphery of the Marvel universe but it feels so detached from the rest of it you might as well consider it to be a different universe again. It's kind of like they have said 'and to hell with explaining the pseudo science with these characters, these ones are just magic, OK?'. And that may seem like a small thing but it isn't. It means that you can't ponder whether one superhero could defeat another because there is no logic to it that holds true throughout. It's just magic so anything could happen and all of it is on such a different level to what the rest of the superheroes are doing (fighting crime not alternate beings from other dimensions) that Dr Strange should effectively render them all redundant. I went because I got two free off-peak tickets of my choosing with a promotion on four packs of m&m's and I overpaid."
"tymbus","5","23","46","26 October 2016"," Not Strange Enough
","The Doctor Strange movie is OK but doesn't benefit to being seen on the small screen my cinema allocates to 2D screenings (It's hard to believe The Odeon, Brighton, UK once had the biggest screen in Britain!). I should have brought binoculars.<br/><br/>The movie combines a lot of kaleidoscopic effects with a few nods to the work of comic book artist Steve Ditko who defined Dr Strange universe. In a way the film is a triumph of visuals over plot which actually mirrors the comic book. Marvel has never used Strange to explore existing magical systems or Christian demonology instead relying on a few nonsense phrases penned by co-creator Stan Lee. Lee himself admitted he never expected to have to actually explain where the Many moons of Majipoor were or who was The Vashanti. As a result, Dr Strange's 'magic' has tended to involve firing magic bolts at his enemies . The movie's concept of magic is some gobbledygook about spiritual manipulation of quantum physics, with a bit of Harry potter thrown in in the form of a semi-comedic cloak of levitation that switches from a cute puppy to a rottweiler, beating one of the villain's hench people to death. The downside of this comes with some laugh out loud dialogue (Sling Rings anybody?) and when Strange finally has a heart to heart with his mentor, The Ancient One, it plumbs unforeseen depths of banality. A lot of the audience got really restless at this point. If the movie is like an hallucinogenic drug, this was its come down. <br/><br/>Benadict Cumberbatch certainly looks the part of Dr Stephen Strange, the arrogant but brilliant surgeon who turns to mysticism to heal his hands after they are wrecked in a car crash, Tilda Swindon (a bizarre casting choice) plays The Ancient One who teaches Strange that there's more to life than luxury apartments and a draw display of rotating watches. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Mordor The ancient One's star pupil until Strange comes along and reveals that his mentor is not all she seems.. As a Doctor strange fan, I was happy to see references to the character's slim mythology and a surprise appearance by Dormammu, ruler of the Dark dimension. As a throw away gag, some of the human villains are transformed into Mindless Ones as they are swept up into his realm.<br/><br/>In contrast, I didn't welcome the continuity tie in dialogue that positioned the heroes as Earth's supernatural Avengers. Perhaps a different director (Del Toro?) would have got to grips with the magic stuff. Since Thor and family have been retconed as aliens, I don't see, as an end credit sequence suggests, is a supernatural threat. Similarly, if the good Dr's magic is simply the manipulation of the quantum universe, I don't see how he can claim the title of 'Sorcerer Supreme'.<br/><br/>The origin by numbers story construction didn't deliver anything narratively special. Strange's character was basically Tony Stark in a frock. <br/><br/>As it stands, Dr Strange felt a bit too familiar."
"kbmorris-89255","8","10","17","11 December 2016"," Solid example of the classic superhero origin story, but with some flaws.
","Doctor Strange follows the typical Marvel action formula that's worked so well in the past few years. It serves as the film's strength, but also highlights some of the weak points. Benedict CumberBatch shines as a brilliant surgeon who is humbled after a tragic accident.Without spoiling the plot, He goes on a mission to regain his lost talents. Eventually Strange finds his true calling as a Sorcerer, and changes his life forever. This film has some of the best visual representation of plot events that I've ever seen. The reality bending action scenes showcase outstanding cinematography and realistic choreography. Shots are edited in a uniquely frantic matter during each fighting scene. The plot was decent overall, but it borrows heavily from previous superhero origin movies like Iron Man and Batman Begins. In addition, the story can feel a little rushed and more time could be focused on Strange's development as a Sorcerer. Marvel has struck gold again with this latest release, and I'm excited to see more it in the future."
"ElDiomedes","7","19","37","27 October 2016"," Visually stunning, witty and suffers from MCU villain deficiency syndrome
","First off, I was blown away by the visuals, and the way cross dimensional scenarios were portrayed as if a comic book page came to life. Haven't read much of Doctor Strange comics, although one of my favorite Marvel characters. Being a DC fan, and so far a disappointing DCEU, went in with high expectations to fill my Superhero treat quota of the year. Was not disappointed. <br/><br/>Now comes the story, it's your typical Marvel character introduction movie. Pretty much explained in the trailers, after surviving a near fatal car accident, he eventually goes to Kamar Taj for healing, thus begins his journey as the Sorcerer Supreme. Benedict Cumberbatch did the character Doctor Strange justice.<br/><br/>I think Scott Derrickson did a fine job directing this multi- dimensional CGI fest superhero movie, as the plot served it's purpose quite well.<br/><br/>Now for the negative roles, Kaecilius..once a pupil of the Sorcerer Supreme, the Ancient one, lost his way and turned to darkness, similar to the likes of Mordo in the comics. Not much had been shown to why he did so. He isn't that scary, and they mention his atrocities several times, we don't see them actually. But Mads was fine as he was, could have been much deeper and better. But that seems to be a common issue in the MCU. Not much depth added to villains to make them less scary ..to make them watchable to everyone. The henchmen of Kaecilius were just wasted imo.<br/><br/>Quite a witty movie, and there are laughter in very serious moments. I loved Benedict Wong and his comic timings.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams was okay, but she doesn't get much screen time.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor, or Mordo, again, lacks the depth.. which he apparently needed a lot. He is a real talented actor, and a very important character in the Strange mythos, so the writers could have done a lot better.<br/><br/>Music and the score were good, not the best in the MCU, but syncs quite well with scenes.<br/><br/>So the best part of the movie was Benedict and his portrayal of Doctor Strange, a simple plot and the extra stunning visuals. That's pretty much it. Overall, a decent movie. I just hoped the villains wouldn't be a let down like some of the past Marvel movies, sadly they were.<br/><br/>There are two post credit scenes, both are quite important. One at the end of Major credits, another at the very end. Don't miss those ! Enjoy ..a must watch in IMAX 3D."
"Fiahm","8","19","37","25 October 2016"," Quite Possibly The Most Authentically Psychedelic Movie You'll Ever See
","Early on, during one of the first of many mind - and reality - bending moments in this film, it hit me that the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' movies made the past 10 years are going to be seen in a half-century's time as just as classic and golden an age of film making as Disney's heyday in the 1940s, or at the very least, Pixar's rule of animation from the 90s on.<br/><br/>Yes, some are weaker than others - the second Thor film and the third Iron Man, for starters - but at their best they are very close to perfect, and so clearly what all those woefully misguided blockbuster abominations like The Force Awakens and Batman Vs Superman want to be. The elusive Marvel formula has been a fantastic balance of action, humour and heart, and this has all of those in spades - although if I have to pick any fault with it, it might be that the emotional charge is not as high as one might hope, and that's pretty much the only reason I took a star away. It was also apparent some PC coercion had influenced the casting and depictions of characters (white characters made black, male characters made female, and the only 'bad' or flawed characters in it being white males), but this was relatively restrained and unobtrusive and it would be churlish to kick up too much of a fuss over.<br/><br/>The most obvious comparison to the visual effects on display would be Inception, but I was struck while watching it, with my mouth open and a permanent smile of wonderment on my face, how this film technically surpasses everything in that film (and every other film I've seen too), but also how far more FUN it is than Inception.<br/><br/>So there we go, Dr Strange is a splendid, exciting, marvellously fun concoction that future generations are going to adore just as much as we do today. That's a rarity, and worth noticing while it happens."

He finds The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and Master Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who teach him about the astral plane and the infinite dimensions. Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) is a former disciple of the Ancient One and has fallen under the influence of Dormammu of the Dark Dimension.<br/><br/>This is the latest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

As for special effects there is nothing that we did not previously already see - and I mean in a bad way.

By far the best Marvel movie yet.<br/><br/>The characters are real and believable and both main and supporting characters have good character development, as far as will fit in a single movie. The plot works. It's a lot of new material, but it's introduced well and it just makes sense. Nowhere in the movie are you wondering what's going on or why. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange is a complicated character in the comic books, and Marvel did an amazing job at translating it to the screen in an original and breath taking way.

","Wealth, Arrogance, Loss, suffering then redemption. It's marvel studios winning formula that brought you the first Iron Man film. This film is marvels second shot at this arc and they really seem to make it work.<br/><br/>The CGI scenes were actually good which was one of my biggest fears going in to this film. The acting is good as Ben Cumbie (never saying that again don't worry) does an amazing job. It's the supporting cast that usually drag down marvel films but in this one they really seem to do great, Tilda Swinton and the dude who plays Mordo are great. If you have any criticisms about Rachel Mcadams acting please just watch the scene where the broom falls in the closet. That is genuine fear. That is good acting.
The whole trippy CGI thing is absolutely brilliant and won't age that badly, but the best part of the film is the score. Sure the story and acting is good and the shots are all fine but the score is just magnificent. Listen to a track called ""the hands dealt"" and you will find yourself loving this film more and more.
The best way to describe this film is as a cross between Kung-Fu Panda and Iron Man 1.
Unfortunately the villain of the film really lets it down as their performance is great and the reason they have for conflict is presented in a somewhat interesting way but I just feel like it was lacking something. A little more character development wouldn't go a miss.
The connection between Christine and stevie strange (sorry) is actually really good. There are whole plots that feel like they could go some where that just don't. It's both great and terrible.
The most important part of this film is that it is a great standalone. It has Easter eggs to the MCU but it never depends on another film to do anything. That is important as it means this film proves it can get by on its own.
This film is clever and serious when it wants but has the charm of the silly and stupid films we have come to love from marvel. It succeeds in telling a compelling story and the acting cinematography is generally great. It still has flaws and those flaws are oh too apparent. It is still entertaining and even tho it's not a perfect film in anyway it is defiantly worth watching at least twice.<br/><br/>7/10 - Master of the mystic farts"

","The movie ""Dr. Strange"" is one of the best movies that was released in 2016. It's about an arrogant neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch). A tragic car accident leaves Strange's hands permanently paralyzed. He wanted to go back to his occupation, but he needed to fix his hand. So he tried everything in allopathy medical but didn't find any cure. So he started to look other ways to find a cure.Then he founded a guy who gets fixed by meditation.First, he didn't believe at all, although he went to meet that guy and he told everything how he got cured. After meeting that guy, he went to the mysterious place close to Himalaya. When he gets to the Himalaya, he quickly learned that there is a battle going on that can destroy reality in a way. Before long, Strange is forced to choose between his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence. One of the most glaring sins of ""Doctor Strange"" is how quickly Strange masters magic. There isn't much tension in his arc. While he struggles briefly at first to keep up with other students The Ancient One has taken under her care, he's soon stealing sacred books out from under Wong (Benedict Wong), the sharp-eyed master who protects the texts at The Ancient One's behest. Strange plays by his own rules, growing far beyond the skills of those around him. There were deep focuses in the movie. Which showed the relationship between characters and objects in their environment. For example- when Strange trains with Mordo and learns how to use magic. Also, High Angles were shown in the movie. The camera was positioned above the subjects and made the subjects to appear small and insignificant. For example- When Strange gets chased by the villain Baron Mordo and the buildings collapsed. Overall I really enjoyed the movie. The director Scott Derrickson did an excellent job to create this movie. He provided the good plot, angles, sound, shots, lighting etc. The actors did very good job with their roles and contribution. Also, the director was successful to help the actors act their roles better. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy fantasy and action."

She is training him to combat the dark lord, the Dom in fight a metaphysical battle.<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about this film is that they were able to introduce a Marvel character in under three, even two hours. I liked the support cast but felt cheated by Benedict Cumberbatch who didn't seemed right for the part. This, coupled with the constant CG acid trip scenes made the film less than what it could have been...at least for me.

But still, at present, I tend to come across that flashes and effects constitute the main frame/value of a work.<br/><br/>Most of the above applies also to Doktor Strange, where even good character actors have limited opportunities to show their talent, when dialogues - even when witty - are artificially constructed, and the pre- ending scenes are predictable and consisting with action in the main. Yes, all is visually great and without ""bastings"", but the movie itself lacks novel approach and visions, resembling a known fairy-tale in a different sauce. Costumes and masks are great, but versatile actors tend to use their facial expressions and body movements while producing a wonderful role...<br/><br/>Acting 9 points, script 5 or so, in total - 7.

Obviously, it's not as conventional as the others, but if you read my introduction above, you can basically say the same about Deadpool (a guy with a normal life -> accident -> gets superpowers - > a bad guy comes along -> he has to defeat him). Doctor Strange might not have the uniqueness of Deadpool, but it's still a well-told story.<br/><br/>Starting with the pros, this is easily the most beautiful film of the MCU. The visual effects are unbelievable stunning, the action sequences (even if with some minor video-game-like scenes) are gorgeous and the Inception-like building's distortions are mind- blowing. There's a scene where Strange ""travels"" through this new world of magic and this is THE SCENE! The one that everyone will talk about at the end of the film, the one that you will watch thousands of times on Youtube and the one that you'll never forget! The only thing I can say right now is ""congratulations"" to the visual effects team, they just won themselves an Oscar!<br/><br/>If there's one thing that DC could take from Marvel, it would be the cast and the production team. Once again, the director did an excellent job with a perfect staff and all the actors and actresses were brilliant. Benedict Cumberbatch didn't go out of his comfort zone at all since Sherlock Holmes and Stephen Strange have a similar personality, so he just nailed his performance! He perfectly captioned the egotistic, smug, cocky, funny and HUMAN doctor. Human because, even after he learns his powers, he doesn't forget who he is, he's still arrogant, but when he kills someone he's truly affected by it! He's still a doctor, he saves lives, so killing really triggers him and Cumberbatch is amazing demonstrating that.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton was the one that I was always so intrigued to see and hear. The Ancient One is a very mysterious character and every time she talked I felt dragged by her voice into this ""full-attention mode"". She was thrilling and I have no words to describe how surprised I was when I met this character. Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is the right-hand of The Ancient One, he follows her lead and trusts her blindly, which gives him the motivation to do what he's going to in the sequel. Ejiofor also did a great job in showing the strict personality that his character has, the full respect for the laws of nature make him question everyone that breaks them. Master Wong, who is played by Benedict Wong (coincidence?), is an extremely fun character. The interactions between him and Strange were super funny and I was always with a smile on my face when he was on the screen.<br/><br/>Kaecilius is as good as his actor, Mads Mikkelsen. He is not supposed to be the main villain since there's a higher power, but he has a lot of screen time. The oh so powerful villain appears for like 5min and Kaecilius is the one that has all the attention. Don't get me wrong, he's a good villain with more than understandable motivations (he actually has a very intriguing backstory), but he wasn't the biggest evil to fight against (he was basically a puppet for someone else to achieve a greater objective). This time Marvel's villain wasn't as effective as the other times.<br/><br/>Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) is the college and lover of the famous doctor ... And the ""romance"" didn't work. McAdams is perfect in the scenes that she's in, which are very few and that's the problem. Literally, if you take out all the scenes where Palmer shows up, there's only one that saves this character. If Lois Lane was the damsel in distress on Batman V Superman, Christine Palmer was the doctor that was only necessary when our heroes were hurt and that's too little for a character of this importance. This is by far my major issue with this film.<br/><br/>The other issue would be very few scenes from the action sequences that seemed very video-game-ish and some other scenes where it was too much of a camera just moving too fast for us to see ... I don't know if it was because of the 2D, but I feel that I should have liked more the overall action of this film that I did (to make it clear, I did like it! I just expected more in some parts).<br/><br/>This is a classic superhero origin story, with an amazing score by Michael Giacchino and a lot of Marvel's usual comedy (they're getting better and better on implementing some belly-laughter humor on their films, the audience and I were laughing so hard throughout the whole runtime). Excellent cast, great directing and BRILLIANT, STUNNING, JAW-DROPPING production and visual effects ... God, I really need to see this one on IMAX!<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"
"laurenknight-58650","6","2","2","5 August 2017"," A film with much potential, but the writers needed to understand what they were writing.
","I actually really enjoyed this film. It was very entertaining, and a good way to spend two hours. Benedict Cumberbatch was good, the background of his character was very unique and interesting, and the other characters were complex and somewhat relatable. However, this movie had many flaws.<br/><br/>Firstly, the storyline. Now, the backstory for Dr. Strange was very interesting, however, it was after he stopped being a surgeon when things began to get odd. It is all too common for movies to not explain their stories, because there are, 'things you don't understand.' However, in movies such as The Matrix, that line is used to evoke mystery and keep the audience engaged. I found that in this particular film, this was a tactic used by the writers to not have to explain their own story that they wrote. It gave me the feeling that they conjured up a great storyline for a great film, but they were unable to think of what the characters were actually doing in the film. It was not really explained what the characters were doing, it was just all of a sudden, Dr. Strange could conjure up a gold weapon and they had to fight people who wanted to ruin the world for no particular reason, and ended up concluding the film using time travel, another tactic used for easy endings.<br/><br/>Now I am all for time travel movies. Films like Back to the Future are some of my favourite films of all time, but time in this film does not work for me. Time can be used to solve all of film's plot issues, and does not require any creativity to do so. I just felt that the messing with time in this film was not done cleverly, it was simply done to conclude a complex plot.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy this film. It had some good elements such as the backstory and acting. However, I felt the storyline could use work, which would have made the film an 8 out of 10."

","this movie has it all. Character development, slight romance (not too heavy), action, loss and sorrow, good acting, good story, and perhaps most importantly, the potential for sequels.<br/><br/>That is by far the thing I am looking for most of all. <br/><br/>I knocked two stars off my rating for two reasons: anti Christian bigotry planted subtly in the movie, and because digital effects go a little too far at places.<br/><br/>There is a scene where Mads Mikkelson's character and his two zealot henchmen are conducting an occult ritual in what is clearly a Catholic Cathedral in New York.... Whoever directed this needs a kick in the face for that scene alone! I am soooo sick of this crap!<br/><br/>Also, the digital stuff goes a little far in places. It gets right onto the high-wire of being in bad taste, but thankfully pulls back."
"mike48128","8","2","2","29 July 2017"," Good Special Effects with a Weak Comic Book Premise
","What makes Earth so gosh-darn popular with megalomaniacs and super villains with big heads? Maybe because strange movies are so profitable in movie houses that serve beer and pizza. A planet-sized menace with hairy eyebrows covets the Planet Earth for no major apparent reason and engages a maniacal ""time-bending"" mystic to conquer Earth in his name. Yes, there was an old ""Star Trek"" movie (#5-Final Frontier"") with such a ""large"" villain who gets mistaken for our ""Supreme Being"". Yawn. Fantastic special effects that kept several CGI studios busy working. The effects are a bit reminiscent of the gravity-defying angles and buildings used in ""Inception"" in 2010. Mystic nonsense. Fortunately for us such effects make for a great ""popcorn movie"" that I liked in spite of itself, for the fancy graphic effects alone. It almost made me dizzy on a small(er) 40"" screen! Rachel McAdams plays the perky long-suffering female surgical ""love interest"". Best effect: The Doctor split into his physical and astral beings and directing his own ER surgery. Moral: Don't play with shards of glass from magic mirrors and stay away from time portals. Like James Bond, the time-bending Doctor will return in other Marvel Adventures. Whether he becomes another great ""Iron Man"" character or the now worn-out ""Hulk"" remains to be seen. I am still waiting for the battle of the Muscular Marvel Girls starring female heroines in skin-tight plastic leather, like She Hulk, Spider Woman, Black Cat, and Black Widow (Sigh.)"

","One could see heavy influences from the movie Inception. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it was also not new.<br/><br/>The effects are good and the cumber batches his role quite well as usual. I also had quite a few laughs during the movie. However the extremely weak bad guy in terms of the characters just not being very exciting brought some flaws to the movie.<br/><br/>I just couldn't get as invested as I was with Winter Soldier or Civil War. Doctor Strange has potential though to be an excellent addition to the MCU and we'll have to see where they go with him."

","I expected so much more of this movie. I love movies about bending mind, time and matter, but this was just shallow. There was a funny joke here and there, but other than that there script seems to have been written by the same Hollywood movies who write all the other crap. The cast was good though, and special effects excellent."
"alexanderdavies-99382","8","2","2","1 July 2017"," Much better than I expected.
","This blockbuster Hollywood movie, actually makes an effort in presenting the character of Dr. Strange in a more accurate light and in accordance with the characters origin story. Benedict Cumberbatch did a fine job of giving the leading character some depth. He projects arrogance, conceit, vulnerability and intelligence with relative ease. The actor who played the Ancient One was also very good. The film has a good pace, some imaginative touches and a solid plot on the whole. The dialogue is pretty good apart from a few lines that strike a false note. I believe that fans of the Dr. Strange superhero will be pleased with this adaptation. I hope a sequel shall follow. I reckon this might happen, if the final scene is anything to go by. Watch this and enjoy."
"jamesrupert2014","7","2","2","13 May 2017"," Tony Stark goes to Hogwarts
","Typical of 'origin stories' ""Dr. Strange"" opens slowly and follows a trajectory similar to that of the highly successful ""Ironman"" (2008: an arrogant, overachiever is humbled, then acquires supernatural abilities while overcoming difficulties, then experiences an epiphany and becomes a wisecracking superhero (in this case a sorcerer)). The formula works, so why would we expect anything much to change. Benedict Cumberbatch is fine as the Doctor (although he seems to be channelling Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark during the more lighthearted parts of the film (especially the wisecracks)) as are Mads Mikkelsen and Tilda Swinton as the villain and the teacher respectively (admittedly not much is asked of them, the characters are pretty much props secondary to the CGI). I found the imagery, especially the mirror universe, initially interesting, but eventually it all began to look the same. Michael Giacchino's horn driven-music seemed out of place in a film featuring more mystic than martial heroics (and sounded too much like the theme from the current Star Treks for a film starring that franchise's 'Khan') and some parts of the film were just silly (the sentient cape comes to mind). All-in-all, an OK blockbuster-Marvell universe movie – neither particularly inventive or particularly clever, but entertaining and watchable."

"andlu-13737","7","2","2","23 April 2017"," Marvel just Keeps Making Good Movies
","This movie was in my opinion one of Marvel's best films - or at least solo films - in a while. With so many films in growing cinematic universes constantly throwing in references to upcoming characters in order to set up that universe, it is good to see a movie that has its own self-contained story. No Tony Stark or Thor (except for the post-credits scene, but that's a little different), just Stephen Strange and his world. The casting is also very good. Benedict Cumberbatch provides a very convincingly arrogant and privileged guy who realized he might be wrong after all by the time the movie is coming to a close. He's still flawed, but at least he's trying.. There was only a small handful of things that could have been improved. The pacing started out a little odd. I feel like it could have taken more time to develop all of the characters and their world. It did even out quickly, though. Again, a bit of a generic villain, but Kacaelius was not as threatening as he could have been. I don't think it was as bad as most people say however. The story of Doctor Strange is not as interesting to me as some of the other Marvel stories, so it was not my #1 favorite MCU installment, but it was still very good"
"DKosty123","7","2","2","16 April 2017"," Stan Lee's 102 Acting Role? Wow
","There are great reviews of this one out here, and there are trolls reviews venting that all Marvel Movies are alike, over hyped and over cgi bullshit*t. Well I am kind of in between here. <br/><br/>This one is much better than a dreadful one where two teams of super heroes actually both lose in the movie. It is a notch short of some of Marvels best efforts. That is why Stan Lee is on a bus on this one. He is trying to stay out of the way and yet laugh all the way to the bank. Successful, Lee is.<br/><br/>The movie makes it because Dr. Strange actor pulls off his role pretty well. It does get a little deep in all the fighting and action sequences. The bald lady comes off very much like that old lady who is in charge of James Bond in the last few outings.<br/><br/>The movie is predictable, and yet enjoyable. Could it be better, yes, and the feelings between Strange and his estranged wife are not very emotional. Of course who has room for emotions when you need to save the entire world?<br/><br/>This is one of the places the emotion is lacking a bit. The characters do the best they can with the script, but it could have been better. The ending credits contain 2 surprises, and one thing that is not surprising. There are only about 4 songs that get credits in this one because Dr. Strange is just not very musical.<br/><br/>Maybe that is a sour note, but it depends on what you like, You could say that in a diner, this movie is the blue plate special, better than a plain cheese sandwich, but not a prime rib sandwich. Then again in some eateries, the Blue Plate is the prime rib. It's just left over from yesterday's special."

","Doctor Strange: I hate going to the movie theater nowadays. It isn't that the experience is so much worse than it was back in the good old days when men were men, children were well behaved and people dressed for going out in public. It simply is that my home theater experience is gotten so much better. Surround sound, my own snacks, my own choice of company and a decent 4k OLED screen make for a mighty fine home viewing experience. <br/><br/>Sometimes though a movie comes out that makes we wish I had seen it in the theater. Doctor Strange is one such movie. The special effects and design are so wonderfully trippy. The story is your standard origin story with the put-upon love interest (an underused Rachel McAdams), A cocky self-assured millionaire learning a life lesson, and even a touch of ye olde chosen one. <br/><br/>It's all the other wonderful stuff that makes the movie. Director Scott Derrickson isn't afraid to let his imagination run wild everything from acid trips to body horror to Inception called and they want their movie back is featured.<br/><br/>While this movie is not peak Marvel it is better than it had to be and certainly better than it could have been. A fun visually impressive well acted movie."

","I'm not specially a big fan of Marvel but I still do watch the movies. And to me Doctor Strange is one of the better ones. The special effects are very well done and sometimes stunning. There are a lot of visual effects that work really good in this story. I'm also not a major fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, unlike others, but in this movie he did a good job. The whole cast is enjoyable to watch. The movie might be long but you never have the feeling that it's getting boring or so. And that's mainly due to the stunning sometimes psychedelic visual effects. You'd better not take any LSD before watching Doctor Strange.

","It seems this is the going to be the last Origins Story in the MCU, or at least that is the word going round. Guess they are just going to introduce the other characters from here on out. I'm fine with that. The origin stories are starting to become the exact same stories. Not saying Doctor Strange is a bad movie though. Here's why.<br/><br/>Synopsis: After a horrible car accident, brilliant neurosurgeon Stephen Strange must find a way and a cure to healing his hands. His quest brings him to Kamar-Taj in Nepal where he studies under the Ancient One, who teaches him the ways of magic and alternate realities. With new skills of interdimensional travel and spells, Strange soon discovers that he must protect the world from a deadly enemy who is out to destroy it. Starring: Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Tilda Swinton Director: Scott Derrickson<br/><br/>Really, the reason I did give this movie an 8 is because of the origin story. It took more than half the movie to get to the main conflict. It all concentrated on how Strange got his power. I would have rather seen more of the cosmicverse. They hinted it at in Ant- Man and brought it full force here. Now, they just need to concentrate on it more.<br/><br/>Benedict was the right choice for the role. I really can't see anyone else playing Strange. Nobody has that swagger that he has to pull off the cockiness of Strange. I can't wait to see him square off with Tony.<br/><br/>Other than Benedict all the characters were one dimensional. Not the writers fault, most of the secondary characters in the Strange comics are one dimensional. At least from what I remember. Haven't read one of his since the turn of the century.<br/><br/>There was nothing that stood out in this movie besides the visual effects. The movie was just on average with all the rest of the MCU. Albeit a vital part to the MCU.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: If it wasn't vital, this movie could have stood alone. Comparing it to the other movies it doesn't stand on its own. But still watchable.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10<br/><br/>That's it for me folks. If you would like to continue to follow my post, go ahead and like this page.

His personality, wit, stubbornness and ambition were portrayed very well on screen. Rachel McAdams also played her role perfectly and I really hope she gets more screen-time in future movies.<br/><br/>The story is also a little different from what we've seen in previous Marvel movies and some of the visuals reminded of other great sci-fi films, such as Inception and The Matrix, but Doctor Strange sets itself apart with a wonderful introductory story to the character within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>The action sequences were pretty cool but I feel they could have been a lot more intense and breathtaking in a world where the perception of reality are limitless. Visually, it was still nice to look at but the potential to be much more thrilling was definitely there after watching the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a fun film to see and I highly recommend it if you've enjoyed Marvel's previous films.

"Reno-Rangan","8","2","2","24 February 2017"," When a science person was the chosen one in the spiritual world!
","You would have not expected it from this director if you had seen his previous films. This was based on the Marvel comics that I haven't touched. So basically I had high expectation to witness another side of Marvel universe with another set of (super)heroes. And surprisingly, it was very entertaining, nothing like other Marvel's heroes/story, except the possession of superpower to fight evil forces.<br/><br/>Firstly, Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead in a Marvel film, I did not think it would work. All I knew is he was a great sidekick, but that image has changed here. He was wonderful, definitely I'll be looking forward to its sequel as they had confirmed at the end. The theme wise, it is similar to most of the superhero tales, but some new concepts were added to it, I mean the superpower and that's what made it so unique.<br/><br/>Just like 'Thor', this film as well had taken the spiritual believes only for the basic platform. The rest of the developments are the clear mix of fantasy (illusion) and science. So it means the film is for theists and atheists. I am one of those who did not like 'Inception', which I think an ordinary action film with multiple layers. But this one was so awesome and it is for the people like me who think 'Inception' failed.<br/><br/>Visually spectacular. I regret missing it out in digital 3D. Its Academy Awards nominee in the category of Best VFX tells the story. There will be a tough contest, even I'm up for 'Jungle Book', but I won't be sad if this wins. The success story of Marvel continues. Not everybody reads comic books, but film goers are the majority. So adaptations like this are people like me. Let them keep coming, I love this format better. This film is not just for the youngsters, but old, families, as well as kids can enjoy, so I hope you won't miss it.<br/><br/>8/10"

I really wish the character of Kaecillius could have been more thoroughly explained and flushed out to suit with Mads Mikkelsen's magical acting capability. Acting was good; character was bad.<br/><br/>3. I wish there wasn't a love interest for Doctor Strange. It didn't need it and is would have actually been a nice break of formula for Marvel individual character movies.<br/><br/>4. The 'twist' involving Mordo at the end was so painfully predictable and I've never touched a Doctor Strange comic in my life. It was stupid and lazy and so obvious.<br/><br/>5. Mid-way through, there is an action scene unlike anything I've ever seen. It was phenomenal. It was genius. That being said, it made the final fight of the movie seem anti-climactic. The time travel gimmick was nice, yes. But it just fell short of the legacy the mid-way fight delivered.<br/><br/>6. There is so much exposition in the film. I understand it was needed for such a foreign and unique concept such as this, but this was a bit overkill. They needed to set up the world but could have done it much more efficiently.<br/><br/>7.

","As a once passionate comics fan, most often Marvel, I wasn't overly familiar with Dr. Strange, so I can't speak to how closely the film hewed to the canon. The casting was decent; I almost always like Mikkelsen, Cumberbatch, et al. The visuals-which I'm generally unimpressed by since almost anything can be done to a degree-were fantastic: psychedelic, dazzling, pretty. The story was OK, but I found the action itself played out mostly like another kung fu movie with a huge budget. I guess there's a challenge in providing an entertaining enough movie about sorcerers battling, but the battle sequences were sorta boring. Over all it was an entertaining watch, and I'm interested to see Strange shoehorned into the crowded movie Marvel universe."

I was not disappointed and is the only reason I gave this movie 4 stars.<br/><br/>The reason I didn't give it more is they absolutely ruined ""The Ancient One"". They made everyone in the movie white. He was a saintly and extremely mystical figure. A Buddhist monk. They put some British chick! What on earth? It explains why they didn't give The Ancient One the screen time he deserves, because it was a totally out of character. Extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>After the absolute disgrace of The Ancient One, they didn't do justice to Dormammu. They made him seem like he took a plea bargain. But Dormammu is such a immense character he's hard to capture. The Ancient One is also pretty immense but much easier to capture as he can be personified by a human. They even had a guy with white beard in the movie (the one with no hand). Shoot, short and fat Miyagi San from the Karate Kid would have personified ""The Ancient One"" better.<br/><br/>Gosh I can't get over at how much Marvel just insulted The Ancient One."

","This movie is a ticket to one wild journey to unknown to us places in MCU! The opening scene - the amazing acting skills of Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen, Benedict Wond and also Rachel McAdams. The amazing visual effects, that definitely pay off the price of the 3D ticket and the way we learn about the magic in the Marvel universe is only a part of everything you will see.<br/><br/>As it is typical for MARVEL, humor is present in the movie and it is even more than I expected and almost every joke fits perfectly its place in the movie. The story of the brilliant and narcissistic neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange is told very good, without wasting too much time waiting to see his transition from Doctor as a profession to Doctor of mystic and magical arts - Sorcerer Supreme.<br/><br/>The persona of Strange reminds a lot of Tony Stark in the beginning, with the exception that as much as Stark was stuck-up, he was still accepted with a smile, while Strange is rude and he hurts the person who at that time is closest to him, who eventually leaves. Ancient One, who is played by Tilda Swinton, is one of the best parts in the movie. After the end of the movie there will be hardly anyone that won't like her character thanks to her acting. Baron Mordo, who is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, also has an interesting story to track. Beginning as the trustworthy student of the Ancient One, who is constantly by her side, then learning something that affects his view towards everything which eventually leads him towards a new path of his character. We will definitely look forward to seeing the future actions of Baron Mordo. Kaecilius, who is played by Mads Mikkelsen, is a villain that wants to open the eyes of everyone else for something they all fear and he wants to show some of the actions of the Ancient One, that no one else knew. Kaecilius is a secondary villain in the movie, because there is a bigger threat, something much bigger and much dangerous and he wants to summon it. The character of Wong is funny and interesting to watch, as well as the nurse Christine Palmer, who is more than a friend of Strange.<br/><br/>The visuals and the effects in the movie are on an unseen before level and the movie is definitely among other movies that are worth watching on 3D. Any comparison with Inception has to be forgotten, because Inception compared to Doctor Strange seems like a beta version.<br/><br/>The end is simultaneously epic, mind-blowing and funny, because as you see everything that is happening you realize what Doctor Strange can show us in the future as a character, because he has not finished his training yet. By the end of the movie he succeeds in things that even he didn't think he could do. I am waiting in fascination how he will fit the other Avengers, his first encounter with Tony Stark, how his powers will be compared with the others and how they will fit in future projects by MARVEL. Also the Cloak of Levitation... you'll just love it!<br/><br/>In conclusion, MARVEL show us another action packed spectacle on a high level, diving deep into the still unknown to us and that, in my opinion, makes MARVEL successful for another time unlike their rivals... if you know what I mean. Don't forget to watch the Post and After Credit scenes, which are very interesting and important for the upcoming in the MCU.<br/><br/>Acting: 10/10<br/><br/>Story: 10/10<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10/10<br/><br/>Visuals: 10/10<br/><br/>Humor: 9.5/10 (Which doesn't have to be perceived as a big negativity, it just could have been better without some of the jokes.)<br/><br/>I already watched Captain America Civil War 4 times at the cinema and 6 more in home, so you get the idea.

"javiergarcon","10","8","14","3 January 2017"," Forget the actors! although all of them did great.
","Everyone bases the movie about the actors, I am sorry but the actors do not make the movie! there are a series of Directors and producers and a well-oiled machine that makes a movie successful, I should know I am an actor but your not going to find my name on here. Let me start by saying that this movie was never meant to be seen without in being in 3D, If you watch this movie in plain old 2D you're wasting your time and money! The movie was enhanced by 3D! With that said I am going to nominate this movie for the best Action, Best special effects, Best Computer special effects (At least they didn't get me dizzy in 3D) First movie I have ever watched in 3D that didn't give me a Headache! Absolutely amazing and it stayed true to the original storytelling of its founder from Marvel! Thank you and I believe this movie will be overlooked because some people think comic books are for children. hope everyone can just overlook everything else and commend the amazing special effects that went off like a perfect concert in sync!"
"SpoodermanDerp","7","13","26","28 October 2016"," Unique and unconventional style, but lacks the substance to make it better than it could've been.
","Probably everyone's biggest immediate perception at what's so amazing about this film is of course the visuals, and yes there's no denying it was such an extravagant experience especially considering watching it in 3D and 4DX. The mind-bending, intergalactic, space time continuum trippy-ness of the film makes up most of the chunk that makes this film a cut above the rest of all the Marvel films and it's a breath of fresh air that it remains that way through out the film. Benedict Cumberbatch is well cast, if Marvel is indeed planning on making the new ""RDJ- like"" character archetype then they're lucky to find another Sherlock actor to fill in that role because his arrogance, charisma and elegance were all translated so fluidly in the film. In fact, the actors in this film are all individually strong and there's no surprise since almost all of them have been given Oscar nods and recognition to be well rounded actors.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, style over substance is never usually a good thing, and I'm not making an exception here even if I do concede that the film looked hella cool. My biggest con in the film is probably how everything is either just so one or two dimensional (ironically, in a film about mind-bending stuff). If you take a step back and remove all the visuals, you get a run by the numbers generic plot with minimal impact. The plot leaves little to no tension with yet another ""world ending"" and life threatening plot line which will obviously be solved by an already existing deus ex machina. There are obvious and predictable foreshadowing hints wherein it really didn't feel like they were trying to be subtle anymore and force dialogue unto your face saying ""Remember this thing I'm telling you, it's going to be used in the future and you'll totally know when"". Also, the lack of tension in the film is quite appalling, sure it's executed beautifully, but that doesn't mean I'm going to fully appreciate the scene for what it truly is and what it means for the whole plot. Since the film focuses too much on the visuals, the audience is led to really forget about the tension and the possible stakeholders that might happen because cool unorthodox things are showing up on your screen. This makes it rather hard to relate to the characters and have slow and development heavy moments to be overshadowed. The second con is how we have no actual grasp of the extents and limitations of the powers in play here, IM NOT SAYING MAGIC IN THE FILM WAS A BAD THING, Magic can definitely be a good and special thing to do, but only if it is executed well enough not just in visuals but in substance as well. Sadly, the film glosses over that after such a strong first act. Suddenly after a span of reading montages, you sort of just have to accept he's this good and pro at this now. Even though from the start the film does show him struggle, the next few scenes, he's shown being able to handle toe to toe with a dark magic user who's way more experienced than him, and that's exactly the point. Sure there are quick explanations like him reading all the books in library etc etc, but it then leaves us with no grasp or knowledge as to what are the extents of the magic in this film, what are the strengths and weaknesses of each sorcerer or what are the possibilities for magic in battle and why do they even move God damn architecture. The point isn't that the visuals and the magic were horrible per say, but we had no grasp of what they truly are and are only left with ambiguity and cool scenes. Like the final battle was solved by such a convenient plot device that you even wonder why that wasn't even used before to prevent horrible events from ever happening, oh well they only explain that with a crappy one liner that doesn't work as well as it does in Doctor Who (""Time is Relative""). Lastly, the villain and the rest of the film is quite underwhelming and forgettable. It's a trend for Marvel films to have quite lackluster and monochrome villains, this isn't an exception even with Mads Mikkelsen as the actor. Not much to say about the musical score as well, ever since the ""Marvel Symphonic Universe"" essay made by Tony Zhou(Every Frame a Painting) it wasn't quite a surprise to have a rather generic and even non- existent Doctor Strange theme, odd considering solo films like Iron Man 1 and Ant-Man had their own distinct musical scores you can attach them too.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not a great movie, not a bad movie either. It's perfectly up to you whether or not you will absolutely adore this film mainly because of it's unconventional visual style and not care about the lack of substance and a run by the numbers safe origin plot. It's definitely not as good as Civil War and debatable if we compare with Ant-Man, but nonetheless it's a solid and unique Marvel entry.<br/><br/>Verdict: 7.6/10"
"wwwbrady","4","19","41","1 November 2016"," Not so STRANGE
","MARVEL does it again, no really MARVEL does it again.... the movie itself doesn't put much effort into setting up the majority of the ideas it brings forward, it just tosses them out there. Scott Derrickson's direction pulls the film together in spite of the dense mythology. Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange is solid, though not spectacular, will not leave fans disappointed. On the other hand, even though the cast is an unusual level of prestige for a film of this type, the characters and their arcs do not give them much to work with. Marvel films continue off the same foot, gray villains and female counterparts weak."

","Scott Derrickson made Doctor Strange a visual masterpiece! Art and visual effects surrounding the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's character were stunning. Chiwetel Ejiofor delivered a dramatic crescendo during this exploration of metaphysical and physical conflicts. Benedict responded with conviction, mastery, and swagger. Jon Spaihts, Scott Derrickson, and Robert Cargill interwove humor, spiritualism, and action into the smart dialogues. Tilda Swinton brilliantly delivered against Mads Mikkelsen's character. Rachel McAdams' character was more of the classic contemporary female role. Vicotria Alonso's production team, Ben Davis, and Sabrina Plisco's editing team stitched together this multi-faceted jewel spectacularly."
"lewisideson","8","12","24","28 October 2016"," An unexpectedly brilliant film
","Honestly I was never really interested in watching doctor strange until I wanted to go to the cinema. At First I was thinking about watching the magnificent seven or deepwater horizon but both weren't showing at the time I wanted. then I saw the showing times for doctor strange and thought why not. I'm a big fan of comic book movie's and I had intended to watch doctor strange eventually simply because it's a marvel film but after looking more into it i become more enthusiastic about seeing it. In the end I read some of the early reviews and thought best to see it in 3D.<br/><br/>As for the good points of doctor strange, and there are many, it is a genuinely good film with outstanding acting and awe inspiring visuals. benedict Cumberbatch shines as Stephen strange and solidifies his place in the marvel cinematic universe tilda swinton was exceptional as the ancient one and Chiwetel Ejiofor was brilliant as always playing mordo. I also liked Rachel McAdams performance however she didn't get much screen time. The mind bending visuals are best watched in 3D but I'll let you see for yourself.<br/><br/>With doctor strange I found it hard to say anything bad, contrary to what a number of reviews state I don't think the villain was underdeveloped, well maybe a little. The one bad thing I can think to say is that sometimes, not always, the trademark marvel humour feels out of place and it didn't always get a laugh. For example a scene with mordo and strange in which mordo hands strange the WiFi password was amusing but it didn't feel right. The delivery was always perfect it was just the timing that made the joke seem out of place.<br/><br/>To conclude doctor strange is up high on the list of marvel movie's, it's no civil war and Stephen strange isn't the most well known marvel hero but doctor strange is a good movie to introduce the sorcerer supreme. Also I hope after seeing the mid credit scene doctor strange appears in Thor Ragnorok. A solid 8.4/10"
"Troy_Campbell","8","12","24","27 October 2016"," Visually awe-inspiring.
","Marvel Studios has had solid success when it comes to bringing their second-tier heroes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU): Ant-Man was a fun little heist flick and Guardians of the Galaxy is still one of the franchise's best entries to date. This multi-realm fantasy film sits comfortably in the top echelon of MCU movies thanks to its ambitious concept and dazzling set pieces, the mind-bending parallel dimensions arguably the greatest challenge Marvel Studios has set themselves yet. Director Scott Derrickson and his VFX team visualise the multiple plains of existence with jaw-dropping splendour, the Inception-esque world-shifting of the dark dimension is awe inspiring and lends itself to a superb action sequence in the final act. What the climactic battle lacks in originality – an otherworldly entity wants to destroy Earth – it makes up for in sheer visual awesomeness, with our human heroes and villains going at it whilst a recently demolished town in Hong Kong mends itself in reverse. If the action is A+ then the story is a respectable B+. The pre-powers backstory of the titular hero is mercifully brief and there is a plethora of jokes that hit the mark, however there's some clunky exposition serving as narrative shorthand and the odd bout of dire-logue that could've been cleaned up. As for Strange himself, Benedict Cumberbatch plays him with a dash of Tony Stark's arrogance, a pinch of Steve Roger's sincerity and a sprinkle of Scott Lang's what-the-hell-am-I-doing bewilderedness, all the while adding a touch of the rock 'n' roll to his brain surgeon turned sorcerer. It's a mixed bag elsewhere though, Tilda Swinton's mischievous Ancient One and Mads Mikkelsen's malevolent Kaecilius are compelling, but Rachel McAdams is given little to do as Strange's love interest Christine and Chiwetel Ejiofor is frustratingly dour as sidekick Mordo. All in all Doctor Strange is a hugely entertaining blockbuster that once again cements MCU's position as the preeminent superhero series."

","This film really is everything the critics have been saying. Stupendous, visually spellbinding, brilliantly acted and very funny. <br/><br/>In the beginning, neurosurgeon Stephen is so arrogant that he becomes almost completely unlikable. After the intense car accident, he tries every possible means to heal his hands, to no avail, and he runs out of funds. When Christine (Rachel McAdams) tries to encourage him to try different things, he verbally abuses her in such a way that it reminded me of Christopher Moltisanti from the Sopranos. Unlike the meek and battered Adriana however, Christine has sense to leave him and cease contact with him.<br/><br/>The transformation from this selfish asshole to a humble and caring Sorcerer Supreme is out of his world, literally. Stephen is plunged headfirst into a sea of different dimensions (it's a wild and trippy sight) learning different spells (no silly wordy spells like in Harry Potter) and finally overcoming his ego with the help of the Ancient One, in order to save the world from other worldly threats.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch truly is Doctor Strange and he has the right mix of cockiness, humour, emotion and bad-assery embedded in the role. He surprised me at every turn.<br/><br/>Although the villain Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelson) was cool, he was sort of weak compared to the others we've seen in Marvel blockbusters. <br/><br/>Tilda Swinton is the second best performance in this film. She truly is magical, mysterious and sassy as The Ancient One. Wong is brilliantly funny as the super-serious librarian, Chiwitel Ejiofor's character arc as Baron Mordo is also just as interesting as Stephen's. I'll be very curious to see what he does in the next instalments. <br/><br/>And that levitation cloak! I absolutely love it. It guides Stephen to defeat and protect him from villains, helps him fly, and even wipes away his tears at one point. It reminded me of BB8 from Star Wars in some ways.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best Marvel films I've seen in a long time. Although nothing beats all of the superheroes being in one movie, ready to fight off danger. I look forward to seeing The Doctor again, soon."

","Doctor Strange, directed by Scott Derrickson, is not only the fourteenth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but a film that brings in a whole new perspective of magic and sorcery in the franchise. What you are given is a spectacular tale of a man who defies all odds, to learn the art and craft of magic, who is magnificently played by the great Benedict Cumberbatch. Other than Benedict, the film boasts a stellar cast with the likes of Mads Mikkelsen, Tilda Swinton, Rachael McAdams and Chiwetel Ejiofor, who all play their parts great as well. Accompanied by top-quality visuals, interesting origin stories and one of most fascinating music scores in Marvel history, you are giving one of the better Marvel films in recent memory.<br/><br/>With 2016 slowly drawing to a close, the year of movies hasn't been the most satisfying as major blockbusters haven't been able to reach the heights we wished they would. I have been slightly disappointed with what has come out so far this year, with the likes of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, X-Men Apocalypse and Jason Bourne failing to live up to the hype. I believe Doctor Strange is up there with some of the best this year, which include Captain America: Civl War, Finding Dory, Zootopia, Deadpool and the Jungle Book. Not only do the visuals take your mind away, but it shows that Marvel still has what it takes to make good films (especially with so many superhero movies coming out in the next couple of years). It also proves that Marvel is capable of placing unknown directors with big blockbuster movies, like what they did with James Gunn in Guardians of the Galaxy and Scott Derrickson with this movie. It also sets up the character well for future movies as Benedict has confirmed he will take part in Avengers: Infinity Wars and possibly other Marvel movies.<br/><br/>If I were to make one criticism for the movie, it'll have to be the overuse and forcefulness of humor, especially when the movie started to get more serious. But, it did make the audience laugh in some moments, so it isn't much of a concern. <br/><br/>To finish off, we are taken on a visually impressive journey throughout Doctor Strange's world and how he prepares to enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a big way."

","Oh, wow! Marvel did PERFECT this year. First Civil War, then Doctor Strange just blew my mind. I like that Strange was egoist, and kind of bad, then The Ancient One teached him the lesson. The visuals were excellent, NOT like Inception!!! Mads Mikkelsen did great, his character is not forgettable, like Ronan/Malekith. Some say that the storyline is a piece of s--t, and I'm like..what? They just don't got it... or they're into dc.. Anyway, I loved it, Benedict was awesome, and I loved the Ancient One. Her death was... unexpected, I think. I'd love to see Mordo as a villain in the next movie. And more of these effects!! I rate it 10/10 This is my second favorite movie of the MCU. First is Civil War. 2016 was a great MCU year, I hope GOTG2 will be great, Spider-Man will be excellent, and Thor will be... well..better then the first two."
"Random3","5","13","27","2 November 2016"," An extremely flawed exercise in visual overindulgence...
","I'll preface this by saying I have seen and enjoyed almost all of the MCU films so far. I saw Doctor Strange in 3D in Coventry UK. I have not written a film review before but I felt compelled to do so as I didn't feel my experience was in line with any of the other reviews that have been posted. This was my first experience of the character of Doctor Strange.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>All of the performances were decent as expected. Tilda Swinton was the highlight.<br/><br/>The tone through most of the film had a unique feel which distinguished it from the other MCU films. If I hadn't known before hand I wouldn't have guessed it was part of the MCU at all. This was mostly a good thing, however there were two off-hand references to The Avengers which felt slightly out of place when spoken by a matter-manipulating wizard.<br/><br/>The first half hour showing the character pre-superhero was genuinely moving. It wasn't anything particularly new, but it was played out very effectively.<br/><br/>The climax of the film, whilst absurd, was definitely a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre. No portal in the sky, no expendable alien army, and no extended emotionally-charged 1v1 showdown.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>The comedy. There were two scenes that made me laugh, and a handful of others that seemed like they were supposed to. However, other people in the cinema were laughing when I wasn't so take this with a pinch of salt.<br/><br/>Strange becomes a super-wizard too quickly. There isn't even a montage or other indication that time has passed. In one scene he is struggling with very basic space magic, and then next scene he is a bad-ass who can suddenly fight multiple fully-trained evil space wizards.<br/><br/>As soon as the science meets the fiction it becomes extremely jarring. There is a scene in the film where Strange, now able to manipulate time and space, visits an old neurosurgeon colleague to get himself patched up. What follows is a scene involving a character performing physical surgery in the real world interacting with two astral projections having a zero gravity fist fight. This sounds cool, and indeed it did look cool, but it made no sense. Why are astral projections able to physically fight each other? If they can move through walls then why are they able to throw each other into things? Why is the neurosurgeon not questioning any of this? This dissonance peaks when the climax of that fight scene tried to blend science with magic in a physical way which didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>There is a part of the film where Strange uses a particular type of magic to save the day, which we are told is ""forbidden"". We aren't shown why it is forbidden. There are no consequences for him using this particular power. We are told that it is ""against the natural order"", with no explanation as to why all the other destructive magic is allowed, but this isn't.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was with the depiction of superpowers in the film. There was no consistency, minimal explanation, and multiple logic gaps as a result of this. If you have seen the trailers or the film, you will no doubt have been drawing similarities to Nolan's Inception. I will not claim that the films are similar beyond the visual, but the best way I can explain how poorly the superpowers were explored in Doctor Strange is to directly compare it to Inception.<br/><br/>In Inception, we have a bunch of characters who are able to manipulate the world around them. The film spends about an hour and a half meticulously explaining what is and is not possible. It has it's own set of rules and logic. We as an audience understand who can do what and why. When the proverbial sh*t hits the fan in the second half of the film, there is tension and a grounded sense of reality as a result of this.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange also features a bunch of characters who can similarly manipulate the world around them, both the ""real"" world and various alternate dimensions. The difference here is that the film spends 5-10 minutes explaining a portion of the superpowers, and then every fight sequence from then on was totally devoid of any tension or sense of realism because none of the characters have any established limitations to their powers. It was like watching fights take part in a vacuum where physics and logic don't apply. There is no tension in these scenes because we don't understand what each character is capable of. <br/><br/>Most non-fantasy action films don't have these problems because the characters are using weapons we are inherently familiar with, such as guns or knives. When Hans Gruber points his gun at Takagi in Die Hard, the audience understands the consequences of this action. When Voldemort points his wand at Harry Potter, we understand what he can and can't do because the films established this fact. When Kaecilius threatens Doctor Strange, we feel no tension because the film hasn't explained anything. Both characters could potentially do any number of fantastical things. As a result the confrontations do not work. In Inception, the ""superpowers"" were an integral part of the plot. In Doctor Strange, the superpowers were seemingly made up on the spot by the animators to make a visually entertaining sequence.<br/><br/>Let me close by saying that I did not hate the film, but I was disappointed with it. I paid to see this in 3D soon after release because it looked very enjoyable. I felt compelled to write a review of this film because I don't understand the praise it is receiving. It isn't terrible, and a lot of it was enjoyable. However, in my view it is an extremely flawed exercise in visual overindulgence which unfortunately tarnishes the better aspects of the film. 5/10."

But, the pace drops again once Strange learns the magical force & a not-so-strong villain Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen, not in form this time), add to its disadvantages. The action is spectacular, though. Once Strange begins to kickass, there's not stopping him & its a lot of fun watching him do that. Even the jokes here evoke laughter, even though they come in limited doses. The visuals are mind-blowing, the action works, but Writing wise, its loopholes all over.<br/><br/>Scott Derrickson & C. Robert Cargill's Screenplay works, only in parts. The pace, also, is uneven. The film jumps from being fun to plain dull. And no film, despite its technical achievements, can rise above a rather weak Screenplay. Derrickson's Direction, on the other-hand, relies on visuals to deliver. Cinematography is excellent, while the Editing needed to be sharper. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Make-Up is finely done, as well.

","*I am not a native speaker, so i am sorry for mistakes or things like that.* I was very excited about the doctor strange movie. I never read a Marvel Comic so I had no idea what to expect. What I expect was a generic marvel movie with magic instead of ""avengers power"", I can promise that it is much more than that. The first 5 minutes of the Movie destroyed my prejudices. I was drawn into the world of Doctor Strange. Doctor Strange surprised with a comparatively slow narration. Our Hero doesn't get his skills at the next road corner after 10 Minutes. So we follow him on a interesting journey through the mind of a person that changes completely. The slow beginning of the story is followed by a short middle section, which is my only criticism of the film. The story does not get a ""routine"" and starts immediately with events which advance the story further. So the learning process is a little bit too quick for my taste. There is no real middle section of the movie. With 115 Minutes the movie is comparatively short compared to movies like Civil War or Batman v Superman and I would have preferred if the film had gone a little longer. So the Story of Doctor Strange is interesting and the setting is unused. The whole movie feels refreshing next to the other ""classic"" marvel films, a little bit like Deadpool (Really only a very very small bit like ""Deadpool""). The visuals of the Movie are stunning. It is absolute amazing to sink into the world of mirror dimensions and things like that. I would advise anyone to watch this movie in the cinema AND in 3D. I think this is the first time since ""Avatar"" that I would prefer a movie in 3D, but the optical illusions and changing dimensions are absolutely amazing in 3D. The music is good but inconspicuous, nothing centuries long lasting, but good and fitting. Benedict Cumberbatch convinces like the rest of the cast of the film. I haven't read the comics, but for me Tilda Swinton was a great embodiment of her role. I can't understand the debate of here role.The humor is similar to the other Marvel films, apart from Deadpool (this movie was glorious). The last thing I want to speak about is the overlaps with the Movie ""Inception"" some people talked about in advance. Doctor Strange is not Inception, some people will remember the optics to inception, but Inception and Doctor Strange are like apple and pear. I think it is a matter of attitude. So don't expect something like Inception and you will not be disappointed. So what we have is a real interesting character, stunning visuals and refreshing setting packed in a very good movie. If you are interested in the Marvel universe it is a very good episode. If you never watched a Marvel movie before (if there is a person in the world) it is a perfect beginning to give this sort of movie a chance. I give this Movie 9 out of 10, 8,5 out of 10 if i could.. Thumbs up Marvel I am very excited about the future of your universe. Thanks for reading."

","Saw 'Doctor Strange' (although fairly late perhaps) because of liking the cast a great deal, who can argue with Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton, and having liked a lot of what Marvel has done, something that one doesn't see people saying a lot here.<br/><br/>'Doctor Strange' is not a perfect film, but to me it was a thoroughly enjoyable one and is one of Marvel's best. Lets begin with the things that from personal opinion didn't quite work. Rachel McAdams does do a good job with what she has, but the character was underused and underwritten. Her screen time, while essential, was not large and her development was sketchy at best. Strange mastering magic does happen too fast, didn't buy how rushed that aspect was, and while there are a lot of fun and witty moments a few jokes felt random and out of place (i.e. Beyoncé).<br/><br/>However, the cast are a major asset. Had reservations about McAdams's character but not with her performance. Benedict Cumberbatch really makes the interesting title character his own and knocks it out the park. The standout of the rest of the cast is Tilda Swinton, wonderfully mysterious as the film's most interesting character and played with relish by her.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor has a charismatic intensity and Benedict Wong has fun and enjoyed his chemistry with Cumberbatch. Do think that the villain Kaecilius could have been explored in more depth, but Mads Mikkelsen is intriguingly menacing.<br/><br/>The story, making the most of a great innovative concept, is never dull and is told with absorbing atmosphere, exuberance and very rarely sacrifices coherence or credulity. There are some really interesting ideas here, explored with thought-provoking intelligence. The action excites and thrills, as well as being visually stunning, instead of being drawn out even though quite long the climax is great fun to watch (or at least it was to me).<br/><br/>'Doctor Strange's' script has emotion, wit and tension and although he doesn't have the character growth one would like Strange is a well realised character and Cumberbatch has a lot to thank for that. The music score has great intensity, rousing excitement and nuance and Scott Derrickson clearly engaged hugely with the material.<br/><br/>Where 'Doctor Strange' is particularly good is in the production values. It's very stylishly shot and edited and handsomely mounted in production design but it's the incredible special effects (particularly jaw-dropping in the climax) that take centre stage.<br/><br/>Overall, while not quite finding it a masterpiece of film-making and having a few problems with it 'Doctor Strange' was a thoroughly enjoyable film and among Marvel's best. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","Doctor Strange did show a good blast with its stunning Inception-styled effects that is mind-blowing plus Benedict Cumberbatch was the right choice to portray the titular character in which his marvelous performance is perfect just like the way other actors in MCU did. Some of members of the cast such as Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Rachel McAdams did deliver a good performances.<br/><br/>Rest of the others in case of Tilda Swinton gave a good performance which make it perfect but the problem is that, in the comics it was portrayed as an Asian character and it's no secret that this is white-washing noting that Hollywood never learns its lesson when choosing white actors to portray non-white roles.<br/><br/>Then the flaw was with the inconsistencies of the plot and plot holes that leaves scratching their heads for questions. Mads Mikkelsen did give a good performance as a main villain though it fell flat and bland, then another villainous role such as Dormammu is poorly portrayed which leaves to be desired with."

","Marvel's Doctor Strange is a very high profile, and expensive, train wreck. That is if you haven't drank the Cool-Aid and relish everything Marvel. For the acolytes it's likely to be imbibed just as ravenously as all the other Marvel cocktails.<br/><br/>Dr. Stephen Strange is a egotistical neurosurgeon who chases his own hype at the expense of a real soul. Oh, he's brilliant in his realm, but he's a victim of his own success and self- centered selfishness. He's not saving lives, he's notching another victory for his personal scorecard. He faces his mortality after a horrific car crash ends his career. Due to his lack of depth beyond his ego he falls into a mean depression. He can't accept his lot to no longer feed his ego as a brilliant surgeon. Hearing of one man who beat the hard science that said he'd never walk again he seeks him out to find how he did it. That leads him to Nepal and, more specifically Kamar-Taj a mystical place where The Ancient One (a strikingly bald Tilda Swinton) trains warriors to defend Earth from a dark force.<br/><br/>We get the predictable ""Rocky in training"" sequence where Strange learns to harness power from teachings of The Ancient One and her band of mystics. It's all quite boring and rote. In fact it's a deluge of CGI the viewer was already hit hard with in the opening James Bond like big entrance. It was too much there and it only ramps up beginning with Strange's multi- dimensional boot camp where he learns to forget all he's learned. Science is crap and the mind is all that must be re-booted. The fallen warrior who stole secrets from books of The Ancient have become the Darth Vader of the dark other universe. If there's an original idea here please let me know because it's been done with far more flair and the love of humanity it seeks to preserve. This is stuff only a Marvel maven and CGI junkie could find compelling.<br/><br/>Sure, Strange survives to win a truce and save Earth, at least until the dark forces regroup and we get a sequel. That is something I, for one, will not be anxiously awaiting. Only for die-hard fans of the Marvel universe."

","Perhaps it is this writer's lack of knowledge on Marvel, but compared to the other groups of superheroes created by the American comic book publisher, such as the Avengers, X-Men or even the Fantastic Four, Dr Strange honestly draws a blank. That said, with the current proliferation of formulaic superhero movies, this unfamiliarity might have actually help the latest movie from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, *Dr Strange*.<br/><br/>For the non-Marvel comics' readers, Dr Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) was a real doctor – a neurosurgeon – before getting into a horrific car accident that destroyed his hands and effectively ended his career. Unable to accept this result, Strange exhausted his resources trying to regain full control of his hands and in the process, alienated the only person who still cared for him, ex-lover Dr Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams). As a last resort, Strange journeyed to Nepal to find a cure at the Kamar-Taj, met the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), started to practice the mystic arts, and in the process, somehow did not regain full functionality of his hands.<br/><br/>Just like how *Deadpool* was a breath of fresh air compared to the Avengers and X-Men series, Dr Strange was a departure from the angst- filled drama of its more established counterparts. Instead, the movie showcased its free-spirited 1960s origins, bringing to mind the trippy LSD-taking, orient-obsessed, self-proclaimed mystic bohemian vibe stereotypical of that era. This was put on full display when Strange first arrived at Kamar-Taj, and was forced on a roller-coaster ride through dimensions, galaxies and worlds. There is only that much of psychedelic-ness one can take before getting turned off by the kitsch, and the movie thankfully pushes that boundary but does not go pass it. On the other hand, what really made the 3D effect pop was, in my opinion, the fight scenes where the characters manipulate buildings and structures, bringing to mind the dreamscapes from *Inception* but with prettier, more symmetrical set design. If this is not your thing, perhaps just skip the 3D option.<br/><br/>As for the protagonist, Stephen Strange also fits nicely between the crass and never-serious Deadpool, and the overly stoic and tortured Captain America. Despite all his failings – selfishness, arrogance and stubbornness – Strange never quite felt like the high-performing genius and jerk he actually was. Kudos to Cumberbatch for that, who perhaps had more enough practice for the role while playing other socially awkward but brilliant people (Stephen Hawking and Sherlock Holmes in TV series *Hawking* and *Sherlock*, and Alan Turing from *the Imitation Game)*. As Strange gets increasingly proficient in the mystic arts, his character does change to someone more compassionate and open-minded, but never losing his snark, as evidenced by how he saved the day. This consistency probably contributed to the character's likability, and was the most real/ convincing thing that would happen in a superhero movie.<br/><br/>With the movie's overwhelming focus on Strange, the other characters were relegated as Strange's sidekicks and support team. McAdam's Dr Christine Palmer made use of what little screen time she had to aid and heal Strange, although McAdams could probably do nothing and still be likable; Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo was the good-natured and straight- laced teaching assistant, whose rigid personality probably made him the most disillusioned by the Ancient One's doings; and for all the cries of whitewashing, Swinton does an admirable job playing the mystical and otherworldly Ancient One.<br/><br/>For the Marvel fans – this review would probably not change your mind on this movie. So for the non-Marvel fans out there (like me), the movie was an entertaining departure from the other superhero movies throughout the year, and worth the watch – even if it is to tide you *Sherlock* fans over until next year."

"Hbarker-32233","5","7","13","19 December 2016"," Doesn't this stuff ever get stale to you people?
","A beat-for-beat remake of the first Iron Man crossed with a Windows 95 screensaver, Doctor Strange is the fourteenth Marvel movie in eight years and one that really reveals the gears of their assembly-line productions. A shame, because it's been directed by Scott Derrickson with an eye-popping pizazz largely missing from these prosaic-looking pictures. This past summer's Captain America: Civil War may have been content to stage its epic battles in dimly-lit stairwells and cruddy office parks, but Doctor Strange traverses entire dimensions while bending space and time with hallucinogenic gusto. (I actually didn't feel ripped-off after shelling out for the IMAX 3D.) In fact, the movie probably wouldn't be as frustrating were it not so wondrous to watch — the visual delights end up underlining a sorry screenplay's slavish adherence to exhausted formulas.<br/><br/>Stop me if you've heard this one, but a filthy rich, arrogant hotshot is forced to reassess his life after a traumatic injury. He's supported by a vaguely Eastern mentor who gets killed off early and a black guy who doesn't get to do much even though he's spent years training for what our protagonist just took up last week. There's also a tremendously overqualified actress hanging around in an insultingly thin girlfriend role, just so our hero will have someone to apologize to later in the movie after he learns a few important lessons and becomes a better person.<br/><br/>Honestly, Iron Man wasn't exactly a masterpiece the first time around but that one at least had the benefit of Robert Downey Jr. snarking up a storm in hungry comeback mode. As narcissistic neurosurgeon Stephen Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch pushes at the outer limits of his charisma but isn't nearly magnetic enough to bring off the role. (But then what do I know? Women on the internet fawn all over this guy. I think he's an okay actor who kinda looks like a foot.) Stephen flips his Lamborghini and shatters his hands, eventually journeying to Katmandu in search of experimental treatments.<br/><br/>The filmmakers try to dodge the source material's queasy stereotypes by casting Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One, a wizened immortal training Dr. Strange in the ways of astral projection and kung fu fighting. She's sensational at selling all this silliness, but her presence has saddled the movie with charges of ""whitewashing,"" even though the alternative would've been a pretty offensive role to offer an old Asian guy. Frankly, I feel like the only way around these kinds of conundrums would be to just not make a Doctor Strange movie at all. However you try to spin it, in the end this is still an antiquated Tarzan fantasy of a gifted and superior white guy discovering an exotic culture and taking no time at all to become way better at it than the indigenous people he ends up rescuing.<br/><br/>Anyway, the fighting was fun. In the ""mirror dimension"" our characters can fold skylines into origami, running up the sides of buildings and dancing down stairwells out of your favorite dorm room M.C. Escher poster. (It looks a lot like that cool demo reel at the beginning of Inception when Leonardo DiCaprio showed off all the awesome powers they weren't allowed to use again for the rest of the film.) Truth be told, I had no idea how any of this was supposed to work, as Doctor Strange is the kind of movie where people dart around during action scenes yelling arbitrary rules for what you're watching. Picture someone jogging a few paces behind the hero, gasping for air and shouting: ""Now he can only be stopped if you say ten words that begin with the letter Q!"" Okay maybe not that arbitrary, but close. There's also some disappointingly flat work by Mads Mikkelsen as yet another boring, barely-written Marvel villain and Chiwetel Ejiofor gives what might be his first bad performance as a sidekick whose main purpose seems to be getting shown up by the star. Rachel McAdams is on hand as Pepper Potts – I mean, Christine Palmer – dutifully waiting around for our callow hero to become decent enough to deserve her. (Meanwhile, I'm still waiting for a movie that deserves Rachel McAdams.) Credit should be given to the filmmakers finding a clever way around the numbing, third-act demolition derby that makes the endings of Marvel movies such crashing bores. A friend of mine thinks the climax is a wry commentary on the inherent repetitions of this franchise, but that's a little more self-awareness than I'm willing to grant these guys at the moment.<br/><br/>Because again, if they're smart enough to subvert that particular cliché then why are we still stuck with so many others? It's moments like this when Doctor Strange is just good enough to make you mad that it isn't better."
"bob-the-movie-man","7","9","18","9 November 2016"," Well Multiversed
","In the latest Marvel film (notably now available with the snazzy new Marvel production logo at the start) Benedict Cumberbatch (""Sherlock"", ""Star Trek Into Darkness"") plays the titular hero: a neurosurgeon with exceptional skills, an encyclopedic knowledge of discographies and an ego to rival Donald Trump.<br/><br/>After an horrific car crash (topically addressing the dangers of mobile use while driving) Strange loses the ability to practice his craft, and descends into a spiral of self-pity and despair. Finding a similar soul, Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt, ""24: Live Another Day"") who's undergone a miracle cure, Strange travels to Katmandu in search of similar salvation where he is trained in spiritual control by ""The Ancient One"" (Tilda Swinton, ""Hail Caesar"", ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") ably supported by her assistant Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor, ""12 Years a Slave"") and librarian Wong (Benedict Wong, ""The Martian""). So far so ""Batman Begins"". <br/><br/>As always in these films though there is also a villain, in this case a rogue former pupil turned to the dark side (have we not been here before Anakin?) called Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelssen, ""Quantum of Solace""). The world risks total destruction from spiritual attack (""the Avengers handle the physical threats"" – LOL) and the team stand together to battle Kaecilius's attempts to open a portal (""Zuuuul"") and 'let the right one in'. <br/><br/>Followers of this blog will generally be aware that I am not a great fan of the Marvel and DC universes in general. However, there is a large variation in the style of films dished out by the studios ranging from the pompously full-of-themselves films at the ""Batman vs Superman"" (bottom) end to the more light-hearted (bordering on ""Kick-Ass-style"") films at the ""Ant Man"" (top) end. Along this continuum I would judge ""Doctor Strange"" to be about a 7: so it is a lot more fun than I expected it to be. <br/><br/>The film is largely carried by Cumberbatch, effecting a vaguely annoying American accent but generally adding acting credence to some pretty ludicrous material. In particular he milks all the comic lines to maximum effect, leading to some genuinely funny moments: yes, the comedy gold extends past Ejiofor's (very funny) wi-fi password line in the trailer.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch also has the range to convincingly play the fall of the egocentric Strange: his extreme unpleasantness towards his beleaguered on/off girlfriend (the ever-reliable Rachel McAdams (""Sherlock Holmes"")) drew audible gasps of shock from a few of the 'Cumberbitches' in my screening. (As I'm writing this on November 9th, the day of Trumpagedden, we might have already found a candidate able to play the new President elect!) <br/><br/>In fact, the whole of the first half of the film is a delight: Strange's decline; effective Nepalese locations; a highly entertaining ""training"" sequence; and Cumberbatch and Swinton sparking off each other beautifully.<br/><br/>Where the film pitches downhill is where it gets too ""BIG"": both in a hugely overblown New York morphing sequence (the – remember – human heroes suffer skyscraper-level falls without injury) and where (traditionally) a cosmic being gets involved and our puny heroes have to defend earth against it. Once again we have a ""big CGI thing"" centre screen with the logic behind the (long-term) defeating of the ""big CGI thing"" little better than that behind the defeat of the ""big CGI thing"" in ""Batman vs Superman"" (but without Gal Gadot's legs unfortunately to distract the male audience).<br/><br/>Music is by Michael Giacchino, and his suitably bombastic Strange theme is given a very nice reworking over the end titles. By the way, for those who are interested in ""Monkeys"" (see the bob-the-movie-man.com glossary) there is a scene a few minutes into the credits featuring Strange and one of the Avengers (fairly pointless) and a second right at the end of the credits featuring Pangborn and Mordo setting up (not very convincingly I must say) the potential villain for Strange 2.<br/><br/>Not Shakespeare, but still an enjoyable and fun night out at the movies and far better than I was expecting. <br/><br/>(Agree? Disagree? Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review and to comment. Thanks.)"
"alexg-beamer","5","9","18","5 November 2016"," Very generic story with amazing visuals and one good character.
","Benedict Cumberbatch is near perfect as Strange. The visuals are amazing. The rest of the characters are there for exposition and sequel set up. The story was very run of the mill in terms of Marvel. They have a money-making algorithm that they have used to churn out a couple amazing movies (all of this is in my opinion, of course), and many mediocre movies. The villains are my second biggest issue with Marvel. I have never found Loki to be a good villain, he's more of a meddler, who I believed has been stretched too far. Marvel seems to pour all of there effort into him, and create poorly written villains. The villains in this movie have amazing, rich, deep comic backgrounds, but in this movie they are explained through a throw away line. The movie is fine."
"bartonj2410","8","9","18","26 October 2016"," People who claim each MCU film is exactly the same must be blind...
","With the arrival of Doctor Strange, the Marvel Cinematic Universe now consists of fourteen films, a franchise that has introduced us to a number of iconic characters who have occupied the pages of comic books for many years, turning Marvel Studios into a box-office behemoth in the process.<br/><br/>The continuing expansion of the MCU is something that each film has to keep in consideration but, while introducing new characters at this stage in a franchise, it's important that these films feel fresh. Doctor Strange does very well in introducing a character I'm not too familiar with, taking time to explore his origin story and becoming one of the most different offerings within the MCU.<br/><br/>Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is one of the world's leading neurosurgeons who, after a major car accident, is forced to give up his career due to severe injuries sustained to his hands. After hearing of a potential cure, Strange sets off on a journey of healing to meet the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton).<br/><br/>Strange's journey takes him to Kamar-Taj, where he discovers the mystic arts. Trained how to use them and taught about the purpose he can serve, Strange takes a path that will change his life forever.<br/><br/>As I've mentioned before, I'm not all too familiar with the character of Doctor Strange in comparison to the likes of Spider-Man, Iron Man or Captain America. That worked massively in favour of the film as I was interested to see how a character like this would fit into the MCU and excited to see something new altogether within the franchise.<br/><br/>Scott Derrickson really has done a great job in making a film that offers that something new while feeling right at home within the MCU at the same time. The exploration of the mystic arts is big enough but Derrickson juggles that with Strange's origin story to make sure this is a hero we want to root for. Derrickson's film flows at a steady pace and features some of the better humour we've seen in the MCU so far.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that a Marvel film possesses impressive special effects however, when you see what they achieve with the effects in Doctor Strange, you can only be even more impressed with them. Watching Strange learn the secrets of the mystic arts gets pretty psychedelic at times while the action sequences, including a landscape shifting chase through New York, are quite breathtaking.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Doctor Strange features a lead in Benedict Cumberbatch that proves, once again, Marvel have got the casting for one of their heroes spot on again. We know Cumberbatch can pull off the arrogance as we've seen him do it as Sherlock Holmes and he does it so well as Doctor Strange, both during his time as a surgeon and sorcerer. It's a trait that makes him a bit difficult to take to but then it's great to see the character earn the respect of the audience as the film goes on. <br/><br/>Cumberbatch is joined by a mightily impressive supporting cast that includes Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Rachel McAdams and Mads Mikkelsen. There's been a bit of controversy surrounding the casting of Swinton in the role of the Ancient One, a problem seen quite often in Hollywood unfortunately, but there's no denying Swinton gives one of the best performances in Doctor Strange. I really enjoyed Chiwetel Ejiofor's take on Karl Mordo and I'm intrigued the direction his character will take in future instalments.<br/><br/>It's the misusage of McAdams and Mikkelsen that leaves a bit of a sour taste, McAdams rather terribly pushed aside to the role of girlfriend while Mikkelsen falls under the curse of weak and underwritten Marvel villain. It's a problem Marvel have really struggled with throughout the MCU with Loki and Ultron being the only stand-out villains. Two memorable villains across fourteen films isn't really good enough though. I mean, McAdams and Mikkelsen both do there best with the limited material they're given but it's a real shame that it has to happen.<br/><br/>As always with Marvel, there's two extra scenes throughout the end credits that tease future projects and it's the one in the middle of the end credits that left me pumped for a particular sequel coming out next year. It also felt like a great subtle nod to Sherlock Holmes, who Cumberbatch has played before. Thanks to a very good introduction to the Sorcerer Supreme, I can't wait to see how he's going to interact with the likes of Tony Stark and Star-Lord when we get to that point in a couple of years."

The only reason I didn't leave mid movie is my wife fell asleep and I didn't want to wake her. Mr. Cumberbash with an American accent demonstrates his abilities but why? That would be like having Tilda Swinton with a cue ball. Oh wait ... Even Stan Lee's cameo was a question mark. As I proceed with this, it's just to fill the required number of lines in the review.

","I went into this movie, knowing I do not usually care for movies, based on cartoon characters. Sorry, but my intelligence demands at least a mild level of plausibility, and though I am willing to take substantial leaps of faith, this one required leaps of mind boggling degrees. <br/><br/>Let me start with my chief complaint. After this misanthrope gets into his accident, and decides to go to extreme lengths to recover his lost powers of surgery, he travels to a monastery in a mysterious kingdom, which even a 12 year old will realize is Kathmandu. He then hooks up with the ""ancient one"", with a minimum of effort. And the straw that really broke this camels back, is that seemingly within days, or perhaps a couple of weeks, he is a 6th degree aikido sensei master, with the ability to bend time and space, and control energy. I suppose in the comic book, he had all of that innate ability, and it was simply dormant, and waiting to be released. But, in the movie, it came across as just another attempt by Hollywood, to make us believe something extraordinary, without giving us the background, nor the character development required to allow us to believe it in a natural fashion. <br/><br/>My friends, who really liked this film, talk about the Inception type special effects. Frankly, I did not see the charm in those effects, though they were cool looking. A planet bends, building get turned upside down, but there are no casualties whatsoever? People just continue working as usual, while their building is on it's side, or upside down? Maybe a lot of 12 year olds do not break things down like that. But, there were some adults at the movies too. A continuation in the abuse cycle that Tinseltown continues to inflict on it's adult audiences.<br/><br/>Am I the only one who walked away from this mess of a movie wondering what I had just saw? How it has gotten such high marks can only be because of the charisma of Cumberbatch. There really is no other reason. The plot made no sense and was completely illogical. Thankfully, the seats were comfortable. Perhaps I didn't like it because I'm a reasonable man, and I realized what a good movie it could have been. A couple of laughs, a couple of gee whiz special effects, but nothing else. <br/><br/>I walked out with about 30-40 minutes left in the film. I just could not subject myself to one more mind numbing fight scene. <br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are a real comic book fan, who enjoys seeing comic book movies, and are able to completely suspend your intellect and sense of reason for two hours, this film is for you."
"ThatAnimeSnob","3","8","16","20 December 2016"," Again with the time reset abuse
","So, I watched Doctor Strange and boy what a forgettable movie it was. Nothing about it felt like it was its own thing. It was just stealing ideas from left and right without ever managing to grow an identity of it own.<br/><br/>The selling point for example is the trippy visuals which are constantly warping reality into a psychedelic kaleidoscope. They do not have an in-story meaning for looking like this; it's just for the cool factor. Inception did the same thing a few years back and although it was a lazy representation of a person's psyche, it was meant to be a representation of their minds.<br/><br/>Not only Doctor Strange does not excuse why things warp the way they do, it goes as far as using the stupid mirror world cop-out, where all the battles are taking place in a copy of reality and thus nothing gets actually damaged in the real world. Hell, nobody even notices it. Despite the flamboyant presentation, nothing actually happens. It's a bunch of chuunis having make belief battles in their minds.<br/><br/>Pretty colors aside, there is still nothing much going on in the movie. Since it's an origin film, means that most of it is spent on the protagonist beginning as normal, then finding a power, and then training how to use said power. By the time he is capable enough to count as a superhero, the movie is close to over. It's a boring build up and unlike heroes like Spiderman or Batman there is very little to care about Strange. It's just some guy who wants to heal his hands and uses mystical powers to do so. He never comes off as someone who does it for the world. This is not compelling drama, he is not an interesting character.<br/><br/>Take the script aside as well. The very way the battles work is not good at all. They are random magic stuff appearing and disappearing all the time. There is no strategy, there are no tactics, it's random bull where everything is possible therefore nothing feels significant. When magic can be abused to the point they can teleport instantly anywhere they want and even travel to other dimensions by flying into them, you stop giving a damn.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the plot convenience is too obvious for Strange. He starts as an average guy and within a few days he tops elite sorcerers. There is this magic cloak that has a will of its own and helps him out all the time. Villains somehow constantly fail to kill him when they have no problem with anyone else. He unexplainably manages to control an infinity stone and constantly messes with time. Which means he abuses a trope I hate: Time loops and time resets. That's how he wins, he repeats events until he does them right, and rewinds time so it's like nothing happened in the end. What is wrong with modern entrainment? Stop doing that! To hell with this movie."

","This movie was totally worth all of my penny. And i don't have that much penny to begin with so its that good.<br/><br/>Cast wise, OH MY HANNIBAL! Mads Mikklesen! He nails it as a villain! But its such a shame they cast him to play a character that does 85% fighting with a big as* eye liner (like seriously... its larger than a Pandas black eye), and 15% talking about how he wants to make a world without time (ahhh... to be young forever. No need expensive skin treatment). Mads should've just a wee bit more screen time just cause we need to see more of his ""villain brain"" than his ""villain magic power"".<br/><br/>Story wise, there's nothing special about the story. It's just... that. Like honestly from A to Z without skipping any BCD till Z. So the story is linear, and the pace is fast (but not brutal, its Disney come on!). You don't need to think (that much) watching this movie. The comedy is really good. It fits perfectly and doesn't feel force. The magics are all wow. It reminds me of Final Fantasy. Especially the special effects and Inception-ish scene, it's like a cut scene before battling the boss in a video game. It's that much fun! So i guess this movie is ""Just sit pretty, have fun and enjoy the movie"". That's what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>Overall, its a Benedict Cumberbatch movie. Who doesn't want to watch a Benedict Cumberbatch movie with colourful magic sign, his short shirtless scene (was it necessary tho?), magical cape that has its own mind, oh and Tilda Swinton as his teacher. Tilda Swinton rocks! She's awesome! Whitewash or not, this movie is worth the time and the passion for those who loves hero movies."

","Doctor Strange is a film about a doctor named Strange. He is involved in an accident, and when traditional medicine fails to heal him, he turns to alternative methods and discovers a world of magic.<br/><br/>Being a movie about a magical magician, it relies heavily upon its VFX to create a believable world for its characters. And in this department, Doctor Strange delivers with beautiful results. It's tough to make an entirely new world, and it's even tougher to make it seem as though it's part of the real world. In this regard, ILM seems to have taken inspiration from Double Negative and their work with Inception six years ago, displaying an exceptional knack for weird shapes and impossible movements. It's also really tough to make a kaleidoscope of buildings, roads and inhabitants (as you might have seen in the trailer) but still keep a sense of direction and focus in an image, especially during the action sequences, but ILM keeps on astounding with their incredible skill with VFX.<br/><br/>Those action scenes also need to be edited well in order for us to be able to really appreciate it, and thankfully, editor Wyatt Smith has made clarity a priority. Instead of a Bourne-style mess of camera movements and quick cuts, action sequences are well organised, with clear distinctions between the two sides of the fight and a direction that can be followed throughout. Despite this calmer edit, the fighting never feels as though it might lack energy, and there's definitely a hair raiser (or two, don't want to spoil anything). <br/><br/>As well as some parts of the film is edited, there are bits where it feels decidedly slow (I yawned a few times). The pacing isn't the best and it feels like the movie was stretched to longer than it should have been. In trying to explain this new magical world, there ends up being a few bits when there is a little too much boring exposition. But even with a few lengthy explanations, there are still some things that are left unexplained – some weird rules which are only mentioned a handful of times and not really elaborated upon. It leaves the audience a little in the dark as to the motivation behind certain decisions that characters take.<br/><br/>Speaking of characters Scott Derrickson made an interesting choice with the 'villain', in that he isn't really evil at all. He is the antagonist, but there is more to the character than a desire to kill and hurt, which is unlike the usual in many superhero films. It means that there's a unique tension throughout a majority of the film, something added to by Strange's mentor Karl (I won't elaborate). Sadly, this is really the only differentiation this film makes compared to the several other origin-story films that Marvel has made over the years. It's a pretty standard setup, where someone has a good life, something bad happens and they are forced to re-evaluate. Not to say that it is bad, but 13 movies later it feels a little overused and definitely contributes to the film feeling a little predictable and on the slow side. Another part that doesn't work too well is the music. Though he is a very talented composer, it doesn't seem as though Michael Giacchino brought his best to the table, instead putting down some more forgettable music which has been a constant problem plaguing almost every Marvel film.<br/><br/>Determined not to take itself too seriously though, Doctor Strange is filled with the usual humour found in Marvel's movies, and Stan Lee's appearance is definitely one of the funnier moments in the film. It also helps that the acting, while not Oscar worthy, is definitely believable, and even the supporting cast did a pretty decent job with their characters. This gives it a very consistent feeling, and no one person is really overshadowed by another, making the film a little bit more believable.<br/><br/>Overall, Doctor Strange is a great watch, a wonderful glimpse into the world of magic and multiverses. Despite its standard plot structure and forgettable music, it remains one of the better films to have been released this year (and miles ahead of anything DC has done so far).<br/><br/>8.4/10 – Definitely worth watching, even if you only go for the psychedelic worlds"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","8","16","26 October 2016"," Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler are FINALLY reunited! Sort of
","Benedict Cumberbatch (best known as Sherlock Holmes in the TV series Sherlock) and Rachel McAdams (Irene Adler in the Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes movies) play exes, Dr. Stephen Strange and Dr. Christine Palmer, who work at the same hospital. He's a successful neurosurgeon; she's a trauma doctor specializing in thoracic surgery. Cumberbatch isn't straying too far from his Sherlock role here, as his Strange is just as stubborn, arrogant and cocky as Holmes...though thankfully doesn't indulge in quite so much speed-talking. Palmer is far more likable a character, as she only wants what's best for Stephen, but after he's in a car accident that robs him of the loss of his hands (the movie's end credits include a driving safety message), she can only take so much of his crap attitude/treatment of her before she's had enough. We haven't seen her like in a female lead throughout the MCU before. She's supportive, but not a pushover, she's firm/tells it like it is, but wouldn't (nor shouldn't) ever be classed as ""whiny/bitchy"". McAdams balances the right amount of strength and warmth that the character requires to ensure the audience is on her side during her 'fight' with Strange post-accident. McAdams also has good comic timing, and her reactions to Stephen later in the film are great. She and Cumberbatch have a nice chemistry, their characters have a very 'grounded/believable' relationship (which contrasts nicely with the later craziness), though they aren't playing out some 'typical MCU love story', it's quite different to what's come before.<br/><br/>Like with his Sherlock, Cumberbatch's Stephen is not someone you are immediately meant to like. He does have a fondness/vast knowledge of music (too bad The Doors' 'People Are Strange' wasn't included), and he can toss out a quip or two, but on the whole he's kind of a jerk. However, what separates him from certain other jerky MCU characters is that his cockiness makes sense given how skilled a surgeon he is, and his stubbornness almost ruins his relationship with Christine, but he goes on a character journey that teaches him humility, patience and to think of others instead of himself. We already know Cumberbatch can play an egotistical jerk to perfection, but throughout the course of the movie his Stephen actually manages to become more likable (moreso than his Sherlock is) and he learns about self-sacrifice (his solution for defeating the film's 'big bad', Dormammu, is quite ingenious). Aiding him in becoming a sorcerer and losing that arrogance is Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One. Her performance seems so effortless, playing this ancient being. She gives off this serene vibe, always so calm and at times frustratingly so (for Stephen especially), but there's more to her than is first presented. She and Cumberbatch play well off each other, sharing some memorable scenes. <br/><br/>Also helping out is Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo and Benedict Wong as Wong. Mordo is a curious character, as he seems on the side of good, but oddly enough his most intriguing/important scene comes post-credits, suggesting he's not what we once thought. There seems to be a running theme of the characters not being quite as they first appear, as Wong seems like the humourless sort who protects the books/spells and doesn't get Stephen's jokes/pop culture references (of which the film could have done with far fewer of, I thought, as they rather overdid it), but by film's end is seeing the humour in things and proves Stephen's closest ally against the Ancient One's former pupil turned adversary, Kaecilius. Mads Mikkelsen, who was so great as Hannibal Lecter and Le Chiffre, doesn't have a whole lot to work with here. He gets maybe one or two amusing lines, but on the whole, like the majority of MCU villains, doesn't leave much of a lasting impression (though at least he uses henchwomen for a change). His fights with the good guys, though, are very memorable. It's the effects on display (which the 3D definitely enhances here, rather than being just a money grab) that are the real stand-outs of the film. Yes, there's been comparisons to Inception, but that was hardly the first movie to feature moving cityscapes (Dark City, anyone?). The mind-bending effects and sheer trippiness of the film is what stands out most, as is Strange's Cloak of Levitation aka THE BEST CLOAK EVER since the Invisibility Cloak from the Harry Potter movies. This one's even better, as it keeps him from harm, helps him find the most appropriate weapons for fighting, wipes away tears from his face and, best of all, kicks the arses of bad guys all by itself. <br/><br/>Like with Ant-Man, this film may feel so 'different' to what's come before that those who have grown comfortable with the MCU movies to date might feel this one's a little *too* different, but I liked the fact that there are still new ways of telling these movies and giving us something we haven't seen before in the MCU. There are two credits sequences, the post-credits one as mentioned earlier (it's worth waiting for, plus you get to hear 'The Master of the Mystic End Credits' tune, which is pretty neat, although the film's score overall does have some sense of familiarity about it), and one mid-credits (my favourite of the two) featuring an amusing cameo from Thor. It's great to see Stephen interacting with another Avenger already (and even better that it's one of the one's I actually *like*). It's the more entertaining of the two credits sequences, and promises some interesting stuff to come whilst raising questions about the next Thor film and what's happened since the last one. He may have started as a jerk, but by the movie's end I'm fully on board with seeing Doctor Strange in further films."

","typical marvel origin story for doctor stranges first solo outing, but an enjoyable one nonetheless. the special effects are by far the best thing about the whole movie, and marvel are to be commended for the outstanding work they did.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch is excellent as Strange, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that Marvel made an excellent choice when they picked him to play the part, and Tilda Swinton is also good as the Ancient One, despite the fact they changed genders for the role.<br/><br/>the only let down for me, was Mads Mikkelsen's villain character, who suffers from the same thing that a lot of marvel studios villains seem to suffer from, namely being boring and one dimensional. Dormammu is built up the entire movie as a major world destroying threat, but gets maybe 10 mins screen time at best, and is defeated far too easily.<br/><br/>overall, a good movie which you should see as soon as you can, but don't make the same mistake that a lot of people did at the screening i went to and walk out as soon as the credits start to roll. you will miss the mid and end credits scenes which most Marvel movies have now."
"tefen","1","11","24","15 May 2017"," Over glorified kaleidoscope special affects demo.
","Despite all of the possible amazing magical power battles that took place there was next to none! The majority of the film is a boring story about an arrogant doctor that is told that he needs to be more humble along with a bunch of kaleidoscope special effects and shifting landscapes/rooms around. <br/><br/>There is very little of anything detailed of a story and the acting is all fairly dry and dead. They waste too much time at the beginning with establishing that he is a pompous jerk. The ""love relationship"" if there even is one is acted rather horribly. I have seen B-list movies that do a much better job with the acting for that part. <br/><br/>It truly is amazing how people can enjoy this and give it good ratings but then hate and rundown other movies just because they get attacked with whitewashing propaganda in the media. <br/><br/>The fact that the only main power that he uses is control over time is very lame and gives for very little action scenes. To top it off and make for the worst part of the movie; they didn't even have a battle scene at the end of the movie and he doesn't even fight the main enemy, all he does is trap the enemy(that is said to have control over time) in a time loop which makes no sense and making even less sense the superior being that should be used to the time issue gets restless and angry, they make a deal instead of Doctor Strange taking the time to learn more each death until he grows stronger & defeats him which provides the views with no entertainment at all."
"brettdharris-14975","10","11","24","27 October 2016"," The Beginning of something Strange...but wonderful
","I have just gotten back from seeing Doctor Strange {28th October, 2:24}, and, wow, was it intense. I'll definitely have to see it a second time to take in all the action and set pieces (not to mention Easter Eggs), but I can say, without a doubt, it is within my top 5 Marvel movies (the top five including Captain America Civil War, Captain America The Winter Soldier, The Avengers, Guardians Of The Galaxy, and Avengers Age Of Ultron; Doctor Strange is tied with The Winter Soldier).<br/><br/>The effects are mind boggling, and the magic helps mask the whole ""fake looking"" problem that some movies suffer from. Yes, Benedict Cumberbatch's Stephen Strange is similar to Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, but where they defer is really obvious: while Tony was humbled by his incident, Stephen becomes more arrogant and distant from everyone he knows. However, much like Iron Man, the story of Doctor Strange is that of finding oneself and becoming a better person because of it. The supporting cast are absolutely amazing, and Tilda Winton as the Ancient One was a choice I thought was odd and didn't suit the character. I was happily incorrect with my first assumption.<br/><br/>The music is truly something that does work in favour for Doctor Strange unlike previous Marvel movies (while I enjoy other Marvel movie music, I can admit that they do pale in comparison to that of Star Wars or The Dark Knight). The story is one that has been told many times now, but Doctor Strange adds creative elements to it that make it stand out (such as magic; big shock, I know), and the final act of the movie is one that works in making Doctor Strange stand out from the standard Superhero movie.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is a strange movie indeed...and I can think of no other movie that would work better with such an uncanny nature to it.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is a Magnificent {10/10} movie."

"MrDHWong","8","7","14","27 October 2016"," A surreal but interesting look into the psyche of the title character
","Doctor Strange is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comic Book of the same name. Although I wouldn't consider it a Top 10 film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I still found it to be a highly enjoyable origin story. Along with Guardians of the Galaxy, this film wasn't afraid to take risks or stray too far from the typical Marvel superhero formula.<br/><br/>Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon, is involved in a car accident that seriously damages the nerve endings in his hands. With his career now ruined, Strange sets out for Nepal, where he heard a paraplegic learned how to walk again. While in Nepal, Strange meets the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), a mysterious person who runs a society of loyal followers tasked with defending the Earth from evil inter-dimensional threats. Intrigued by the possibility of unlocking his full potential, Strange undergoes a lengthy training process with the Ancient One to become a master sorcerer.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most thought-provoking of the Marvel films, Doctor Strange is a surreal but interesting look into the psyche of the title character. Benedict Cumberbatch feels like he's giving it his all in the lead role and even his American accent wasn't too bad, although it is far from perfect. Mads Mikkelsen also gave a solid performance as the film's villain Kaecilius, who didn't just seem like a generic bad guy wanting to take over the world. However, Tilda Swinton steals the show as the Ancient One, Her spiritual lectures in the film really struck a chord with me. The visual effects were fantastic, strongly reminiscent of Inception and 2001: A Space Odyssey. So far, I'd say it's the most visually gorgeous looking film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I look forward to seeing the Doctor Strange character in the future Avengers film.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10. Like with just about every Marvel film, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes."

"Iron-Bat-Prime","7","5","9","4 November 2016"," Doctor Strange ""Try Me, Beyonce!""
","Rating: 7.7, A Good Yet Strange Movie Experience<br/><br/>* Its the end of the 2016 Superhero year, and the M.C.U. has ended it with a new beginning for the comic book genre. Director Scott Derrickson has brought to life a character that few know of, but is sure to become recognisable across the globe through his vision of the strange and the performance of the sorcerer supreme. Whats makes Doctor Strange great is its ability to captivate the audience through its visual wonders and make its movie feel more like an experience, even if you feel completely lost at times.<br/><br/>* Characters: Stephen Strange: Just as Robert Downey. Jr owns Tony Stark, the talented Benedict Cumberbatch's charms brings the doctor to life from his arrogant beginnings to his wisdom of an ending.<br/><br/>The Ancient One: I don't know about you but I haven't seen Tilda Swinton since the Chronicles of Narnia, and her performance of the Ancient One regardless of her gender nor race is exceptional. Her silky voice and smooth movements are felt continuously throughout the feature, and her dramatic death illustrates how the M.C.U. is becoming ever so darker through Phase 3.<br/><br/>Kaecilius: We all know MARVEL Comic struggle with their villains and after witnessing the atrocity of the Mandarin and Malekith, Kaecilius isn't as bad as you would expect. His character is not given much development however Mads Mikkelsen's intimidating performance shadows the strangeness of his character and is given more power from his superior master Dorramu!<br/><br/>Christine Palmer: We are also given your usual love interests of the hero, but the relationship here is rather meaningful yet hilarious at times, and Rachael McAdams does a decent job.<br/><br/>Mordo: A great supporting character who is as conflicted as Strange at times, and Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance is rather meaningful and impacting in conclusion.<br/><br/>Wong: The humour in this movie is present but not always effective, however when the Librarian Wong shows up it's a different story. He may not laugh( or does he...) but you will giggle for sure.<br/><br/>* Plot & Design: The strongest component of a Superhero is their origins, and Doctor Strange illustrates this rather well as it adds components from its previous films particularly the origin of Iron Man (8.5). Although its intro feels slow, the training of the sorcerer supreme is elegant and the feel of Batman Begins (9.0) shines through. But the greatest factor in this movie is it's stellar visuals of the strange. The transformations of objects and structures is as breathtaking as Inception's was (7.0), I highly recommend watching this in 3-D or IMAX, petty me... However the final scenes do feel rather forced and confusing at moments from its bright colours and lights.<br/><br/>* It might not be the greatest M.C.U. movie, but it is indeed a place holder as like DEADPOOL (8.5)before it, it feels rather unique and unlike a MARVEL feature. Its breathtaking visuals and stellar performances shine over its cons and make the story feel meaningful and visually beautiful. P.S: The new M.C.U. studios opening is Friggen Marvellous, and a great end credit scene was put in place. <br/><br/>Thank You for reading this review, and please check out my other Reviews and List here at IMDb: Iron-Bat-Prime!

","Took the boys to see Doctor Strange this afternoon on it's opening day here in the UK.<br/><br/>The best way to describe it is enjoyable but very much to the Marvel formula they have been running with since Iron Man eight years ago. It's a typical superhero origin story where you can pretty much guess where the beginning, middle and end will fall and how they will play out. It still works, but might start to become boring for future standalone films for Black Panther and Ms Marvel if they stick to the same plan.<br/><br/>What makes this work are the outstanding effects and the lead performances. The effects are seamless and flow perfectly into the story. I know that much has been made of the Matrix and Inception type of effects, but those on display here far surpass those two films. Look out for how the cape becomes almost a character on its own and you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>Fortunately the actors are not overpowered by the effects. Cumberbatch is superb as Strange, embodying not only the look of the sorcerer but the change in his manner throughout the film. Swinton is clearly enjoying herself in the type of role she doesn't usually get and gets some of the best action scenes. Ejofer and Mikkelsen are two of the best screen actors around at the moment and bring class to their slightly underwritten roles. Rachel McAdams also achieved a first for me in being tolerable on screen, though her part was largely non-existent.<br/><br/>So in conclusion well worth seeing, though it suffers from a feeling a deja-vu and a slightly disappointing battle with the 'big bad' at the end.<br/><br/>Oh and just to remind viewers to stay until after the credits where there is a more significant scene that that during the mid-credits"
"CoderHead","4","6","12","26 November 2016"," Dr.'s Cure for Insomnia
","Marvel movies have progressively gotten more focused on style over substance and nowhere has it been more obvious than with Dr. Strange. If your friends have told you that the visuals in this film are amazing, they weren't lying to you. I wouldn't call anything about it groundbreaking because you've already seen these things in movies like Inception, Interstellar, The Matrix, etc. - all of which were better movies in every regard. This manifests as a number of sequences that are all essentially the same and get boring very quickly: ""Oh, they're folding reality again....yawn.""<br/><br/>Because I had no comic book relationship with the Dr. Strange character I went into this movie as a blank slate with no expectations (despite having been told it was the most amazing movie ever). Right away, Cumberbatch did an out-of-this-world job of making me loathe Stephen Strange as a human being. Instead of embodying the confident playboy like RDJ did with Tony Stark, they achieved a self-absorbed, self- aggrandizing, entitled, snobbish jerk that didn't even allow me the opportunity to like him. From that point on, every time he opened his mouth I just wanted him to shut up. Even the attempt during the third act to redeem him and show his growth as a person (over, what, a few months? It's unclear) fell flat and came off as more of the same.<br/><br/>Strange sets himself up as a man of science, reason, and intellect. He refuses, like Uncle Vernon in Harry Potter, to acknowledge that there could be any ""such thing as magic"" yet with a single, acid-trippy, out-of- body experience he falls to his knees and pleads, ""Teach me!"" This sequence was too long, too overblown, and not in the least bit compelling for such an impulsive change of a stubborn person's world view. It felt disjointed as an ""Ooh, look at the pretty colors"" scene created because there was still money left in the CGI budget.<br/><br/>The introduction of The Ancient One character is jarring and disappointing amid a swirling Hollywood whitewashing controversy because Tilda Swinton just doesn't communicate the type of human being you could accept as the Eastern spiritual supreme guru - even if you make her bald. It just doesn't work. She turns out to be this weird Obi-Wan type of teacher who has never ending patience when it suits the story and no patience when the script calls for it. Her interactions with Mordo over his interpersonal conflict with Strange take a sort of ""vague, poetic philosophy professor"" approach that never pays off since Mordo just walks off toward the end in a huff and, presumably, will become the bad guy in the next film.<br/><br/>This movie ends (not soon enough, unfortunately) in a battle of the wills with Dr. Strange fighting Dormammu, who apparently isn't amused by being able to murder Strange in every way conceivable for eternity (why not?) and begs the fledgling sorcerer to stop making him kill him over and over...? So Strange makes a deal with Dormammu to take the bad guys to the Dark Dimension and leave. I mean, are we able to assume he could have asked for anything? Is that the best he could have done?<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is just boring. There's nothing remarkable about the story, there's nothing lovable about the characters, there's nothing surprising about the visuals. Coming off of the huge disappointment of Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War, this constitutes an official break-up between the MCU and me. I'm not pouring any more money into this if you're not willing to make more of an effort, Marvel."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","6","12","31 October 2016"," Marvel keeps dishing these out
","""Doctor Strange"" is an American movie that runs for under two hours slightly and was released this year, 2016, very recently actually. The writer and director is Scott Derrickson and after making a handful of films for horror film fans, here he enters the world of superheroes, namely the Marvel Universe. And this will without a doubt turn into Derrickson's most known work to-date. No need to mention all the other characters who already got their own films or were in the Avengers movie as you probably are aware of them anyway if you consider seeing this one. Obviously, Marvel is not running short of these and I am sure Doctor Strange will not be the last guy entering the scene. The title character is played by Benedict Cumberbatch and there are more fairly famous names in the cast. You can check out the list to find out who exactly appeared in here. Actually, I myself thought Stuhlbarg's character would turn into some kind of antagonist judging from the early scenes but he was just a mean to show the character development towards being a nice guy for Cumberbatch's character. Speaking about him, you could call him a mix of Dr. House, Sherlock and a superhero eventually I guess. Other than that, the film also makes parallels to stuff like ""Inception"" or ""Doctor Who"".<br/><br/>The way how you see this movie will have a lot to do with how much you like Cumberbatch. I personally think he is a very overrated actor who does not have half as much range as people make him out to have plus his approach to very different characters looks almost always the same. And this movie here is no exception either. Let's be honest: The first half hour of the film is Cumberbatch channeling his Sherlock 100%. But away from him and let's look a bit at the film in general. Stan Lee has his cameo as usual and the main antagonist is played by Mads Mikkelsen 10 years after he gave another very memorable villain performance in a Bond movie. But sadly, his turn here offers very little in terms of memorability and this has mostly to do with how forgettable and generic the character was written. Mikkelsen still makes the most of it. In terms of the plot, a bit of it is predictable (Swinton's character's fate e.g.), but not everything. These two hours definitely also have many lighter moments, but there aren't many that are working out from a comedy perspective. One exception would be the name confusion between hero and antagonist or Cumberbatch mentioning his astral body. McAdams was part of several of these comedy moments and she definitely elevates the material, but seriously Cumberbatch is so bland and has no comedic talent at all and his always-the-same tongue-in-cheek approach becomes stale and cringeworthy quickly. Most of the scenes intended as somewhat funny to create a balance with the more heavy material aren't working.<br/><br/>Eventually, this film here is a decent watch for comic book film fans, even if there are many weaknesses included. Still, the story is solid for the most part and some of the scenes and characters are also memorable, even if there was nothing really new or innovative in here that you haven't seen in Marvel films in recent years yet. The film also offers some of the best in terms of special effects, but for real film lovers like me it's difficult to really appreciate these if the story is a bit flawed. I'm curious what you think about the film's comedy. As for me, I definitely prefer the darker, unfunny approach to superhero films, but this is not the one taken in the Marvel films and this should not come as a surprise to anybody anymore. Besides that, I don't think Cumberbatch was ideal for the part. Most of the other actors are though and I am a bit surprised how many English actors are in here. What else can be said? Oh yeah, at the end there is already a bit of a teaser about Strange and Thor working together on a future project and this is probably the next film we can expect where the focus is on Thor, his dad and once again the brute brother Loki. Finally, one more word on this one here. They really tried to make it different compared to other Marvel films with all the intellectual, the doctor, the scientist references, but it's not working out. The only effect it had on me was that I was wondering where are the other heroes when the world is in danger. Besides, the time references (and how crucial it was at the end) felt a bit random. Clumsy references to watches just aren't enough to make it work in the long run. I see this film has received many strong reviews and receptions so far and I am a bit baffled by that. It is a solid film, but there is not a single aspect that stands out and even if these 2 hours flew by quickly, I don't think it will get people interested in superhero films if they did not like them before already.

","The superhero genre is entering the stage where it will become increasingly hard to tread new ground and appease the masses, who over the course of a decade or thereabouts have been treated to a large contingent of high quality and highly entertaining outings filled with capes, dastardly world destroying villains, star studded casts and more quips than a John McLane Xmas party gone bad. <br/><br/>Kings of the superhero domain, Marvel have been leaders in developing box office behemoths as their counterparts DC struggle to maintain pace after their Nolan Batman trilogy came to an end but even with the recent box office heavyweights Civil War, Age of Ultron, Deadpool and the well-received Ant-Man, Marvel to showed glimpses of the toll the superhero overkill has taken on the movie industry, trying to bring freshness and the wow factor that the genre once produced at ease is no longer as easy as it once was. <br/><br/>Then along comes Doctor Strange. <br/><br/>By no means reinventing the wheel but using the wheel in different ways, Scott Derrickson's film is very much an origin story that follows a well-trodden path, Doctor Strange, the story of the esteemed Dr. Stephen Strange who turns to the spiritual realm in search of healing from an horrific accident only to find himself our world's newest protector from nasty other-worldly beings, is absolutely the superhero film we needed right now, filled with fine casting choices, quick smart humour, an often bizarre and unique playground to dwell in and enough eye watering Inception-lite spectacle that will have many eyes laid wide open gazing at the big screen. <br/><br/>Calling to mind the success of Marvel's huge breakthrough Iron Man from 2008, with Strange bearing more than a small resemblance to the origin story of a one Tony Stark (arrogance and wise cracking included), Doctor Strange excels off the back of Benedict Cumberbatch's impressive turn as the wonder-doctor and supported by the likes of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Tilda Swinton and the underused Rachel McAdams, Derrickson allows his cast to work their skills into the film while the director himself, who once seemed an odd choice (Sinister was beforehand his best film) showcases a talent for the imaginative that makes you hope he too will return for the next installment in this magic infused universe. <br/><br/>Where Doctor Strange falls short is in the recently troublesome superhero 'big bad"" and despite the presence of esteemed actor Mads Mikkelsen (who sadly has become a bit of a villain typecast in recent years), the purple eyed Kaecilius, who wants nothing more than to meet a world destroying entity is anything but the adversary the unique Stephen Strange deserved, while the previously mentioned nature of this following the playbook origin story isn't breaking much ground in the way it tells the story of a man at his lowest finally realizing his true potential. <br/><br/>After the stale Batman Vs Superman, the disappointing Suicide Squad, the fun yet forgettable Civil War and the overrated swear-laden Deadpool, Doctor Strange is exactly the type of comic book movie we needed and a nice change of pace (keep your ears open to for Michael Giacchino's un-superhero like harp infused score) for the direction Marvel was and still is heading into. <br/><br/>A likely crowd pleasing experience that should be seen on the biggest screen available, this polished, inventive and most importantly fun thrill ride is yet another example as to why Marvel continue to pave out successes, where they should now be hitting bumpy roads. <br/><br/>4 Wi-Fi passcodes out of 5"

","Another admirable film from Marvel that largely stays true to its comic book origins. Trying to do a spoiler free review so I'm not going into detail. Boxed ticked just in case! <br/><br/>Marvel may have another Robert Downey Jr. in Benedict Cumberbatch. He's excellent in the title role. A top notch actor giving a top notch performance. Marvel's casting decisions are usually very good and this is no exception. The Ancient One may be a bloke in the comic but who cares when Tilda Swinton is so Karmacally good here. The whole cast do well; and I especially liked Bendedict Wong's, er, Wong.<br/><br/>The mind-bending stuff is cool. Early hippies assumed Steve Dikto was off his face on LSD when drawing the comic, something so inaccurate it was hilarious. But Ditko's brilliant art in the original comic was drawn only with the aid of his unaided imagination. And the psychedelic stuff is superb in this movie. There's even a bondage gag for those in the know (Ditko occasionally swapped chores with a bondage comic artist).<br/><br/>I do have a few qualms. Yep it is influenced by Inception in part (Chris Nolan influences the MCU!) and also the training of Strange is not dissimilar from the training of Neo in The Matrix. These influences are worn on the sleeve. Also we needed a little more time to get to know Strange before his accident - it's rushed into a little bit.<br/><br/>All in all though, Marvel have delivered another highly entertaining entry in the MCU, some of the effects are jaw-dropping. And do stay for the post credit scene. I think you will enjoy it."

So the movie success relied writing and CGI. It blew me away. The acting was great, the characters were great, and CGI was top notch. It is even better than the comics in my opinion. Some of the characters are different gender than the comics and it works even better. <br/><br/>I can not think of anything I did not like about this movie. Except maybe I wanted some of the characters to get more screen time. But even that is not that big deal because I also feel most characters had enough time on screen too.

","If you want to get straight to the review itself, skip the first paragraph.<br/><br/>Before anything, i just want to let you know this is my first review, so despite knowing that many people have established a certain system in their reviews and have everything divided into sections, i wont even try to go there, and instead give you my honest opinions and impressions to hopefully give you some insight.<br/><br/>So, let's get straight to business. The very basic question would be, is the movie good and worth watching? Yes. And no. It really depends on a couple of things, and it all pretty much boils down to what a fan of Marvel universe and/or Marvel movies you are.<br/><br/>There might be a couple of very minor spoilers ahead, so be warned. I'll play fair and won't spoil anything important, but still, i feel like it's worth letting you know first.<br/><br/>The very first thing that made me wonder if i really am watching a Marvel, very anticipated, very well funded movie, is something in the opening scene. We are shown the movie's antagonist, Kaecilius. While Mads Mikkelsen's performance is stellar, as expected from such a good actor, his whole appearance is something you'd except in a Mortal Kombat B movie, not this movie. Even his lackeys have this 80s baddie and his gang vibe, that kind of doesn't fit in a Marvel movie, at least not for me. <br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch also performs very well, to me, the way he just fits the character of Doctor Strange was very similar to how Robert Downey Jr. made me think ""Oh my god, THIS is the perfect fit for Iron Man"" when i first saw the first Iron Man. There isn't really much else to say, he just fits. Perfectly.<br/><br/>What doesn't fit perfectly is the movie's pacing. Something that was bugging me a lot was how little time is given to the establishment of certain environments and scenes. You know where you are, what you are watching and what's going on, but that's pretty much it. This makes you feel that despite the fact that the number of sets that the story takes place in is not small, it somehow ends up feeling like it. Thanks to this sort of strange pacing of some scenes, we end up with a lot of information and not a lot of time to process it. And thanks to that, you just float through the story, without being given enough time to enjoy it properly. As a result, Dr. Strange is one of those movies you have to see twice or thrice in order to let everything soak in and give your brain time to focus on things you didn't have time to process when watching earlier. This is a reoccurring problem with Marvel movies, but i guess it is something to be expected when you need to squeeze rich story into short screen time.<br/><br/>One more thing comes to mind, the story itself. It's not BAD. It makes sense, it IS enjoyable, entertaining etc., HOWEVER, i can very honestly say that what you see in the trailers are pretty much the major points of the movie. And i mean those shots itself, like Dr. Strange and Mordo standing in front of a shifting city. That's it. The story is there, but the visuals just push it into the background as you are bombarded with psychedelic scenery after another, and an explosion after explosion, and a spell after spell... and before you know it, you feel as if you're watching some sort of a CGI demo reel that's just wrapped around some sort of a story that was quickly put together to give the movie at least some sort of a shape. There are some scenes that give a friendly nod to the rest of the Marvel movies, such as The Ancient One talking briefly about the Avengers or the fact that we are shown another Infinity Stone, but all that just feels like it's there just to remind us that these movies take place in the same universe.<br/><br/>To be quite honest, i personally felt a little empty after seeing the movie, like something was missing, or like that wasn't all there was to the story. And these feelings are not without basis, that's how the movie is. It just doesn't feel like a part of this massive undertaking that Marvel has been doing for a long time now, and i know that there isn't much that could connect the story of the movie to the rest of the Marvel universe until the very ending, but still i feel like it could have been done better, and the movie COULD be a lot more satisfying to watch. But as it is, it just leaves you a little disappointed after watching it. Not even the soundtrack stands out, no catchy, memorable themes, it's just there, in the background of all the stunning visuals, just like everything else in the movie.<br/><br/>So, for the verdict. If you are a Marvel fan like me, definitely watch the movie, but don't expect much. Marvel has a tendency to not do that much of a good job when exploring new territories, and Dr. Strange was in the realm of uncharted waters, and as a result, it falls a bit short, just like Antman or the early Hulk movies."
"ironhorse_iv","8","4","7","8 November 2016"," No doubt about it. This movie was indeed strange. I kinda like this superhero version of a kaleidoscope LSD trip!
","During the psychedelic era of the late 1960, as many hippies rejected mainstream organized religion in favor of a more personal spiritual experience, often drawing on indigenous and folk beliefs. This would also have an influence on the field of medicine, as many people seek the various practices of eastern spiritual medicine over the science of western health, during that day. In order to capitalize on that, creator Steve Ditko and Marvel Comics created 'Doctor Strange'. Inspired by old school radio adventure serials mystical programs like 'Chandu the Magician' & 'Mandrake', 'Doctor Strange' tells the story of a former neurosurgeon turn sorcerer, Doctor Stephen Strange on his quest to reclaim his broken body, while also having to protect the Earth against magical and mystical threats. The comic book character soon became very popular. So, it was no surprised that Marvel Studios would one day, bring this comic book character to live action on the big screen. However it took many years for their plans to work. The first attempt in 1978 was so badly made, that they choose to air it as a TV movie. Their next try was in 1992, with 'Doctor Morbid'. Due to the studio's license to the character expired before production has finished, the film had to change a lot from the source material. It was equally as bad as the 1978's version. The 2007's cartoon movie was alright, but it wasn't until 2016, that 'Doctor Strange' finally hit the big screen with great results. Being the fourteenth film entry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the film directed by Scott Derrickson finally gave us, the magical spell-bounding visuals, this series needed. Remind me so much of 1999's 'The Matrix' & 2010's 'Inception' in a way. Marvel comics fans will also be pleased to see that the original Doctor Strange art by the character's co-creator, Steve Ditko, is not forgotten and paid proper respect. Kudos as well to Michael Giacchino's appropriately drug-fuel score, which helps propel the action. I also find the clever cameo from both writer Stan Lee, and the foreshadowing end credits, pitching 'Thor: Ragnarok' fun to see. However, the writing from screenwriters, Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, could need some work, as it felt a bit unbelievable in the coincidences. Like how did the 'Orb of Agamotto' get from the throne room from 2011's 'Thor' to one of the sanctums control by the Kamar-Taj? Also, the whole idea of time-travel seem a bit rush, and somewhat confusing. Another thing it's really hard to believe that Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), at first, would be, so against magic, seeking how both witchcraft, supernatural beings, and aliens, population his world in all of the Marvel movies. It's so hard to believe that the only damage, the rich selfish guy would had from a car crash is nerve damage in his hand. Anyways, while the first part feels a bit formulaic, having seen similar comic book story arches both in 2008's 'Iron Man' and 2005's 'Batman Begins', my main gripe against the film was the out of place, force humor, poorly written female characters and underdeveloped villains. Don't get me wrong, Cumberbatch is perfect choice to play Strange, as his own mixture of gravitas, but he is far from being a great comedian. Leave the jokes to somebody else. Also, it was a bit disappointment to see Rachel McAdams having nothing much to do on screen, as Strange' former lover Christine Palmer. It's sad that she wouldn't get to be the hero 'Night Nurse', since the character Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), who appears in Marvel's Netflix television series, will seem to portray her for a very long time. Yet, the worst has to be, the misused of Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius. The combination of several antagonists from the comics, Kaecilius was used in the film to drive the introduction and development of bigger villains for the future, including ""certain individuals who live in other dimensions"". In other words, Mikkelsen was just a tool that was greatly underused. He is a generic, forgettable henchmen for Dr. Strange to fist-fight with. I wish, he was Kaluu, instead. I also feel that his superior, Dormammu (also played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is just as forgettable. The generic all-powerful smoke monster villain attacking Earth remind me, too much of 2007's 'Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer' & 2011's 'Green Lantern' in a bad way. I felt that all the Dormammu stuff, could had cut off, seeing how it kinda ruins the oncoming 'Infinity War' movies, seeing how one man can outsmart an all-powerful being like him. How can a normal villain like Thanos (Josh Brolin), do any better? If anything, Karl Mondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) should had turn to the villain, faster. While, the film lacks memorable villains. The film made up with great actors for the supporting heroes in the film. Both Tilda Swinton and Chiwetel Ejiofor were wonderful as Karl Mondo and the Ancient One, even if it's a bit whitewashing. I'm for one, wasn't too angry, by the filmmakers choices that they were trying to avoid the Asian Fu Manchu stereotype. Yet, I can understand, the backlash from some audiences, of not giving one of few significant Asian roles to an Asian actor. Still, it does almost comes off as a bit paternalistic to have the educated Western man save all the mystic foreigners from their own incompetence. 'It's a damn if you do, damn if you don't' decision. Still, the movie has a positive message about humility, and not being so arrogant. In the end, it was a fun trippy movie with a lot of potential for greater things in the future."

","... but unfortunately no-one's home. <br/><br/>By which I mean to say: Plenty of things are happening, but there is no evocative core, character building, or genuine emotion. <br/><br/>It's a film for people that need things to happen, without any feels involved. <br/><br/>It's full of bombast, exposition, left field cuts and platitudinous axioms that essentially do not amount to much. This leaves very little space for performance or subtlety from the leads. <br/><br/>That being said there is good space (made) for comedy, and it's very well done. Ultimately, though, it's a shame that those short moments (which gave more character than any other in the film) are few and far between. Even the physical comedy is good. It's by no means a dark and broody affair, it's just that the pace is far too fast, and the cuts are far too frequent for any personal narrative to build over all the stuff that is happening. <br/><br/>This is a shame, because the film is gorgeous, and I was genuinely blown away a few times. Visually it's stunning, however that really translates poorly to any drama for the characters involved. <br/><br/>I believe that there is a film in there, somewhere, perhaps on the cutting room floor, I do not know. Perhaps I needed a bit more time with him as a person before and after before we were thrown in to scene after scene of (quite, quite, awesome) action. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I think they've struggled to tame the language, and have perhaps gone a bit too respectful of the source material, which is unweildy at the best of times. Dumbing it down really could have helped the performances sell this a little more, and since we are at the start of the good Doctor's journey, that might not have been too bad a thing. <br/><br/>It's fine, but there is more film in there somewhere, begging to get out of the mirror that this is."

","The big difference between Marvel Studio productions of Marvel characters, and the other studios that do Marvel characters, is that Marvel Studios get it and do a really great job.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch initiates his role with a superb presentation of the egotistical, narcissistic and arrogant Stephen Strange. Rather than the evolution of the character being, as so many are, instant transformation, Cumberbatch's Strange demonstrates the ongoing battle with his inner unlikeable self and the person he will become.<br/><br/>While there was much uproar with the casting of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One, if you can drop the default from canon argument, she does her usual high quality work.<br/><br/>The story remains interesting and moves along at a good pace. While there is no dearth of kaleidoscopic CGI effects, the effects do not dominate the film. It is also filled with a number of truly funny moments. For Marvel fans, who know the Marvel pantheon, there are plenty of Easter eggs, but unlike some films they do not splatter into your face, one needs to be on the game to catch them all. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie, as did my spouse who is not a superhero movie person at all. She doesn't care for Cumberbatch generally but gave him high marks for his acting. The Mordo character was well played, but more could have been done with him to increase the overall dimensionality of the film. The Mads Mikkelsen character well played well was a bit flat, and that was a bit sad, as Mikkelsen has much more capability than was leveraged in my opinion."

","I must still be in my astral form, floating in an etherium of utter, unbelieving, bliss, gliding, translucent and glowing, for my feet have not touched the ground once. Forget everything you know about Superhero movies, a beloved genre that began beautifully as an eccentric niche, and was falling dangerously close to convention. Let your mind be opened to the infinite impossibilities that await you...................<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is a MASTERWORK worthy of the name, MARVEL!!! It is unprecedented in every mirrored and reflected facet, unparalleled in its incredulous abilities, there has NEVER been a film like it, it's breathtakingly innovative, truly groundbreaking, a kaleidoscope of unimagined vibrance, and mind-blowingly BEAUTIFUL!!!!! With a man at the heart of it all that is nothing less than pure MAGIC. I didn't watch a film last night, no, I EXPERIENCED a man transformed, body, mind, and soul into a superhero, and saw a star BURST into a powerful, blinding, supernova!!!! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you an unstoppable force, the INCREDIBLE, INCOMPARABLE, SENSATION Benedict Cumberbatch!!!! <br/><br/>Mr. Cumberbatch doesn't just act, he BECOMES, giving life and laughter to a BRILLIANT Doctor at the top of his profession. His Stephen Strange is arrogant yet endearing, prickly yet charming, well-liked and jovial. He's got the world on a string and he knows it, and his steady hands have been magic from the beginning, garnering for him wealth, and acclaim, a career that he adores, prizes as if it were a real and breathing love interest. Stephen Strange feels so intricately nuanced and real, as exquisitely woven as the nerve cells he so expertly navigates. It's as if he's the other dimension, American Cumberbatch, like he's been living all this time in a parallel universe, just on the other side of the mirror, an ingenious doppelganger, who's as talented at neurosurgery, as Benedict is at acting. I believed him completely, as this rockstar doctor, dancing to 70's music, outshining his peers, laughing and quipping with the interns. I believed entirely that he could actually perform all of those complicated, impossible surgeries without batting an eye. Again, Ben doesn't ""play,"" Stephen Strange he creates him.<br/><br/>Mr. Benedict Cumberbatch has exquisitely OUTDONE himself in this fast-paced, highly decadent, soaring epic of an origin story. It's so refreshingly new, so unique, unlike anything ever done before, a novel and masterfully executed, feat of cinema sorcery. It's a soaring magical kaleidoscope trip through the infinite and the impossible, a Technicolor, twirling dream through time. With his Doctor Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch has broken into a whole new untouched celestial realm of his vast and uncharted talent. I'm still a bit shell shocked...........<br/><br/>The visual effects are in themselves MYSTIFYING, and spellbinding, cleverly tricking the eye again and again, until you're SURE what you are seeing, is in fact real!!!! Think of the first time you saw a magic trick, no matter how seemingly simple, as a child. Remember that astonished look on your face, that wonder and baffled merriment as you tried to figure it, but couldn't!!!! THAT'S what Doctor Strange is!!!!! Countless times I thought, with wide, incredulous eyes, ""HOW did they do that!?!?"" I've seen movies in IMAX before, but I was not at all prepared for these breathtaking, heart-racing, effects that I not only saw, but LIVED through, up close in this EXCEPTIONAL world!<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent. Rachel McAdams is the gorgeous, natural beauty of Stephen's Ex, who keeps up with him, puts him in his place, and brings out something tender and gentle in him, as revealed in a beautiful, and loving inscription on the back of his watch. It's a moment that surprises and quietly delights, tugging at your heartstrings in the sweetest way. Benedict Wong's straight faced, dead pan reactions to Stephen's tom-foolery, and wittily relevant pop culture references, is BEYOND perfect, and there's this HILARIOUS scene of him listening to Beyonce that made the whole audience laugh SO hard!!!! It's a wonderful moment, and you really get invested into Stephen's side sojourn to make Wong laugh!!!! Tilda Swinton is a REVELATION!!!!! She's ethereal and mystic, and preternatural, as the Ancient One. Her voice sings with such old world wisdom, and again, her chemistry with BENEDICT is scintillating!!! Her tranquil strength, her enlightened power........... all prove her to be the ONLY choice as Stephen's Sagacious Sensei. All those naysayers who were wary of her casting will be FOREVER silenced after seeing her in action.<br/><br/>Marvel and Benedict Cumberbatch have made magic and mysticism real before our very eyes. Ben becomes their greatest, and most multi-faced, three dimensional hero. What makes him so compelling as a superhero for me is his vulnerability. He's not a hulking, gamma-radiated specimen. He doesn't have laser eyes, an iron suit, or even super strength. He has the power of his mind, the magic coursing through his fingers, and the inner peace of enlightenment. He's the hero that MARVEL desperately needed, to bring new enchantment to their Universe, to take audiences to new worlds, and show them places they can't even imagine. This film is a labour of love and a testament to the mesmerizing caliber of everyone involved. For the Man with the Magic hands, this is the golden portal to everything he's worked so relentlessly for. This is his moment, his entrance to the beyond. A level of stardom that he has so rightly deserved since he first uttered those immortal words back at Baker Street. Like Strange himself, he's got time on his arm, and magic at his fingertips. I'm ready to take this adventure with you, Stephen, by astral forms, between dimensions, and through conjured portals.The beyond, the awaiting wonders and dangers beckon. The portal opened, a limitless power protected, a hero rises, and the impossibilities are endless..............."

Exceptionally well done character development, with many comedic moments to break up any unwanted plot tension. The director obviously knew what he was doing. The scientific accuracy of the medical portion of the plot was impressive. The attention to detail in the movie with regard to how Steve Strange acquired his abilities is mind bending.

","Doctor Strange tells the story of neurosurgeon, Dr. Stephen Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch). Stephen Strange is a brilliant doctor, who can perform the most complicated surgeries, effortlessly. Strange is also very arrogant & thinks no end of himself. One day, Doctor Strange meets with a fatal car accident. After he recovers, Strange goes on a journey to heal himself completely. This journey makes him meet people, who teach him about the mystic arts & the various different dimensions in the universe. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange is a mind blowing film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has made, yet another masterpiece. This movie is one of my all-time favorite origin stories, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual effects are otherworldly. All the various dimensions shown in the film, look gorgeous. The scenes where Doctor Strange is traveling through various realms, look very surreal. You have to see the movie to appreciate the magnificence of these scenes. The 3D puts you right in the middle of this topsy-turvy, magical & amazing world. The highlights of the film are the New York set piece, the climax & of course, the performances. Benedict Cumberbatch is spectacular as Dr. Stephen Strange. Cumberbatch portrays all the different emotions his character goes through during the course of the movie, with aplomb. Chiwetel Ejiofor is outstanding as Mordo. Rachel McAdams is excellent as Christine Palmer. Benedict Wong is awesome as Wong. Mads Mikkelsen is brilliant as Kaecilius. Tilda Swinton is amazing as The Ancient One. Michael Stuhlbarg & Benjamin Bratt are great as Dr. Nicodemus West & Jonathan Pangborn, respectively. Stick around till the end of the credits because there's a mid-credits scene & a post-credits scene. Doctor Strange is another unforgettable film, in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's a must watch, preferably in IMAX 3D. Go, experience a one of a kind movie about magic."

","I have never written a movie review before but this movie is so exceptional I simply could not refrain. I have been collecting Dr. Strange comics since I was 7 years old, he is my all time favorite super hero, and I was filled with trepidation that they would ruin it; but far from it. Everything about it was phenomenal - the special effects, the costumes,the fight choreography, the acting... and it was very true to the original comics. Benedict Cumberbatch just nails the lead role and Tilda Swinton is amazing, as is Chiwetel Ejiofor and Mad Mikkelsen. The movie is thought provoking and inspiring as well as entertaining; I and my friends had an almost 2 hour conversation about, well, life the universe and everything after seeing it. You know it is a good movie when it evokes conversations of that kind. It is by far the most sophisticated of all the Marvel films to date, but then again Dr. Strange is probably the most sophisticated Marvel super hero. Did notsee it in 3D so I will be going again soon to check it out with enhancements!"
"sergiok3","7","5","10","31 October 2016"," AMAZING visuals, OK plot... (warning SPOILERS ahead)
","OK so I have to start by stating once again that the visuals are just spectacular. It truly is a eye-orgasm to watch this movie. That being said...I just wish they would have put a little more effort into the plot, and here's why...<br/><br/>OK we get it, Dr Strange is an asshole. While the script might have said that Dr Strange's character had to be portrayed as arrogant and self centered, I really think they over did it. It's one thing to be arrogant and it's another to be not very impressed by anything. Here's my case, the first time the Supreme Sorceress shows him all these other dimensions and powers she had, the first think this guy says is ""show me"". Someone who clearly did NOT believe in ""magic"" or sorcery now all of the sudden reacts as if he always knew it existed and it almost seems as though it was something he'd been looking for his whole life. The psychological impact should've been much more intense. <br/><br/>Then...is this kamaj-taj like an all in country club? Seriously, someone just comes knocking at there door and they show anyone all these amazing powers? Nah-uh, I ain't buying it. Very very weak plot here. In my opinion, they should have recruited Dr Strange because of some force that the supreme sorceress sensed in him. They should have looked for him, not the other way around. So what is Dr. Strange never had that car accident? Or what if he did have that accident but never severely damaged his hands? C'mon Hollywood, you can do better than that. <br/><br/>And finally, how he beats the all mighty dormamu. Really...? A Bargain? So he uses the eye to set an infinite time loop so that Dormamu would get so fed up with living the same instance that he would eventually give up? REALLY? Oh please, and also, why the hell didn't anyone else use the eye before to just turn back time and never let the forbidden pages be stolen??? Drives me nuts. <br/><br/>Anyway, those are my 2 cents on the movie. Overall good, but man, I can't believe these are movies with huge budgets and they can't get simple stuff done right. Still kudos to everyone who made this movie possible. The after credit scene was the best! lol"

","Do you remember when you saw Iron Man the first time and thought to yourself ""that guy is made for that role!"". - Maybe not, but i had that moment. <br/><br/>Now i had the same moment again. Benedict Cumberbatch is made for this role. He plays it very well!<br/><br/>It is in my top 3 movies this year. Might even be nr.1, but i wouldn't want to give a prize before the year ends :).<br/><br/>Good short and unchaotic fight scenes. Overall, scenes have been cut in a very tasteful way and it contained a very special kind of awkward comedy with very well chosen moments to hit you with those awkward jokes. <br/><br/>To make it simple: I have paid a good sum for my 3d tickets and i exited the cinema thinking they deserved my money. The last time i had this feeling was at ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"". ( I like Owls :) )<br/><br/>Thank You Scott Derrickson, Jon Spaihts, C.

","i watched this movie today at the cinema. I do not go to the cinema often but i was really curious when i watched the trailer and its a superhero movie, so its better to watch at the cinema. Anyway i really liked this movie. Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect for the role of Dr. Stephen Strange. Its one of my favorite actors. But especially in this movie his acting is amazing. Not that the rest of the cast is bad. On the opposite. Every actor is this movie is perfectly fitted for his role.The plot is well written, especially for an origin movie. Its the best origin movie i have watched and i have watched many movies. I loved the fact that there is not much romance in this movie as almost in every super hero movie there is a love story. Till now my favorite marvel super hero was iron man. But now Dr. Strange took a special place in my heart. A lot of action and great music. i really enjoyed watching it i highly recommend it and i will go to watch it again."
"jeddjong","8","5","10","26 October 2016"," The Sorcerer Supremacy
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe charts a path into realms unknown with this fantasy adventure, the 14th (!) film in the ever-expanding canon. Our hero is Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch), a gifted but self-absorbed neurosurgeon whose life is upended following a car crash. His hands irreparably damaged, Strange is unable to find satisfactory treatment through western medicine, and heads east to Kathmandu. In a sanctuary called Kamar-Taj, the Ancient One (Swinton) holds court, opening Strange's eyes to unexplainable wonders. Strange sets about mastering the mystic arts, guided along by the Ancient One's disciple Karl Mordo (Ejiofor) and Wong (Wong), the keeper of Kamar-Taj's sacred relics. The Ancient One's students and humanity at large is threatened by Kaecilius (Mikkelsen), a former pupil who went rogue and is meddling in dark powers that could doom humanity. As Strange's colleague and ex-girlfriend Dr. Christine Palmer (McAdams) comes to terms with his transformation, Strange must use his newfound abilities to defeat Kaecilius and his followers. <br/><br/>For all of the MCU's strengths and its branching into various subgenres, things have been feeling samey-samey. Audiences crave something all-new, all-different, and Doctor Strange is different enough. Director Scott Derrickson, known for horror films like Sinister and The Exorcism of Emily Rose, takes on his biggest, most ambitious project yet, emerging out the other side victorious. This is a film that's packed with eye-popping invention. Production designer Charles Wood and visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, among the legions of artists and technicians involved, are worthy of commendation. <br/><br/>The trailer, with its origami folding cities, had me worried that the imagery would be too similar to that of Inception. It turns out that the trippiest stuff has been saved for the film itself, with kaleidoscopic vistas, Doctor Who-style tunnels through space-time, buildings morphing and shifting like Dark City on steroids, and ghostly Astral projections floating between this plane and the next among the tricks up its sleeves. The mind-bending geometry gives the action sequences a delightfully unpredictable landscape in which to play out. The results resemble weaponised Escher artwork. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange may serve up eye candy unlike anything we've seen from the MCU so far, but for the most part, this is a straightforward hero's journey origin story. The haughty doctor must be brought to his lowest point, accept that there are things in this world and others beyond his understanding, and come into his own as a superhero. Things move along nicely and the screenplay by Jon Spaihts, C. Robert Cargill and Derrickson is witty without being smug. Just as Deadpool was a standard-issue origin story dressed with self-referential irreverence and attitude, Doctor Strange is a standard-issue origin story spiced up with logic-defying dazzlement. This reviewer will admit to thinking Benedict Cumberbatch wasn't the best man for the job, and that Cumberbatch was cast in an effort on Marvel's part to ride the Sherlock wave. This reviewer was wrong. It is gratifying to see a performer take the material as seriously as one would treat Shakespeare. Cumberbatch's commitment to the part is yet another indicator that the days of ""this is based on a comic book so it must be mere frivolity"" are behind us. Cumberbatch rocks one of the most convincing American accents we've heard an English actor affect, and looks quite dashing in those robes and that cape. While we do already have an arrogant, brilliant MCU hero in the form of Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, Cumberbatch's portrayal of Strange doesn't feel like a repeat of that. Having an actor of Cumberbatch's calibre in the MCU roster is something we're grateful for. <br/><br/>Ejiofor's Mordo is by-the-book and serious, but the actor's charm does shine through. Comic book fans know what becomes of the character, and that's hinted at here. While Swinton is fine as the knowing mentor figure with a glint in her eye, the movie doesn't make as a solid a case for its whitewashing as it promised. In the source material, The Ancient One is an elderly Tibetan man – your stock ""Asian mystic"" archetype. Co-screenwriter Cargill compared the dilemma to Star Trek's no-win scenario, the Kobayashi Maru. Adhering to the comics and depicted an elderly Asian man as the wise mentor would have been one kind of racist, but it can be argued that substituting said Asian man with a white woman is just another kind of racist. The implication is that a white person has bested the locals at their own game and is now running the show. What I'm really saying is: wouldn't Michelle Yeoh have made an awesome Ancient One? <br/><br/>McAdams doesn't get a whole lot of screen time, but it's great to see a lead female who isn't merely the designated girlfriend. She's also shown to be so skilled a surgeon, that even Dr. Strange acknowledges her prowess. Wong has been reinvented from the subservient tea- pouring butler of the original to a stern librarian who refuses to laugh at Strange's jokes. Strange, Wong and Mordo end up working well together as an unlikely team. <br/><br/>By now, you've read the phrase ""MCU villain problem"" in countless think-pieces. Alas, as far as villains go, Kaecilius is quite generic, but Mikkelsen does give the character a sinister, authoritative presence. The design flourish of burned-out crater- like scars around his eyes creepy. Keep a lookout for martial artist/actor Scott Adkins as one of Kaecilius' goons. <br/><br/>The levity exhibited throughout most of the MCU movies is present here as well, with Strange making some smart-alecky quips and the sentient Cloak of Levitation behaving akin to the Magic Carpet in Disney's Aladdin. Just as elsewhere in the MCU though, the jokes sometimes diminish the stakes. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange may not bend the established rules of the MCU completely beyond all recognition, but it reinvigorates the formula with a satisfyingly unique aesthetic. Stick around for a mid-credits scene and a post-credits stinger."
"SpoilerAlertReviews","7","5","10","26 October 2016"," ""A live action M.C.Escher puzzler...""
","Horror writer/director Scott Derrickson, famed for Sinister, The Exorcism of Emily Rose and Deliver Us From Evil, has his wicked way with Marvel's Doctor Strange, the 14th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Derrickson is a big, self-proclaimed Doctor Strange fan and he even funded his own concept film to impress Marvel studios so he could direct. This franchise, without Doctor Strange, has already reaped a whopping estimated £10billion! <br/><br/>Doctor Strange, or otherwise known as Stephen Vincent Strange is a strange character indeed, even for Marvel standards, being the first hero that dealt with magic and mysticism. First appearing as a filler in Strange Tales back in 1963 before getting his own origin story five issues later. His physical appearance was based on horror legend, Vincent Price, hence his middle name. <br/><br/>Now, I've never been a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and when I heard he was given the role I was originally put off, thinking, and I still do, that Game of Thrones' Aidan Gillen could have made a brilliant Strange. But, Cumberbatch does good, playing the egotistical, super-surgeon who goes in search of some mystical healing and ends up something stranger. He looks the part, acts the part and I even forgot for most of the movie that he was Cumberbatch. I think he's done a better job than what Joaquin Phoenix could have done. <br/><br/>It's an all-star cast and I'm thinking eventually every actor/actress is going to have a part in the MCU. I know there was a lot of controversy around the casting of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One, but I agree with the creative reasoning behind the decision, being more of a title as oppose to a single character. <br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Mordo, but not exactly the Baron Mordo comic fans will know with this film possibly leading up to him, as Mads Mikkelsen plays the key villain Kaecilius who has a much smaller part in the comics. Mikkelsen never fails to play the bad guy with that unflinching, menacing look, however I don't think he was bad enough. <br/><br/>Benedict Wong is superb as Wong and I do hope he's around for the rest of the story as Doctor Strange's sidekick valet. Rachel McAdams, Benjamin Bratt and martial art film-star Scott Adkins make up the rest of the cast and all do extremely well. I don't think McAdams read the script because she sincerely looks shocked for a lot of her part. <br/><br/>The movie itself is way out there, being very much like its source material sticking to Marvel canon. When the comics were first published, some readers thought creator/artist Steve Ditko and others behind the story to be high on something and this film goes way beyond anything we've seen from Marvel before, not even from Fox or Sony Pictures. <br/><br/>It's like Marvel has taken the ingredients of Inception, The Matrix, Harry Potter and then mixed with a bit of Big Trouble in Little China and a dashing of Edge of Tomorrow. It's beautifully mind- bending, like a live action M.C. Escher puzzle inside a psychedelic kaleidoscope. <br/><br/>Even Pixar's regular composer, Michael Giacchino does an interesting and broad score to reflect the vast weirdness of the movie using an array of instruments such as chimes, bells, harpsichords and a choir; no two tracks are the same with some baroque and even some backmasking which is quite spooky. <br/><br/>It has all the Marvel trademarks including the comedy elements which are, actually very amusing, especially the personification of his cloak. I like the little nods and connections to the rest of the universe that might be missed first time round, tying in with the incoming Infinity Wars <br/><br/>It's well paced, visually mind-blowing and a good addition to the MCU. I'm looking forward to seeing how everything comes together. But it isn't the best, different yes, but not as good as some of the others we have seen. Be sure to stay right till the very end for the usual couple of linkages. <br/><br/>That's it from Marvel Studios this year but 2017 is looking good with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2, then Spider-Man: Homecoming followed by Thor: Ragnarok. Who's up for a Marvel Marathon?<br/><br/>Running Time: 10 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 7 Script: 8 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 0 Would I buy the Bluray?: Yes.

","This was another AWESOME Marvel superhero movie I watched with my movie theatre-working friend. We were both enthralled by the origin of one Stephen Strange who we find out was first an actual doctor of medicine before his accident from a car wreck. So he travels to a faraway country to cure his body only to become a new man due to his now practicing some mystic arts of magic. I'll stop there and just say this was quite visually stimulating watching various far-out images of the things Stephen goes through. So on that note, me and my friend recommend Doctor Strange. Oh, and yes, there's another Stan Lee cameo and some extra scenes after the closing credits."

","Doctor Strange is a movie that takes us to a mystical world.... or so you think. Visually the movie looks great, this superhero adventure like most of Marvel's output, is well-paced enough with a few interesting ideas up its sleeve, including a refreshing climax featuring anti-destruction that it should thus hold one's attention. But for being devoid of a compelling story at its center, one walks away from Doctor Strange feeling as empty as the magic on display. The films feel more programmed than written, more pre visualized than directed, while the actors, who remain committed and do their best in underwritten roles, provide light-touch of enjoyment...."

","I'm a huge marvel/dc fan. I've grown up with all these comics and i'm always thrilled to watch a movie based on them, and I got to say I never got anything nearly as satisfied as I did with this film. (well maybe with Iron Man 1) <br/><br/>I was so afraid to see a different ""Ancient One"", BUT, Tilda Swinton did a wonderful job. I adored her. I was truly taken by a surprise cause I went into the cinema with the idea of hating her and came out loving her character. <br/><br/>As for Benedict Cumberbatch. What can I say? The best Dr. Strange they could have picked. I enjoyed every part of his acting. Such a great actor with the gift of fitting in every single role he's played so far. Brilliant. Just brilliant. <br/><br/>Rachel McAdams and Mads Mikkelsen (aka. Palmer and Kaecilius) where okay I guess. Didn't enjoy Christine's part as much but that's me. <br/><br/>As for the movie, the story was as much expected. I loved the music in the whole film. It did like 80% of the work and the other 20% were the special effects. Everything's very well done, compered to the avengers movies, marvel (and now marvel studios), did a huge step. <br/><br/>Looking forward for the crossover. Hoping for a great sequel. This is by far my No1 Marvel movie so far. <br/><br/>music: 9/10 effects: 10/10 acting 9/10 <br/><br/>P.S. don't leave the theater. As always a great mini clip for the upcoming movie"

While not your typical Marvel movie, it just ups the ante in so many ways...<br/><br/>The hype is totally justified! Contrary to some critics... this definitely does not! feel like a reboot of Iron man. One of the most original experiences in the MCU. Just go see it & be sure to stay to the end because of the 2 credit scenes: mid & end.<br/><br/>The movie can also appeal to both Marvel & non-Marvel fans.

","First off all, I like to watch the spectators reactions of the projection room. And it was like the rhythm of the film ""sporadic"". Saw it yesterday for a first premier and I was pleasantly surprised because the theater was full and the public react positively at all the funny moments. But I'm sure one guy just behind me took a little nape during the movie. I think the major problem of the movie is his rhythm because Cumberbatch takes his role and the effects are amazing. Other thing I want to write about the character of the Ancien One. In my opinion Tilda Swinton is reduce to a role too scripted, she is accomplishes her mission and that's all. Spoiler alert! or not: just don't miss the after generic scenes THERE ARE TWO!"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","7","16","28 October 2016"," 3D is worth it, for this once
","The one thing that really stands out in this movie is the eye-popping ""city-folding"" CGI, inherited from ""Inception"" and further enhanced. I have usually found 3D a nuisance. For this movie, however, it is well worth it.<br/><br/>For ingenuity and depth, ""Doctor Strange"" is a far cry from Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" but the bar there is so high that I am not even sure if the comparison is fair. As a comic book adaptation, DS is well above passing grade, offering the familiar ingredients: egotistic hero, the supreme evil, time manipulation, interplay of dimensions and elements, martial-art-type action, mandatory romance, cryptic humor, among others.<br/><br/>We start by witnessing a what you may call ""intellectual men's Tony Stark"", the titular superhero (Benedict Cumberbatch), having his top-surgeon career crashed, literally, in a car accident that leaves him with fingers he can barely move. To cut a long establishing sequence short, we find him eventually in Kathmandu, Nepal seeking salvation and finding himself sucked into something considerably more than he bargained for.<br/><br/>On the good guys' side are the boss The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and two sidekicks Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor, British classic pedigree) and Wong (another Benedict, all-poker-faced here, Benedict Wong). The bad guy is renegade disciple Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen, arguably the best known Danish face currently on the silver screen) and a few sidekicks who are little more than mere props. And yes, there is the supreme evil that manifests itself only as a voice and a dubious blur of an animated figure, not unlike Sauron on LOTR.<br/><br/>I use the word ""boss"" above deliberately. Swinton's portrayal of what might have been a mystery-shrouded figure surprised and impressed me with its contemporary feel. I immediately associate this in her ""Michael Clayton"" (2007) playing a corporate conspirator against George Clooney's titular hero. As one critic points out, the names Cumberbatch, Swinton and Ejiofor may conjure up in your mind a Shakspearian stage, and seeing them together in a comic adaptation throwing sorcerer bolts at each other in certainly refreshing. I mentioned mandatory romance and here the love object is ex-girlfriend and colleague Doctor Christine Palmer played by the always-lovely Rachel McAdams.<br/><br/>This movie even offers well-spaced comical quips, such as self-adhesive costume similar to Iron Man's. Here, it is a Dracula-type robe with high pointed collars that become rather irritating when they refuse of lie down flat against our hero's collarbones.<br/><br/>I think I have said just about everything that needs to be said regarding this movie. Just sit back, out on your 3D glass, and enjoy."
"p-jonsson","10","3","5","12 April 2017"," Excellent magical fireworks display
","It is actually quite some time since I watched Doctor Strange but somehow the movie must have slipped between the cracks since I appear to have forgotten to review it. So I am about to remedy that now. To put it in simple terms: This is an excellent movie. It is a wonderful display of magical fireworks with a decent enough story to keep it together.<br/><br/>I have to confess that I have not really read many of the comics containing Doctor Strange so it is a bit difficult for me to comment on the aspect of the film versus the comics. From the little that I have read I got the impression that the comic book version of Doctor Strange was a wee bit more dark, serious and mature. This movie starts from the beginning of his career though so I guess there is some justification for the less mature Doctor Strange in the movie.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is a skilled neurosurgeon but a bit of an asshole. Actually more than ""a bit"". He gets involved in a accident, that he pretty much causes himself due to his arrogance. Fast forward to the interesting chapter were we get to see Doctor Strange being, reluctantly, admitted into a scruffy looking monastery on the other side of the planet. That is when the fun starts. Doctor Strange is in for a ride. Slowly Doctor Strange gets knocked into him that magic exists and he is expected to practice it.<br/><br/>The time at the monastery, or perhaps we should call it a school, leads to a few funny episodes and I do like the head monk's bantering with Strange and the way she does things. Talk about getting thrown into the deep end of the swimmingpool first. Strange's continued arrogance and immaturity is a bit annoying from time to time though. That has to be said.<br/><br/>What is the use of super heroes if there are no bad guys around. So after Strange having trained for a while, and mostly failed miserably, the bad guys starts to crash the party. So no more pretty living room magic for Strange. It is time to go head to head with some serious competition. Unfortunately, for a good chunk of the first fights Strange mostly falls on his arse. They are still cool and beautiful to watch though.<br/><br/>Slowly Strange starts to get to grip with this whole magic thing and he also starts to shed some of that arrogance of his and take some responsibility. About time since the despicable bad guy are, of course, working towards freeing the real BIG bad guy, father of all evil and mother of everything else bad you can think of. Time for a showdown.<br/><br/>As the fighting escalates so does the user of special effects and personally I though the special effects were both beautiful and spectacular. I really liked them.<br/><br/>I am not sure Cumberbatch would have been my first choice for Doctor Strange though. To me he do not really project the image of the wise and skilled Wizard I expected. He is not bad though. The only other person that stood out for me was the chief monk and The Ancient One which I also quite liked. The rest of the characters, well to me they mostly lived in the shadows of these two, even though they were in general likable and sometimes fun.<br/><br/>There were a few rather hilarious parts where Strange has to reveal the truth about what he stepped in to his former girlfriend. I have a soft spot for the surprise moments in both movies and books.<br/><br/>I rather not get started on time travel since I generally hate it as a story element since it almost always leads to paradoxes or is simply so poorly done that it is blatantly obvious that someone tried to cover up for a lazy and shoddy story. However I guess I have to mention that screwing around with time is an important part of the plot in this movie. Luckily it is done in such a way that it do not, in my opinion, negatively impact the movie. Actually, to my surprise, it is used in a rather cool way.<br/><br/>So, bottom line, a movie I liked quite a lot. 5 out 5 stars kind worth of liking."
"no_vampires_here","10","3","5","19 March 2017"," It was fun!

","I am going to put this in as a last minute thought, the Dr. Strange animated movie that came out awhile back is a much better scripted and thought out movie than this, so if U find this movie frustrating in its lack of sense and incompleteness, watch the animated movie.<br/><br/>Having read a few Strange comics growing up i can attest that this movie was true to the strange world, where nothing is really explained very well, Dr. Strange seems to have powers equal to a God, and his movements are basically rabbits pulled from a hat <br/><br/>--I never really found the strange comics to have much depth, so the movie was pretty true to the original strange vision <br/><br/>--Currently this movie is overrated, and probably will remain so for quite awhile, the script simply isn't in the same class as the other marvel super hero movies that have come out in the past few years, a discerning viewer can see the hand of Disney raise its ugly head in this. <br/><br/>--Its obvious that some of actors portraying main characters were not required to audition or 'win' their parts, I give the overall acting about a B- to B range"
"Imdbidia","8","3","5","16 January 2017"," Entertaintment with capitals
","I'm not into superheroes comics or movies at all. I haven't read the Dr Strange comic ever either. I watched the trailer of this film at the cinema and I thought it looked too cool to let it pass. Besides the caliber of some of the actors involved in the project was a great sign that his wouldn't be yet another Marvel movie with more visuals than substance. Gladly, my hunch was good.<br/><br/>Not having read the comic, I cannot comment on whether the adaptation to the screen is good or not. Thus, this review is just about the movie. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange is utterly entertaining and has the right mix of drama, adventure, humour, philosophical teaching, character exploration, wow effects, goodies and baddies.<br/><br/>The visuals of the movie are spectacular, and they are at the service of the story, not just to wow us with fluff. The styling, coloring, wardrobe, and city landscaping are awesome.<br/><br/>To me the philosophical spiritual exploration of the main character is perhaps the thing that enjoyed the most, watching a prick transform from selfishness and narcissism into a person with a mission that transcends himself and puts himself at the service of others and of a greater cause, and that is done through inner hard-work catharsis. <br/><br/>I found the British wit displayed in the film great!<br/><br/>All the actors are believable in their respective roles. I especially liked Mikkelsen, Swinton, Cumberbatch, and Benedict Wong in this order. However, all the cast does a great job and are believable in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Please stay for the full credits, until the very end, because there are two extras there that you don't want to miss.<br/><br/>Entertainment as it should be."

","With the large number of superhero movies that have exploded on the scene in the recent few years, it was no wonder then, that, a new venture from the Marvel Universe was highly anticipated. Dr Strange, belongs to the superhero genre, but in a world of radioactive spider bites and seventy year old super soldiers, his tale is one that is different and like a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange, directed by Scott Derrickson, released in theatres all over India on 4th November 2016. Based on the Marvel Comics of the same name, by Stan Lee, Doctor Strange is the first movie for this character. Popular British Actor, Benedict Cumberbatch takes on the role of Dr Stephen Strange, a brilliant neurosurgeon, who is extremely arrogant about his abilities. However, there is trouble in paradise when Strange gets into a horrific car accident and damages his hands. This sets him on a path to search for ways to heal and he spends his resources on experimental procedures. He is told of a place in Kathmandu where a paraplegic was healed and he ventures out. What he doesn't know is what lies ahead for him there.<br/><br/>The storytelling is effortless and the visuals are stunning. Combined with the stellar soundtrack and the humour, this makes for a definite watch for all Marvel Movie lovers. Benedict Cumberbatch slips into the role of Dr Strange and makes it his own. What sets this film apart from conventional superhero movies, is, that, while most of them are based on the physical plain, Dr Strange deals with the mystical. The movie has fantastic performances from Mads Mikelsen as Kaecilius and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo amongst others and is truly an experience in 3D. The stellar visuals by the VFX teams is what made the experience, magnificent. Would I recommend it? YES. Absolutely! Go watch it and get lost in the mysticism of Dr Strange."
"Venom_81","9","3","5","8 November 2016"," A nice movie visually stunning
","I was surprised by doctor Strange, it's always a Marvel movie so the plot of the super hero against the villains it's quite always the same, but putting some magic and mysticism despite laser and just muscles gave to the film and aspect more interesting and less childish. I have to say that the look of the movie the look of the Vfx it's visually stunning, despite to the other marvel or dc movie i could say that visual effects gave to this movie a proper style a proper connotation. So i will be not surprised if it will be Oscar nominated and winner for visual effect. One of the best Marvel in the last couple of years. The only things that I didn't appreciate to much it's the villains them self, a little too dumb and also the evil boss was a little too easy..but this give me a point to think about, it's more a movie against the demons and the limits and barriers you have inside you than a movie against a standard villain."

","Marvel came out on top with the thrilling ensemble epic ""Captain America: Civil War."" But while ""Doctor Strange"" could have been the company's victory lap while introducing movie audiences to a cosmic new branch of the MCU, instead, this tale of magic and world-threatening mayhem is Marvel at it's most mediocre.The story itself makes sense only in broad strokes. Try to pick out the particulars of Kaecilius's plan, and you'll be left with far more questions than answers. Though Mads is riveting in his creepy make-up and confident glowers, his villain goes the way of too many MCU baddies by being too vaguely realized in his emotions and backstory to have a powerful emotional impact. However, Mikkelsen's wry humor honed over seasons of ""Hannibal"" comes in handy to deliver one of the film's funniest moments, involving a nonchalant exchange that has a confused Kaecilius calling the titular hero ""Mister Doctor.""Unfortunately, this is one of the few jokes that work. Under the direction of Scott Derrickson (""Sinister""), ""Doctor Strange"" rejects the broader comedic moments of quips and pratfalls that the MCU has made part of its signature in favor of a dryer wit. Which would have been great, if it worked. As it was, joke after joke from Strange — including a run about people with solo names like Adele, Aristotle and Eminem — fell flat, leaving a cavernous silence in a theater where laughter was meant to be. This speaks to the central problem of ""Doctor Strange"": Benedict Cumberbatch has been wildly, woefully miscast.Now, I admire that Derrickson tried to make the MCU his own, folding in trippy and sometimes nightmarish visuals of the astral planes and Mirror Dimension. He swung for the fences, and while the CGI bodies are sometimes jarringly rubbery, it's a dizzying delight to see how these stylish sorcerers bends the streets of London, New York and Hong Kong into M.C. Escher- inspired constructs of chaos. However, while the action scenes have great settings, the fights themselves lack zing, leaving the stakes feeling weightless.All in all, ""Doctor Strange"" is fine, and sometimes fun. But I've come to expect so much more from Marvel. With ""Captain America,"" ""Thor,"" ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers,"" the shrewd studio casts films impeccably, bringing together an astonishing array of actors to create captivating on screen chemistry and wonderfully larger-than-life characters. Following in the footsteps of the Batman and Spider-Man movies that came before, the MCU has been raising the bar on what audiences should demand from superhero spectacle. But sometimes, even they can't clear it."

","Its far from a perfect film. The narrative follows a tried and tested and clichéd structure. Lets just say there was nothing innovative in the story format.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent, as was Tilda Swinton. The graphics were excellent, and the final resolution was innovative and done well.<br/><br/>The film had good dashes of humor scattered throughout, the jokes work and that is a good thing.<br/><br/>However as has become the norm in Marvel films the villain was a let down. Clever at times, but for the most part easily defeated, and always seemed a step behind the hero.<br/><br/>Ejiofor as Mordo was good in his acting, but to be honest the script doesn't really give him anything important to do. He is reduced to being Strange's sidekick at times. The internal conflict that he is supposed to be having also doesn't come across that well, and he seems a one dimensional character for the most part.<br/><br/>Wong will have left a more lasting impression on most viewers than Mordo.<br/><br/>The story is relatively simple and there isn't a lot happening that is going to be hard to keep track of.<br/><br/>However the film really does work as an overall origin story. Strange's journey is the highlight and does a good job of binding the narrative together, despite the many issues I have listed. Rachel McAdams delivers a fine performance, and was memorable in the short screen time she got.<br/><br/>While its not a perfect film, far from it in fact, but the action coupled with the amazing graphics and effects, the film has enough about it to keep viewers entertained and involved throughout."
"robertdeaniii-1","8","4","8","4 November 2016"," Action/Philosophy/Sci-Fi in one package! Wow!
","Without spoiling anything the movie challenges materialism in a way which I didn't think a film could achieve. It was neither nihilistic nor religious and that takes a good deal of creativity. What indeed lies beyond ""The Doors of Perception"" as Huxley wrote? The film is philosophical at times and pulls back from the seriousness with a lot of artistic action or wit. As one who sighs at the superstitious the introduction of the surreal in the film was more convincing than anything I've yet to see or read. Perhaps it was the film's artistic representation of a world being created fluidly, much like those ever shifting visuals one gets right before falling in a deep sleep. The only reason I would refrain from giving this movie a 10 was the good/evil story line was, for me, too simplistic. Strange was certainly interesting but the lesser characters seemed a bit too thrown together. Overall, superb."

","I saw ""Doctor Strange"", starring Benedict Cumberbatch-Black Mass, 12 Years a Slave; Chiwetel Ejiofor-The Martian, 12 Years a Slave; Rachel McAdams-Aloha, the Sherlock Holmes movies; Mads Mikkelsen-Hannibal_tv, Casino Royale_2006 and Tilda Swinton-Trainwreck, Constantine.<br/><br/>This is based on a comic book hero created by Stan Lee & Steve Ditko in 1963, and yes, Stan has his usual cameo appearance-look for him on a bus that Benedict slams into. Doctor Strange is a lesser known character-to most non-comic readers-that uses magic, or the mystic arts, instead of the usual super powers. Where as the Avengers handle the super powered villains, Stephen Strange fights supernatural enemies from other dimensions. In fact, his powers are explained as being energy that is drawn from other dimensional planes of existence. Of course, the origin story has to be told, but it isn't one most people know, so it isn't boring. Basically, Benedict plays a gifted, egotistical surgeon that gets in a car accident that damages his hands-what he makes his living with-and tries all kinds of traditional medical remedies, that just don't work. He then hears about a crippled man that was mysteriously healed and goes in search of his nontraditional cure. This leads him to Chiwetel/Mordo, a student of Tilda/the Ancient One-in the comics, the Ancient One is an old man but it was changed here to be a woman. Tilda and Chiwetel teach Benedict in the mystic arts and how to focus the energy into shields and weapons because another student, Mads, that dropped out of Tilda's class, has gone to the dark side and teamed up with Dormammu and is on the verge of destroying the world-they need Benedict's help to stop them. Rachel is a fellow doctor that Benedict works with and she gets involved in things, like patching up Benedict after a battle. And as far as the battles go, there are mystic battles-with fantastic looking special effects that look like the movie Inception on steroids-and there are also some good martial arts fights as well as plenty of humor thrown in for good measure. Oh yeah, at the beginning, look for a new Marvel opening logo and as the end credits start, there is a scene with an Avenger and at the very end, after the credits, is another scene with Chiwetel. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi action and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes. This is a movie that was made to be seen in 3D, which I did, and I would definitely buy it on Blu-Ray."
"dave-mcclain","9","4","8","4 November 2016"," ""Doctor Strange"" magnificently raises the bar and expands the horizon for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
","The wild superhero action-adventure-fantasy film ""Doctor Strange"" (PG-13, 1:55) does for the Marvel Cinematic Universe what the character did for Marvel Comics when he first appeared in 1963 – make a universe into a multiverse. When Marvel artist Steve Ditko brought his idea to his Spider-Man co-creator, writer Stan Lee, according to Ditko, it was ""a new, different kind of character for variety in Marvel Comics"". The film connects Strange's new world to previous Marvel stories this way: ""Heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers. We safeguard it against more mystical threats."" The story in this vibrant and visually remarkable film starts ordinarily enough. Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange (Oscar nominee Benedict Cumberbatch) is a supremely talented neurosurgeon, with the ego to match. (Think of him as an even better, but only slightly more charming version of TV's ""House"".) He has an emotional attachment to fellow surgeon Dr. Christie Palmer (Oscar nominee Rachel McAdams), whom he respects only slightly more than rivals like Dr. Nicodemus West (the underrated Michael Stuhlbarg), whom he doesn't hesitate to publicly embarrass. Driving to a dinner, Strange's Lamborghini tumbles down a hillside and his life comes crashing down with it. Still in charge of his faculties and in possession of all his appendages, he nevertheless suffers devastating hand injuries which effectively ends his surgical career. He searches in vain for a medical solution, becoming even more self-absorbed as he does so. When Strange learns about and tracks down a man named Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) who completely recovered from a similarly devastating injury, Strange learns about a place of healing called Kamar-Taj, near Katmandu, Nepal, and literally spends his last dollar to get himself there.<br/><br/>Kamar-Taj is a mysterious complex run by The Anicent One (Oscar winner Tilda Swinton) – and is nothing like Strange expected. The Anicent One thinks that Strange is too arrogant to bother with, but she is convinced by one of her followers called Karl Mordo (Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor) to let the rude but desperate doctor stay. She convinces him to look beyond his current reality by thrusting his spirit out of his body and into, as pluggedin.com wonderfully described it, ""hurtling through unimagined realms, galaxies and dimensions. He flies through the universe and finds another and another. He spins through time and matter - soaked in color, drenched in image, places pregnant with beauty and horror."" Strange begs to be taught and he progresses quickly, becoming a talented student of the mystic arts. But The Anicent One struggles to teach him ""the simplest and most significant lesson of all... It's not about you."" There's definitely something much, much bigger than Strange's problems for Kamar-Taj to contend with. A former master sorcerer called Kaecilius (TV's ""Hannibal"", Mads Mikkelsen) has stolen pages from one of The Ancient One's secret books of rituals and plans to use the spell to summon the supremely powerful Dormammu from The Dark Dimension in order to remake the natural world and give everyone in it eternal life. The Ancient One, Mordo and Wong (Benedict Wong), the Kamar-Taj librarian, all warn Strange about the danger posed by Kaecilius and Dormammu – and they try to keep Strange from experimenting with powers that he doesn't yet understand – but the newly self-assured sorcerer has to learn all those lessons for himself – while his own life and the fate of our world hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>Like ""Deadpool"" earlier in 2016, ""Doctor Strange"" raises the already high bar for MCU films. The story is fresh, interesting and transports us to new worlds which excite the imagination. The visual effects are simply amazing and the score is terrific. The sights and sounds of the first sequence alone are worth the price of admission, but we get a full two hours of remarkable creativity and outstanding entertainment. (And make sure you stick around for the fun mid-credits scene and the game-changing post-credits confrontation.) Some have criticized the film's changes from the comics and/or the extreme efforts to be politically correct in this movie's casting, but the story works very well, and the cast is pitch perfect – Cumberbatch in particular. Others complain that the visuals are too close to 2010's ""Inception"", but they are completely in service to the story and take visual effects to the next level. My only criticism involves a slight overuse of slapstick as comic relief, but that's a subjective and very minor issue, considering how good the movie is overall. In the film, The Ancient One expands the title character's perception of reality, as the movie does for the audience, by telling her newest student, ""You think you know how the world works. You think this material universe is all there is. What if I told you the reality you know is one of many?"" What if indeed. ""A"""
"Lewis_Heather787","6","4","8","4 November 2016"," A bit disappointing from all the hype!
","Ever since the name drop in Captain America Winter soldier , i thought Doctor Strange must be someone rather important and amazing. I'll get onto whether he is as important or interesting as it was made out.Just as a side note I'd never heard of Doctor Strange until Winter soldier and I'd never seen any of his comics so I have no prior knowledge about the character, my fault I'm more a DC fan than Marvel. Oh no that must mean that i hate every Marvel film and love every DC film, no not true. Onto the positives of the film, firstly the effects in the film are breath taking and a truly stunning. This film will probably suffer with the tag of ""copying"" the film Inception but I feel this brings something new to the table and is slightly different from Inception. Every action scene in the film has effects that every film should strive to have because they are mind blowing....(pun intended). The other positive I have is the cast for the most part was solid, with the Standouts being Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton and Chiwetel Ejiofor. They all gave performances that were decent for the film but nothing amazing but it didn't need to be anything over the top. Unfortunately this is the part where I get called a Marvel hater and DC fan boy, there are negatives to this film....quite a few. Firstly although the performances are good in the film I didn't care for any of the characters in the film, even Strange himself who is a horrible person. It made it difficult for me to follow the characters through the story. Next the story, as I said earlier I don't know the original story or any story of Doctor Strange so I could be completely wrong, but my word was it a boring story. I had no interest in following Strange around the world in his training or life, the only saving grace are the effects to keep me engaged. If that is happening then the film has missed its mark with myself. Next negative and the main negative I have with every Marvel film....Humour, once again there is too much of it. Personally just ruins the scene and the experience for me and there generally not funny either. Lastly the villain, which similarly to every other Marvel film except Winter Soldier is very weak. This is such a shame considering you have a great actor in Mads Mikkelsen, but in this film I never saw him as a genuine threat. I believe that Doctor Strange would work far better in a ""avengers"" type film I think this time Marvel bit off more than they could chew. This is a real shame from a COMIC BOOK FAN that this has happened, and that this year has turned out to be a generally poor year for comic book films. Lastly was Doctor strange an important addition to the MCU, in my opinion no not really but OK. Also was he as interesting as I thought, erm...no not really either which is a really shame. 6/10 or 60% its OK nothing amazing or bad just a bit boring, only the effects saving it!"

"basilisksamuk","9","4","8","29 October 2016"," Near perfect interpretation but with minor problems
","This is as near to being a match to how I imagined the film should be as it's ever going to get. It isn't perfect but then nothing ever is, given that it's someone's interpretation of a work of art from a different medium. In the canon of Marvel films I rank this as number one but it's probably because Doctor Strange was always my favourite Marvel comic back in the sixties and the film captures the psychedelic aspects of the original perfectly even down to using Interstellar Overdrive on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>My first minor dislike is that the Ancient One is played by a white woman. Actually I think that changing the Ancient One's gender is inspired and Tilda Swinton is brilliant in the role. But it's hard to see why an Asian actor wasn't chosen for the role. My other dislike was the opening sequence. It seems all films have to start with some big action sequence these days but when you don't yet know its connection to the main story it has little impact except to impress you with the CGI. I would far rather this opening sequence was left on the cutting room floor and the film started with the next scene with Stephen Strange in the hospital.<br/><br/>Opening sequence apart, I felt that for once the CGI earned its place in Doctor Strange and was perfectly integrated into the story. The visuals often reflected Steve Ditko's style, further adding to my enjoyment of the film. I hope Marvel make some more standalone Doctor Strange movies because I can't help but feel he will be ill-served as a mere team member in one of their ensemble efforts."
"erhen-o","8","4","8","26 October 2016"," Not enough Mastery
","Where is the mastery?<br/><br/>The story is simple to understand, a good start for great intrigue and action. However, after you understand the story, I was really disappointed that there was not enough mastery, and smart strategy, it's too simplistic (I know underneath it's still Disney!..). They would ALWAYS fight but ""traditionally"", there were effects, but I didn't see their real mastery. It was like they would win only by luck with a few tricks sometimes. Do you really need to fight body to body - even when you are out of your body (lol!) -, when you control energy and matter? Bizarre, right ! Especially, I think Tilda Swinton died way too easily. I mean, she is very ""ancient"" with great longevity, so she must have won a lot of big fights to have survived during all those years or centuries, and yet she just dies from a frontal stab after a 5sec fight?! Come on ! The doctor fights during 20mn we never see the end of it and bonus: he doesn't die ! She is supposed to be the ""Sorcerer Supreme""... she should have saved the situation more times and fought more. She should have pulled off a magic trick that only her owns for example, like a true big master. I think it's definitely a scripting mistake. Anyway, she delivered a great performance, even if I don't understand what really motivated her to help the doctor. He never proved himself or argued his case. He just showed arrogance, and yet she taught him and told him all those big secrets, WHY? The guy is not even remotely interesting or likable. And he just drops in and takes over? Hmmm, that is just weird. I don't understand his real motivation.<br/><br/>Another hero based story (of course, I know, I know)<br/><br/>I know it's Marvel. But I'm still going to say it :) What does everybody else is doing while he is saving everybody on his own?! Why does he have to do it on his own, all the time? I wish I saw the other characters developed more. I think hero based stories where a sole person saves it all just really don't make any sense anymore in today's world. Not only does it means that everybody is weak and actually needs a hero, but also that power is concentrated in a few privileged ""gifted"" ones, not very positive and motivating in my sense. But that's Marvel's viewpoint. OK.<br/><br/>Excellent visual effects<br/><br/>The movie is beautiful though for the cracking power imagery. I don't get over such beautiful effects, with the city turned upside down and everything. Bravo !!!"
"PyroSikTh","8","4","8","26 October 2016"," Both Fresh and Generic Simultaneously
","Doctor Strange is the story of celebrated neurosurgeon Stephen Strange who loses the use of his hands in a car accident and seeks one-hundred percent recovery in order to get back to his life's work. This leads him to a mysterious place in Nepal run by what appears to be mystics and monks, but are actually a group of sorcerers and sorceresses that protect the Earth from multiversal threats and unseen dimensions. In time he becomes one of them, and is thrust into a conflict with a rogue sorcerer who seeks to bring the dark dimension into ours.<br/><br/>In many ways, you can see how Doctor Strange might be a relic from an earlier Marvel Studios. Despite the claim of never doing origin movies, Doctor Strange is absolutely an origin movie, and makes no attempt to hide that either. It feels a lot like the origin stories of Phase One, mixed with the kind of humour and lightheartedness that permeated early Phase Two. It doesn't help that the character of Stephen Strange is a mirror image of Tony Stark; wealthy, genius, arrogant, charming, joke-quipping. On the surface, Stephen Strange is about as generic as a Marvel movie can get, often feeling like a retread of old ground and things we've seen before.<br/><br/>This also extends to, but also simultaneously is undone by the visuals. Yes, the imagery of cityscapes folding in on themselves is reminiscent of that one scene in Inception, but Doctor Strange takes that concept, splinters it, and exaggerates it to levels where it's almost unrecognisable. Doctor Strange is easily the most psychedelic Marvel movie to date, and that includes the folding cities, which appear more kaleidoscopic than anything. There's one scene in particular that is one of the most visual mind-bending sequences I've ever seen, feeling almost 2001 in execution. The Ancient One opens Strange's mind up to the multiverse of hidden dimensions, and he's flung through a psychedelic montage of trippy images that feel like a bad acid trip. Just like the end of Ant-Man, I just wanted this bizarre place beyond the law of physics to be developed further, to take us on a bizarre mind-bender. This is all without mentioning the slow-motion backdrop of snow and lightning, or the extra dimension added thanks to the introduction of magic, including the mirror dimension and the astral plain.<br/><br/>As I mentioned though, the tone is on par with some of Marvel's more lacklustre movies (looking at you Iron Man 3), with quips and one-liners aplenty. Some of them are quite funny, others not so. Strange listing through celebrities with only one name is a definite high point, while his cloak flicking his cheeks while trying to look cool is a low. Derrickson also puts his history of horror movies to good use to create a few jump scares that are played for laughs as well, like Strange unexpectedly re-appearing from the astral plain to Christine's surprise.<br/><br/>The acting is unsurprisingly top-notch. Benedict Cumberbatch slips effortlessly into the role of Strange, proving that he would be a worthy replacement for RDJ as the franchise's mascot. That said, I did feel like his accent was a bit off. He sounded like a Brit trying really hard to do an American accent, which is pretty much exactly what he was, and that took me out a little bit. Chiwetel Ejiofor was also great as the more straight-edged Mordo, and hopefully he'll be used to good effect to become Marvel's third most memorable villain further along down the line (behind Loki and Wilson Fisk). Tilda Swinton is fantastic as The Ancient One. Haters be damned, she owns the role, and is almost unrecognisable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as great and talented an actor as he is, Mads Mikkelson feels sorely under-utilised here. Like the majority of Marvel villains before him, he draws the short straw on screen time and character development. He wants to live forever by bringing the dark dimension into ours, and that's the extent of his motivations and backstory. The only reason I will remember him is because he's Mads Mikkelson. Rachel McAdams has her moments, but is again reduced to little more than Strange's on-again-off-again love interest that feels almost archaic these days. Benedict Wong and Michael Stuhlbarg both do the best with what they're given, which is about two minutes of screen time each. Here's hoping they get a little more attention in future sequels.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is not the best Marvel movie out there, and it doesn't quite do enough to mark out it's differences from the rest of the roster (like Guardians did, quite successfully I might add). As the introduction of magic into the MCU, it would have benefited greatly from a more mystical tone, but instead it just felt like a generic Superhero origin story. Whether his powers came from magic or not seemed irrelevant. However, as generic as Doctor Strange feels at times, it has plenty enough going for it, most notably in the visuals department (which required several paragraphs of Digital Artists in the credits), and it is a fundamentally very enjoyable movie that at least flirts with new ideas. I give Doctor Strange a very respectable 8/10."

","I have just accepted the death of actual good movies. When I say good, I am talking about good plot, good effects, good acting. Today we get movies that are usually missing one, two, or all three qualities. Dr.Strange the movie has good effects, but the plot, the acting are atrocious. The preview of this movie made this movie like it was going to be awesome. The reviews on IMDb made it seem like this was a good movie. I am so glad, so glad that I did not waste my hard earned cash on going to the theater to see this. I was actually going to see the 3D version. So glad I did not.I accept that the movie makers today make movies to today's foolish, no common sense, no critical thinking, just want to be fed mindless, thoughtless, movies with lots of explosions, loud side effects. The loud sound and other effects is just used to distract the actual thinking movie goer and trick those with a brain to think it is actually a good movie. Dr. Strange tries to trick you into thinking it is a good movie, it fails. It's really hard to put into words. First off, the cartoon version was WAY better. The cartoon version really showed Dr.strange's struggle, he had to trek through the mountains to get to the hidden temple. In the movie he just walks up to a building in the city. The pacing is terrible. The jokes were terrible and took away any seriousness of the plot. So the student who turned to the dark side wants to end the world, who cares. The screen writing/story line makes you not care.At the end of the movie it just felt 'hoky'. I kept thinking of the movie Inception, that is not a good thing. These days finding a good movie is like finding the 'holy grail'."
"kgprophet","6","5","11","5 November 2016"," Playing it too Safe
","When I started to hear about the type of world this movie was exploring many months ago, I became more excited to see this movie than probably any other movie released this year. I am very interested in quantum physics and the whole idea of multiple universes, and the idea of being able to travel and manipulate other dimensions I thought was the basis for an exciting movie. Then came the reviews talking about how 'heady' it was, working at a higher level than your normal super hero movie. Along with that you have Benedict Cumberbatch, which not only sounds like an exquisite English breakfast, but is a very enigmatic actor who has made his mark in a very electrifying way. To top it all off, there was the promise of mindbending special effects that reminded you of Inception or Interstellar. <br/><br/>So it is funny that all these elements on their own seem to be the right combination for a real audience favourite. So why do I feel rather indifferent? Here are some possibilities: <br/><br/><ul><li>Benedict Cumberbatch needs his English accent as part of his prowess, the lame American accent diminished his character. In general, he was too 'safe' as a personality to be engaging enough. It is inevitable that all Marvel films be compared to the first Ironman. Robert Downey Jr. was allowed to personify his character and was very engaging. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The action scenes seem to come out of nowhere. The designated bad guy along with his evil plan are established right off the bat, so it is just by the screenwriters choice when to break away from a mentoring scene to start the 4D fight scenes. Then back to the mentoring. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>One thing that we all remember is the bombastic ""BBBBBBAAAAAAAA"" score from Inception. It has been noted that all Marvel movies have generic scores. My feeling that it is part of a greater sympton of the studio playing it safe when it comes to these things. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The story structure, spelling out the origin story, has the same familiar beats. Again I think of Ironman, where both have a jarring incident in a vehicle to kick off their road to recovery. Going through origin stories have become tedious. I was hoping that with the more intellectual material there would also be a more intellectual approach to the filmmaking. My guess is that the studio wanted to play if safe with this material to make sure younger crowds wouldn't get lost. Yet I remember learning about the 'force' in Star Wars slowly without needing a great deal of exposition. Better yet, the capabilities of this power was revealed through major story points throughout the film. </li></ul><br/><br/>-Again, the special powers are introduced without any great mystical approach. The world beyond our dimensions can be strange and frightening, but this movie does it in a conventional way that is not that intriguing. Appropriate comparisons to the ""Matrix"" shows how revealing these strange powers can be done in an original and exciting way. <br/><br/>What makes this film worthwhile? <br/><br/><ul><li>Terrific effects featuring the expansion of the folding skylines first seen in Inception. The best sequence in the film. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Other fun sequences that make use of the other multidimensional universe. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Great mentor character played by Tilda Swinton, I only wish the rest of the characters were written as well. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The trademark self-mockery that allows the audience to buy into the goofy comic book world. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Nice tight pacing that kept the film moving along and not exceeding the 2 hour mark. </li></ul><br/><br/>It is hard to fault any one department for the absence of real spark to this film. I would say it was the studio playing it too safe with the material as the main fault. But it is also that we have seen too many origin movies to be that absorbed by them. I think the bad guy proved to be menacing enough, but could have been far more intriguing and cerebral in his personality. (Too 'by the book' haha). But something as fundamental as a more striking musical score could have done wonders. <br/><br/>I will recommend this movie, not being familiar with the comics, because there are enough engaging moments to keep you entertained. It is the potential that is lost in the business-like approach to making yet another superhero movie."

","Marvel has gained my (and millions of other people's) trust through 14 films in their illustrious Cinematic Universe. But it's that trust I felt was tampered with in Doctor Strange, which is their most ambitious yet disappointingly uninspired film at the same time. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange is helmed by horror director Scott Derrickson, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Mads Mikkelson, and Tilda Swinton. Most of them are quite good in this stylish Marvel superhero flick, but I also don't believe any of them are given much to do. Cumberbatch plays a good a-hole, but we already have a better version of that in Tony Stark. McAdams was a strong point and provides the audience's connection to humanity, but there isn't much to her character yet, other than a love interest for Strange. Wong played the humor well. Mikkelson is one of the most dynamic actors working today, but I found nothing compelling or unique about his antagonist, Kaecilius. Nor did I think there was any believable motivation behind his actions. Tilda Swinton is probably the best part about the film, but again, she's used sparingly.<br/><br/>I came into Doctor Strange wanting something entirely different than Marvel, or any other studio, has ever given us with a comic-book film. While there's something to be said about the trippy and horror-ish visuals this film displays, it actually ends up falling more victim to the superhero formula than I would have hoped. Take the humor for example, something Marvel has grown accustomed to trickling into their installments, but 80 % of the humor in Doctor Strange feels out of place. The trailers never once tried to sell me on humor. I came for a distinctly different story and mind-blowing visuals. I didn't buy my ticket to see Cumberbatch try and be the next Tony Stark. It would also help if the rest of the characters were using that same humor, but they aren't, most of them seem like they acted in a relatively serious drama. This type of humor works in Guardians or Ant-Man, but it's completely out of place in Doctor Strange.<br/><br/>But it's far from all bad. Marvel at least deserves some credit for daring to actually take the fight sequences into that psychedelic territory. Granted, I wasn't as into the action scenes as I had wanted to be, because the story to that point wasn't all that interesting. If the film had stayed in the darker and twisted tone that some of those scenes presented, I could have been more on board with the end results. There are many strong aspects about this film, however. The visuals are unlike anything I have seen in a superhero film, Tilda Swinton kills it, McAdams is a strong love interest, and Strange himself deserves a place in the Marvel universe. But I was expecting something different. Perhaps that's on me, perhaps not, but this one just didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>+The Ancient One<br/><br/>+McAdams is a nice complement to Cumberbatch<br/><br/>+Trippy and daring visuals<br/><br/>+Unique fight scenes<br/><br/>-But the story is paint by numbers<br/><br/>-Mikkelsen gets nothing to do<br/><br/>-Really really forced humor<br/><br/>-Some third act decisions are questionable<br/><br/>6.0/10"

After seeing the movie in V Max, Doctor Strange delivered as it had a mix of legend and fantasy and typical marvel humour we have all come to see in the franchise. The 14th film for the MCU was probably one of the best and visually outstanding movies that Marvel have done so far. Doctor Strange also sets up Thor Ragnorok as seen in the mid credits scene.

","Dr. Strange is a great movie and the best superhero movie at this moment. Now a little more without spoilers. The plot I liked, despite its secondary. Marvel's humor is also on top. Jokes are actually made to smile, as opposed to jokes from a parody of a film called the ""Suicide Squad"". They are always in place and perform a certain role, and are inserted not just to spoil. The action in this movie shakes the imagination more than light drugs, and the scene with the final fight for 10 days doesn't come out of my head. I didn't see a more beautiful visual part, I was in an inexpressible delight. And of course, everyone's favorite Benedict in his repertoire. Narcissistic genius, how we liked him. Even some of the soundtracks in the film are taken from Sherlock and StarTrack, which his fans can not help liking.

"cherold","7","2","3","24 March 2017"," Enjoyable but unexceptional
","Although I did read a single Dr. Strange comic book something like 50 years ago, it's fair to say I don't really know anything about the comic book. So I don't know how true it is to its source material. But divorced from that material, I found this a reasonably entertaining piece of nonsense that felt like it could have been better.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a terrific opening scene in which people fight on the side of a building which is turning in on itself. Weird stuff happening with architecture is a common theme in the movie and is consistently entertaining.<br/><br/>Then we meet Cumberbatch as a brilliant, arrogant surgeon whose golden hands are destroyed in an accident. Soon he discovers a temple in Katmandu that he believes can help him. It is headed by Tilda Swinton, and my response to that was, immediately, why is this white lady in charge of an Asian temple? This turns out to have been part of the Asian whitewashing complaints, but ignoring that entirely, it just seems weird, and goes totally unaddressed in the film.<br/><br/>It is one of various small things that added together weaken the film. Another is the magical cape that makes an appearance. Again, I'm not familiar with the original comic books, but the cape in the movie seems like the silliest superweapon ever. It's played for laughs, which is perhaps the only option with something like this, but the cape slapstick felt out of place with the movie overall.<br/><br/>The story itself feels a bit rushed. I got little sense of the villains or the actual stakes, and various ideas and twists were just kind of tossed out and never adequately pursued. Strange goes from jerk to hero without much actual character development.<br/><br/>What saves the movie from its many flaws are some terrific set pieces, including a fight that takes place while time is reversing, and those crazy architecture battles. The action and special effects are quite good, Cumberthatch does a solid job, and the movie has a sprightly sense of humor. <br/><br/>So overall I did like it. But I feel like there was potential for something better. Maybe they'll do better for the sequel?"

","There is a branch of historians arguing that Shakespeare actually wasn't a single person, but a collective of writers publishing their work under the name of a fictional persona. I sometimes wonder whether Marvel is today what Shakespeare was back then. There is barely any Marvel movie which isn't a work of great craftsmanship and fun to ingest while retelling classical conflicts of drama in a fresh way reflecting the postmodern or post postmodern or post whatever times we live in. <br/><br/>DOCTOR STRANGE delves deep into the depths of mysticism, catches bits of esoteric knowledge and pseudo knowledge, mystical techniques and philosophic mind over matter conceptions, and cooks a wild, bright, colorful meal out of it back at the surface, spiced up with the usual myriad of references for example pointing to the MATRIX (Kaecillius and consorts walking just like Neo & co), martial arts flicks (the fights, the zooms) and 2001 - A SPACE ODYSEE (the dimensional shifts). <br/><br/>The film uses expressionistic, fat brush strokes so to speak, working with strong contrasts and hyper stylized exaggerations. It does it with charming elegance, never slipping into the muddy traps of ridiculous trash. DOCTOR STRANGE can be an inspiration. I can't help but liking it."

","I am not a fan of Marvel so I can only judge this movie by itself. This three-dimension movie tries to show effects but actually makes itself dizzy. Two many confusing plots fill the whole story, and there is no gradual process for the protagonist to change from a layman to a master - he just finishes the process almost in a second looking at the mysterious book. What's more, in the end, the ending egg is even more ridiculous: Baron Mordo was loyal to the earth while he turned his back on it just after saving the earth without reasonable transition. Although I didn't read the comics, I can sense that the story would be much better and more integrated in the comics."
"danielharden","6","2","3","17 December 2016"," Stranger Things
","Benedict Cumberbatch has made a name for himself by mispronouncing the word ""penguins"" and playing the asshole genius role in many a film and TV show. He's been Alan Turing, Julian Assange, Sherlock Holmes and Khan, but now Cumberbatch plays Stephen Strange... An asshole who is also a genius... Well if it ain't broke don't fix it am I right? Doctor Strange is a decent Marvel film that doesn't quite reach the ranks of other 2016 Marvel films Deadpool or Captain America, but at least it's better than X Men Apocalypse.<br/><br/>The film is overall well acted, Cumberbatch plays the type cast role as good as ever and works rather well together with Chiwetel Ejiofor. The two together provide theatrical level acting as if they were cast in a critically acclaimed dramatic stage production rather than a MCU film. The British duo are also joined by Rachel McAdams who does fine in this film as well as Tilda Swinton, who controversially plays the Ancient One. Although the Ancient One wasn't played by an Asian actor luckily Wong is. Played by the aptly named Benedict Wong this character was the best and most entertaining in my own personal opinion. Now, we know that every blockbuster film is often only as good as its villain. So that explains why this film felt average as Mads Mikkelsen's Kaecilius joins the ranks of pretty much every Marvel film villain... Pretty much you will forget about them fairly quickly. Be that as it may this is not down to Mikkelsen's performance at all but more the lack of things for him to work with.<br/><br/>Which leads onto the next point about the film itself perfectly. The film feels generic. The dialogue is typical of superhero films in which the fate of the world is at stake and some of the visual techniques are as well. The one scene in particular that screams the word unoriginal is the scene where Kaecilius and the Ancient One circle each other while they talk before fighting. The film is hard to pin down as I enjoyed its simplicity by being generic but it is also just too generic to the point of not bringing anything new besides kaleidoscope visuals to the table.<br/><br/>The film is visually beautiful with its kaleidoscope styled visual effects and its magic portals etcetera, but overall the film lacks originality and to an extent substance. Doctor Strange is an average Marvel film similar to the first Captain America film but nonetheless I'm intrigued to see what the MCU plans next for Stephen Strange... Maybe some more bargaining?"
"kb-01809","8","2","3","8 December 2016"," Doctor Strange
","Back in 1998 director Alex Proyas who was responsible for The Crow and later on I Robot directed a movie starring Keifer Sutherland and Rufus Sewell. It was called Dark City. To this day it is one of the top 5 Science Fictions movies to come out in my lifetime. It was about a guy waking up to find a dead woman in a hotel room who he was framed for murdering. It incorporates aspects of time manipulation and visuals where the city landscapes could be changed and altered to fit the current time. All in all it was pretty much a test set by an alien race that they called Strangers. So why am I bringing this up? Because I keep hearing parallels of Doctor Strange and Inception. And although there are inception like visuals in this movie, it is really more like Dark City than anything else, and in my opinion any movie that reminds me of that already has a step up on the competition. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been struggling lately. There hasn't been any movies that I would call bad but the quality of entertainment has gone down a bit since it started. Even Civil War wasn't as good as I hoped it to be. I felt like the internal struggle of the Avengers team wasn't really that bad because nobody really wanted to hurt anyone. The whole airport scene was like watching all of our heroes in a slap boxing tournament. The good news is we all know that things are about to drastically change in the MCU. And the first change is Doctor Strange. I am usually the guy who goes to see these movies then has to wait weeks before he can talk to anyone about it because all of his friends take forever to see it. This was the opposite. All my friends saw it and wanted to talk to me about it but I couldn't because I've had a busy month and it took a while. It was really annoying, let me tell ya. Anyway, I saw it and now I'm telling all you how I felt about it. And I'm feeling pretty good. I feel like the MCU has been invigorated and has successfully begun switching gears a bit. Now ask anyone who knows me about my thoughts before the movie came out. I had serious reservations about because of the director. Scott Derrickson is a very well regarded writer, script doctor, and horror director. If you don't know what that means, hes one of the go to guys a studio will call on when they have a high profile script going into production but they need it polished. Whether it's the dialogue or action there a few writers out there who have their niche and are used in this capacity. But up until Doctor Strange all he had directed was the failed remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, Sinister, and Deliver us from Evil. I really didn't have any faith in him when it came to a story and character that actually mattered in the greater universe. Im sitting here now admitting that I was very wrong. In fact Im giving the guy a great deal of credit to the success of this movie and breathing fresh air into the MCU. Doctor Strange represents Marvels visual best and is rounded out be a very strong cast and a well put together cinematic story. It could have gotten very complicated considering the ideas of time and multiple universes inside an already established one but Kevin Feige and his disciples did a fantastic job of introducing us to a character that the basic cinema goer knows nothing about. I am hoping that the future characters to be introduced like Carol Danvers(Captain Marvel) follows suit. Next up for the MCU is Thor: Ragnarok which is supposed to be like a road movie with Thor and the Hulk, followed, by Guardians of The Galaxy Volume 2, and Black Panther. Im thinking by the time the credits roll on The Infinity Wars, most of our old Avengers will be dead, and the new crew will take over. But don't worry. As seen at the end of Doctor Strange, there is an Infinity Stone that can correct times mistakes. And I'm pretty sure we will get to see Adam Warlock (hopefully played by Dave Wooderson himself( Mathew Mcaunaghey)) take control of the gauntlet and ultimately reset everything. HINT: in the collectors little hideout in GOTG there was a cocoon. It harbors Adam Warlock. Google it. Hes awesome. But until then enjoy the movies. Support your local theaters. Yes you can pretty much download or stream anything you want but there is and never will be a better way to see a movie than on a giant screen with a crowd of people. So there you go. A review for a movie without actually telling you anything about the movie."

","If films based on comic book characters are new to you, and you aren't quite sure what to expect with Doctor Strange, don't worry. Besides the fine acting of Benedict Cumberbatch, who is at the top of his game here, the viewer is treated to fun, quantum-leap style physics, and amazing, cutting-edge CGI that actually makes you think. Magic, of course, is what drives it, in the form of slide rings and ancient formulae. But that isn't why you should watch this. It's really a character study of how a man reacts to a life-changing event. The event is a problem in modern guise, but its solution is ancient.<br/><br/>There are some excellent performances from supporting members of the cast – Chiwetel Ejiofor in particular, and also Tilda Swinton, who always manages to surprise, and Benedict Wong. But the main focus is on Cumberbatch's arrogant, controlling surgeon – who hasn't met at least one doctor like this?"
"jacobburns-09136","8","2","3","3 December 2016"," Strangely Exciting
","Dr. Strange is an interesting take on the world of magic when compared to other movies with magic, such as Harry Potter series. While this series have magic as something your are born to do, Dr Strange is a bit different. The movie has a selfish surgeon how loses his money maker hands go on a desperate search for a way to fix what had happened to him, all so he can ""help"" people. However after a discover of a paralyzed man walking perfectly again, Dr. Strange seeks this treatment only to find a world of magic created by all the other worlds that exist. In his selfish attempts to fix himself he discovers a greater evil occurring and begins to help stop the destruction of his world to Dormammu, a creature wishing to make everything part of himself or ""The One"". Benedict Cumberbatch's easy takes the essence of this selfish character and becomes one with it as well as he is able to slowly transform this character over the film. The elements of humor added to some of the more serious moments also helps keep the attention of the viewer as it is unexpected and well written. what I found the most fascinating was the effects used on the movie. All the magic in the movie is created based on the people creating special circles or tomes to summon the magic from the other worlds. while most of the magic was a orange like electricity that's shape would change depending on the spell, other magics where a more translucent in appearance or altered the world itself. The mirror dimension was my personal favorite as the world would be reflected or altered in weird ways where characters could run along walls or create four of the same city in each corner of the screen. These effects were mind boggling and created a unique setting for parts of the movie. Even one of the final scenes of the film took place in an alternative world, created likely by well done CGI that made it seem like all of this could happen. I enjoyed the how all the characters developed and what roles they played in the story, my only complaint would be that Dr. Strange seemed to get strong too fast. In the film they say he was just likely a natural but they still could have had him struggle more in his training. Other than that I am excited to see where they go with this character, especially since they connected his one artifact to the infinity stones, the items connected to the next Thor movie, which was confirmed by Thor's visit to the Doctor at the end of the movie. It excites me for the next movies in the Marvel Universe."

The way I feel about things are influenced by all the other things I've experienced in my life, and I can't ride into a land of objectivity and no context, nor would I particularly want to. With that said, the fact that I've seen most of the Marvel movies already, as well as some of the DC ones and numbers untold of other generic Hollywood action films, makes it really difficult for me to find anything new or interesting with Doctor Strange. It's true that Cumberbatch does more with this role than anyone could have reasonably expected him to. It's actually a terribly-written character, yet he manages to inject likability into an utterly unlikable person who, played by anyone else, would have been completely insufferable. This is because he's an excellent actor, far too cool and interesting for a movie like this, which is neither of those things. Swinton also is far too cool and interesting for this movie. Her performance was in my opinion the best aspect of the film; she too managed to take an inherently uninteresting, uninspired character and make it somehow riveting. At least until they killed her.<br/><br/>I'm just tired of giving Marvel movies a pass when they're so formulaic, generically-written, and genuinely uninspired. The 6 I gave this is entirely because Cumberbatch and Swinton are so blisteringly excellent. Otherwise, Doctor Strange is more of the same."

","The story is fast paced, but not to the point that majority of the viewers would not be able to catch up. Cumberbatch has made the movie more interesting, specifically with his attack on the role, by giving his character a ""dynamic"" and not necessarily pleasing personality. A typical Marvel's origin movie, as presented in the beginning up to the middle of the film, and still carries, just the right elements of the story, to guide the unfamiliar audience without getting into the boring, nitty gritty details. I'm not a fan though of the use of reflections and mirror images which serve as the movies' visual effects to the characters powers and illusions. This first Doctor Strange movie, delivers the same feel to Captain America's initial installment of its franchise, being an Origins movie, and with better things yet to come."

She likes very few movies and normally has no patience for excessive special effects/CGI. <br/><br/>The action is good (although the sequences of morphing landscapes do go on). In general the pacing is good. There are some clever twists to the CGI design and some editing could have made it more snappy.

","First, the 7-star rating is based on the entertainment value. The movie moved quickly, and the action and special effects were pretty awesome. This is not to say there were some major issues with the movie.<br/><br/>""Dr. Strange and the very Strange Tibetan Monk"" may have been the more a propos title. The entire time I was watching Swinton, a question lingered in the back of my mind. ""What, a white middle-aged woman is the spiritual and combat master leading the Tibetan monks?!"" This was a bit hard to swallow. <br/><br/>Another issue with the movie is the story flow. It was more like watching action series than a movie. I had to either swallow and/or blink hard time the scene changed. The filming seemed to have wrapped up while the editing was in progress.<br/><br/>Not to discourage you from seeing the movie, it is still fun but don't try to understand the complex and very improbably storyline."

","This was a great movie to watch to relieve stress and have fun. The best things about the movie were the fantastic effects, of course by Marvel studios, and the humor that never stops. The story isn't very deep, teaching nothing to the audience except to not to text while driving, but comedy fills it up. Even the villains of the movie are comical. The graphics and effects playing with dimensions were very impressive and added to the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>The cast was also great, although the movie drifted from the original comics where Dr. Strange was an Asian. The humor and the excessive talking of Benedict Cumberbatch was very natural, except that I really couldn't get used to his American accent, but it wasn't disturbing. The Ancient One's epicene look and character was also well played by Tilda Swinton. <br/><br/>The story of the movie goes on pretty quickly, not allowing the audience to take their eyes off the screen. The plot is original and exciting from the beginning till the end, although some parts are predictable. It isn't at all realistic, but successfully lets the audience drift away from reality for the least 115 minutes. For me, this movie was one of the best Marvel studio movies."

","Overall I liked the movie. Yes special effects plays a big aspect cause they were so good but it did make quite a difference, as it should in this movie. The acting was quite good and story pacing was good as well.<br/><br/>Far as the negatives (and I'll show my age here) his ""Rocky training"" sessions were flat out stupid and unbelievable. Hey director, you flat out failed here and I don't care what the comics say or how many books he read, this part of the movie sucked... I mean here you have some hot shot surgeon, brilliant no doubt, but is he a friggin ninja or expert spell castor? Not in the least and I don't care how smart the guy is, his disbelief in the ""non science"" realm of things only gives him a handicap, yet he seems to race through basic training and ends up being the savior of a realm we ordinary humans can't see or even seem to know about?<br/><br/>I'm willing to disbelieve a lot of things, because it's fantasy, because it's the movies, because it's Marvel movies, but at the end of the day it needs to tell a good story. With this movie overall I think they succeeded, but the whole middle ""powering up"" aspect just fell flat on it's face and the more I write this review the more it bothers me. I mean he touched and grabbed or stole things that were sacred, yet no price other than humor was paid????<br/><br/>It guess it worked, kinda...."

And then there were the puns. Yes I did laugh, but they disrupted the serious atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>I mean, if I were to write the screenplay, I would make it at least 3/4 of one movie until he reached Katmandu. And just divide this plot into 2 movies. Because then the audience would actually start to like Strange + understand his pain more... <br/><br/>Even though it is the ""classic formula"", the movie still had something to it that made me write this review."

","Over all the movie was good, it had some really funny scenes and very good visuals that made it entertaining to watch. The plot was very cliché and the ending lacked some logic. A lot of it was very predictable to the point that you don't have to go to far into the movie to have a solid idea of where it is leading. It played a lot with mysticism, magic, and time making it intriguing and confusing which is OK if you're not paying too much attention, but if you do you might notice that some things contradict and defy the logic that was established previously in the movie. That was one of the issues I had with the ending, which I don't want to spoil. The acting was good and I feel like if I didn't like something about it was probably because of the plot. Although the plot was cliché people never get enough of the story and most movies today rely a lot on the visuals to entertain the audience."

"benjaminpiche","8","1","1","28 May 2020"," A Pleasant Surprise Every Time
","Doctor Strange is in a weird place when it comes to my preferences in the MCU : every time I watch it, I am reminded of how much I love this movie, but at the same time, it is very rarely the one that I choose to put on over something more light-hearted like Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor : Ragnarok. This makes it very hard to rank this film in my Marvel list.<br/><br/>The obvious MVP here is the VFX team, who did a spectacular job making this magical world come to life. The action sequences are honestly some of the best of any MCU movie. Also, the performances are spot-on : Benedict Cumberbatch kills it as Stephen Strange, and the other cast members play their roles to near-perfection. I would complain, however, that the pacing is an element that could have been improved, especially in the first act when they set up Strange's character a little bit too quickly for my personal taste.<br/><br/>However, Doctor Strange is another amazing addition to Marvel's stacked lineup, and I can't wait to see what Sam Raimi will do with the sequel in 2022."
"ljsmith-25626","7","1","1","10 May 2020"," Mid-Table in the Marvel Rankings
","The first 30 mins or so of Doctor Strange make for just about the best superhero origins story I've seen in the MCU. Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. The writers have a decent stab at giving our protagonist an interesting character arc, and as far as Marvel films go I'd say Stephen Strange has more development of character than anyone. Cumberbatch is cast perfectly - I wouldn't be surprised to find out the role was written with him in mind.<br/><br/>What lets the film down is once again a weak antagonist - ""Dormammu"", an ambiguous being with a seemingly motiveless intent on destroying the planet. Sounds familiar right? I'm losing track of the number of Marvel films that follow this same lazy bad guy formula. It weakens the plot drastically every time, which in the case of Doctor Strange is already barely holding water.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of many films that attempt plot lines experimenting in time travel - it is too easy to pick holes in and too difficult to accept events. For instance, why does Doctor Strange wait until the end of the film to use his time reversal powers?? Why not use them at any other point in the story to resolve matters?? There are no answers to these questions, and along with many other movies that allow their plots to fall into the time travel trap, it makes for weak viewing.<br/><br/>If it weren't for the outstanding visual effects (which are so good they give Inception a run for its money) then I think I would've rated Doctor Strange one or two stars less. Overall though, while not my favourite instalment in the MCU, it is a worthwhile watch and leaves us with the potential for a promising sequel. 7/10."

","This is a weird film. It sits right in the middle of an ongoing MCU but feels like it shouldn't really be there.

I watched it right through because it's part of the MCU but had I not bothered with it, I wouldn't really have noticed."
"hooma814","7","1","1","7 April 2020"," Marvel have found a way to keep their movies new and fresh again!
","Doctor Strange was a very unique in its style, and the powers available for the heroes. Marvel did a great job of moving the buildings in ways unlike any other movie I'd seen, other than Inception, I think Marvel did it even better. The ways the characters could run sideways along rooms or buildings, as well as jumping through time holes into new areas.<br/><br/>The development of Strange's character was well done. His arrogance is constantly being broken down scene after scene until he finally relents and realises that its not about him.<br/><br/>The CGI and camerwork was excellent. The cape that flies onto Doctor Strange was even humourous. They were able to make an inatimate object seem alive and interesting.<br/><br/>It was great to finally have some settings outside of London and New York. Being in Kathmandu, Nepal was refreshing. It's arrogant to think that time and time again that Superheroes would only ever be found in USA or UK. Super hero movies are more often than not set in these western settings.<br/><br/>The Eastern setting was a welcome change and the new cast was quirky and intriguing. Benedict Wong was funny and added a lot to the overall feel over the movie.<br/><br/>The casting of Rachel McAdams felt like Marvel just trying their hardest to try and get as many famous actors involved in the MCU as possible. She was a key actor and did really well. But she could've equally been an actor that was not as well known. Movie after movie, it seems like they have a man as the main superhero and then try to have an attractive, famous supporting actress to try and get more ratings.<br/><br/>Overall a much bigger improvement from some of the earlier movies in the Marvel universe. Doctor Strange easily becomes one of my favourite superheroes and he is full of dominating power. His story also advances the overall story with the inclusion of the infinity stone."

","...gave way to a joyous, refreshingly creative, kinetic visual treat with some superb flourishes of VFX and some snappy dialogue moments even if they are all lifted from the How-To Guide for Marvel Superhero Movies(tm).<br/><br/>The (highly underrated) Scott Derrickson, director of modern horror masterpiece, Sinister, shoots confidently, and despite the palpably brisk pace hopping over lots of obvious scene trimmings; the film moves from whizz-bang locale to genuinely interesting introspective scenes with aplomb.<br/><br/>Derrickson knows how to take and distill the influences of comic books and videogames and build something less like Inception, and more like Ninja Theory's DMC game; fight scenes take place in the mirror world; a beautiful kaleidoscope of flowers and rocks and exploding, bleeding plateaus like an Arkham City battle arena. Weapons imbued with magic and a cape to rival Aladdin's Carpet (sure to be used more in the next instalment) all of them designed straight from sub-culture inspirations like Final Fantasy. That stop-motion-esque scene with that apple is bloody fantastic.<br/><br/>The sparse but excellent cast and the very clearly defined globetrotting locations mean that the film can look rich and uniquely designed with tremedous costume and make-up work, great lore and contained moments without inflating the budget. It's a smart move, worked on by talented collaborative team in the early stages with the freedom to create something cohesive.<br/><br/>When Strange uses time to defeat a timeless being it's a little bit clever, a lot bit beautiful and pleasurable on the whole. Unlike recent blockbusters (I'm looking at you Ghost in the Shell) the themes are seeded well, consistent and clear and the film doesn't rely on crappy opening descriptive text for idiots or stupid generic ending voice over to cap it off because of confusion.<br/><br/>The only disappointing beat is Chiwetel Ejiofor's unearned and misguided post-credits turn to the dark side. But that said, Doctor Strange is the little film that could; like Iron Man and Thor before it. Let's just hope the same team can build upon the foundations and expand all of the little moments and doesn't end up an Iron Man 2 or a Thor Dark World."

The scene where strange bids goodbye to Jean and she kissing him on his cheek instead of lips shows their lack of chemistry.

I would still say that the movie delivers in most departments. Special effects are spectacular, if not groundbreaking. Dialog is well written, the action sequences fun and the pace of the movie keeps the audience interested throughout.

","A brilliant man of science gets injured and works with an individual from the east to rediscover his purpose, eventually fighting an enemy with similar powers in a city. But enough about Iron Man.<br/><br/>I know I'm in a minority on this, but Doctor Strange tells a similar story to, but is superior to, Iron Man in just about every way.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is a brilliant neurosurgeon with a photographic memory who gets into a car accident due to his own negligence that robs him the use of his hands in any effective way. He goes from performing some of the most intricate surgeries modern science is called upon to accomplish to being unable to shave himself because his hands won't stop shaking. Giving up on western medical solutions, he follows rumors to Tibet where he meets the Ancient One and a monastery of monks dedicated to magic. Opening his eyes to the world beyond the physical, Strange uses his mental strength to quickly become a star pupil, going beyond the proscribed limits of his training, and meeting an evil former student out to bring about the end of the order and the current state of the world in favor of a being from the Dark Dimension.<br/><br/>What mainly makes this movie work is the strong and simple character journey Doctor Strange finds himself on. It's beyond an arrogant man learning a bit of humility. It's the story of a man with a limited view of the world learning to expand it, while also realizing his size in the face of such enormity. He may have been the best neurosurgeon (partially because he only chose savable patients), and he may have become one of the premier masters of the magical arts, but he has come to realize how small he is. Despite the great things he does to save the planet, he knows that there are more things out there that he won't be able to face down alone. It's a strongly written emotional arc for a main character that connects from piece to piece very well.<br/><br/>Of course, the main positive of the film is the action and special effects. Marvel movies have a tendency towards a drab color palette and shaky cam action (which is sometimes appropriate like in the Captain America sequels that imply a sense of urgency and reality to the action). However, that approach isn't always appropriate like in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies and this one. The idea behind the film is a gobbledygook idea of a multiverse, bringing in the powers of other universes using magical spells, and then shattering reality in certain ways with that. That very idea lends itself to trippy visuals that the movie embraces fully.<br/><br/>From the spectral form of Doctor Strange helping with a surgery on his own body to the show stopping chase through New York's mirror dimension, the movie embraces an inventive mode of special effects that lends itself well to the material. Watching New York's skyscrapers fold in on themselves, creating different axes of dimensionality, is just fun to take in, and the action that runs through it is inventive and fun.<br/><br/>Another note needs to be given to the resolution to the film's climax. The giant cloud monster from the Dark Dimension has entered our realm through a portal in Hong Kong. Dr. Strange uses some time magic to draw things backwards and then launch himself directly into the Dark Dimension to face the monster. Instead of some special effects knock out, drag out fight, we get Dr. Strange attacking the problem with intelligence and wit. He can't beat this giant monster. In fact, we watch the monster kill Dr. Strange repeatedly as the good doctor puts time into a loop that neither he nor the monster can escape. Dr. Strange is happy to maintain this status quo as long as it keeps Earth safe, but the monster needs to escape, leaving an implied agreement that we see the end of.<br/><br/>The movie's a strong entertainment and fun. A good, mid-cycle addition to the whole universe."

The development of Strange's character is one that is classic but well done, moving from a Tony Stark narcissist to a just protector of Earth. Rachel McAdams helps to balance the plot between the mystical and real. The whole movie constructs a really interesting conflicting narrative between science and belief, and how people can learn to have both.

The movie casted Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Stephen Strange, Benedict Wong as Wong, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo, Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One. In my opinion, the acting was quite good, they embodied the characters they were set to play, not just be the character. Cumberbatch did really well being the Wizard and Swinton as the Ancient One, she was on fire! The villains Kaecilius and Dormammu are acted really well, considered as one of the best villains of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The story was really good: a doctor crashed in a car and when he recovered, he was sent to Nepal to train mystic arts. It was 9% boring to me and it was kinda corny!
I've gotta say, the fight scenes were really EPIC and so were the CGI effects. They were better than Inception (2010). The city moved like a puzzle and characters fought upside down, which was one of my favourite MCU showdowns. But unfortunately, it wasn't how I expected it to be. It didn't win the best Visual Effects but overshadowed by The Jungle Book. That was really unfair, they only did animals talking and nice jungle views but if I was the one to choose the winner, I would definately choose Doctor Strange for its CGI and other special effects. The were jaw-dropping and of course, extremely mind-blowing! That's why I couldn't take my eyes off. The mystic arts KILLED it!
Many scenes were quite unforgettable like when Mordo gave Strange a paper and he thought it was something about mystic arts but it turned out to be a Wi-fi password! I couldn't help myself laughing.
I wasn't sleepy or bored but I was watching this at midnight and I just kept praising the movie for its good actions and VFX. I went like ""Wow!"", ""Awesome!"". My eyes were wide!
To rate this movie, I gave it a 8.6 out of 10. It was quite a BLAST, mostly unforgettable and one of the best of MCU"
"slightlymad22","7","1","1","21 April 2019"," Cumberbatch Is Perfect Casting
","I just watched Doctor Strange for only the second time. As is the case with most of the Marvel movies. I didn't love it, but it was OK. Benedict Cumberbatch IS Doctor Strange. I don't think any other actor could play him, as well as Benedict. Mads Mikkelseb and Tilda Swinton are both fine whilst Rachel McAdams is a tad under used, Benedict Wong is a joy.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I understood everything that was going on, but the effects are great, and I really enjoyed the score too. Outside of the Avengers theme, I can't think of another theme to a Marvel movie.<br/><br/>
On to Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2"
"Leofwine_draca","7","1","1","21 April 2019"," Fresher than most
","The latest Marvel superhero origin tale, this explores the character of Stephen Strange, a neurosurgeon who loses his dexterity in a horrific car accident. He travels to Kathmandu in order to train spiritually in an attempt to fix his broken body, but instead he finds himself joining an order of mystic monks in their battle against a renegade. DOCTOR STRANGE stands out from the overcrowded market thanks to the emphasis on astral projection and spirituality, which I found generally interesting. Cumberbatch is a likeable hero and the supporting cast much better than usual for this kind of film, with Mads Mikkelsen standing out as villain. The film is inevitably dominated by CGI action but it feels fresher here than most, and it generally stays character-focused to keep the viewer involved."

"educallejero","6","1","1","12 April 2019"," Potentially better, bogged down by Marvel cookie cutter machine.
","Visually, this might be the best MCU movie (not Avengers). Also, Stephen Strange is not like Tony Stark, like a lot of people and critics said it was. It has similarities (super ego, millionaire, best at his job, ultra smart), but the personalities are clearly different. Also, Benedict Cumberbatch seems to enjoy the dumb comic-book world. The story is another Marvel Origin superhero and ""it works"", barely.<br/><br/>Now the bad. The jokes do not work, for the most part. The villain is underused and weak. The story already done with Thor (humility and being worthy) in the same MCU, which makes it even less original because it has a similar tone and feel. The powers aren't well explained at all. There are some major dumb things, like the prohibited books section and whatnot.<br/><br/>Having said that, the action is fun and different because of the kind of powers Strange has. Also the discussion of the ""Chosen One"" and ""breaking the laws of nature"" and the moral conundrum of using power ""from the Dark Dimension"" and the extent of its use to protect the Earth, etc, is pretty interesting (although again, cut by the Marvel light-hearted formula, it's not the most profound discussion of such things with a conclusion that says: its good when the hero does it). The ""final boss"" villain was defeated in a very original and smart way, and that was great too.<br/><br/>Good movie, with potential for much more, imprisoned in the good not great Marvel Formula."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The special effects were amazing. The fight scenes where mind blowing. I did feel however, they rushed a few things and could have explained more. I felt like this might have been a filler film to bridge the gap to other Marvel films, but it is still a great film. I would probably rate this in my top five favorite Marvel films to be honest. It is a unique character and explores the realms of the impossible."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","7","1","1","8 March 2019"," A visually dazzling stepping stone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
","See if you can guess this movie: goatee'd egomaniac finds himself in a life-changing situation in a foreign land that makes him question everything he's ever stood for and become a superhero in the process. If you guessed Iron Man (2008), you'd certainly be close. No, this familiar plot is none other than the visually extreme Doctor Strange. I understand Marvel has a bigger plot in mind when they do these lesser-known heroes; but lately, it almost seems like they're just phoning it in. Doctor Strange merely feels like filler to get to Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Avengers: Infinity War (2018).<br/><br/>I will give Marvel this much: they do know how to cast a film. Benedict Cumberbatch does a superb job at portraying the eponymous Dr. Strange, fused with enough gravitas and humor to make watching him a joy. And while many will question Tilda Swinton's role as The Ancient One, especially considering the amount of Eastern mysticism included in the film's theology, she certainly makes the role work in her own way. Even the sentient cape he wears has a personality I haven't seen since the flying carpet in Aladdin (1992).<br/><br/>What Doctor Strange lacks in plot, it makes up for in special effects. I'm almost glad I didn't see this in 3-D, as I'm sure I would have vomited from all the swirling kaleidoscope effects seen throughout. Clearly, even though it's six years later, Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010) made an impression on the film world when it comes to these reality-distorting effects. There were even moments where I could catch the influence of The Matrix (1999) on the special effects of this film, especially when the characters decided that gravity wasn't good enough for them. Despite all this, even though I wasn't high enough to fully enjoy some of the sequences, Doctor Strange was still an entertaining film.<br/><br/>A visually dazzling stepping stone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I give Doctor Strange 3.5 stars out of 5."
"c7flat13","7","1","1","3 March 2019"," Another solid MCU production.
","Cumberbatch is a great actor and is a great Dr. Strange. I wouldn't say the villain or story on it's own or as part of the overall Marvel universe is as compelling as the Captain America series but the mythology and mysticism gives a cool Buddhist touch to the super hero universe and his intellectual/spiritual powers make all us Karma believers hopeful his story will evolve as one of the most obviously powerful characters of them all."
"gracewillaerts","7","1","1","24 February 2019"," Iron Man... With Magic!
","Very similar main character and concept of Iron Man, but with our hero wielding magic and sorcery over machinery. (Conceited well-known rich smart guy has a life-threatening issue which leads him to gain superpowers and be less jerklike. Then he goes and fights bad guys, makes up with some lady in his life, and becomes a better person- I mean superhero.) But while Iron Man got acclaim for kickstarting the whole tidal wave of blockbuster hero origin movies, Doctor Strange just sort of rides it and fails to stand out plot/character wise. I'd give it a 6, but the special effects were, admittedly, pretty spectacular, so there's an extra star."
"undeaddt","6","1","1","21 February 2019"," Slightly dissapointed.
","I love MCU, I love the comic book characters and the movies are really awesome alongside the amazing arc that they follow, but all in all, we all know that very often MCU movies are likely to be overhyped. That is the case with this movie. Yes, maybe I am bit late and the hype was understandable and bigger back then, but still, this is a mediocre movie with awesome visuals. The world shifting scenes are out of this world, they are absolutely amazing and I can bet the cost a lot of money, also the cast is pretty good, with some characters being developed way more than others, but I expected a bit more. The story is pretty basic, nothing special about it, the action sequences are like a part from a TV Show, you expect them to have a different conclusion that will happen further in the future. All in all, for me, this movie feels more like an episode without a concrete conclusion than a whole 2 hour movie. 6/10"

"WalkdenEntertainment","8","1","1","10 January 2019"," The Doctor Will See You Now...
","Neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is rich, smart, handsome & successful. So the biggest highlight of our lead character in this movie is that he is Successful! How And Why?<br/><br/>In the early stages of the film we learn that Doctor Strange will only take on patients he knows he can operate on without any failures and rejects the challenging ones, sending them to other doctors so they fail instead of him. The doctor is also normally only thinking of himself and putting others second or last. These are also just some of the reasons why his relationship with Christine (Rachel Adam) is no more...<br/><br/>One night, Doctor Strange is scheduled to speak at a medical presentation. While driving and while talking on a phone Dr Strange is involved in a major motor vehicle accident which forever changes his life...<br/><br/>Doctor Strange then begins a path that requires him to put aside his ego to discover the world of mysticism and alternate dimensions.<br/><br/>Marvel continues to kick goals. With the huge success of Captain America: Civil War, Marvel is very clever at introducing a new character into Marvel/Avengers such as the introduction of Ant Man in his own film then his inclusion in Civil War.<br/><br/>The whole world of Doctor Strange is incredible and I would saw this by far is the biggest highlight of the film. Watching many fight screens while buildings turn around, fold, collapse or even flip is jaw dropping. Benedict Cumberbatch is also brilliant and it felt like he enjoyed the role and gave it all while delivering the highs and the lows of this hero.<br/><br/>The only things that has held this film back in the rating scores at Finesse Movie Reviews are two things.<br/><br/>1. As far as the plot goes, its not far off from 2005's Batman Begins- a man who is looking for something, seeking answers, goes on a Journey, finds a temple and begins the training process.
2. Other characters. The overall connection between Dr Strange and our past love interest with Christine (Rachel McAdams) doesn't carry a strong nor real connection. Any time they talked about their past or possible future I really struggled to accept it. Also, the villain can come across as dull/weak.<br/><br/>While I do feel Doctor Strange is not the best Marvel movie ever, it's still a pretty damn good. Also, If you love Marvel films then you will also know what to expect. Marvel continues to offer great entertainment and exciting new characters that we will see again.<br/><br/>7.7/10

","Exotic, mind bending and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. Among the terra firma Marvel characters we've had playboy technologists, soldiers and a scientist, so this one is a good contrast - the genius. Cumberbatch is well cast, smoothly encapsulating a genius and determined man who loses his dexterity and turns to the mystics to regain it. Strange manages to be theatrical even when he is learning not be theatrical. He has good support from Tilda Swinton, the mysterious Ancient One, played with charismatic blankness. 
On the downside, the plot is quite straightforward once the rules of the perspectives are understood we see little of the thought process of a character forced to rethink everything he knows and the nature of reality itself and so when he becomes emotional it feels a bit false.
But, as the Marvel series moves on in leaps and bounds this edition once again gives it a shot in the arm and an option for the next Avengers assembly."
"one9eighty","6","1","1","23 July 2018"," A decent intro in the shape of an origin film - more to come next time?
","This film is Marvel's cinematic introduction (or reintroduction if you believe that the 1978 film should be counted as the first outing - although that was before Marvel Studies was a thing) to a long-time favourite character of comic nerds everywhere, Doctor Strange. Doctor Strange is the master of mystical arts and one of the Marvel Universes most powerful people. More than just a magician or a wizard, he controls powers that affect time and space as in this existence and others. <br/><br/>Like other movies, this is an origin story to introduce him. It accounts his story from being one of the world's finest surgical physicians who loses his skills in a freak car accident, to becoming a master of mystical arts and protector of Earth. <br/><br/>Being a superhero film you'd already expect a lot of CGI, throw in the magical element and you know that nearly every scene will be CGI'd. Threat not though, for the most part it's actually tastefully done. There are some beautiful scenes in the city reminiscent of ""Inception"", there are some wonderfully choreographed fight scenes too, and wit and humour is never far away from the screen. Some film's feel like they need the central character to grow up and become an adult with responsibilities in order for the film to advance. This feels the opposite, while Strange is a responsible adult at the start of the film he needs to relax and let go in order to be victorious. Perfect for what doubters and Marvel haters need to go through to watch something like this unreservedly without pre-judgements. If a man of science and medicine had to believe in magic in order to accept what his eyes and ears were telling him, then I'm sure cinema goers will be okay to sit and watch this for the joy of cinema rather than ulterior motives. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the Doctor and his portrayal, while a little wooden and void of emotional attachment at times, it was exactly how I'd image Strange being on screen when being plucked from the pages of a comic. I'm a fan of Mads Mikkelsen in general, I think his demeanour is very powerful, he is believable as the villain Kaecilius and I only wish there was potential to be in future films. Oops, nearly a spoiler. OK, so the story is a little formulaic, but it has to be, it's an origin story. The central character was X, then Y happens, now he has to cope with Y if he wants to be Z. It's simple sure, but at least this film had the manners not to pretend it was something it was not. It's a simple and fun film with visual treats that won't offend. I couldn't rate this as highly as other Marvel film's I've watched, but I'm not worried about that either. I know that this is an origin, we'll see Doctor Strange in other things soon, the next film, I'm sure will be better than this - but for now, I say decent introduction, 6 out of 10."
"domtaylor","7","1","1","15 July 2018"," Its outstanding special effects can't elevate the picture past its poor storytelling and inconsistent tone.
","The visuals are undoubtably fantastic, leading to some very unique action set-pieces that have enough style to set them apart from other superhero films, and its outstanding soundtrack is one of the best of the MCU. It's a shame, then, that the story and tone of 'Doctor Strange' drag it down to be one of the worst films of the Marvel cinematic universe. Stephen Strange is an unlikeable protagonist, one who we can never root for, and this means that the audience doesn't really have any reason to care about the story. Also, the narrative is very predictable and the film doesn't have a proper grasp on time; the 'training montage' is over very quickly and because there is no indication of how much time has passed, it seems as if Strange has gone from a nobody to the sorcerer supreme in mere days. Therefore, it feels entirely unbelievable that Strange can masterfully use his powers and save the world by the end of this film. Throughout the picture, Strange should have been struggling to use his powers, indicating to the audience that he is still learning and developing over time. Another big issue with the movie is its ham-fisted attempts at comedy. It is never funny, yet its 'humour' is always prevalent, even undermining serious moments on several occasions, and this becomes extremely annoying. Sure, a few comedic moments wouldn't have gone amiss, but since the character of 'Doctor Strange' isn't a funny one, this film should have had more of a focus on its serious elements and getting them to be successful. Without its superb visual elements and soundtrack, this could have been a disaster. 6/10"

"gengar843","7","1","1","27 May 2018"," Visual Treats Ahead
","This film hates itself, and loves itself, much too much.<br/><br/>Why hate? Stephen Strange of comics fame was arrogant but firm, not the childish whelp which is written for Benedict Cumberbatch, who amplifies the wiseass teen persona quite naturally, which is irritating, and I think the writers and director wanted that. There is an alienation in this version of DOCTOR STRANGE which says ""Love it or be cast out!"" I feel as if Iam being coerced into a cult of Cumberbatch, but Doctor Strange should need no such coercion. There is so much here to attract and potentially inspire, and yet we are subjected to acerbic banter rather than philosophy, and emotional band-aids rather than life lessons. I've said elsewhere the animated 2007 offering did it better. Sorcerer Supreme here is arbitrarily female, bald, with English accent, and a cheater in ways of magic; the animated version respected not only the original Sorcerer Supreme but also every ethos of Shamballa, Shangri-La, and other Tibetan adventure stories. Stephen Strange here is quite sarcastic for a man on a mission, unlike Tyrone Power in the wonderful LOST HORIZON, and more so for being out of his scientific element and such a klutz as a sorcerer until his miraculous transformation, which, honestly, must all be credited to the Cloak of Levitation. I don't buy this Mordo either, but happily I liked this Wong. As for villains, only Dormammu was worthy, the dark-side ""Nazi-ish"" Kaecilius really very feeble for all his expertise and stolen knowledge, as well as power from Dormammu. One more thing, did not like the generally-terrific Rachel McAdams in a wasted role full of snark and disbelief, an exaggerated version of Dana Scully. So in these fashions, I feel the film has a self-loathing, and perhaps a razor blade for the audience, giving us dregs of characters.<br/><br/>Why love? The film dotes on its effects, from the casual walking through a magic doorway or membrane to the ultra-spectacular meeting with Dormammu. There is of course a necessity to overwhelm with these visual delights since the characters are basically paper-thin and the story so disjointed. There are inclinations of INCEPTION here on the FX, but I can honestly say DOCTOR STRANGE does it better in any case. The film is overlong at 1hr55 (counting credits and teasers) but there are enough different cinema tricks to keep you entertained. That's why I say the film loves itself too much - it could easily have done everything without losing any eye candy in about 1hr40. <br/><br/>The Dormammu confrontation was pretty clever, with the time loop, although more exposition of how that is accomplished should've been forthcoming. Honestly, the comic books are MUCH better at information than are most Marvel movies, and I don't particularly enjoy having to suspend my disbelief when I know the answers are on page 14 of issue 37 or whatever.<br/><br/>I was also happy that Mordo turns out to be evil, which is correct for the character, but the explanation here, that the Ancient One had broken a rule to save the universe, and Strange to save Earth, is just a bite too much for me to swallow. I really liked the animated version reasoning better - Mordo is just not a guy who accepts second fiddle."

But Doctor Strange promised to be different and visually inspiring.
As far as the visuals go, 100% yes. They're really creative, interesting and next level, actually, they kinda define the film, which is why I am happy to rate the film higher than it should be, just because it was more than visually appealing to watch.<br/><br/>In terms of being different, well, kinda. 
I really liked where things were going in the beginning (spirituality, astral projection, calming the mind, healing body through soul) because these are all real phenomena, even though wildly different from how they're portrayed in the movie, obviously.
But Cumberbatch, who is a very fitting Doctor Strange, hardly changes during the entire film. I would have loved to see a more dramatic character arch. It was said that he should connect with his soul and let go of his huge ego in order to gain these powers. Well, he gained all sorts of powers but didn't seem to connect to his soul or let go of his huge ego. He still appeared pretty awkward after what one could call his awakening.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","1","1","24 April 2018"," Some poorly timed humour and a generally generic story can't stop this from being an entertaining and engaging experience.
","Thanks to some interesting visuals and a couple of fantastic action sequences, 'Doctor Strange (2016)' is a solid, if broadly generic, origin story that sets up an interesting new hero and gives him one of the widest (though somewhat 'Tony Stark') character arcs in recent MCU history. It sometimes tries too hard to be funny, with a couple of moments being unfortunately undercut by some poorly timed humour. This isn't a major issue, however, as most of the comedy comes from character and fits with the flick's consistent tone. The lead character is initially hard to sympathise with, especially since the accident that kicks off the plot is entirely his fault, but his journey and general charisma ultimately make up for that, even if his transition from 'muggle' to 'magician' is kind of hazy in terms of how long it takes. The piece is actually highly enjoyable throughout and takes a number of risks that more than pay off, especially with its wacky visuals that are a real treat to watch unfold. It also keeps a keen focus on its characters, which is what makes its fight sequences work so well, and has a hold on its themes, too. Overall, though we've essentially seen it before (mystic arts notwithstanding), this is an entertaining and engaging picture that sits comfortably among Marvel's better efforts. 7/10"
"MichaelMRamey","7","1","1","23 April 2018"," Benedict Cumberbatch Is Doctor Strange
","It's sometimes hard to disassociate an actor from their most famous role and for Benedict Cumberbatch, that would be Sherlock Holmes. However he is such a brilliant actor that he never gets that sort of treatment, you're able to separate the character from the actor and I can't imagine anyone better for the role of Doctor Strange than Cumberbatch. Marvel never really screws up casting for this MCU, but I'd say this was one of their best ones. Doctor Strange is different from the other films and I was worried it may be hard to keep up with, but they made it quite simple to understand one of Marvel's most complicated characters. Looking forward to seeing more of Doctor Strange."

"leegato","8","1","1","14 March 2018"," An Underrated, Groundbreaking Marvel Film
","Yes, this film already has high ratings, but what I mean when I say it's underrated is that whenever I mention this film to any dedicated comic book film fans, they always dismiss it as being a ""weak"" and ""typical"" superhero film that doesn't deviate from the formula that Marvel has gotten good at establishing and repeating. Doctor Strange is a spiritual and mystical journey of enlightenment for its viewers. It is certainly much more than just a rehash of Iron Man, and here's why.<br/><br/>The story tells of a brilliant neurosurgeon, Dr. Stephen Strange, whose excellence is prefaced by his harrowing arrogance. After getting into a car crash that renders his hands unusable for the precision of surgery, Strange exhausts all of his resources to improve his condition. With no hope, he turns to spirituality and healing and discovers the school of the Ancient One, where he humbles up and is introduced to the world of the mystic arts.<br/><br/>The film takes great care in establishing Stephen Strange as an arrogant and selfish person. Benedict Cumberbatch, known for his borderline sociopathic and arrogant roles as Sherlock Holmes in BBC's modern adaptation and his villainous roles in other franchises (Khan in Star Trek), is very good at portraying a character who is both unlikable yet sympathetic. I'd argue that Stephen Strange's portrayal in this film is far from Tony Stark's portrayal in Iron Man; the first half of the film shows how much Strange pushes the people who care for him away with little to no empathy, including former lover, Christine Palmer, played by Rachel McAdams. In fact, a significant amount of time is given to developing not only Strange as a character, but also his relationships with the people around him and how they serve as foils to his arrogance and eventual redemption. Of course, there are some characters who fall short of development, including the villainous Kaecilius, a rogue mystic and former student of the Ancient One whose primary motivations to use dark magic are powered by his pain of loss. The film attempts to add more development and background to Kaecilius as a character, but given that Kaecilius is a character that's moreso a reflection of the evil Dormammu, developing him as a character can only go so far as adding the finishing touches to a puppet. With a weak villain, this is definitely one of the weaker points of the film. Other than that, it's the first time in a while that we've seen an origin story like this in this franchise that actually felt independent from The Avengers (Ant-Man's opening made the film seem like an extension of Avengers; the last independent origins story we got that actually felt independent was probably Guardians of the Galaxy), and it's the first time in a while we've received a leading character and supporting characters with this much character development.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange also features visually stunning and innovative action sequences inspired by the effects used in Inception, but wholly expanding upon them. The scene that introduces Strange (and the audience) to the world of mysticism is visually groundbreaking, experimental, yet also accessible for audiences as it puts them through a roller coaster whirlwind of abstraction and surrealism. The first major action sequence featuring Strange in New York City features the action scene we dreamed of in Inception that we thought we'd never get, and the final climactic fight in Hong Kong gives a unique opportunity to watch a fight happen in full reversal while it's characters fight in real time. The resolution to the climactic fight is also original and unique; instead of the ""big fight"" we're waiting for, Doctor Strange manages to use his wits to avoid a destructive fight and win the battle with Dormammu with clever thinking, adding value to his character not only as a mystical master but also as one of the more clever characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>I'm normally not a fan of a film relying too much on comic relief, as I feel it cheapens the quality of the film, but I found the comic relief to be used tastefully in this film to help flesh out character development and provide a balance of entertainment for the film's more serious scenes. Similar to, but not exactly like, Winter Soldier's ""On your left"" line, Doctor Strange is riddled with simple single-lines that help develop characters and serve to humble Doctor Strange as he goes through a spiritual awakening.<br/><br/>On the surface, Doctor Strange is a visual effects spectacle that tells the story of an arrogant professional turned into an extraordinary and humble superhero, but, as you dig deeper, you'll find that the story is one of the most original Marvel films with a strongly developed (and well acted) lead character and supporting cast. With a clever storyline, uniquely fleshed out characters, and stunning visual effects, Doctor Strange proves to be an excellent addition to the MCU franchise."

","""Doctor Strange"" is an action fantasy movie of Marvel in which we watch a neurosurgeon who had a tragic car accident and lost his ability to pursue surgeries. Devastated by it he starts a journey of physical and spiritual healing. In this journey, he discovers a new world of mystic arts and soon his life goals change from just be a neurosurgeon to protect the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because of the plot and of course the good interpretations of the cast. At this point, it has to be mentioned that the interpretations of Benedict Cumberbatch who played as Dr. Stephen Strange, Chiwetel Ejiofor who played as Mordo and Mads Mikkelsen who played as Kaecilius. I have to admit that I expected more from Tilda Swinton who played as The Ancient One. The direction which was made from Scott Derrickson was simply amazing. The visual effects of this Marvel movie were once more outstanding as the cinematography too.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say that ""Doctor Strange"" is a very good movie for its kind and I believe that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I strongly recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to have a great time watching it since it's very interesting and you are going to enjoy it very much."

"gavinp9","7","1","1","2 January 2018"," Good entry into unknown territory for Marvel
","'Doctor Strange' is the 13th (14th? 15th? Even I'm losing count!) Marvel film, and continues the trend of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', 'Ant-Man' and 'Deadpool' - not the most well-known comic book characters, but they've given chance to breathe and create their own energy separate to the Avengers, and are more fun because of it. Simple premise here - Dr Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) is a famous, conceited, surgeon who has a car accident and can no longer fully use his hands. In search of radical treatments, he visits Nepal and encounters Mordo (Ejiofor) and The Ancient One (Swinton).<br/><br/>He - like us - has to surrender everything he thinks he knows and enter the world of mysticism, spells and magic. There's some funny scenes and remarks as he comes to grips with these new possibilities in the world. The film is actually funnier than I thought it was going to be, since Dr Strange is no Spider-Man or Deadpool in terms of quips, but it's handled well. The director, Derrickson, is coming off a patchy output at best - 'Deliver Us From Evil', 'Sinister', 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' - but does a decent job of keeping the pace up and not having too long between scenes with action. Some of the ""city/room-bending"" scenes are great to watch.<br/><br/>While the tone is sometimes dark and ""we're all just a speck in this world, which is only part of one universe, let alone the multiverse"", it's generally upbeat and handled more with awe and fun than seriousness and fanaticism. Christine (McAdams) serves as the real-world foil and Kaecilius (Mikkelsen) is an adequate bad-guy. Cumberbatch carries the film and is a douche when needed, and a strong presence at other times. The end-credits scene has a nice quick Thor appearance. I look forward to seeing more of Dr Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."

","I have a hard time with these movies. Completely weird with the mystical in the comic scifi genre. I like movies with witchcraft, and weird things, but this was hard for me. PLus, I never knew much about Dr Strange, and he intruded in my all time favorite Marvel title, The Micronauts. He was out of place. So, I am a little biased. Plus, I always have issues mixing the physical superheroes with the mystical ones (back to Micronauts, science vs mystical).<br/><br/>I only watched because it will play into the upcoming Infinity War. However, I give major props to the special effects. And over all story line too.<br/><br/>The one drawback I found, was his learning and training were so rushed through. I think, and I know they don't like to do that in movies today as to lose the audience, but another good 15-30 mins could have been spent on his training alone. I mean, this is something that would have taken years, and they blew through it in like 10 minutes. he spent more time trying to find the supreme, then actual training it seemed. Not a whole lot of explanation IMO as to the whole sorcery thing.<br/><br/>However, a very good flick to watch. Especially if you have HD and big screen. Definitely want to watch it on that."
"Maladjusted_1","7","1","1","16 December 2017"," The story is run-of-the-mill but the visuals are first-class
","Scott Derrickson's 'Doctor Strange' plays it safe most of the time by adhering to the familiar comic-book movie format (origin story, followed by training, followed by a battle with the villain). But as the saying goes: if it isn't broken, don't fix it. While the narrative side of 'Doctor Strange' doesn't offer anything new, the visuals are pretty exceptional in at least a few segments. Marvel have been outperforming their rivals for at least the last few years when it comes to cinematography and design, but in this film I'd argue that the visuals surpass even other recent films from the same studio such as 'Deadpool' and 'Captain America: Civil War'. If aesthetics rank highly on your list of qualities to look for in a film, look no further."
"crberme","8","1","1","9 December 2017"," Enjoyable despite having the average Marvel movie plot
","Doctor Strange is the introduction of the character of the same name in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Like a lot of Marvel characters first films, we get to see how Doctor Strange becomes the wizard/superhero that we all know from the comics.<br/><br/>This movie looks good, and part of that is thanks to a cast that looks natural in their characters and do great performances (Cumberbatch and Swinton really stand out here). The other part is visuals, which are filled with effects that are well done overall, but also make me feel sometimes that it was just way too much. There were moments in the movie where a more minimalistic approach would've been better and it wouldn't compromise what the movie wanted to represent. They don't look cheap at least, so they're enjoyable.<br/><br/>The plot, while is a little clichÃ© coming from a Marvel movie, it's enjoyable and actually rich in contend, which surprised me. Being this movie almost two hour long I expected some skippable parts, but pretty much the whole movie is entertaining, interesting and important for the plot. I only felt like Christine is an underused character that deserves more screen time and importance to the plot, put it's just fine the way it is.<br/><br/>There's also some funny moments in this movie that Cumberbatch really pull off well and give both the character and the movie it's own personality. I was really surprised to see them and I'm glad they made it to the final cut.<br/><br/>So Doctor Strange is good, and I think both comic and sci-fi fans will enjoy it, as it doesn't connect with other marvel movies. Also, don't stop watching when the credits start ;)."

","It is no secret that Marvel has capitalized on the popular formula used in the first Iron Man film in some of their most recent efforts. Doctor Strange is a film which follows this principle, yet it still feels fresh and unique. It possesses the arcane weirdness of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, the general story trends of iron man and the same light tone as almost every MCU film. Scott Derickson's clever direction distracts from the formulaic script via the use of mind blowing special effects; perhaps the best we've seen in a Marvel, if not a Superhero film to date. The cast does well with what they are given; Benedict Cumberbatch portrays a charming Stephen Strange, even if his character's personality and arc feel all too familiar. Tilda Swinton, controversially cast as the formerly Asian Ancient one puts in a good stint, and Benedict Wong is gives an amusing performance as his namesake Wong. Chitweiji Elijifor stars as exposition machine Mordo, and whilst his character lacks depth the actor's characterization is well done. Once again however, Marvel have fallen into the trap of fielding an underdeveloped antagonist; Mads Mikkelsen is undoubtedly a terrific actor, but his villain is ultimately forgettable. At the end of the day however, Doctor Strange ticks all the right boxes when it comes to producing a pleasurable cinematic experience; it is well made, acted and directed, is bundles of fun and has excellent special effects (This film makes Inception look tame in comparison). Overall, I really enjoyed it, and look forward to an inevitable sequel."

","Benedict Cumberbatch who plays the main role of Dr Strange stars as the head strong, pompous neurosurgeon whose personal adversity leads him to join a legion of sorcerers and to learn the inner most details of the universe. He perfectly plays a man who develops from being overly cocky to being smart with his skills and knowledge, the tragedy that shocks the audience actually turns out to be exactly what he needs in his life as he learns to be humble and have humility. The film had me hooked from the beginning, this was done brilliantly by the director Scott Derickson who has included and thought of every variable possible to keep the audience hooked and on the edge of their seat in every scene in the film, even the scene where you are just literally looking through a door to see where he come through the portal. Furthermore, there is a lot of cracking shots in the film, especially the scene in which Cumberbatch and Swinton are having a conversation while lighting strikes illuminate the sky and reveal the drifting snow in the wind. Now in every Marvel film there is always the balance of Superheroness and comedy, and this is still evident in Dr Strange through the satirical humour that Dr Strange uses as well as the subtle humour and obvious humour. Furthermore, the CGI used in this was exceptional, bending buildings and folding streets, I didn't initially notice any problems with the green screen but I've heard from others that in some areas it has been a bit hazy and lacking in quality but I never noticed it. Highly recommendable to anyone. Follow me on Instagram @gabewatling and Twitter @gmwatling"

He is a kind of stubborn guy with a powerful ego and since he cannot be cured by traditional medicine he goes to Nepal to meet a magic master (a strange lady)hoping that maybe she can cure him through the learning of mystic arts. From then on, however the story complicates itself a lot turning itself into a struggle between forces of Good and black forces of Evil that are trying to destroy our world.

","The character Doctor Strange first appeared way back in 1963. As all, certainly all the major, Marvel superheroes have long since made it to the big screen, his appearance was long overdue. The film loses nothing for those who are not au fait with the man himself; obviously it can cover only a tiny percentage of his adventures, so naturally it concentrates on his origin.<br/><br/>Also unsurprising is the fact that it has been updated – just in case you didn't realise there was no WiFi in the 1960s – but the plot is, well, difficult to follow at a first viewing. There is no sex worthy of the name, and for the most part only comic book violence, so it may not be suitable for adults.

To be sure, this film was better in some ways than the 1978 version--if for no other reason than the improved CGI. Unfortunately, rather than concentrating on creating a film with any measure of depth, the director (Scott Derrickson) chose to take the rather lazy and uninspired route by providing--yet another--superhero film consisting of nothing but action and CGI. Make no mistake, a film of this type definitely needs CGI and action. But it shouldn't be at the expense of everything else. That said, although I don't consider this movie to be bad necessarily, I also don't believe that it achieved its considerable potential either. For that reason I have rated this film accordingly.

His witty remarks, Dr. House style) his irony and sarcasm, and still - probably to attract audience - his Sherlock persona put right into the character of Stephen Strange, all of this is magic) <br/><br/>Yes this movie looks like a stand-alone show of Benedict Cumberbatch. But it is somehow justified by the plot - Stephen Strange was always sort of a diva, egocentric genius, who lived like all the universe was moving around his sun. And he never changed. <br/><br/>Rachel McAdams was very nice in her role of a protective girlfriend and the only ally Strange had in his life.

In addition, we will wondering when is he going to appear: Thor Ragnarök? Avengers: Infinity War? Spiderman Homecoming!!??<br/><br/>The story is interesting, different from the previous Marvel ones. There aren't weapons or shootings here, but magic, inner power; which is good for a change, and more mysticism, which is really appealing for western people. The way the story is told is pretty good: the path is agile and there is nothing that feels like has been added just to fill time. The performers are all big name actors and actresses, all familiar faces which delight the audience with their characters, but of course, he who steals the spotlight is Mr Cumberbatch. No one would play better Dr Strange than him and we sincerely hope that he will appear in more movies to come.<br/><br/>But the main and most important actors of this movie are the visual effects. Something absolutely breathtaking and that cannot make you look away from the screen. If Matrix was a before and an after, this one could be a another milestone in visual effects history.

It is entertaining, it is funny and it provides some inner thoughts, plus there is Cumberbitch, so go watch it while we wait for the next Marvel one!"

","The opening sequence is one of the most stupefying openings since Inception. Just as you begin to think, ""hey this is great, break out the popcorn,"" it turns into an hour of the Marvel origin story we've already seen at least a dozen times now.<br/><br/>When you tell me, Madds, Tilda and Benedict are all going to have dope space-wizard battles, I hop on-board. But this film seems to rob us of that movie just five minutes in. There is some great action here and there, but it happens so fast, before we can even take a breath, we're back in a hospital again. What's the point of being a wizard if you rely on your health insurance more than your magical powers?<br/><br/>There are many redeeming moments throughout, and the good doctor could become an excellent vehicle for gorgeous visual material in future Avengers or Doctor Strange movies. But this movie feels like a two hour trailer that tells you to come back in a few years once they've made the sequels."

","In India, Marvel super hero movies has a lot of marketing. This is an exception. Being a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, I expected a performance like in Imitation Game.

The story is plain and we will come to know what happens next in the first 45 minutes itself.Rest is all about how the lead actor saves the world from evil.<br/><br/>With an age old story line, an effective screen play might have made the movie even better. But somehow, I found the scenes too shallow with the whole of attention on the CGI stuffs. Even that gets boring after a while where the same spell is being used over and over. The climax is good and well thought but I don't know how the evil of all evils simply made a school kids like deal, just for a simple reason of getting escaped. It made me laugh.<br/><br/>There are some good thoughts shared. Mind control is one area which I felt is noteworthy! Overall, a decent one time watch.

","Forget Doctor Strange as a superhero movie and just watch it as a series of images. The movie undoubtedly still works, and that is probably it's biggest strength. All of the training montages, the hero facing off against the big villain planning on world domination, and the mentor that is doomed to a tragic fate so that the hero can avenge them – we have seen a hundred times before. Throwing in time reversal, mystic dimensional shifts, magic vs. hard science – even all that has been done to death. But these visuals, not to mention the great acting by the entire cast, are what make Doctor Strange a story worth telling and it is less a super hero movie than a psychedelic experience."

"bowmanblue","8","1","1","13 March 2017"," The Marvel formula lives on
","Once upon a time there was a conceited rich man who frequently cracked jokes at other people's expense. However, he only got away with it because of his status and that he happened to be brilliantly good at what he did. However, his charmed existence all came to an end when a tragic accident happened to him which forced him to re-evaluate the way he'd been living his life and, in turn, made him into the superhero he is today. His name was Tony 'Iron Man' Stark. Or do I mean Dr Strange? Actually, it doesn't matter – it's basically the same film. I may be being a bit flippant, but, when you're basically copying the original 'Iron Man' film, it can't be that bad. And it isn't.<br/><br/>'Dr Strange' is yet another superhero movie in Marvel's – seemingly – never ending connected cinematic universe. Here we have Benedict Cumberbatch taking on the titular role as an arrogant (but brilliant!) surgeon who gets his career (and life) dashed when he's involved in a horrific car accident and therefore loses the use of his hands and therefore livelihood. However, all is not lost – a trip to a spiritual guru on the other side of the world turns the arrogant Dr Stephen Strange into the 'Sorcerer Supreme,' ready and willing to protect Earth from all those dark dimensions out there (and Mads Mikkelsen!).<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the story is pretty much what you'd expect from any of Marvel's recent offerings. However, this one is the first one that really centres on actual 'magic' with its plentiful psychedelic effects which are used for both the battles and trips into other dimensions. A lot of people have commented on how much they look similar to the way the worlds 'fold' in the film 'Inception' and I have to say that it was instantly recognisable. Whether you consider that a drawback or not is up to you. Either way, they are pretty impressive (as you'd probably expect from a big budget Marvel movie) and make a change from the usual beating up of endless CGI robots in New York! If there's one constant criticism that's always levelled at Marvel movies, it's that they have a distinct lack of decent villains. We've had Tom Higgleston's 'Loki' and that's about it. Perhaps that's why they went an employed the extremely talented Mads Mikkelsen as the antagonist here. He, as you'd expect if you've seen him in anything before, he's as good as he can be with what he's given. However, in the grand scheme of things, he's just the guy Dr Strange has to defeat at the end, leaving most of us lamenting the fact that Loki wasn't included (again!).<br/><br/>When the casting was announced for Dr Strange, there was some minor controversy regarding using white actors for Asian roles. I guess this is only a problem if you know the source material. I wasn't sure who they were referring to as I hadn't read the comic; instead I just enjoyed the romp and the pretty colours used in the magic scenes! Benedict was good and a welcome addition to the Marvel shared universe. Apparently, his accent was a little off here and there (as my girlfriend said he sounded 'Scottish' at one point!). Overall, Dr Strange isn't anything new, but it is good fun and plenty to build on in the expanded universe."
"MajBlade2","6","1","1","10 March 2017"," Interesting visuals but could have been better
","Considering they worked on the script for two years I would have thought it could be better. Bendict Cumberbatch really looked like what I would think Dr. Strange would look like so casting was spot on there. The visuals were pretty good other then some of it looked rehashed and the NYC fight scene looked like a better version of Inception. But the story just had so many holes and stuff that wasn't explained just kind of appeared and became part of the story. And the directors very conspicuous use of non stereotypical people to play some of the parts actually hurt the movie. The man is in Nepal in the capital of Katmandu and he is accosted in a back alley by a boy band? No! really, all the muggers were white or black not an Asian in sight. Why go to Nepal he could have walked down to the sanctum in NYC still got mugged and got brought into the order. And the end....mahhh But I guess you got to have your orgin story. I think he might do better in an Avengers movie. I just hope they don't try to reinvent him 3 different times in 10 years"

","First off I have to ask the question: What is it with all these mediocre film endings? This film started out great. I was thoroughly engaged in the plot and the characters.<br/><br/>Then about half way through, it started to get messy. The story-line felt rushed and scenes overblown.<br/><br/>I notice these days if the writing is weak, then film-makers start to blow up things hoping the audience won't notice a predictable story-line.<br/><br/>I get that comic geeks love this stuff but at the same time, how often can the same plot-lines be repeated over and over again? In the Lee universe I guess ad nauseam. So no surprise, there is going to be a sequel to pick up from the rather bland ending.<br/><br/>Blowing up the world and reassembling it through your green time trinket is not a good enough ending for me. Sorry to be a spoiler but that's how disappointed I felt watching it.<br/><br/>If film studios can't raise the budget to hire a stellar writing team, them using the budget on excessive CGI isn't going to make it better.<br/><br/>But since comic book fans are loyal followers, the formula works. Question is: what about the rest of us looking for solid story lines within a great fantasy film? Dr. Strange shows we are not part of the equation. Because of this, I give the film a 6. Would have been less but the film started out very strong so that's really what I'm rating. The beginning and not the end."
"fung0","7","1","1","5 March 2017"," Exactly What You'd Expect - Unfortunately
","Doctor Strange is THE quintessentially generic Marvel comic-book film. It executes the established formula with mechanical precision. The origin. The early training. The villain. The gratuitous quips. The evolution of The Costume. The Earth-shattering finale. It's all there.<br/><br/>This makes for a fun film, but not a great one. What Doctor Strange really lacks is *strangeness.* The truly original vision that Steve Ditko brought to comics in the 1960s (and which numerous other creators have built on, over the years). The early plots were hokey, maybe, but they were original. The look and feel and concept of the comics was unusual, bizarre, like nothing that had gone before. It was that unique sense of style that set Doctor Strange comics apart.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange, the film, is devoid of any style of its own. As the trailers correctly intimated, the visuals are largely swiped from Inception, and do absolutely nothing to capture the Ditko world of demented alternate dimensions. The look of the film is glossy and modern, where it should be bizarre and scary.<br/><br/>The often-annoying Cumberbatch is actually not bad as Stephen Strange - but he's also not particularly good. He's really the same guy as Robert Downey's Tony Stark. Both of whom could easily be older Peter Parkers. He's yet another Generic Action Guy, laughing nervously in the face of cosmic dangers. Even though Doctor Strange was the one Marvel hero who was truly devoid of humor. His was a grim world of sorcery, not of levity, but of endless study and utter devotion to forbidden arts. There's none of that in this film.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is certainly worth seeing as two hours of light diversion. It's well-made and satisfying in its own terms. But coming after a decade of Marvel adaptations, it's also utterly forgettable. And a cosmic let-down to anyone who had any love for the original material. It's probably just about what Steve Ditko would have feared Hollywood would do to his work."

","Generally I regard most of the Marvel's shared universe projects as fun, but ultimately filler entertainment for the most part. My favorites are Iron Man, The Winter Soldier & new addition Doctor Strange.<br/><br/>Expanding on the more magical aspect of the Marvel universe, - introduced in the dismal Thor: The Dark World - we are introduced to alternative/reality bending powers & dimensions. There is no character better suited as a candidate to go on this journey with then Doctor Stephen Strange. He is the master of magic, regardless of which medium the audience/readers find themselves in.<br/><br/>Played suavely by Benedict Cumberbatch, a lot of people draw comparisons with Tony Stark. They do share some personality traits, however Stephen Strange set himself apart - at least in the film - by being more reserved in his attitude.<br/><br/>Supported by a strong cast who give good - Rachel McAdams (Christine Palmer), Chiwetel Ejiofor (Mordo) & Mads Mikkelsen (Kaecilius) - to great performances, - Tilda Swinton (The Ancient One) - Doctor Strange proves a strong addition to Marvel's shared universe despite it's fairly rushed by the numbers story.

","Doctor Strange is the same superhero movie that we've seen a thousand times, but different. The sense of humour in it makes it a little bit different and something new. <br/><br/>I have not enjoyed a superhero movie in a long time so much that I didn't liked it, but this one I loved watching it. It was an easy going movie and not tiring at all. Like a 20-minute comedy episode. <br/><br/>I've noticed that Benedict couldn't shake Sherlock off. If it wouldn't have been for the suit, hair and beard and the costume with an American accent, you'd see Sherlock all over it. Which is not necessarily a bad thing cause I enjoyed it, but if I see it in his next movies enough I might stop following his filmography. <br/><br/>The script is the same but is a satirical black comedy making fun of superhero movies and all those great moments that the superhero realizes his power and the music starts, the wind is blowing and his pilgrim is flying.... and then it's ruined (haha). It was a refreshing thing to see the fun side of being a superhero.<br/><br/>But if we take it as a serious one then it has gone in a completely different direction. I would have liked it had the movie been darker, but I don't really know if that could have worked.<br/><br/>Also the romance is out here, only a light touch (not too much), just enough so the audience can see a soft side of the man with the pressure of the world in his arms. Rachel McAdams, no Notebook for you here. <br/><br/>The modern-now-day cultural references to Eminem, Beyonce, Drake and what not show the fun side of the movie and keeping in track with ''present'' time as in other superhero films the character looks like he's not in touch with today and looks like he's a thousand years old. Shows that they're not savages. <br/><br/>Overall it is worth it, if you wanna relax and have a drink, take your mind off a hard day's work ... this is a good recommendation. <br/><br/>7/10."

","Some guy steals a book and tears some pages from it after killing some guys. It's Hannibal. As he makes his escape, the architect, I mean, a bald monk arrives and start flipping space horizontally and vertically, still, Hannibal escapes through some wormhole.<br/><br/>Then we meet Dr. Strange a brilliant and supremely arrogant neurosurgeon who thinks he's brighter than he really is. While recklessly driving his Lambo he crashes and barely survives. His hands are trashed. A therapist tells him the story of a guy who was paralyzed but now is walking. The Dr. finds him and this guy tells him about Nanda Parbat, I mean, Kamar-Taj where he can undergo spiritual and physical healing.<br/><br/>The Dr. travels to Nepal and starts asking about the place. He's trailed by some monk who eventually takes him there and right away introduces him to the Ancient One, a laughably miscast Tilda Swinton, who was the bald monk from the intro. The other monk, Mordo, is all for supporting the Dr. while Baldy realizes that his massive ego is in the way. She gives the Dr. some Eastern metaphysics lessons to no avail. When he's left no choice but to surrender, he finally develops the power to control energy. She also tells him about the order of things, namely, there are multiverses most of which are under the control of Parallax, I mean, Dormammu. Our multiverse is the last free one so there are temples in NY, London, and Honk Kong to protect the planet. And that is where Hannibal is heading.<br/><br/>The pages Hannibal took give him the power to control time. The brilliant Dr. learns everything he can from the ashram's library, including things he shouldn't and with the eye of so-and-so he too controls time and envisions the missing pages. He also learns something interesting about Baldy. At one of the temples, a floating cape attaches to him and he he fights with Hannibal and his minions. Now a fully empowered Dr. and Mordo and the librarian head to the last temple where Dormammu is about to swallow the universe.<br/><br/>Why has it taken so long for the Marvel/Disney mafia to release this story instead of cranking out the other ridiculous dressed-up goof movies by the dozen who knows. According to Baldy while the avengers fight in the physical plane, these monks fight in the astral plane, which is of course baloney because here too the fights are physical. The confrontation between Dr. and the colorful kaleidoscope of Dormammu is a bit more cerebral. At least this movie goes a bit deeper with the Eastern thinking. The problem is, it also tries to be irreverent. In fact, this movie doesn't know when to get serious and when to go for laughs. The backstory of the Dr. is also interesting. Competent professionals always make for good characters. Also strong is the philosophy of time, mixed with a bit of ethics. It seems to be getting fashionable as it also was the theme of Arrival. There's a bit of an ethical twist which is very good. The bad guys here do have the stronger argument. But the movie for no good reason flip-flops on the issue.<br/><br/>I'm going to give this movie a higher score than it deserves mainly for exposing moviegoers to some deeper thoughts even if it does it tongue-in-cheek unfortunately."
"ritera1","7","1","1","12 February 2017"," Enjoyable except poor direction.
","A good chunk of positive elements, especially visual. The twisting landscapes were new and exciting (even though were done in Inception). Especially the chase in the middle, which was balanced and flowed well, despite a demanding visual requirement.<br/><br/>The performances were not really demanding but were well served by a slew of very good actors.<br/><br/>Writing was a bit better than the regular Marvel fare (Captain America the exception). The metaphysical element were simply defined and accessible, by and large. It was a bit complicated at times but I assumed the benefit of the doubt. I don't think the time loop at the end worked very well. Clunkly.<br/><br/>Was disappointed with Scott Derrickson's direction. Thought several instances of detail and artistry were missed. Despite the chases being very good, the actual fight scenes were quite poor. American cinema, and especially Marvel movies, have a habit of making the combat vague and confusing with a shaky camera. This was the case here, plus 20%.<br/><br/>Additionally, disappointed with the lack of conflict with the first half, despite the fact that it was heavy with conflict in the 2nd. Somewhat called for a slow start but still felt antsy, even though it did have the pending threat of Mads Mikkelsen's bad guy at the front.<br/><br/>In the end, Strange's arc was convincing and effective. Didn't care for Chiwetel Ejiofor's turn to a bad guy at the end. Too much by-the-numbers and sudden."

Some like to say whitewashed, but the reality is there are white Asians. The important thing is she did a great job. Mads Mikkelsen as the villain is a good choice, but the makeup and fashion downplayed the character.

Benedict Cumberbatch seems like he was born to play the Role of Dr. Strange, and will definitely live up to any expectations you may have. The only complaint I have about the movie is the somewhat excessive use of CGI in several scenes. In most Marvel movies, the CGI is used only when necessary, and it's clear that the actors are used in as many scenes as possible, whereas in Dr. Strange, the CGI could be distracting, and made it a bit difficult to suspend disbelief in some of the scenes. Other than this small issue, Dr. Strange was still just as fun and exciting as other superhero movies that recently came out, but also had more thought-provoking and interesting themes throughout. Overall, Dr. Strange was a fun and interesting film that you're sure to enjoy-just try not to get too distracted by the CGI."

","Doctor Strange is a textbook definition of a Marvel film. A generic story, good action sequences, a healthy dose of comedy, and an underwhelming portrayal of an amazing superhero. One thing that sets this film apart for all of its Marvel predecessors is its superb psychedelic visuals. Dr. Strange's introduction to the world of ""magic"" by the Ancient One was some of the most visually appeasing sequences I have seen in film, which is also why I regret not witnessing it in 3-D. Besides the visuals and smart casting of Benedict Cumberbatch for the role of Dr. Strange, this film is very unfulfilling. I was hoping for this film to break the mold and delve away from the formulaic nature of Marvel films, similar to what Deadpool did, but that simply just doesn't happen in this one.

"Matt_Layden","7","1","1","3 January 2017"," Decent intro to the mystic arts.
","Going on to about a dozen films or so in the Marvel Universe, there comes a point when you have to present something new to the audience. Everyone was on board with the individual films, which led to the team up of the Avengers. People were blown away with how well they pulled that off. Shift to the second phase of films and we get some decent and generic sequels. Knowing early on that they had to spice things up a bit, Marvel took a chance on some third party characters, hoping that they were unique enough to be considered ""refreshing"". So we are introduced to Guardians and Ant-Man. This seemed to hold the fans attention for a bit longer. Now were closing in on another set of films and I'm sure Marvel was asking themselves, what can we show them now? Their answer is Doctor Strange. A wonderful kaleidoscope of imagery to grab your attention, despite the same tepid story Marvel has been chugging out for years now. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, the movies are all good in my book, but I feel that the spectacle will not be the only offering people want in the next phase of films. <br/><br/>Strange is a genius surgeon, the best in his field. The only thing that matches his talents is his arrogance...hmmm, sounds like another goatee wearing hero on the marvel universe. Anyway, one night while driving, he ends up in a terrible accident, which destroys his hands. Determined not to live a life of mediocrity, believing he is better than that, Strange dedicates his life to bettering himself. The search takes him to some far corners of the earth and opens his eyes to a new healing power, the power of magic. Quickly learning his new formed powers, Strange must battle some guy who has some evil plan....this is where the story gets a little generic and forgettable. So forgettable, that I forget the villains name, I only remember that he was played by Mads Mikkelsen.<br/><br/>That has been one universal issue that everyone agrees on when it comes to Marvel films. The lack of a compelling villain. Save for Loki, the Marvel films have continuously dropped the ball in this department. They seemed to try and steer back into the right direction with this year's Civil War, but Strange seems to throw them back down a peg as Mikkelsen is not given enough screen time to shine. Before I look anything up, if I recall correctly. He was a former student of the Ancient One, who has suffered some personal loss. This turns him evil and he teams up with a giant cloud monster to bring the destruction of earth. Hmm, some pretty hollow motivation if you ask me. So I'll copy and paste some info from the Marvel wiki to clear some of that motivation up.<br/><br/>Kaecilius was a sorcerer and a former member of the Masters of the Mystic Arts who became disillusioned with the Ancient One when he felt his mentor was not allowing other dimensions to come to Earth, which he believed could reunite him with his deceased wife and son. He formed the Zealots with the intention of defeating the Ancient One and bringing the inter-dimensional being known as Dormammu to Earth. <br/><br/>So with this new information in my mind, I still stand by the fact that these films tend to drop the ball on the villains. So where does the film excel? Well, for starters the aforementioned Ancient One, played by Tilda Swinton. I'll admit, at first I was not a fan of her. Her alien like features and dramatic turns seemed to turn me off of her acting in previous films, but I have since developed a new found appreciation for her. I guess if she sticks to genre flicks or quirky comedies, I like her. She is the highlight in Doctor Strange for me. Cumberbatch does well enough for himself, he plays the arrogant jerk to perfection, but he will have more time to develop that role. For now, this film belongs to Swinton. Rounding out the rest of the supporting cast is Chiwetel Ejiofor, with an irritating character arc and Rachel McAdams, relegated to being the girlfriend sidekick. <br/><br/>I mentioned earlier the kaleidoscope imagery...I literally meant that. The background images of this film were obviously inspired by the images one would find looking through the glass of the toy. Strange takes the Inception leveled effects and kicks it up a notch and to great effect. These visuals are what makes the film stand out from the other entries. Strange's first venture into other dimensions is trippy enough to warrant a viewing. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange is another generic entry into the Marvel franchise, but those generic entries are still pretty damn entertaining. The film fumbles with the villain and some forced comedic bits that don't land, but is strong enough entertaining you that you might not mind. It cleverly sidesteps the usual ""city destruction"" climax and turns it on its head. Doctor Strange is a welcomed addition to the series."

Saying this I want to note that I am a fan of many of the actors in this movie but there wasn't anything cohesive to pull them all together. The chemistry between characters was ""meh"" and I didn't find myself emotional or tense at any of the moments I was likely supposed to. The attempts at humor were ruined by the previews.

It's more like the Antman movie.<br/><br/>The character of Dr Strange is interesting and (of course) well played by Cumberbatch. The other characters were also good. The film was easy to follow, requiring no prior knowledge of or familiarity with previous films. The plot was fantasy, but not too dumb. The writing was great, with lots of humour and zippy one-liners. <br/><br/>The usual kung-fu, chasing, shooting and explosion scenes were not too off-putting (although that being said, there was plenty of action). There was one visual technique that was overused somewhat (i.e. the folding of space) but in general the visual effects were interesting and spectacular enough to please a jaded visual generation. <br/><br/>I would not say this movie was insightful or moving, however.

","'DOCTOR STRANGE': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The 14th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is based on the Marvel Comics superhero character 'Doctor Strange'. Strange was a talented neurosurgeon that lost his skills in a horrible car accident. He seeks help from a Sorcerer, called The Ancient One, to heal himself; and in the process he gains mystic super powers. The movie stars Benedict Cumberbatch, in the title role, and it costars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Tilda Swinton, Mads Mikkelsen, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Scott Adkins and Benjamin Bratt. It was written by Scott Derrickson, Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, and it was directed by Derrickson (Derrickson has previously directed, and co-written, such popular horror flicks as 'SINISTER', 'DELIVER US FROM EVIL', 'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' and 'HELLRAISER: INFERNO'). The movie has been a huge blockbuster at the Box Office (much like all Marvel Studio films), and it's also gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I liked it. <br/><br/>Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) is a very successful neurosurgeon, that's horribly wounded in a disastrous car accident; losing the use of his talented hands. In a desperate effort to try and heal himself, Stephen travels to Kamar-Taj; and meets a powerful sorcerer called the Ancient One (Swinton). She teaches Strange her powerful mystic abilities; and Strange also learns that the world is under attack, by other evil sorcerers. The doctor might also be one of the only people that can stop them. <br/><br/>The movie is just as fun, and entertaining, as most Marvel Studio superhero films. This one is cool because it's a little different; like they all are, but this one feels even more so. Despite it's fresh uniqueness, the film still suffers from a lot of the usual Marvel action film clichés; and overuse of CGI. It does always look cool, but it also loses a lot of it's freshness; in it's overuse of CGI. For the most part though, it's a well made (and fun) superhero action movie.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GhHTPB4y30"

","Benedict Cumberbatch is an amazing actor, but was he stretched by such a one-dimensional character, or just playing an aspect of his Sherlock persona? Madds Mikkelson was likewise wasted in another one-dimensional villain. These are great actors, included because their names draw viewers.<br/><br/>The inception-like special effects showed the screen writing to have limited imagination, while the so-called magic was simply not how real magic works; it was more like the sense of magic that a non-magical person might have.<br/><br/>The best piece of the film is the end-credits scene, which is a long wait for some of the traditional Marvel humour.<br/><br/>Having said that, by the end I was curious how future MU films will use Doctor Strange."
"gokhangul-88320","6","1","1","26 November 2016"," mixture of known movies
","I would call this movie as a combination of some well known movies. Majority comes from ""Matrix"" and ""Inception"". Minority comes from ""Dungeons & Dragons"" and ""Harry Potter"". There is also a little bit of ""Last Samurai"". Let me mention briefly about the connections:<br/><br/>""Last Samurai"": An irrelevant person with martial arts starts to develop extreme skills, in a short period of time. It is not really very clear how he manages to do it.<br/><br/>""Dungeons & Dragons"" and ""Harry Potter"": The special effects and magics come mostly from these two movies.<br/><br/>""Inception"": Multiverse and multi-dimension stories come from this movie.<br/><br/>""Matrix"": Many concepts are taken from Matrix. But please don't get surprised. In many recent movies you can see such copies.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I recommend watching the movie, if and only if you are NOT connected to science and your brain works below excellent."
"moelsawy-26614","6","9","25","26 October 2016"," Cliché' Marvel story telling
","I didn't quite know what to expect with this one, but being a comic book movie fan, I booked my IMAX tickets for day one of the latest Marvel movie instalment. Being that this would be the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, I was hoping for a movie that would showcase the magic and mysticism in an original, darker and less cliché way than the rest of the Marvel movies to date. Unfortunately, that wasn't to happen. It started off really well, highlighting Doc's origin, his arrogance, his thirst to be the best. I really liked Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, regardless of the complaints of the character being white-washed, I thought she portrayed the character very well. Benedict Cumberbatch played his role well, giving us a glimpse of the Sherlock Holmes arrogance.<br/><br/>The second act is where I started to notice that the jokes began to get out of hand, and whilst some in the audience were laughing, I found myself and others starting to get quietly frustrated. There are times when jokes are appropriate and then there are times where they just take away from the seriousness of the story. Everything I've read to date about the movie described how dark it is compared to the rest of the MCU, but I really failed to see that. And when it came to the third act, the unnecessary jokes kept coming in thick and fast. Even at points where people were dying.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the visuals were stunning, especially in an IMAX theatre, but it didn't do much to allay the staleness of the rest of the movie. Benedict Wong as 'Wong' was pretty much wasted. A talented actor reduced to a moody librarian. Mads Mikkelsen, as talented as he is, was just a side line performer in a cliché villainous role with no real depth to him. Pretty much like every other Marvel movie villain. And the last act pretty much reaffirmed the lack of creativity, with an end-of- the-world scenario yet again and don't get me started on the way Doc Strange managed to defeat this villain, just pure awful!<br/><br/>This makes me wish that the Russo Brothers helmed all of the Marvel movies and makes me hope that the DCU can do something to really rival Marvel's cliché way of storytelling... The best part of the movie was the mid credits scene setting up the way for Doc's integration with the Avengers and by the way there's also a post credit scene, so stay until the end."
"austin0731","6","11","33","25 October 2016"," A weaker entry from the MCU
","As a Marvel fan I will have to admit that Doctor Strange is one of the franchise's weaker entries along with Thor the dark world and some of its earlier solo pieces. The film had no focus and the pacing was off a lot of times.<br/><br/>However to start of I would like to point out the positives, One of the most well done parts of this film is establishing the absurdist, strange and sometimes trippy world of the famed sorcerer supreme. As the recent All new all different doctor strange storyline does so very well this side of the Marvel universe is being represented quite well, in the comic book continuity and in the Marvel cinematic universe we are really seeing Doctor Strange in a sort of return to forms with all of this absurd and all around 'strange' world that is the mystic and interdimensional side of the Marvel universe. I think this was a good approach and representation to the interdimensional side of this vast comicbook continuity.<br/><br/>Another job well done would be in my opinion Benedict Cumberbatch, he is an actor who can sometimes be really good as one that everyone loves to hate and hates to love. The 'Draco Malfoy' of movies, BC as he quite often does portrays this snobbish know it all character in a great way that makes audience really find him annoying and overly arrogant. Now as BC so often portrays this character type I wouldn't say that this is some sort of a major acting breakthrough but all I can say is I guess it was a good casting choice for BC to play Doctor Strange.<br/><br/>Now the movie also as mentioned have several flaws one of them being a flaw that has been throughout the entire MCU, the villains. Once again we find ourselves in an MCU film where the villain has the most simplistic plans and is defeated by the most basic things, in the sense that they don't seem to pose any major threat at all. We did get introduced to the character of Dormammu but my god, the moment I saw him on screen it immediately reminded me of Galactus from 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer', Why MCU? Can you not have a good villain other than Loki. The film constantly foreshadows and references this coming villain but when he finally shows up he barely does anything at all. Just no. I guess the MCU can never have a good villain so they'll just have to keep bringing back Loki.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film was off too, scenes can sometimes be dragged along really slowly and at times days would go back in the matter of seconds. It really just seems like things sort of pop out left and right with no correlation. I haven't even mentioned the many impracticalities and parts that didn't make much sense at all. The story as the foundation/backbone of this film was sloppy and not done very well at all. But it does manage to get the job of establishing a different side of the MCU and a new character: Doctor Strange done.<br/><br/>Overall, yes this is probably one of the weakest MCU films but it isn't completely irredeemable, it can be hard sometimes to do origin stories so I would expect a second entry to be a lot better simply because this established world of Doctor Strange is a very interesting side to explore in my opinion and the character of Doctor Strange was established quite well as well which does make me quite excited for the following films where we actually see Strange interact with the other members of the MCU."
"elale-573-971300","10","5","12","10 November 2016"," Marvel Does the Matrix
","As a person who both believes in science and works magic, watching this movie felt like remembering things I already knew. It reminded me of things I'd forgotten along the way, foundations buried by the dust of mundane life over the years. Some great stories sweep one away to another world, but this one swept away the dust off of this world, and showed it to be great and wonderful as any other. <br/><br/>I'm giving this 10 out of 10 even though I do have a criticism, because my criticism did not occur to me while I was watching it. I had read a lot about the casting of Tilda Swinson as The Ancient One when the casting choice had been announced. I don't really know why they chose to change the Ancient One, but if it's because of the reasons bandied about in what I read back then, either reason is problematic in its own way. The most obvious reason would be to give any large, important speaking role to a white person for the sake of giving American audiences people they can relate to. Aren't we past this point yet, though? I mean, the Ancient One is basically a martial arts mentor, we had an Asian martial arts mentor in the old Kung Fu TV series even though the title character was played by a white guy, and American audiences had no problem with that. In the previews that played before Dr. Strange was a preview for a movie about the Great Wall of China, and, guess what, a white guy was the star. I'm just over hear shaking my head, wondering what sense that could possibly make in the story. OK, so there's that possibility, but the other one I read about back when the casting choices were made is more insidious if it's so: that they changed the Ancient One from being Tibetan so they could get the movie passed censorship by the government of China. So it could play in the Chinese market. So, now we're blaming Hollywood erasing Asian characters on China. OK then. I really would have liked the Ancient One to stay Asian. Given how much fighting the Ancient One does in the movie, it would have been great to have him played by an actual martial artist, too. All that said, though, none of that detracted from my enjoyment of the movie while I was actually watching it, it's just bugging me now, the next morning. <br/><br/>Dr. Strange is a great spectacle. Even if you're not into the mysticism it portrays, the portrayal of the other worlds and the bending of time and space is done with excellent special effects that are great to watch. It reminded me of The Matrix in that it uses fx and fight scenes to show something deeper. On the surface, it's about gaining powers and defeating a bad guy like any other superhero movie, but underneath it has something to say about the nature of reality. There is enough plot to keep it from being just a psychedelic fx show. Each of the effects is necessary to the story. <br/><br/>There are some great moments of humor. I especially liked the physical humor with the cloak. I laughed out loud at the near-pratfalls caused by the Cloak of Levitation. <br/><br/>The character of Dr. Strange is one I can relate to because he's basically a human. Even though he starts out as an exceptional surgeon so he's up at the top of professional success, he's still just a human without any powers when he starts out. He's not a mutant or a demigod or an alien or given powers by a spider or gamma rays or any of the other ways superheroes usually get their powers. Strange is just a regular human being who learns stuff from books. <br/><br/>I really liked how time and mortality were portrayed as positives. When the villains first explain their motivation, they don't sound like villains at all. They want to free the world from mortality, and that sounds great at first. It's only when we see the true nature of what they serve that the viewer realizes how wrong they are. I also like how questioning and bending the rules is portrayed as a positive. There isn't a hard line between the white hats and the black hats; the top good guys are gray. <br/><br/>This movie delivers the action, fx, and humor one expects from a Marvel movie, including the obligatory Stan Lee cameo and a scene during the credits setting up another movie. Re-filling beer stein for the win, lol. It also serves up a mix of magic, technology, choices, and personal development that will please fans of Star Wars and The Matrix."
"sukanya-samy","6","5","12","6 November 2016"," Comeon Cumberbatch, don't give in to big studio movies!!
","First reviewed on 'broth of blogs' on word-press. OK lets start with the good. The special effects were spectacular - I am just another one who feels it was Kaleidoscope-y/Inception-y but really, they looked great. But was there anything else?<br/><br/>Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange was good, but not as great as Downey as Tony Stark like most people are comparing. I mean Stark was so much more defined. I didn't even see why people are saying there are comparisons - there were like 2 scenes where Strange is shown to be an egotist and a brazenly rude genius. I didn't really care he lost his hands but I did care when Stark was being held hostage because they developed the character there you see. With Strange, they just fast forwarded without showing anything.<br/><br/>I didn't really care for the whole mysticism and magic - I mean I know and have read about chakras and energy and what one can do with practices like Pranic Healing and Reiki. The whole Kamar Taj nonsense just felt so superficial, fake even. You send Strange up to Everest and he learns magic because he can't take the cold? Come on folks!<br/><br/>I really like the chemistry between Stark and Potts because, again, they gave it time to develop. We do see some history here with Strange and his ex-love interest Christine Palmer but I didn't feel any emotions when he insults her because that is what he has always done and says sorry when he realizes that he has been a dick all the while.<br/><br/>There was just too much going on with the plot too. Instead of the film makers taking time to develop the characters and just sticking to one world-disaster waiting to happen, they just zipped past the jerk-turned- superhero-saves-the-world bit. You see, some of the other superheros are more common, I mean most people would know the stories of Superman or Iron Man or Avengers. But Doctor Strange, they needed more of a back story. Not exposition, of where there was just too much in the movie.<br/><br/>And what was Tilda Swinton doing in the movie? They could have at-least taken an Asian as the ancient one. Don't even get me started on Chiwetel Ejiofor and his role in the movie. He just looked gave up too easily being the Master and all.<br/><br/>I could just go on and on about it but I will stop.<br/><br/>Folks, I don't have anything against the actors, I think they did what they were asked to and they did it to the best of their abilities - I blame the greedy studios, trying to make another superhero movie just to fit the MIU. This could have been great, memorable even, if they had just given it time.<br/><br/>I think the only memorable thing in the movie was Benedict Wong as Wong. Lol, he was funny."

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","5","12","29 October 2016"," Well-balanced between conventional and outlandish
","Rockstar neurosurgeon mister, sorry, doctor, Stephen Strange(perfectly cast Cumberbatch, embodying both the early arrogance and the mature respect) comes out of a car crash with his hands as destroyed as a PG-13 rating will allow. Western medicine simply can't do more than it has. So he finds himself in Kathmandu, in a temple, finding out that magic is real, as well as a huge world of its own. As he becomes more familiar with it, so do we, without it ever losing the ""wow"" factor. By the climax, when numerous different kinds of powers are wielded on both sides, we understand the core rules of every single one. This sets a new standard for how well-handled and, yes, accessible, a big budget fantasy tale can be, even if it's not a household name. It's not always that self-assured. Friend, not love, Christine(McAdams, sweet, charming, and actually a presence in spite of the limited screen time) is essentially nothing more than a studio note that ends in an underlined ""if not, it gets too weird"". This borrows from The Matrix, Inception, and the continually expanding and exciting(we will see Benedict again *very* soon!) MCU's most played card, Iron Man. But it makes it all work.<br/><br/>They couldn't have picked a better hand than Derrickson's. He handles the action incredibly well. Yes, as an origin story, the middle doesn't have a lot, and the opening is fairly brief, giving us a taste of what we'll later bathe in. On the whole, it is plentiful, no sequence is ever so short it doesn't properly register, it looks and feels like nothing we've seen before, even if it has pieces that are recognizable. A gritty reality being invaded by increasingly strong supernatural forces – and the fact that he did Sinister, as well, is evident in some gruesome material. I can just hear the pitch now, opening as I'm sure it did with ""the film will just about open with a brutal accident so bad that it leaves the lead partially handicapped for most of it"".<br/><br/>The door has been opened. The multiverse is upon us. It's glorious. Colorful, with tremendous depth(watch it in 3D!), unforgettable, psychedelic, amazing. We don't spend a lot of time out there – this *is* the first, pardon the pun, trip. It's enough to satisfy, and we'll explore further, with the success this will have – oh, on that... trust me. Going in blind? Think ""comics"" mean Dilbert and Garfield? Go, see it. You'll love it. This is quippy, quotable and quick. Everyone gets to be funny, several times over. Characters stick with you. Loki and Ultron are joined in the ""memorable, cool villain"" club by Kaecilius, distracting Danish accent(he's my countryman – I get to make fun of it) and all.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone possessing eyes, ears and a base understanding of the English language. What are you doing still reading this? You could be in the mirror dimension, meeting Dormammu or teleporting across the globe right now! Don't know what that even means? You could, in a mere 103 minutes! 10/10"

","It's what the MCU has been known for and that's delivering characters we care about. Yes, the powers and action is usually very cool but without texture and depth, would it matter? <br/><br/>Just look at the other big budget films this year. The reason most of them fell flat (BvS, Suicide Squad, ID Resurgence, Star Trek Beyond) is because every one of them delivered shallow lead characters that didn't connect emotionally with the audience. They were all written poorly. It's clear that in each case the action beats were written before the actual story and then pieced in to a sloppy script. With Marvel, it's clear that story and character comes first. Then, they unleash FX teams that are second to none. <br/><br/>The case with Doctor Strange may be an all-time bench mark because while nailing the depth they went above and beyond in terms of visuals. What hits the screen is all-time amazing and will certainly earn many an award. Still, without character depth, it wouldn't mean as much. Kudos to Marvel for delivering another masterpiece. <br/><br/>I can't wait to see it again."

Hopefully, Hollywood realizes that THIS is the way to make an action movie, and we see more of the same in the future.<br/><br/>Take the best of Deadpool, the best of Guardians of the Galaxy, the best of Iron Man (and its spin offs), and add professional quality acting by many great actors, with some exceptional graphics (inception level), and an excellent script, and top that off with extremely good direction, casting, sound, editing and production - and you have the latest generation of action movie = Dr Strange. Never before in an action movie has there been such a depth of quality in all of those aspects and for it all to come together so brilliantly into the one modern action movie - unbelievable. In my opinion the direction of Scott Derrickson has come of age in one giant leap.<br/><br/>Sure, there have been some very good 'one/two man' action movies in the past, but this one provides a complex platform for several great actors to perform their stuff at the same time - and they all deliver. Any movie with 'big' roles for Chiwetel Ejiofor and Tilda Swinton is going to be good, but this one adds Mads Mikkelsen as the 'villian', and Benedict Cumberbatch as the 'hero' - awesome !!! But then add solid roles for Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Benjamin Bratt, Michael Stuhlbarg, and the emerging Linda Louise Duan, and you have the basis for a serious film - let alone an 'action flick'.

","Benedict Cumberbatch looks stuck in a particular kind of a role. He is forever playing the role of a genius egotist who has to save the world. When I saw 'The Imitation Game' I gave him the benefit of the doubt and now it's the same thing all over again. The movie follows a fairly predictable path of evolution as we see him making wisecracks at his colleagues and then falling at the hands of his own arrogance. Here again, his portrayal of a genius egotistical eccentric doctor reminds me a lot of Dr House from the TV show House MD. As he enters the world of metaphysical voodoo of inter- dimensional travel, the story starts to make a lot less sense. The little jokes in between were of some relief in the tiresome spiralling of the plot as we chased the camera down to time travelling forces having the one and the only motive of 'destroying earth'. The special effects are amazing in this one. I really liked the cape though; thought it had some personality which neither the story nor the characters had. Even the rogue wizard turned out to be an expressionless fall guy. The villains could have done with some more panache. I think that holds for the film as a whole as well.<br/><br/>Overall, a very average action flick with cool graphics."

","Dr. Strange is well-acted and visually stunning, but this adds to the frustrating experience of the film. Marvel has certainly found a formula that works, but that formula is all too apparent in this disappointing film. Intriguing - even meaningful - ideas and discussions about the nature of existence and human purpose are lost in a cacophony of special effects and tired tropes.<br/><br/>Early on Stephen Strange is told that the only way he will master the mystic arts is the same way he mastered the medical arts: years of study and practice. A few short days later he is winning battles against enemies that his masters have been unable to defeat.<br/><br/>The mystic ability to travel and channel energy through multiple dimensions of reality is reduced to the too often repeated effect of rolling visually reality from one perspective to another. The effect which appeared exciting in trailers was repeated over and over in the movie without ever being connected to the internal reality of the movie including the multiple dimensions that were so often mentioned and so little used. <br/><br/>In the end we are left with stunning visual effects supporting the tired trope of a neophyte showing that his ""passion"" is more significant than the experience and wisdom of his elders: the partially trained Jedi Luke Skywalker somehow defeats the greatest Sith Lords in history...again."

Basically in Kathmandu, Nepal, the sorcerer Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and his zealots have entered the secret compound Kamar-Taj, which contains ancient and mystical texts, murdered the librarian, and stolen a ritual from a book belonging to sorcerer the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), he is able to escape with some of his followers. Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is an arrogant but highly qualified and acclaimed neurosurgeon, until he has a horrific car accident, he loses the use of his hands, his colleague and former lover Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) wants to help him move on, but Strange believes he can find a way to regain the use of his hands. Strange has become vain using all his resources to pursue experimental surgeries and healing processes, all without success, then he learns about Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt), a paraplegic who mysteriously regained the ability to walk, he seeks out and is directed to Kamar-Taj. There Strange is taken in by sorcerer Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the Ancient One was his teacher, she meets Strange and shows him her power, the astral plane and other dimensions, including the Mirror Dimension, he begs her to teach him, she eventually agrees, despite being reminded of her former student Kaecilius, who was also arrogant. Under the Ancient One and Mordo, Strange begins his tutelage, learning from ancient books in the library, now presided over by the master Wong (Benedict Wong). Strange learns Earth is protected from other dimensions by a spell formed from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London and Hong Kong, the sorcerers are tasked with protecting them, but Pangborn gave up the responsibility and channelled mystical energy into walking again. Over several months Strange has advanced quickly, even secretly reading the text stolen by Kaecilius, revealed to be The Book of Cagliostro, and learning to bend time with mystical Eye of Agamotto, Mondo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, comparing his arrogance and yearning for power to Kaecilius. Kaecilius and his followers use the stolen pages to summon the powerful Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time does not exist and all can live forever, the London Sanctum is destroyed, Strange is sent to the New York Sanctum, zealots attack, Strange holds them off with the mystical Cloak of Levitation. Mordo and the Ancient One arrive, but Strange and Mordo are disillusioned when Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One has used Dormammu's power to preserve her long life, she is mortally wounded by Kaecilius before he escapes to Hong Kong, the Ancient One tells Strange he will have to break the rules to stop the destruction, she then dies, despite the efforts of Strange and a bewildered Palmer. Arriving in Hong Kong, Strange Mondo find Wong dead and the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension has already engulfed Earth, Strange uses the Eye to reverse time to save the Sanctum and Wong, he then travels to the Dark Dimension to confront Dormammu. Strange tries to bargain with Dormammu to end his destruction of Earth, but the evil entity kills him, however the same moment repeats, Strange reveals he has placed himself and Dormammu in an infinite time loop, they will trapped forever until he agrees to a bargain, eventually after various repeats, and Strange killed various times, Dormammu is told the time loop will end he leaves Earth, taking Kaecilius and the zealots with him. In the end Dormammu and his forces depart, Mordo also departs, disgusted by Strange and the Ancient One's disregard for the consequences of defying nature, Strange returns the Eye, also known as the Infinity Stone, then takes residence at the New York Sanctum to continue his studies. During the credits, Strange is seen meeting with Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who has brought Loki to Earth to search for their father Odin, Strange agrees to help with the search; after the credits Mordo visits Pangborn and steals his energy used for walking, stating Earth has too many sorcerers. Also starring Michael Stuhlbarg as Dr. Nicodemus West, Scott Adkins as Lucian / Strong Zealot, Meera Syal as Dr. Patel and Stan Lee as Man on Bus. Cumberbatch is the perfect choice as the leading superhero who has the career-ending accident but then becomes a powerful time travelling and wielding mystical energy, supporting cast members Swinton, Ejiofor, Mikkelsen and Wong are suited to their parts as well. This works as a fantastic origins story for the hero with the recognisable name and costume, the story is enthralling and has plenty of exciting action sequences, there are good moments of humour, but more than anything it is an excellent display of visually stunning special effects to bring superpower abilities to life and see skyscrapers and cities being rotated and turned inside out, a superb fantasy adventure and superhero movie. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Production Design, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"

","MCU's 14th installment in the form of magic and mysticism is something I had waited for since the start of MCU itself. Finally watching it coming to life on screen and that too by a wonderful performer by Benedict Cumberbatch himself is more than something to bargain. Doctor Strange is a visual treat for both Marvel fans and movie going fans alike. The 3D VFX throughout the movie is top notch and director Scott Derrickson just nails his way of weaving a story-line with a new villain named Kaecilius. To many, this villain may be underrated but once you pick up a Doctor Strange Prelude comic, you may actually know the back story of Kaecilius and his purpose of taking the dark side. Tilda, being an amazing actress herself, playing The Ancient One is a delight. I love the fact that Marvel is overstepping the borders of gender equality and racism stuffs. No Asian male, this time, it's a white woman with no hair, with a title ""THE ANCIENT ONE"". Yes, I dig it! As usual, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo is fantastic. Watching Chiwetel and Cumberbatch together after 12 Year A Slave is wonderful. Mordo's story arc is a solid way of portraying a future villain in future sequels. Personally, I have no issue with Benedict's accent as many others, it's absolutely great to watch him on screen and that too with so much visual effects. It's like Sherlock, but with a ruby red Cloak Of Levitation, a french cut and some mystical stuffs. My verdict - Go watch it in IMAX 3D and experience a mind-tripping movie."

","The Marvel machine thunders on with Doctor Strange, which stars an always-fantastic Benedict Cumberbatch as a surgeon/sorcerer, learning from Tilda Swinton and Chiwetel Ejiofor, whilst the threat of Mads Mikkelsen looms. It's clear early on that Doctor Strange is standard Marvel fare, yet it remains a fun film nevertheless and is worth a look. <br/><br/>Though it's expected of a Marvel film by now, the acting is spot-on. Cumberbatch channels his Sherlock portraying the arrogant and cocky Strange, whilst Benedict Wong is a stand-out in the supporting cast. It makes for a good watch when the cast has such effortless chemistry, and the witty repartee between characters is helped by a script which often fizzes along merrily. <br/><br/>Beyond the acting, the visuals are a highlight - notably, Strange's first introduction to the spiritual world is an eye-popping spectacle which evokes the art of Salvador Dali, the music of David Bowie, and the Moonmen song from Rick and Morty. Furthermore, the action sequences manage to show off some interesting visual feats, with city-bending, kaleidoscopic scenery making for some fun scenes.<br/><br/>Though this formula is undeniably entertaining, this film just will not stick long in the memory and is not something I'll ever re-watch, nor does it have any particular fantastic scene which stood out. Mikkelsen offers glimpses of being more than a standard forgettable Marvel villain, at one point making Strange question his allegiances, but only briefly. Overall the case is that there simply isn't enough time devoted to character development (Rachel McAdams is particularly shafted in this department) due to the high amount of world-building required of this film.<br/><br/>It's hard to muster much excitement for such planned, corporate-approved films, and it's especially disappointing to see great directors stifled by the conglomerate's cinematic universe machine, such as Taika Waititi, fantastic at the head of What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, whose Thor: Ragnarok next year (which is teased in Doctor Strange) will surely be indistinguishable from the rest. <br/><br/>But you may as well watch this stuff anyways; it's still a decent and fun way to spend two hours if you're alright to unhook the brain for a bit. 64/100."

","Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is one of the most successful neurosurgeons in the world, he care a lot about is job, but he is also an arrogant individual, with an enormous ego. When an almost fatal car accident deprives him of the use of his hands, Strange, left with no other opportunities, embarks on journey to Asia to find out about one mysterious method a man told him about with which he regained the use of his back after a paralysis, yet there might be more to what he initially set out to do.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange has been one of the most enduring and interesting Marvel Characters for the past fifty years, taking part in almost every crossover story line in a key role. Marvel here had the gargantuan task of condensing the iconic origin story and paying homage to the fifty years of lore in a single feature. Whilst the film doesn't quite manage to establish its world both singularly and as a part of the MCU, Marvel has yet delivered another flick full of fun, wonder and rich characters.<br/><br/>What is remarkable about these films is to see how Marvel, even after all this time, is able to put out a product that first and foremost is about the filmmaking behind it and even more admirable is how this product always ends up being good. You always feel the effort of every single crew member and that is something really rare to find, it is such a pleasure and such a joy to see that the most successful studio of our times is driven firstly by passion and the will to tell good stories, it is something that always transpires through to the audience and it is the reason why even with this film, which has its number of flaws, there is just a sense of great fun and storytelling that give all of these films an effortless engagement with the viewer.<br/><br/>Whilst it could have been cool to see a little more of the horror sensibilities, Scott Derrickson did a great job in bringing this tale to life. The casting first and foremost is pitch perfect. Mads Mikkelsen might not be given lots to do (that being due to story problems), but Cumberbatch shines high and owns the role from the first to the last frame, his addition to this universe is more than welcome. Yet, the stand out here is clearly Tilda Swinton as the ancient one: this is ideal casting and the way Swinton brings the role to life is magical, she gives a touching performance with a real edge to it, that surprised me as much as I appreciated it: every second with her on screen was gold.<br/><br/>Moreover the film does have quite some visual spectacle to spare and whilst I thought the action sequences were decent at best, the visual imagery employed in them was absolutely breathtaking and more than that, the non-action parts where Strange is catapulted in other dimensions during training were the best ones, with truly inventive visuals and flawless special effects.<br/><br/>Whilst I'll explain later why I find the script to be quite messy from a world building point of view, which ultimately undermines a lot of the story, I also can say that a great part of it was really well written, with edgy comedy, great character development and a very fluent narrative with essential plot. Moreover, the film has a fantastic sense of discovery engraved in it, you want to know more and more just like Strange does and it makes for a very gratifying experience to be taken on.<br/><br/>As I said, the film has quite a number of flaws and whilst as the movie went on, I was never taken out of the flow or the excitement, it is frustrating to see that this could have been a much better film. Sloppy pacing, anticlimactic finale, weak villain and poor logic are all problems the film has and I believe that they can all be traced back to one single problem core flaw: mythology. There is just too murky of a world building going on, the mythology does not manage to establish itself to the audience in a rational and logical way and you are left with more questions than answers. I am the first one to say than not everything needs to be explained, what film needs is simply a rational understanding of the inner workings of the world and you are never given that. Not even with my comic book knowledge I managed to understand how all of this fitted. There are many expositions scenes and I love an exposition scene when it is done good: when the character wants to discover as much as the audience, yet the filmmakers commit a mistake in using these scenes just to spit out a train of information, without organizing it and without giving an overall sense to the world.<br/><br/>However, this is getting a little too nerdy, ""Doctor Strange"" is a great addition to the Marvel canon, I want to see more from this character and that is a sign that overall the film just was a great ride and a incredibly fun experience to have."
"TheMovieDiorama","7","4","9","27 October 2016"," A strange mystical origin story, but way too formulaic.
","The next new character to be introduced to the MCU, Doctor Strange is about neurosurgeon Stephen Strange who has a fatal car accident only to resort to learning about mysticism in order to save himself...but little does he know he is involved in a much bigger threat. Some of you know, that this is my most anticipated film of the year. I've watched the trailers so many times that I probably know them off by heart. Firstly the acting was spot on, Benedict Cumberbatch literally became his character and his American accent was perfect. Tilda Swinton, Rachel McAdams and even the underrated Mads Mikkelsen were all great, I've not seen such a perfect cast for a superhero film. Director Scott Derrickson (who also directed the horrors Sinister and the underrated Deliver Us From Evil) is confident taking on a franchise movie and is particularly interesting to see how he has transitioned so well from horror to fantasy. The visual effects are outstanding, obviously this film will remind people of Inception, but what this film was able to achieve was such a high level of imagination and technical excellence that really takes the viewer into the world on the screen. There is one great scene that reminded me of MC Escher where the camera pans around and creates the illusion of an isometric view, mind you that whole act was great. The script was funny and witty which is what one would expect from a Marvel studio film, we have to remember that this behemoth of a studio know exactly what they are doing now and can make origin films constantly. That is where the problem lies. This film is so formulaic that it borderlines on boring, I literally at a point wanted this film to get going and do something different but alas it did not. One of my friends told me ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"" in which to my reply was ""it will eventually get broken if something doesn't change"". Some of the visual effects for the humans during fight scenes were done poorly and did take me out of the film slightly. The villain played by Mads Mikkelsen was weak and once again forgettable which really irritated me because he is such a waste of talent on this, why can't these films have better villains? (I shan't spoil it but there is another villain in which I did not like this interpretation of). Also a lot of the fight scenes were choppily edited and filmed which was a shame. Overall, Doctor Strange will satisfy fans with its great cast, witty script and sublime VFX but ultimately it's just another formulaic origin story that borderlines on boring. Slightly disappointing.<br/><br/><ul><li>Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</li></ul>"

","Went to see this movie at the Leeds/Bradford Odeon with my husband, son and son's friend last night.<br/><br/>In this Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Deliver us from Evil) directed and written (with Jon Spaihts: Prometheus, Passengers and C. Robert Cargill: Sinister, Sinister 2) film, from the comic book character by Steve Ditko, Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock, The Imitation Game) stars as Doctor Stephen Strange the brilliant but arrogant former neurosurgeon.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams (Mean Girls, About Time) is his former girlfriend Christine Palmer, who finally tires of his wallowing cruelty following the accident that robs him of his surgeons hands. By chance he hears of a former physiotherapy patient who walked again following a seemingly incurable back injury, so he decides to find out more. This leads him to Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt: Clear and Present Danger, Demolition Man) who tells him to seek Kamar-Taj and The Ancient One who can open his mind to unknown mysteries of the universe that could be the answer he is seeking.<br/><br/>Once there, Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor: 12 Years a Slave, Children of Men) takes him to The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton: The Chronicles of Narnia, We need to talk about Kevin) who can begin his magical education.<br/><br/>Strange's arrogance still has not left him though, so he distracts Wong (Benedict Wong: The Martian, Moon) from his post in the library and reads a forbidden text which leads him to the enemy, Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen: Casino Royale, Hannibal), and he must choose between his new life and his old.<br/><br/>This film had so much fantasy action it made the head spin. Brilliant effects reminiscent of The Matrix and Inception, coupled with fantastic action and a good story. It also had a believable villain (though a tad underused) and set pieces of fighting/imagery that pulled you into the fantasy world and didn't let go.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch was a strong lead and even though we felt he was channelling House MD, his arrogance did not tip over into being unlikeable (a fine line Marvel treads well, e.g. Iron Man), therefore we really cared about his character. The one liners that were trickled in helped to ground the movie and the odd nod to the wider Marvel Universe never hurts. Swinton was spot on as The Ancient One (despite fandom having a problem with her casting when it was announced, I think she convinced as the powerful yet flawed mystic) and it was great to have a strong female lead that got so much screen time. Sadly, the same could not be said for McAdams who though wasn't the romantic interest as such (Strange and Palmer had broken up), she did feel like a bit of a thinner character that the rest, which was a shame as she was clearly more than capable of just chemistry and laughs. Ejiofor was also outstanding (again a casting against character like Swinton), as were Wong and Mikkelsen, who unfortunately also suffered from lack of screen time, ditto the rest of the henchmen, but these are small problems when you take the film as a whole.<br/><br/>The real heart of the film is the dynamic between Cumberbatch and Swinton and the scenes where they are together, resonate and fill you with anticipation for how the rest of the Marvel Universe characters (Superheroes and Gods) might fare against, or teamed with, Strange.<br/><br/>A visual feast (which I am sure would only be enhanced watching it in 3D) and leaves me wanting more, roll on the Doctor Strange franchise.<br/><br/>There are two credit scenes, so be sure to stay right until the end and don't worry about keeping your eyes peeled for the Stan Lee cameo, it feels so crammed in it nearly takes you out of the action of the film.<br/><br/>Matrix meets Inception with House MD 9/10"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In this latest Marvel adaptation, brilliant but arrogant surgeon Dr Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is involved in a car crash, and loses the senses in his hands. In order to find out the secret behind his recovery, he travels to Kathmandu, Nepal, where he meets The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor.) Whereas the Avengers fight their enemies with force, this is a group that harnesses their inner power beyond the mortal world, in order to defeat Kaerilius (Mads Mikkelson) and stop his plan to destroy the natural world and its order.<br/><br/>The latest origin story in the Marvel juggernaut stands alone, and marks a shift in approach to the traditional superhero persona. While it's as laden with dazzling visual effects and set pieces as the usual fare, DS seems to revolve around a more cerebral bend than the smash and bash antics of Spider-Man, Iron Man and the like. Strange is a character in his own right, on his own mission, and who better than current man of the moment Cumberbatch to play him, which he does very well, embodying the lead character in every inch as, reliably, do co stars Swinton and Ejiofor.<br/><br/>As entertaining as they are, too many of these superhero films nowadays get weighed down in endless back story, dragging proceedings on for longer than they really need to, especially the 'origin' stories. So it's to the films credit that it's nice and short, delivering the goods without over-whelming the audience. Like the best of them, it also has a neat sense of humour and keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek. The special effects and action sequences are also amazing, dazzling and colourful. The problem is, the story just isn't interesting or compelling enough, and it's impossible to care about the characters or their motivations enough to get engaged with it. And that, sadly, is a big problem.<br/><br/>The end impression you take away from the film is one of pity. It has everything fundamentally going right for it, it's just what's on the surface that lets it down. Maybe they'll get it right with the next film. **"

","So this drivel is what passes for a ""good"" movie nowadays... sad. I don't remember the last time I saw a great Marvel movie, and this is no exception.<br/><br/>Someone apparently thought that making the main character an egotistical, arrogant, obnoxious, stuck-up snob was a good idea. I suppose there's a change of heart somewhere in the movie where (how original! we've never seen that before), to the ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" of the audience, he realizes the error of his ways and turns into mr. compassionate nice guy, but I missed it. He's a jerk throughout the movie. 0 for 1 so far.<br/><br/>The bad guy has the acting skills of a cardboard box. He has about ten lines in the entire movie, which is a good thing as his English is atrocious. So nothing interesting in the villain department either. 0 for 2.<br/><br/>Plot then, perhaps? Mmmkay... let's see. Evil bad guy steals pages from the Book of Doom (TM), which oddly enough openly sits in the library of the good guys, because they're gullible fools who blindly trust everyone who enters their monastery, which oddly enough sits in the middle of Nepal yet is populated exclusively by westerners and one or two token Asians. Evil guy wants to then summon the Demon of Doom (TM) who will give him immortality. Good guys have to stop him. Wow! What a breath of fresh air! Sigh. 0 for 3. Actually, if you count the absolutely dreadful and forced romantic relationship, 0 for 4.<br/><br/>Finally, SFX? Err... other than some walls folding in on themselves (it appears that's the only spells these guys can cast), a Demon of Doom so bad it almost verges on comedy, and a gate spell that's used every 2 minutes and which looks like a kid waving a sparkle stick, nothing either.<br/><br/>Trite, hackneyed junk.

"vav-61764","8","3","6","26 November 2016"," Doctor Strange Review
","Doctor Stranger is the newest hero featured on the MCU. A hero quite out of the mainstream, a bit like Guardians of the Galaxy, to soften this lack of knowledge of the hero by the general public, Benedict Cumberbatch's choice to play the hero was clever, bringing a face known by the audience to not so popular character out of the comics. Doctor Strange closely resembles the first Iron Man (2008) and follows a formula that is present in most MCU films.<br/><br/>This formula has its positives and negatives, because it is a film with a stratospheric budget, to attract more public, whether they're men or women, children or adults, the film does not risk with a complex story. Not that the formula is bad, Doctor Strange is a good movie with an exciting and enjoyable story, the end has a very clever and different approach from others Marvel movies and it's not a surprise that it has already earned more than $ 500 million so far. The problem is that this focus on pleasing as many people as possible limits the process of creating the script and what it could exploit to not only create a fun movie for the whole family. Even more so, because the character, Stephen Strange, is an interesting and mystical character who travels through other dimensions, the possibilities were innumerable.<br/><br/>The look of the film is fantastic, the scenes in other dimensions and those that change the reality are beautiful and Doctor Strange is one of the few films that 3D technology brings a differential, especially in these scenes. One problem I have is one scene that graphical computing fails a lot, it's very noticeable the use of the visual effects and as the scene differs a lot to the rest, it makes the error jump to the eyes. Humor is another positive aspect, the jokes are good, they have a good timing and aren't very childish. <br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect in the role, he almost instantly acquires the sympathy of the public, besides of being able to convey the emotions that the character is going through with realism. However, there is no denying the similarity between the story of Stephen Strange and Tony Stark's story in the first Iron Man. Tilda Hilton as ""The Ancient One"" and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo have a lead role in the plot and are great, especially Hilton with all the mystery of her character in relation to her past. Christine Palmer is played by Rachel McAdams, the choice to not build a cheesy and very sentimental relationship between her and Strange was right, because it would create a certain blurring in the plot and choosing to develop a realistic relationship, brought a realism to the film. The villain, Kaecilius, played by Mads Mikkelsen, suffers from what many of the villains in the Marvel movies suffer, lack of depth and character development, which makes the villain disposable and his actions not so shocking. The work of the actor was very good, and not surprising, Mikkelsen is recognized by several roles as in the Hannibal series and in the Danish film ""Jagten"", however, the film has no desire to complex the character."
"dromasca","5","3","6","25 November 2016"," 3D confusion
","The genre of movies inspired by comics books seems to be one of the safest bets in Hollywood nowadays. It attracts stars and talents, and sometimes the results are brilliant. This is not the case with Doctor Strange, a film that tries to be different that the norm, but lacks in my opinion emotion and relies to a very large extent on special effects and the stars involved in the cast. Do they however get the roles they deserve? I love all work that I have seen until now by Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton, but to a large extent I feel that their talent was wasted here.<br/><br/>Script author and director Scott Derrickson specializes in films that combine reality and super-natural. This is the case with 'Doctor Strange' which is conceived as a fantasy combination between comics super-heroes and oriental philosophy or better said oriental mysticism. Unfortunately the whole 'philosophy' behind the film which is supposed to get the upper hand over the 'materialistic' and scientific is just cheap comics level phraseology. At first the combination hits the ridicule, later, with the repetition it becomes simply boring, so it did not work for me not even at the entertainment level. Also, for someone who did not read any of the original comics series some of the details and characters remain obscure - for example there are two level of 'bad guys' - one is more physical, the other more, let us say 'meta-physical' - I could not understand the relations between the two. There may be a full mythology developed in the comics series behind, but it stood hidden from me as just a film viewer.<br/><br/>With the text being so thin, much is left to the visual part, which is certainly nothing less than impressing. The special effects of the alternate worlds are spectacular and will probably enter the contest for the Academy Awards in the technical categories (but have we not seen many of these already in 'Inception'?) I have seen the 3D version which could have benefited from more light, but this may have been the problem of the cinema theater I saw the movie in.<br/><br/>The cast is impressing. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers the expected but his intensity seems wasted because of the pseudo-philosophical text, and his conversion from scientist to mystic arts master is not very credible. This is leaving to Tilda Swinton the best role in the film, another proof of her talent to build highly original composition characters. She is a strong contender in the supporting role competition at the Oscars. Yet, despite the visuals and the acting I could not avoid the feeling of confusion and lack of substance of the whole film. At the end of the film I felt like after one of these glamorous theater shows on Broadway where a lot of talent and effort (and money) are invested with little artistic or emotional return."

"caseynicholson","7","3","6","15 November 2016"," A Well Made Superhero Film--But an Overused Formula
","I was happy to get to go see ""Doctor Strange"" this week, after hearing good things about it both from comic book enthusiasts and several friends with kids who are not as much of a geek as I am. That said, I went into the movie with high expectations. And while the movie was good overall, I walked away not having my expectations quite met.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good. There is indeed much to like about ""Doctor Strange"". The film gives a healthy helping of back story, fleshing out a character that I myself didn't know too much about, despite having read some of his earliest appearances from the Stan Lee silver age era in the 1960's. By and large the film is pretty solid in the storytelling department, and the actors all turn out strong performances.<br/><br/>That said, the downside to this movie is that it uses a banal superhero movie formula that at this point has come to feel quite trite. Super-rich, super-smart white guy gets some super-powers, there's a bad guy, the bad guy is hellbent on destroying the universe (the dimension?) and, golly gee, in the end the superhero saves the day.<br/><br/>OK, so it's a little more nuanced than that. Still, it just felt like it was a movie that was made on a cookie cutter formula. It's far from a bad movie, but there are others quite like it--and perhaps others that do what it does, only better.<br/><br/>All that said, I have to go with 7/10 stars for this one."
"fredschaefer-406-623204","8","3","6","12 November 2016"," A great debut for the Sorcerer Supreme.
","As a long time Marvel comics reader, there was no way I was going to miss DOCTOR STRANGE when it came out in the theaters and I can honestly say it is one of the their better adaptations, avoiding some of the things which irked so many fans in other movies, especially when the original material is tweaked for 21st Century audiences. I am happy to say that this movie does right by the character originally created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko back in the 60's and gives the Sorcerer Supreme a proper big screen debut.<br/><br/>The plot: Essentially this is an origin story, which usually means a callow protagonist undergoes some traumatic metamorphosis, usually by way of a seemingly freak accident and emerges a super hero endowed with powers that they will then use to protect the world from some equally endowed evil entity. For teenage Peter Parker, it was being bitten by a radioactive spider; for physicist Bruce Banner, it was being dowsed with Gamma rays; and thus we got Spider Man and The Hulk. For brilliant and arrogant surgeon Stephen Strange, the transformation comes by way of an auto accident which results in severe nerve damage to his hands, resulting in the loss of his surgical skills and ultimately sending him on a desperate journey to Nepal, where he meets The Ancient One, who teaches him the mystical skills that will make him a Sorcerer Supreme, but not before Strange must learn to get over himself and past his ego. We've seen this before many times, but sometimes it is not the story, but how well it is told, and DOCTOR STRANGE goes through its well trod paces well.<br/><br/>The villain: This can be a problem, because if you don't have a good antagonist for the hero, the energy just goes right out of the movie, a good example would be SUICIDE SQUAD, but that's DC and they have a more than a few problems. Here the bad guy is Kacilious, a former pupil of The Ancient One, who out of grief for the loss of his loved ones, is determined to use sorcery to grant everyone immortality, even if it means giving the earth over to the typical ""dark realm"" governed by Dorammamu, a Big Bad evil entity. Kacilious, the former pupil gone bad, may be a character we've seen many times before and one very familiar to comic book readers, but proves adequate for the job here. And Strange's confrontation with Doramanmu is a nice diversion from the usual fight to death with the hero triumphant in the end climax we are used to in these movies.<br/><br/>The cast: Marvel has a knack for getting just the right actors starting with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and in Benedict Cumberbatch, they have found the perfect Stephen Strange. The man goes from arrogant to humble to selfless heroism in the course of the movie and never misses a beat, we always believe he is real in whatever scene he's in. Kacillious might be a cipher in the script, but actor Mads Mikkelsen brings so much to the role, we instantly believe this guy is a threat, building on the performances he gave in CASINO ROYALE and TV's HANNIBAL. If an Asian actor had been cast as the Ancient One, it would have been a cliché, but a bald Tilda Swinton makes the character memorable as a mentor with a dark secret. Other roles go to Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Benjamin Bratt and action star, Scott Adkins, who plays one of Kacilious's disciples who gives Strange a hard time in one of the movie's best set piece action scenes.<br/><br/>The special effects: They can best be described as ""INCEPTION on acid,"" as cityscapes and buildings turn on their sides and turn all the way upside down as characters scramble and fight across them. It might have seemed daunting to recreate the other worldly and psychedelic aspects of the comic in its original classic run, but this movie does a very good job of it; while also giving us a unique look to this world of magic, as opposed to Harry Potter's world. At its best, DOCTOR STRANGE is has a look and feel unlike any other Marvel movie so far, and that is all to the good.<br/><br/>The after credits scenes set things up for Stephen Strange's appearance in the next Thor movie with a meeting with the Norse God of Thunder, while the other one gives us a peak at the next stand alone adventure of the Sorcerer Supreme, where he will likely square off with a former ally. Hopefully this one will be to Doctor Strange what WINTER SOLDIER was to Captain America."
"RNMorton","7","3","6","12 November 2016"," Okay with some mild complaints
","I am a Marvel reader from the 60's, my youngest son is also into the Marvel movies. We had been talking for a good 4 years or so about when they could crank out a Dr. Strange, one of my favorite titles from the 60s. So they finally did it and it wasn't a total disappointment even for a perfectionist like me. Marvel is always spot on in casting, no exception whatsoever with Cumberbatch as the charming but arrogant Dr. Strange. I wasn't as hot on their choice for the Ancient One (male , older, and more passive in the comics), that was a bust. What made Dr. Strange so great was 1) Ditko's drawing of the spells and counterspells, and 2) the strange devices and spells the sorcerers used. So to my list of issues: the first and biggest is the fighting, in the comics it was spells/counterspells, they do a little of that here but it is more ninja stuff. That was my biggest disappointment. Beyond that, my concerns were - Dormammu was one of the scariest villains in comics (flaming head), here they trotted out just another scary face; they played too many plot cards, they could have saved some stuff for the next movie (like Dormammu); and it doesn't always have to be the end of the world. Marvel seems to be gravitating towards putting the entire world at risk, that gets old when it's too often and it isn't needed. If they cleaned this up and worked on the spells more the sequel to this could be a great movie, they've set the table okay. But it could just as easily flop, I'm keeping my fingers crossed."
"TheFirstExecutioner","8","3","6","12 November 2016"," Strange Indeed!
","Doctor Strange is Marvel's 14th addition to the MCU and just like most of the other 13, it is a ton of fun! Doctor Strange is a really entertaining movie and fits in very well with the rest of the MCU. The best part of the movie is that it is very different from your average comic book movie. This takes a very different approach than the other MCU movies, similar to Guardians of the Galaxy.<br/><br/>Just like Robert Downey Jr. with Tony Stark/Iron Man and Hugh Jackman with Wolverine, Benedict Cumberbatch suits the character of Stephen Strange/Doctor Strange perfectly. I really can't imagine any other actor playing the character. He brought the cockiness that the character has, but also the heart that makes you get behind him as a protagonist. Tilda Swinton and Chiwetel Ejiofor are fantastic as the sorcerers who train Doctor Strange. Rachel McAdams is also really good as the ""sort-of-but-not-really"" love interest for the Doc. Mads Mikelson is fine as the villain but underwhelming at the same time because he is not really in the movie that much. <br/><br/>The action sequences are the highlight of this movie because they are literally GROUNDBREAKING. I've never seen anything like this from a superhero movie and it was engrossing to watch. The sorcery and city-bending stuff was amazing, and even better in 3-D. If you want to see this movie, please see it in 3-D. <br/><br/>The first and second acts of the film are very strong, showing how the neurosurgeon Doctor Strange becomes the sorcerer Doctor Strange and were generally entertaining as we watch him learn to control his powers. They are serious yet also really funny. About 95% of the humor in this movie is actually really funny. However, the third act is where most of my criticisms come from. While the first 2 acts take their time to explore Strange's character and make for a compelling narrative, the third act kind of rushes through for somewhat of an underwhelming finale. The villains in Doctor Strange are not as compelling as a guy like Zemo from Captain America: Civil War and their motivations are again brushed by very quickly. I don't want to sound overly negative but those are my biggest issues with the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Doctor Strange is a highly enjoyable movie with all round outstanding performances, especially from Cumberbatch, and jaw- dropping visuals and action sequences. Director Scott Derrickson and the writers deserve much credit for taking a character not well known and making him an awesome and likable hero on screen. While it is not as good as the best Marvel movies like Civil War, Winter Soldier, or even The Avengers, it is still a really fun time at the theater and worth seeing. Please go out and see this movie in 3-D!<br/><br/>Doctor Strange gets a B+."
"BlackLemonTea","6","3","6","11 November 2016"," Visually stunning movie that still sticks to the Marvel formula
","Doctor Strange is different than most superhero movies through its intricate subject and mindboggling visuals; however the movie fails to overcome its reputation as ""just another superhero movie in the Marvel universe"".<br/><br/>But before I discuss that, let me explain why the movie still makes the top 3 of best Marvel movies (because I do think that Marvel has the ability to create entertaining movies). To begin with, the visual style of ""Doctor Strange"" was epic. It had something Inception-esque to it. This aspect really brought something different to the universe and made the cinematic experience for the audience phenomenal. I think this is the movie's biggest strength. On a further note, the 3-D effects worked very well. I was very skeptical of watching Doctor Strange in 3-D because usually movies do not tend to use the full potential of this technology, but to my surprise it was far better than I expected and there were some cool scenes in which the 3-D was used perfectly.<br/><br/>I loved Benedict Cumberbatch. He performed his role in a brilliant manner and was definitely key to the success of this film. I don't want to spoil too much, but I can assure you that he nailed his role and the casting choice was brilliant.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I was really surprised by the movie's score. Marvel isn't popular for their use of music, but in Doctor Strange it's different. This gives the movie a certain ""uniqueness"". I loved it. However, I have a couple of negative aspects to mention. Let's start with the story. For me, the exposition was too long. Origin stories can be a lot of fun, but for my taste they spent too much time explaining Doctor Strange's background. I was also unimpressed by the inciting incident which seemed a bit too random to me. <br/><br/>Many people keep saying that Marvel solved the ""bad villain problem"". I disagree. The villain in Doctor Strange was yet another underdeveloped cliché enemy without clear intentions. (Mads Mikkelsen with a good performance though)<br/><br/>Although the fighting scenes were very amusing and looked spectacular, they became repetitive after some time.<br/><br/>To sum it up, Doctor Strange is a visually terrific movie, but still sticks too much to Marvel's formula by using a lot of funny one- liners, stiffly following the same plot patterns and spending less time to explore the depth of the villain. A lot of potential was wasted. But then again, it was finally something different and new compared to the usual superhero movies. ""Doctor Strange"" might not be a revolutionary movie in the industry, but it set its mark as a rather experimental superhero movie in the Marvel universe and perhaps might influence future projects. 7/10"
"souravkt","8","3","6","11 November 2016"," A visual treat more than just being another good marvel movie
","The CGI is so great and it simply made the movie more beautiful (even though it reminded me of inception).And the humor works out really well, and no words to describe Benedict Cumberbatch.<br/><br/>It's another MARVEL MAGIC. It resembles few of the movies of marvel, but isn't a problem at all. This has a different style. <br/><br/>Coming to cumberbatch, it was like, he was born for this character. He gets to that very look of Dr. strange as in the comics. Right now i love him more than Tony stark.<br/><br/>After all, I still think the film was too short. I personally enjoyed the movie."
"MaximumMadness","8","3","6","10 November 2016"," ""Doctor Strange""- Just a ton of fun. It may not be the best of Marvel's filmography, but it's still an undeniably great time.
","Though fundamentally a standard superhero origin story, Marvel's latest offering is another winning entry in the ever-growing saga thanks to its awe-inspiring visuals and direction, fantastic performances and an all- encompassing sense of pure fun that simply cannot be denied. Director Scott Derrickson's ""Doctor Strange"" is pure magic on- screen. While it may occasionally succumb to the old clichés and tropes, this cannot stop the fact that i'ts just a great time at the movies, and another example of Marvel doing what it does best- giving us good, fun films.<br/><br/>Co-written with former Spill.com alum C. Robert Cargill and John Spaihts, Derrickson successfully translates one of Marvel's more colorful and ""out-there"" characters in a very solid and admirable way, grounding the story in the same sort-of tonal aesthetic that ties all of the other films together while simultaneously injecting new elements into the franchise. The result is one of the most wonderfully mind- bending films of the season, and I cannot recommend it enough to audiences looking for a great times at the movies.<br/><br/>We follow Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant surgeon but also an arrogant and deliciously egotistical jerk, who is unfortunately maimed in a terrible car accident one night. With extensive nerve- damage that robs him of his ability to work, he becomes a depressed wreck, eventually seeking out the aid of mystical Eastern healing when all other hope seems lost. He eventually comes across ""The Ancient One"" (Tilda Swinton), an ages-old spiritual leader, who offers to help him learn how to harness the power of mind and spirit to become a real- life sorcerer. However, soon enough, his training will be put to the test, as he must align himself with allies (including Mordo, as played by Chiwetel Ejiofor and former flame Christine, as played by Rachel McAdams) to battle a devious force known as Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), who seeks to bring about an apocalyptic evil force from the dark dimensions beyond our own.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch is just perfect as the good doctor, injecting a wonderful dry wit and a highly entertaining sense of sarcasm while also still being able to ground Strange in a minor sense of tragedy. In a sense, he may initially remind you of Tony Stark back in the original ""Iron Man"" from 2008, but Cumberbatch makes sure to make the role his own without simply delivering a retread of what's come before- this is very much the ""arrogant man learns humility"" story... but it's fresh and unique and Cumberbatch is a joy. Swinton and Ejiofor are fantastic as the teachers who train strange in the art of sorcery and magic, and both add a great sense of class and gravitas to the proceedings. Especially Swinton, who as always plays her role to perfection. Despite having limited screen time, McAdams is great fun as a riff on the idea of the love interest, but with a clever twist- this isn't a story about her and Strange falling in love, but a story about a former couple who slowly learn to forgive each other for their shortcomings. Mads Mikkelsen is an adequately threatening villain, and his presence adds a lot of threat to his sequences, though I cannot comment too much on his role, as, well... much like the other Marvel movies, the villain here is more of an afterthought. Still, Mikkelsen is a good adversary, under-developed though he may be.<br/><br/>The big thing that really sets the film apart is the beautiful visual work and the good sense of pacing and structure. Derrickson, mostly known for his lower-budget work in horror, really pushes the film to (and sometimes beyond) the limit in the best of ways. Along with his co-writers, he crafts a tale that twists boundaries of how we perceive the world and the idea of ""magic."" There's some incredible work done that plays with the idea of multiple dimensions and astral projection that was just incredible to witness, and the well-advertises sequences where the very fabric of the world is bent were mind-blowing. A prolonged chase sequence in the film's second act might have been the single most creative and breathtaking scene of action I've seen since last year's wonderful ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", and shows how digital effects can be properly utilized to show us things we've never seen before. I honestly cannot wait to see it again. <br/><br/>The script is also a blast and it has a great kinetic movement and build. There's never a dull moment, and it keeps the laughs and thrills coming at a mile-a-minute while also giving just enough time to deliver the appropriate beats of character and story development. Though it does start to just hit the standard beats at times, it has such a good sense of personality that made me all the more forgiving for the occasional cliché they had to throw in. There's some good, solid writing here and I hope the team stays on the inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm exceptionally pleased by how well ""Doctor Strange"" turned out. It may not be Marvel's best release and it does occasionally falter with predictable twists and turns, but the good humor, fantastic performances, solid writing and stunning direction more than make up for it. And I can't wait to see more of this character in future films.<br/><br/>I give ""Doctor Strange"" a very good 8 out of 10."
"babygloverbaby","8","3","6","10 November 2016"," Marvel opens its eyes, not its mind
","I'm a big fan of Marvel's formula. Apart from The Incredible Hulk and perhaps Iron Man 2, they've found a winning mix of comedy and spectacle that fits an almost perfect template - story progression, character development, universe building, humour and action. Each film hits all of these points to a greater or lesser degree, and each works on similar terms. None of them are too dark, or too silly (although Ant Man almost falls down on the latter measure), while each is unique enough in its own right.<br/><br/>Spectacle has frequently been where the films have fallen down, and increasingly so as audiences become attuned to the final act carnage that always, always has to end each installment. You can almost see the cogs turning inside Kevin Feige's and each creative team's minds as the series goes on. Big city collapsing? Done. Big city flying and collapsing? Done. Small town being wrecked? Done. Small house being wrecked? Done.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange tells a familiar origin story with a mystical edge, and peppers the cast with so many first rate actors that the inherent silliness of much of the dialogue should pass mostly without annoying an audience not raised on Marvel comics. Humour is a big part of this, and Cumberbatch and Wong in particular have a huge amount of fun entoning the names of Lovecraftian staffs and capes and helmets.<br/><br/>These films are formulaic however, and necessarily so, and that can leave the uninitiated cold. What makes up for the unoriginality of the themes (and some of the action) is the hard work that has gone into realising the mystical world of Doctor Strange. The much discussed first 'trip' into the multiverse is as mind-melting as anything in most art-house cinema, calling to mind The Matrix, Yellow Submarine, Videodrome and Inception all at the same time. It's a bravura sequence that acts as the single unique element of an otherwise by-numbers romp.<br/><br/>Sidenote...<br/><br/>DC seem unable to recreate their own, darker model for their universe. The question of why is much discussed. It's not for the lack of technical and artistic talent being poured into making each picture look good enough. You get the feeling that the messages coming from the very top of their production team are confusing, and while Marvel keeps picking winning, off-the-wall choices to Direct (Derrickson does a perfectly passable job here, and with some brilliant visual touches), DC just keeps picking duds. Either that or there's too much interference from Corporate."

","""Doctor Strange"" is quite a wild ride of whirling color and psychedelia, and borrows heavily from ""Inception"". I enjoyed the character of Dr. Strange--his coming to terms with his disability and the overall processes and challenges of opening his mind to it's endless possibilities. ""The Ancient One"" is quite a character as well, maybe in a future movie her challenges with the dark forces could be examined more. As a big ""Hannibal"" fan it was fun seeing Mads Mikkelson in his role as the rogue student. The other supporting characters are interesting as well. I enjoyed the different locales, especially the mind-blowing final scenes with Strange battling the dark forces.

"themovieparadise","7","3","6","6 November 2016"," Mind-Blowing Visual Effects, But With a Weak Story
","What made this movie was absolutely its visuals. I am not exaggerating at all when I say that they did things in this movie that I had never seen on screen before. You can definitely see influences of The Matrix and Inception in there, but it's ultimately its own thing. If for nothing else, Doctor Strange is worth seeing just for these mind-blowing, incredible special effects that I'm convinced will not only be nominated for an Oscar, but will by far win it. The creativity of the team behind this film shines through its technical brilliance. Not only did they continuously top themselves scene after scene with the level of complication behind these visual feats, but they found ingenious ways to incorporate these effects into the hand-to-hand combat. You could tell every big action set piece was incredibly well thought out and orchestrated. The action is also something we've never seen before, especially in any of the other Marvel movies. The way the filmmakers effortlessly blended the use of magic with the Asian- style fighting choreography was impeccable. Truly amazing to watch on screen. I didn't get to watch this film in IMAX 3D, but I'm planning on seeing it again in theaters, and I'll definitely make sure to check it out in that format..."
"MrILoveTheAnts","6","3","6","6 November 2016"," The Bad Guy Can't Read Until The Good Guy Learns Magic
","This is more like a 6.5 but I just can't give it a 7 because of this glaring plot hole. I don't consider it a spoiler because it's the first scene in the film that just sort of happens and isn't explained. <br/><br/>So the movie opens with a bad guy stealing pages from an ancient book. Okay, fair enough. But then we learn that these are pages that he is incapable of translating because the first half of the movie has yet to happen. See, there aren't any scenes suggesting he can't read them, we're just told that he can't. So we have this bad guy and he doesn't really show up again until close to half way threw the film. This is one scene where he does something in a church but it's not clear what he's doing. It's just a throw away scene to remind the audience there is a bad guy in the movie. <br/><br/>So we're lead to believe that one of the former masters of this school is unable to read or preform the spell written on the pages and it's never explained why. Meanwhile Doctor Strange has to do his thing. He gets in a car accident, looses all hope after numerous surgeries to save his crippled hands. He then turned to eastern medicine, learned about other dimensions, and after living there for a time he finally become a skilled sorcerer. And it's only now that the bad guy gets to do anything to progress the story.<br/><br/>How Much Time Passed? In the comic books Steven Strange spends something 3 years studying the mystic arts. In the film he maybe spends a month or two. We know this because he grows a beard and shaves once (which gets us the iconic hair style so that's good). Also he reads fairly thick books, 4 at a time, multiple times in the film. Though we're told he has a photographic memory so that makes the books hard to judge. Later though he finds the book with the pages torn out of it, (The bad guy was nice enough not steal the whole thing,) I won't say what he does with the book because that would be spoilers, but he's able to read the book which is written in a cryptic language. So he's had time to learn this language. <br/><br/>Again why can't the bad guy read the pages? What is he doing in this time? It's suggested earlier that anyone at this place is allowed to read the forbidden books. Also they have a wifi password. Couldn't he have just taken a picture of the pages with his phone if he has one? None of this makes any sense, and the bad guy isn't in the film enough to answer any of these questions. <br/><br/>Basically the first half of this film needed a rewrite. The stealing of the pages scene should have come later on in the story and been replaced with him being cast out and starting his own cult of followers or something. <br/><br/>The acid trip, ""Inception"" inspired fight scenes with cities twisting inside out and folding over themselves made more sense. These scenes are the highlight of the film where they clearly focused their efforts. <br/><br/>Overall It's not a bad film. It's well acted, the sets were amazing, there is a sound track that's completely forgettable but not bad."
"jonas_bassforce","6","3","6","6 November 2016"," Just a bridge episode
","Probably the biggest reason why I went to see this movie was because I think Benedict Cumberbatch is a great actor and has done some great work the past few years. I didn't know much about the character Doctor Strange but liked a lot of the other Marvel movies, so one with Benedict just had to be great, right? And for sure the acting is absolutely the best part, but as there are some really good actors in this movie they sadly haven't got that much to work with.<br/><br/>For some reason the Marvel movies that only are about a single hero have started to become some sort of bridge episodes between the bigger ""Avengers"" movies and not much more. Just introducing characters without making an interesting enough movie about them. Benedict does what he can with what he's given and he does it very well, but that really doesn't help that the story feels kind of unnecessary. There are two obvious reasons this movie was made: 1. Introduce Doctor Strange into the Marvel universe since he most certainly has got a very crucial role in the coming Infinity War, 2. Introduce one of the remaining Infinity stones so they can make Infinity War at all. <br/><br/>When you think about it this movie feels rushed in production to be able to introduce the characters in time for some bigger event in the Marvel universe. The characters almost has no clear motive of why they do what they do, except maybe Dr. Strange but that's really vague too. The humor is mainly poor (the post credit scene being the funniest of the whole movie, I think says a lot). The CGI isn't that good and makes everything seem either like stolen scenes or ideas from Inception, or like a newly released computer game where the characters are obviously green-screened in.<br/><br/>So why should you watch it? If you follow the whole Marvel universe you kind of have to because there might be key elements introduced here. If you're a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch you probably won't be disappointed, though he has done much better films. And to be fair it's really not that bad but interesting, and somewhat exciting if you're into superhero movies. Just my expectations for a Marvel movie has gone up beyond this lately, and if you're looking for something mind-blowing you're not going to find it here."

","Fun to watch, and fun to re-watch I suspect due to the kaleidoscopic and intricate visual effects, like Inception but more so. I've never taken hallucinogens, but I can imagine this would be a movie to watch while under the influence.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch is as well-suited to the role as Robert Downey Jr is to Tony Stark. Tilda Swinton makes a delightful Ancient One. Gender and race swapping is no issue as neither is essential to the character. I thought Mordo's heel turn was a bit unconvincing, but it is more layered that the jealousy and hunger for power of the original comic character.<br/><br/>My only real complaint is *SPOILERS* Strange learns how to manipulate time. Like the Time Turners in Harry Potter, this can be poison to narrative. Where is the dramatic tension if someone dies if the hero can just press rewind? I know it's the Infinity Gem of time, but they'll have to be really careful how they use it in future movies. JK Rowling admitted she wrote herself into a corner; I hope they haven't done the same.<br/><br/>Like most recent Marvel offerings, it nicely balances fun, funny, and epic. More please."

Although there is hope that, in future installments, Sherlock will drop any attempt at an American accent. The MCU breaks enough canon, let Strange just be British and it will be easier on the ears.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Doctor Strange was clearly a set-up movie like so many others in the MCU. It didn't have the pure entertainment value that Iron Man or Ant Man had, but it was a lot better than most and lived up to the trippy feel of the comic books.<br/><br/>The visual effects were stunning and in a film like this, it really can't be over-done, it's sort of the point and they did a great job at mimicking well known pieces of art in the process. It makes for a great addition to a narrative that is only so-so at best.<br/><br/>However what it lacks in story it makes up in charm. The subtle nods and not so subtle references to Sherlock and the MCU, combined with some cute, albeit slapstick, humor give the film a light hearted feeling that will either annoy viewers or be refreshing given the otherwise dark nature of the plot allowing the movie to be child friendly.<br/><br/>In the end you leave with a Captain America feeling, the movie was just a set-up to establish the character in the MCU. And though it did a great job, you understand that it was an introductory piece.<br/><br/>However, it's not to say that the movie was bad and you walk away with the sense that the follow-ups will certainly be better. You want to see more of Doctor Strange and the set up for what's coming next is tantalizing."

","This movie was very good, but not the best marvel movie there is. It is still one you should definitely watch in the cinema. I saw the movie in 3-D and although I typically do not enjoy 3-D movies (I think they are overrated), it was well done and made the movie experience even better. I do warn you, though, if you typically get motion sick, you might find some moments hard to watch. <br/><br/>I found the begin was too fast and the movie slowed down at the end, which I did not enjoy. The visual effects and perspectives are insane and the acting is phenomenal. I can already see the quotes of this movie become well known by many. I can not wait to watch this movie when it comes out on DVD and Netflix.<br/><br/>I rated it an 8 out of 10; because I loved everything except the pace. For me, it was a bit awkward at times. But still, AMAZING!!!"
"filmicsite","8","3","6","4 November 2016"," Doctor Strange is a strange trippy, mind bending, visually stunning and wonderfully acted movie which must be witnessed in IMAX 3D
","When Marvel studios decided to go on further with their Movie-verse, someone decided to get Doctor Strange-one of the comic book Hero who is not as interesting as Thor, or even Hawkeye- With such weak background story as Doctor Strange, the studio banked on the trippy mind bending visuals and it Worked. Doctor Strange stars Benedict Cumberbatch in the titular role, with supporting star cast that include Chiwetel Ejiofor, Tilda Swinton, Benedict Wong, Rachel McAdams and Mads Mikkelsen . The movie is directed by Scott Derrickson, the guy who directed The Day the Earth Stood Still and a brilliant and underrated horror movie Sinister. The Director travels down a completely new path through a superhero movie and actually finds a quite stunning yet curved path. Doctor Strange is a story of Mr.(Dr!) Strange, a surgeon who excels in his craft. Egoistic and proud Doctor Strange is not a likable character in the beginning. He loves himself, but a tragedy-an accident- takes him down a path where he loses the thing he loved most-his craft. When countless trials of surgeries and Medicine could not treat his hands, he turns towards east to a place in Kathmandu, Nepal. A place about which he learned have a miraculous healing technique. There he meets the Ancient one (Tilda Swinton) and finds a world beyond imagination and time. He is drawn into the world of Mystic Arts and magic where Multiple dimensions lay and in one dark Dimension is a creature so dangerous that he can devour the planet. And of course there is one disciple (Kaecillius-Mads Mikkelsen) who went rogue and wants to bring Dormammu from the dark Dimension.<br/><br/>The story much like other origin stories skips supporting actors like Rachel McAdams to provide much more screen time to Benedict Cumberbatch who never fails in even one second. It feels like Mr. Cumberbatch was born to portray Sherlock and Doctor Strange. The transformation of Strange's character is remarkable and can be felt through Benedict's acting, his eyes says it all in many scenes. HIs helplessness is palpable and intense. But much akin to Strange is an even stranger character of the ancient one played by Tilda Swinton, the power and elegance seeps through her portrayal, her hand waving is exceptional, she is too powerful. The wonderful intro sequence says it all. When she starts waving her hand so elegantly, and bending the space itself. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo is also pretty good with a compulsory marvel funny character portrayed by Benedict Wong.<br/><br/>The movie is a treat to the eye. The greatest 3d effects I have seen till date. A must watch in IMAX 3D, if you can. When the characters enter multi dimensional space or distorts space and time, strange and trippy visuals replace the entire screen. They are stunning and wonderfully crafted. One look and you feel you are also falling just like Strange is through the dimensions. The movie is colorful and yet remarkably dark in a few scenes. The Climax scene defying the laws of universe and cinema is just a scene to observe in wonder. There are not enough words to describe the wonderful visuals of this movie. Now let us move on to the cons of the movie:  Much like other Marvel movies, the antagonist does not get enough screen time to be even called a villain, he is just there, because you cannot have an origin story without a negative character. Thus we can not understand Kaecillius's  reasons to go about destroying the world. The run time feels constrained and thus many characters are skipped about and just gets a little introduction. There is just not enough time to build up any character than Strange. Another issue with the movie is that it is very convenient the way Doctor Strange acquires his powers, it feels forced and very quick. To finish it, Doctor Strange is a strange trippy, mind bending, visually stunning and wonderfully acted movie which must be witnessed in IMAX 3D."
"shohoku-23686","8","3","6","4 November 2016"," An excellent glamorous film, certainly the superhero movie of the year
","Although being an introduction type of film, Doctor Strange told the story in really delicate and sophisticated way. The fantastic performance of Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton took the film to the next level. You can clearly see the growth of the characters in this film. Doctor Strange did not become a master of magic once he learned the skills. Unlike some other superheroes, he gradually learned from the experience and the teaching from the Ancient One and eventually became who he is at the end of the film. <br/><br/>The visual effects are the highlight of this film without a doubt. The structure of the scenes simply just left me in awe. Those effects were just out of my imagination, and regardless to the complicate spatial reformation, the composition of every shot still remained in a clear, consistent way. The usage of bright neon colours is another personal favourite part. This kind of colour usage is really clever especially in interpreting the Dark Dimension. Those colours created a strange, spooky atmosphere yet still audience's attention because it was just so different and fascinating.<br/><br/>However, the film could have spent more time showing the background stories and the motivation of the villain. Kaecilius is a complicated and interesting character and it would be great to see this awesome one showing more on the screen. <br/><br/>Regardless, Doctor Strange made a solid introduction to the amazing character Stephen Strange, showing so much potential in the upcoming Marvel films. This is definitely a film worth to see in the cinema."
"swilliky","8","3","6","4 November 2016"," Something never seen before, a great addition to Marvel
","The next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe adds a spiritual realm of magic and mysticism. Doctor Strange tells a tale almost wholly separate from the Avengers storyline that had ended in turmoil after Civil War. Steven Strange is played by Benedict Cumberbatch who does a great job as an arrogant neurosurgeon that necessitates a comparison to Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. Strange can do no wrong as he performs complicated surgeries with the help of Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) and speeds down the highway until a gruesome car accident. Director Scott Derrickson does a good job showing the cringy surgeries but avoiding any unnecessary violence.<br/><br/>The visuals will be the most memorable part of this film as Strange ventures to Nepal for a cure, he encounters the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and learns about the trippy astral projection. Those scenes are fun and awe-inspiring. I couldn't look away at the stunning effects and will be the reason I watch this film multiple times in the future. Seeing this movie in the theater really transcends the experience and I would highly recommend this movie to Marvel fans. In the end, it is a Marvel movie and takes a lot of the story cues from that even if the shifting New York City is something we haven't seen on screen before.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","Movies like Inception & Interstellar have opened doors for writers to create new stories. It's quite a unique superhero movie. The story line is somewhat classic & average. The humor and delivery style is great. Villain seems to be underwritten. Movie could have been much better. Visual effects are stunning (must see in IMAX 3D). Benedict Cumberbatch did an amazing job as Doctor Strange. Must watch the post credits scene, the future of this franchise looks promising.

","The story of Stephen Strange, perhaps one of the most interesting stories of the Marvel universe. After all, as someone who used to be guided by reason and science, can go beyond that? When I went to the movie, didn't know what to expect. At the time of the release of the trailer for the film, began to say that the picture is very similar to ""Batman. The beginning"", but after watching the film, I wouldn't say that these films have something in common.<br/><br/>The movie was insanely witty and full of jokes, and most importantly, funny. ""Doctor Strange""is a fascinating picture. I had the impression that indeed you are all these portals mirrored spaces etc. As I thought the movie was not a lot of action and fighting scenes that I personally liked very much, because sometimes you get tired of the monotonous scenes of brawls and shoot-outs.<br/><br/>Of course, there is the perfect cast in the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect in this role, and Tilda Swinton once again conquered me.<br/><br/>In the film there are disadvantages, where do without them in modern cinema. For me, sometimes the movie seemed a bit slow, and some dialogues were not needed. In the end, Marvel had very good movie, I would even say the best this year and also one of the most beautiful. If you are tired of the monotonous shoot-outs and action, then this movie you will love it. I would advise to watch it in 3D, it's worth it."
"mymtproject","8","3","6","4 November 2016"," Another fun, entertaining story from Marvel Studios
","I saw DS at the 7:15pm showing on Thursday. This movie is another fun one from Marvel and Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent in the role of Sorcerer Supreme! The origin part is pretty straight forward, from his car accident to him seeking ways to heal himself and meeting the Ancient One, head of a society protecting Earth from other-dimensional threats. Mads Mikkelsen is a good introductory villain and plays his role convincingly for the time he's on the screen. His argument to Strange is not without merit, so his motivation makes sense in his battle against the Ancient One, also played well by Tilda Swinton. Benedict Wong added a humorous role as the society librarian and head of the Hong Kong order. Pacing is one of Marvel's strengths and they move the movie along, not dwelling too long on one point. Some viewers might argue this is a weakness of Marvel films but I disagree. They don't get bogged down in minor questions and leave some of the bigger questions open to address in sequels. This is a family friendly movie and can be viewed by kids as well as adults. It's like watching a comic book on the big screen, something else that Marvel does really well! I give it an 8 out of 10."
"adhyayan_reviews","8","3","6","4 November 2016"," The impossibilties of this brilliant film are endless.
","Marvel's Doctor Strange is as formulaic in plotting and execution as an origin story can become, but they still deliver thoroughly exciting and occasionally mind-bending entertainment. The plot follows the story of the talented neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange who, after a tragic car accident, must put ego aside and learn the secrets of a hidden world of mysticism and alternate dimensions. Based in New York City's Greenwich Village, Doctor Strange must act as an intermediary between the real world and what lies beyond, utilizing a vast array of metaphysical abilities and artifacts to protect the Marvel cinematic universe.The action shifts from New York to Kathmandu to multiverses to sanctums to Hong Kong and finally to the dark realms.The pace is slick and you will almost feel like you are on LSD or any other psychedelic drug if you will. The film revolves around magic and mysticism which transcend the bounds of time.If only the makers would have put in an effort to transcend their bounds yet we still have at our hands a superhero film unlike any other and this is Doctor Strange's biggest win. While comparisons to Inception are obvious, with cities bending and folding into themselves, this goes way beyond that. The colors, the upside-down, fight-on-the-wall, jump-to-this-dimension action; the way the mystical powers they use enhance everything even further, it all left me astounded by how awesome it was to watch on the big screen. I don't even know how they pulled it off, nor do I care, I was so caught up in what I was watching that I didn't even need to think about what filmmaking trickery they were using Benedict Cumberbatch owns this film totally immersing himself into the initially arrogant and egotistical Doctor(yeah shades of Sherlock) and later a gifted and mature sorcerer.Suave in dialogue delivery and brilliance in action scenes, he leaves a lasting impact. Chiwetel Ejiofor impresses as the strong-willed master sorcerer Modo & Tilda Swindon is brilliant cast as the complicated and seemingly immortal Sorcerer Supreme. Rachel McAdams leaves her mark in the similar capacity as did Pepper to Tony and Jane to Thor. Mads Mikkelson plays the primary antagonist Kaecilius playing the generic not-so-powerful Marvel villain and the role doesn't do justice to his talent. While Marvel fans got a taste of what to expect with the kaleidoscopic Quantum Realm at the end of Ant-Man, Derrickson's movie cranks that up at every opportunity, and it's honestly breathtaking. In an early sequence, The Ancient One rockets a skeptical Doctor Strange through a series of alternate dimensions, and as the Ancient One narrates through voice over the display of infinite universes, you can't help but be just as hypnotically stunned as the arrogant surgeon Clear inspiration is drawn from the beautiful work of Steve Ditko in the character's earliest comics, and it's brought to life in a stunning fashion with awesome visual effects that just weren't cinematically available up until now Much more than just portal-hopping, the film utilizes what is called ""the Mirror Dimension"" to create what is essentially a most surreal interpretation of the real world where cityscapes can be shifted and turned at will and gravity flipped (all of it imperceptible to the non-magically inclined). These sequences, along with a finale that utilizes time manipulation in amazing ways truly make Doctor Strange stand out as one of the most visually inventive and incredible films put out by Marvel Studios.. If there was ever a film that needed to be seen in 3D, it's certainly Doctor Strange. Marvel has stepped up their 3D game to no end, and while there's still elements that need a little more tweaking, the usage of the format really does carry this film out of this world, and into the next. Don't hesitate to book an IMAX 3D if you will, as the aspect ratio and sound tweaks in large format really do go well with this 3D masterwork. This a must watch (theatrical) for Marvel aficionados.Experiences and interpretations with this movie will be different for everyone, and casual movie goers might not connect with Strange's story as deeply as MCU followers would.Nevertheless, everyone is sure to be blown away by how totally stunning this vibrant, visual extravaganza is."
"Pramitheus","7","3","6","4 November 2016"," Combo of magic and action
","Finally the presence of a multiverse and the inclusion of magic happens in the MCU. Please read this review considering the fact that I happen to have not read many comic books due to the lack of comic book stores in this little town in India and that my knowledge of Dr.Strange is limited to what was shown in the Amazing Spiderman series and the comics that come in the Daily Telegraph. Pardon me if I write something that is inaccurate according to the comics.<br/><br/>I am huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and I was very excited when he was included in the MCU. I knew how much he didn't want to portray a superhero but I am glad he did. He looks the part and acts the part, though I have a few gripes. Not regarding his acting but his characterization. Without further adieu allow me to expand my mind and extract all that I witnessed.<br/><br/>DIRECTION - I have liked Scott Derrickson's 'Sinister' and 'Deliver us from Evil'. He doesn't disappoint here either except, and I am sorry, the ending. I'll get to that later. Considering that this is an origin story in the middle of a long line of movies, whose characters have already been well established, nothing felt rushed. The magic was shown beautifully. Since the time the trailers dropped, many were comparing the visuals to Inception, but it really isn't. Yes, there is a similarity but the mind-bending, building bending scenarios are just amazing. Calling it the same as Inception is just insulting. The chase sequence is so intricate that I have to see multiple times to fully understand what is going on in the background. The jokes felt a bit out of place sometimes. It's OK to disagree, it is a personal thing. The 'mister doctor' scene was funny in the trailers and I was anticipating it, but then when Kaecilius stabbed the guardian right after that, it was just confusing. Why would you do that? Do you want me to laugh or sympathize? Strange's character is similar to Stark because he is also arrogant and probably that's why it was shown that he was cracking so many jokes. I hope in the subsequent movies he gets more serious to match his persona of Sorcerer Supreme.<br/><br/>ACTING - When you get some of the most gifted actors, there could be no complaints about that. Benedict's Strange is funny, compassionate, witty and a very apt portrayal as far as I am concerned. Many were complaining about the accent, but it is negligible. Rachel McAdams has limited screen-time, but shines through and through. Again, glad Marvel roped her in too. Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, according to me should have got some more interactions with either Strange or the other characters. It is a compliment because I wanted to see more of her. I had read that Mordo is a villain but from the trailers I was a bit confused seeing him in such a good avatar. Then I thought that Chiwetel Ejiofor wouldn't have come in if Mordo would have been reduced to a side- role. This also serves as an origin story for Mordo and it will be great to see Chiwetel against Benedict. Benedict Wong as Wong is a strong and compelling and even though there wasn't much of him, you know that he will have a far more stretched out role in the future. Mad Mikkelsen probably strolled through this role as Kaecilius. He had a very one dimensional villainous role and that's why I think his acting potential was under used.<br/><br/>STORY and SCRIPT - Again, please pardon me if I am being inaccurate. As this is an origin story, I was expecting him to become Sorcerer Supreme by the end of the movie, but was glad that they didn't go that way. The jokes felt a bit out of place. I know Marvel tends to be funny but I think now they should just let it go. We can handle dark and sad moments. You have trained us well, Marvel Studios. Now, the ending felt kinda REPETITIVE. HAHA! Didn't see that coming did you? It felt like the ending of Fantastic Four 2 , where a huge monster like thing, which has been built up for the whole movie, doesn't exactly deliver. I know we are supposed to consider that that movie don't exist but it did feel like that. It felt like a cheap cop-out. I am just happy that in the future, Strange will be facing off against Mordo and as Mordo's character has been established, we will be able understand the reason behind his actions.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT - My final thoughts are that Marvel has a formula and it looks like it worked again, though I hope in the subsequent movies they could pull back on the jokes. It is very entertaining, action heavy and stunning visuals. Go watch it and enjoy.<br/><br/>Additional thoughts -I am a bit sad that people are still walking out before the post and mid-credit scenes. Haven't you learnt already? It's a tradition. It allows you to look at the names behind the magic and also you get to see what's next. Just, please, sit and watch."
"nikh1996","8","3","6","4 November 2016"," A visual spectacle to be witnessed in IMAX
","Mild spoilers:<br/><br/>First things first: WATCH IT IN IMAX 3D! Okay now the review: ""Doctor Strange is exhilarating and a visual spectacle... Seriously these guys have given so much eye-candy and couple that with the IMAX experience and this was a beauty to behold. For example, one of the fight portions in the later half of the movie is a type of 'What if we could make Inception an even more trippy experience with more complexity thrown in for good measure' and that how that scene is... Benedict Cumberbatch is made for the role of Strange as he imbues it with the ""cocky"" nature that is supposed to be Strange... Rachel McAdams was like just there... Nothing much. But few scenes with her are good. Tilda, the ""one"" (no pun intended) barraged with the ""white-washing"" controversy was actually good for the role with serenity and grace. Mads Mikkelsen was also great as a villain but as with every Marvel movie, he kinda exists only for this movie... This movie is a good origin story for Dr. Strange and based on visual spectacle alone, this movie makes it a ""must-watch"" ""<br/><br/>Btw there are 2 end-credit scenes so sit back..."
"mvpeter24","8","3","6","4 November 2016"," ""Doctor Strange"" has more spectacle than substance, but it's worth your time
","About halfway through ""Doctor Strange,"" I just accepted that the plot made no sense. Usually this is a cardinal sin, but for Doctor Strange, it isn't. This movie has visual spectacle greater than you've seen before, and, in this case, that alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>This is the origin story of (somewhat) obscure Marvel hero Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). Strange is a neurosurgeon who is in a car crash which gives him severe nerve damage and limited use of his hands. He seeks mystic healing in Nepal and joins up with a cult that uses magic power. A lot of hard-to-follow magic happens, and in the end Dr. Strange needs to save the world.<br/><br/>This movie is riddled with logical fallacy, tonal inconsistency, and forgettable characters. There is not nearly enough time spent explaining the movie's mythology, and we're left with a bunch of sorcerers who fight for an unclear reason and use spells/combat maneuvers we really don't understand. Dr. Strange himself is a discount Tony Stark; there is nothing new about his personality we haven't already seen from Marvel's own ""Iron Man"" movies. But, despite all its seemingly innumerable flaws, I'm giving ""Doctor Strange"" strong positive recommendation.<br/><br/>We've all seen big things blow up in movies before... but we've never seen it like this. ""Doctor Strange"" uses CGI in ways that are unique and mesmerizing. For example, in the final battle Strange uses a spell that rewinds time. As our heroes fight in the streets, the buildings around are not being destroyed, they are being pieced back together. Simply using words to describe this effect does not do it justice in the slightest. It is breathtaking to watch. This time manipulation is not the only incredible visual in the movie- it is far from it. There are tons of other visually interesting sequences, including multiple psychedelic scenes that borrow visuals heavily from ""Inception"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey""<br/><br/>This is not a film you should wait to see on Blu-Ray. This is a film you need to see in a theater. Go to an IMAX theater if you can. In a way, it's like James Cameron's ""Avatar."" If you watch Avatar on Blu-Ray today, it's not the same as you remember it in theaters. In fact, it's not a very good movie when you watch it at home on your television. Still, nothing can express the way it captivated audiences when it came out. If you want to feel that magic again, go see Doctor Strange. The visuals will leave you breathless, even if they cover up a very flawed story."

","Dr. Strange: I don't believe in fairy tales about chakras or energy or the power of belief.<br/><br/>The Ancient One: You wonder what I see in your future? Possibility.<br/><br/>Although I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I should have, the visual effects were stunning and with the story making anything possible, it is interesting to see how creative Marvel was with this film. Unfortunately the visuals weren't enough to carry the story which was quite weak. This film is everything you would expect from a Marvel movie and nothing more.<br/><br/>The character of Doctor Stephen Strange in the beginning of the film reminded me of Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, arrogant and wealthy. While I loved the character in the first two Iron Man's, I didn't feel like it worked with Doctor Strange at all. Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange) I believe did an excellent job in acting but his character was typical and Marvel has done it better before. I would have loved to see a darker and more serious Doctor Strange, with mystery behind his personality at risk of it being cliché because of his name. <br/><br/>The plot didn't allow for a real story for the audience to chew on. There was a cause and effect in every act that wasn't really complicated. The only complex character in this film ends up being Chiwetel Ejiofor character ""Mordo"". Make sure to stay after the credits and you'll see what I mean, because of this I am excited for the next chapter of Doctor Strange but I have some hesitations if the film doesn't improve it's writing and direction which was seriously lacking here.<br/><br/>The action sequences were great throughout the whole film. So much was happening as worlds changed physically and dimensionally giving a creative sense of epic fights and battles. This was one thing I was most excited about but still thought the film could've improved on. The possibilities were endless and I don't think that Marvel used that to it's full extent here.<br/><br/>The music is just as Tony Zhou put it best in his Every Frame a painting video essay. It wasn't risky or memorable, I watched this film 16 hours ago and I already forgot the music. If you haven't seen his video essay, I highly recommend you do. Just google The Marvel Symphonic Universe by Every Frame a painting or visit this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=7vf... <br/><br/>If you plan on seeing the film I am sure you will be entertained for 115 minutes and it would probably be worth the money but it wasn't something that would stay with you for a long time. Maybe with some better character development, writing, direction and music this franchise can really make an impact on the audience as a stand alone superhero movie."
"Eclectic-Boogaloo","6","3","6","2 November 2016"," Marvel Studios best since 'The Avengers'
","To preface: I'm not a big MCU fan but, I've been a marvel comics and content fan since I was a kid. Id rank Doctor Strange behind The Avengers, Iron Man, and Ant-Man(close), as my favorite in the MCU.<br/><br/>Well the superhero origin movie has been done to death. As has been the chosen one or hero's journey. They can be pretty tedious and boring. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange looked to get around that, but not by being original rather, they just rushed Steven Strange's journey from Doctor to Sorcerer supreme<br/><br/>Now as an aside, I must say that Benedict Cumberbatch was solid in the role. I thought the filmmakers wrote the role for a Robert Downey Jr. type of performer which, is a disservice to Cumberbatch who, has a powerful and dramatic presence. The films humor was largely wasted on him and the movie. He excelled in the movies dramatic moments. Especially in the third act.<br/><br/>and from New York to Kamar Taj. About 20 minutes. That's the first act of the movie. <br/><br/>It leaving in question the whole backstory of the villain Kaecillius (a wasted Mads Mikkelson) and how he ties into the Ancient One (terrific performance by Tilda Swinton). And more importantly it starves Steven Strange of a real human connection with Christine Palmer ( Rachel Mcadams) and stunts his overall characterization. We don't see him suffer enough. Physically or emotionally. <br/><br/>Not to mention we don't know why HIM, and there's no sense of urgency to the TASK. They just train for a long time. And the bad guy disappears for 30-40 minutes until<br/><br/>In order to make up for the rushed first hour of the movie, in one of the worst scenes in the film, the filmmakers bring the first showdown between Strange and Kaecillius to a contrived standstill so the bad guy can spend 3 minutes (seemed like more) talking about himself and the universe etc etc Basically a huge exposition dump. <br/><br/>In the end, what really elevates Doctor Strange above the other post The Avengers films is that the third act. Basically the last 20 minutes of the film... <br/><br/>The movies end brings a sense of poetry and sacrifice to the hero. What any good heroes journey has which is a hero who must make a sacrifice willingly to be a hero. And stare mortality in the face. Doctor Strange does both with aplomb. The final few scenes between Strange and the Ancient One were, in my estimation, the best dramatic work in any Marvel movie. And the final showdown in which Doctor Strange saves the day is absolute eye-candy to Steve Ditko era fans and is pulled off with visual splendor. And a dash of very dry humor.<br/><br/>Overall, Doctor Strange is visual treat made for the theatrical experience that has a poor first hour marred by ineffective humor, a rushed story, and choppy character work. The last 20 minutes is when the action (which there's a lot of), stunning visuals, and story finally come together for a surprisingly satisfying resolution. Yes the stakes amount to very little but, the character's journey is satisfying and, that's what any good superhero origin story should do. Doctor Strange did not disappoint.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Doctor Strange has finally come out and the floodgates of reviews and IMDb scores are coming in at long last, and the census is that the film is good, damn good. Sure the plotting can be derivative of Marvel's earlier films and there may be holes in some of the logic, but Benedict Cumberbatch is wonderful as Strange, and Tilda Swinton gives a respectable take on the Ancient One, though I thought Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo fell short of the other characters in the film because he's acts too sensitive for a mystic so wise.<br/><br/>Stephen Strange is a neurosurgeon whose ability is lost in a car accident resulting in his hands getting severed. To heal himself of this pain, he heads to Kathmandu, Nepal to learn from The Ancient One, a mystical person who possesses powers beyond Strange's comprehension. Through The Ancient One, Strange aims to become something greater than himself.<br/><br/>Marvel has given us their fourteenth entry in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and they've already built their own origin-structure to bring in unfamiliar characters to the masses with great actors heading the production. Doctor Strange is like Inception's-LSD-influenced--Batman-Begins-&-Harry-Potter-crossover mixed in with philosophy and archetypes influenced by The Matrix and Star Wars films. Doctor Strange is a good experience filled with what-the-f### visuals mixed in with an easy-to-follow story that falls a little short of its reality-defying and gorgeous visual effects. Doctor Strange is an experience that may even wow the most bias critics of CGI effects; these ones are something else.<br/><br/>Go see this movie when it arrives in American theaters November 4th."
"assassin-42523","8","3","6","2 November 2016"," Easily on par with The Winter Soldier, and just shy of being as good as GoTG
","Visually : Stunningly and trippy. The looks of the film is beautiful and the CGO are really impressive and contribute a lot to the magical effects, surrealist theme of the movie. The director is good, every action, every camera move, every object placed has a symbolism meaning behind it. However, they used overused CGI a little bit in my opinion, every magic scene is undoubtedly beautiful, yes, but also disoriented, everyone who came out of that movie has a dizziness of some kind. To make matters worse, the antagonists doesn't stood out so the blurry, shaky fighting sequence is even harder to discern than your average Action Movie. Soundtrack: Just your typical forgettable songs backing the scene it's playing. However, I think most of the songs are in Minor, plus that with the serious theme, making the mood of the movie to be creepier and darker than most Marvel's movie. And that's a good thing. Plot: Every superhero movie now has a plot so predictable you don't even need a trailer to guess what the overall movie plot is about. However, unlike the others, this one is pretty tight with few significant plot holes. The greatest thing about the plot, however, is the detailed, the director focused so much on every detailed about the in-fighting of Stephen Strange between his egotistic old lifestyle and a life of sacrifice for the good of others. Thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch great acting, his vision is fulfilled. Overall: 8.3/10, but 8 since this is IMDb"

","A massive amount of effort and money went into rebuilding this dusty old property from the Marvel library.<br/><br/>You merely have to look at the John Mills film version -- or any of the forgettable animations -- to see the scope of the challenge.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that when Lee and Ditko first conceived Strange, neither had much of a clue about mystical stuff. So they came up the Eye, and Nightmare (probably the next movie) and the world's most forgettable villain Dormammu. Even the spelling of the name should tell you how quickly the original story was thrown together back in the day.<br/><br/>However there are few problems on this planet that millions of dollars cannot fix. The casting of Cumberbatch was brilliant. OMG he looks exactly like the original character, right down to facial bone structure.<br/><br/>However at the end of the day you have just another Marvel ""origin"" story cleverly designed to permit either future individual stories or, as a last resort, to merge the doc into the Avengers. Wherever there is the most profit, I presume.<br/><br/>The beginning is above average -- Tilda Swinton brilliant as always -- and the ending is BRILLIANT.<br/><br/>In the middle you have a lot of sound and fury signifying mainly nothing. Astonishingly A-list stars Ejiofor and McAdams are completely wasted. Papier mache figures could have played these roles, they are so poorly written."

","For someone who has never seen the comics - since I was never really a huge fan of reading comic books, but I did love looking at the colorful pictures. Nevertheless, I've never seen Dr. Strange entirely, before watching this film. I have to say, this film is by far has the best graphics I've seen, even by Marvel. The best part is, Marvel didn't push too hard for the film to be a special-effects centered film, but rather, they allowed the plot drive its effects. Everything you see, in my opinion, is all part of the bigger plan.<br/><br/>You'll LOVE Dr. Strange, basically because of its SPECIAL EFFECTS and not really because of its STORY and CHARACTERS. Honestly, it feels like it lacks character and reasoning. Dr. Strange, to me, felt like it didn't give enough reason for Dr. Strange to choose the better option rather than himself. The plot line also felt usual. You have a master whose intentions are good, but at one point joined the evil and also has a lot of secrets still.<br/><br/>In totality, I really would recommend this film to everyone! Hero- film fans or not, you'll love this. FOR SURE."
"muligens","7","3","6","1 November 2016"," A visual feast
","Doctor Strange. A somewhat odd addition to the MCU pantheon but I had every faith that they could pull it off. And did they?<br/><br/>The Good: The acting on display is top notch. Benedict Cumberbatch absolutely nails it. Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong and Rachel McAdams do well with what they're given. I really enjoyed Mads Mikkelsen here and wish he had more to do.<br/><br/>The visual effects and set design are great. They certainly set this film apart from the other MCU entries. Very cool and worth the cost of the ticket by itself..<br/><br/>The Bad: The script feels somewhat generic. Yes, this is an origin story and as such there are some things that are hard to avoid. <br/><br/>With so many bases to cover it felt like the pacing was a bit fast. It would have been nice to be able to linger a bit at various stages of his development instead of having to rush to the next level. But for a film that is already around the 2 hour mark I can see why they didn't want to make it any longer. It never felt boring or overly long that's for sure.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Nope, nothing ugly about this one.<br/><br/>Not the greatest film ever. Not even the best superhero movie of the year. But still a very enjoyable time spent at the movies and well worth the trip to the theatre. See it at the biggest, best screen you can."
"sarah_mccully","8","3","6","31 October 2016"," I have a new favorite Superhero!
","Last week I was given the opportunity to enjoy an advanced screening of Marvel's Doctor Strange. I will be honest that I am not as familiar with this character, and am much better versed in Spider-Man, the Avengers, the Hulk and many others. After seeing this film he is my new favorite Marvel Superhero. I could relate to so much that he was going through on several levels and I love the spirituality of his journey and how he overcomes so much.<br/><br/>What I loved: Some of my favorite things about this movie include the mysticism that surrounds the story. I love the Sci-fi aspects of time traveling and going between dimensions and to other worlds. I loved that as a doctor he took a Hippocratic Oath that he holds true and important (at least for now) ""to do no harm"" thus trying not to kill anyone. He fights, no question but he also problem solves in ways I don't remember seeing from the other superheros. This was surprising and welcome.<br/><br/>I LOVED the humor in this film. I found I was giggling through several scenes. This happened more for me in this movie than most of the other (outside of Dead Pool - that movie was hilarious!).<br/><br/>I thought this was a really solid movie and the story line was well written and engaging. The action sequences were pretty intense and fun.<br/><br/>I really felt that the movie was well cast and the acting was great. Sometimes these movies feel like they are over acted and this one felt like everyone was comfortable and kept things right where they needed to be. <br/><br/>Recommendations: I took a couple of friends with me to see this movie. They are big superhero fans and suggested that you should really check this out in 3D. As someone who struggles a little bit watching 3D movies, I felt like as long as it is on the big screen you will be happy (and a big screen for this really lets you see more of the effects).<br/><br/>For parents considering taking small children, please be aware that in the first few minutes of the film a man is beheaded. It is seen as a shadow and no blood shows, but you see the head coming off the body and going into a pot. There are also some hospital scenes that aren't gory but might be confusing to little ones. And there is an impaling later in the film. <br/><br/>Not so spoiler-spoilers: As always Stan Lee makes his appearance, but it is a blink and you will miss it situation (I love that he does this!). Thor also makes an appearance in the movie, but you will have to wait for the credits. There is a hidden scene at the very end, so make sure you sit through the credits...you will want to see it!<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie and highly recommend it!"
"lmpuyen","8","3","6","31 October 2016"," It did what it was supposed to - that's it!
","Doctor Strange gives you the basic of what one would expect in a superhero movie, and it gives it well, but that's all you will get. The CGI was fantastically done and amazing to watch, the action and suspense was definitely there and the actors all gave a convincing performance. My favorite part of it all - that I should mention before getting into what I don't like - was the world-building, without knowing much about the universe before-hand I still was able to grasp quickly onto the idea and thoroughly loved the concept of such magical world. <br/><br/>The first thing I would note about Doctor Strange however, was that the ending fight scene to me was rather disappointing. Maybe it's the fact that their main method of fighting was magic for the main face-off between the force of good and evil in this film was just simply lame compared to many of the Marvel Movies that I've watched. It lacked the intensity and in no part of the scene did I really felt like though the character's lives were in danger.<br/><br/>Another thing that I would note is that the movie failed to do what I believed is the most important thing in earning an 8+ rating. It failed to touched me. Some people might argue that a movie about heroes saving the planet focuses mainly on action. In some cases that might be true, but Doctor Strange is a movie that started on Stephen's journey of seeing the world for what it truly is and answering the question of what is his place of existence in this new-found universe, and I felt that the movie hasn't answered this question. A great movie (9 or 10 stars) should finish it's spiritual task (if it has one) along with it's entertainment task. Therefore while the movie did do an amazing job in giving fun, it just didn't go the whole way for me."
"The-Sarkologist","8","3","6","30 October 2016"," Somewhat Stranger than the Others
","The annoying thing about movies is that you spend all this time anticipating a movie and after two hours, boom, it is over, and thus you then spend all your time trying to anticipate the next movie. I guess it has a lot to do with the age of fast fashion and fast advertising where things come and go so quickly that if we blink we miss them. In a way it is much like me spending half an hour wandering through an art gallery taking photos of all of the works of art so that I might spend some time afterward appreciating them. What has this got to do with the movie? Well, Doctor Strange is one of those films that I spent most of the year anticipating, and now that I am writing a review on it clearly indicates that I have seen it, and now it is in the past. It's not that it was a bad film, it is just the experience was so short that I felt that I didn't get to savor the experience as much as I would have liked to.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film, as is the case with a lot of the MCU films, is that they need to take time developing the character and exploring his creation story, which means that you end up having little time to deal with the actual antagonist. Usually the plot goes along the line of guy becomes superhero but before guy (or girl) is fully trained the mentor is killed and the superhero must now defeat the antagonist despite not being fully equipped to be able to defeat the antagonist, however through luck, and smarts, manages to do so. This is basically the plot of Doctor Strange. Mind you, if you aren't looking for anything all that deep in the plot then fine, but if you are, well, unfortunately Doctor Strange isn't going to deliver.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is that it was suggested that Doctor Strange takes a bit of a new direction with regards to the superhero genre, and they have done it to prevent what is termed 'superhero fatigue'. If there are way too many films that just have a superhero fighting bad guys then people are eventually going to become sick of them. At this stage they seem to be releasing two MCU films a year, so obviously they need to fiddle with the concept to keep people interested, and they have certainly done that with Doctor Strange – this time we wander into the world of Chinese mysticism.<br/><br/>The thing with Doctor Strange (which is actually his real name) is that he is a neurologist, though he is one of those elite group who only operate on patients that they know that they will succeed (though also having a challenge to keep things interesting). In a way it means that they can maintain a 100% success rate, and also keep their notoriety intact. The problem is that Dr Strange has a rather nasty car accident, namely because he is so full of himself that he believes that he can speed, and talk on a mobile phone, while navigating a twisting, mountainous road. Obviously he fails, and lands up with hands so mangulated that he will never perform surgery again. Except that he discovers a place where he can theoretically be healed.<br/><br/>It turns out that his perception of reality has been challenged – he is a doctor therefore he only understands, and accepts, the scientific, though he is now being confronted with the spiritual. What is happening here is that we are entering another area of the MCU – initially we have the technological with Iron Man and Captain America, the the gods of Asgard, then the science-fiction element of Guardians of the Galaxy, and now we delve into the mystical and magical world of Doctor Strange. It certainly does create a new dimension to the series.<br/><br/>Another thing that stood out was that this film reminded me, in some places, of Inception. I guess it had a lot to do with how they were manipulating reality in the film. Actually, those scenes occurred in a parallel dimension, in much the same way that similar scenes occurred in Inception. Okay, the film wasn't necessarily the same (Inception was much, much better), but the special effects were still pretty cool, and the film really enjoyable. However it's over now so I guess that means that I am now looking forward to the next film on my list."
"knight_ca","8","3","6","30 October 2016"," A new and exciting aspect to the Marvel Universe
","A brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon is left struggling for purpose after his hands are shattered in a car accident. His journey to heal himself takes him to seek out the mysterious Ancient One who throws him into a mystical world of wonder and terror.<br/><br/>Marvel has decided to raise another of its heroes to the big screen but this time, there are no mutants or men in iron suits. Instead, it's magic and sorcery and this injects a much needed twist on the Marvel Universe. We are treated to some seriously trippy moments with the true nature of the cosmos revealed and some Inception- inspired reality bending.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch takes on the mantle of the eponymous Doctor Steven Strange which is a superb piece of casting. He fits into this role as though it was made for him, giving Strange the annoying arrogance as he begins what is essentially his origin story. His journey into the mystical world and all the threats it contains is his hero's journey, emerging as a more rounded and selfless character. As great as Cumberbatch is in this role, it's Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One who steals the show. Her performance is amazing and delivered with such gravitas that all eyes are drawn to her whenever she's on-screen. Her effortless authority shows why The Ancient One is the defender of the cosmos and Supreme Sorcerer.<br/><br/>The villain of the movie is played by Mads Mikkelsen who always seems to look like a bad guy without even trying. He's the usual fallen hero who quests for power but in an attempt to make him more rounded, he is shown to be doing what he thinks is best for the world. The fact that this is having the Earth sucked into a dark dimension is beside the point.<br/><br/>No Marvel movie would be complete without a plethora of fight scenes and Strange delivers on this. Magic and battles in mirror worlds allow a different style of combat that takes us away from the usual Avengers-style smack-down. The sorcerers are a level above the other Marvel heroes and you could imagine Loki being swept aside with a wave of The Ancient One's hand. It's interesting to see how Marvel have shown this new aspect to their universe and immediately try to head off the 'if they're so powerful, why does the world even need the likes of Captain America?' questions. The sorcerers have their hands full protecting the world from mystical threats and leave the physical threats to the Avengers. Fair enough.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is arguably the most original Marvel movie since Guardians of the Galaxy and show that it is possible to break away from what was becoming a formulaic and prosaic universe. If you like superhero movies, you can't go wrong with this one. If you don't like superhero movies, give this one a go, you might be pleasantly surprised."
"riordantheking","6","3","6","29 October 2016"," My favourite comic book movie of this year, and my favourite MCU film so far
","I went into this film expecting some neat visuals, good performances, and a big battle with a CGI army at the end. Nothing special, I thought, just a fun experience. But, to my utter surprise, this was something more, something really great.<br/><br/>Let's start with the acting. It's great, all around. Benedict Cumberbatch is massively likable and charismatic as the titular character. He brings the comedy perfectly but also the troubled man within. Tilda Swinton does a very good job at playing The Ancient One, I thought she would ham it up, but she out in a revered, quiet performance. Benedict Wong and Chiwetel Ejiofor do good jobs as supporting characters, and Mads Mikkelsen is great as usual, making a generic villain rather memorable. Rachel McAdams is good as well, but she doesn't get a lot of time to shine.<br/><br/>Visually, it's far and away the best looking MCU film to date, beating out Guardians of the Galaxy. The scene in which Strange is first introduced to the multiverse is an awesome treat on the eyes, and the film doesn't let up from there. All the CGI is done to perfection, and the film takes great advantage of the nonsensical rules to create some of the best action sequences I've seen this year. The gravity defying streets are very impressive as well, I must add.<br/><br/>The story and characters are great. The story is a little on the generic side, but it serves it's purpose well (just like in most of the MCU films). The characters are memorable, except for the love interest and villain, who come across a little flat. I won't spoil the end battle here, but it's great, and extremely different compared to the usual business of the MCU.<br/><br/>A small negative I found was that Doctor Strange's learning of his powers and mastering them is a little rushed. It cuts from him being an amateur to him having become quite adept at them. A small qualm, but I wish they expanded on it.<br/><br/>So, yes, it's very great, and sits at the top of the MCU for me, beating out The Winter Soldier."
"katuseluuk-62-328352","8","3","6","29 October 2016"," Was there something in my popcorn?
","As I left the cinema into the cold and rainy evening I wasn't able to say much about the movie. Me and my friend were mostly joking about mysterious substances that could've been hidden inside the free popcorn we received before the premiere. I'm pretty sure a lot of people will make these kinds of jokes after seeing Doctor Strange, but not in a negative way.<br/><br/>When it comes to the plot and characters of Doctor Strange, well, to be fair it isn't any different from the usual big movies we get – we have our hero, our villain, mentor, love interest, sidekick, etc. It is a solid formula that Marvel holds onto and which has brought us an unstoppable Cinematic Universe train where you can't call even the worst entries entirely awful. So as to be expected, Doctor Strange has a solid and straight spine in its back which keeps you grounded after an insane kaleidoscopic trip through New York. But this Marvel formula is not perfect – once in a while it brings us jokes and quips at inappropriate times which can bring you out of an emotional or otherwise intense scene. Of course, it's a colorful comic book movie that shouldn't be taken seriously, but this begs the question: why even have serious scenes if the point is to have just simple fun? But while the plot isn't something too extraordinary for Doctor Strange, the movie works on a completely another level in visuals.<br/><br/>I was a little bit dumbstruck after the movie. Perhaps not because of the movie itself but by the fact that something like this was ever made by a big studio. While the plot was kept solid and grounded by the already formulaic Marvel style, the meat around it was just something surreal. Right from the get-go the prologue gives you a taste of what's to come and every time mystic artistry is done by one of the characters, it manages to even top the previously seen psychedelic imagery. Sometimes there are fights with the use of martial arts, sparkles and flashy lights but when it comes down to actually defeating an opponent, it is only done by the wits and clever use of magical tools by the arcane spell-masters rather than the size of their mana pool. So perhaps you can predict an outcome of a conflict but I guarantee that it is impossible to predict the way those characters try to reach their goals. So that's what left me dumbstruck about this – the movie manages to visually defy expectations and actually surprise you up to the very last confrontation.<br/><br/>It sounds a bit lame to recommend a movie only for the visuals but that's what I'm doing. While there is some spiritualism involved in Doctor Strange, it doesn't stand out too much. And the already amazing cast did a solid job and I can't complain at all. Perhaps there could've been more Mads. There's never enough Mads. I like this popcorn. HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON PLEASE, i want this moment to stay for a little longer.<br/><br/>OK, now i want you to see this movie<br/><br/>Conclusion: Where's Mads? out of 10"

","I'm not a fan of most of the MCU. I like intelligent dialog, believable characters and am not fond of the hyper violence that MCU is renowned for. You also have too much political correctness jammed down your throat, which is why characters such as Black Widow are so aggressive.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is none of those things particularly. The cast are all-round excellent. Tulsa Swinton was superb, mostly through solid acting and that she didn't feel the need to be hyper violent. It was such a refreshing change. Benedict Cumberbatch walked a fine line of arrogant and charming and was very believable. Chiwetel Ejiofor wasn't over the top and he didn't feel like the typical 'larger than life black character' (eg. Like the Falcon who is so clichéd, it's numbing).<br/><br/>The story was also solid. No scene felt out of place or dragged. There were no twists or dues ex machina that stood out.<br/><br/>All in all, ignore everything Scott Mendehlson said about this movie. I disagreed with almost everything he said. It wasn't over the top. It was extremely subtle for MCU. The characters were believable for a change.<br/><br/>Great, great movie. Very thoughtfully executed by all. Definitely my favourite MCU picture. I thought the movie was suitable for 12+. Some of the violence is eye opening (eg. A beheading), but was handled off-screen. There is some blood and depiction of a damaged body."
"marc5477","2","4","10","12 February 2017"," Complete horse poop
","Sorry but I just don't see it. The only thing going for this movie is special effects and that is all. You might as well call this Transformers XII or whatever number they are on. The story was asinine and pretty much nullifies the need for any other heroes and the characters themselves were total garbage. Strange is un-redeemable. He is filth and not smart in any way. Again, Hollywood does not seem to be able to portray what smart people are really like. They think that we are all air heads. We might be arrogant and many think we might seem condescending to some but we are usually right and we almost never as closed minded as this clown. In fact, by definition of being smart, we better understand just how little we know. We don't need to be reminded of this and we are fully aware of it. This portrayal of smart scientist in this movie is insulting.<br/><br/>Next, the antagonist was also a total flipping retard. The plot is that he wants to live forever by killing everyone and sacrificing the earth to something that does not live under the rule of time... well if the thing is outside of time, why the hell does it seem to exist at a specific point? Why does it not exist across multiple points as it should and why would a time loop isolate it to one form? Why did it not just leave Strange alone and continue what it was doing prior? It didn't actually need to kill him but it was apparently so dumb that it couldn't think of any other solution to escape the trap.<br/><br/>I don't know. It was one of the worst Marvel movies I have seen. Certainly worse than Wolverine and old Hulk movies."

I'm really glad they waited to make this movie when the technology of movie CGI was finally good enough to capture the true world of Dr Strange. The special effects at times reminded me of Inception, except this movie made total sense and was 10x better.<br/><br/>The casting was done perfectly. I don't think I've ever watched a movie as visually stunning as this one. It reminded me of seeing Avatar for the first time in 3D. His powers and abilities and story line and character development were incredible. There are so many layers to this movie I look forward to rewatching it many more times over the years. <br/><br/>I was a huge comic book fan as a kid, but never read Dr Strange.

","Doctor Strange is another Marvel superhero I've heard of, but am largely unfamiliar. However, given the studios recent track record, the intriguing trailers, and Benedict Cumberbatch in the starring role, I've been salivating in anticipation of seeing this film.<br/><br/>WARNING: Anyone prone to or sensitive to motion sickness may want to forgo seeing this in 3D (especially IMAX 3D) or at least pop a Dramamine prior to viewing.<br/><br/>First things, first. The visual effects in this movie are simply amazing and lend themselves to IMAX 3D if you can handle it. I'll say they're along the lines of Inception although I haven't actually watched that movie. I admit, the opening sequence gave me a little tummy trouble, but fortunately I soon adapted and was able to submerge myself and enjoy the film. The idea of a new twist on reality takes new meaning and boggles the mind.<br/><br/>Secondly, the cast is perfect.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One? What a badass and a delight to watch. She's one of those actors I normally don't think of until I happen to see her in something, then can't be more thrilled with her performance.<br/><br/>Mads Mikkelsen, still gives me chills from his take as Hannibal Lecter from the defunct NBC series Hannibal and again delivers as our baddie Kaecilius. Brilliant, talented, but oh so misguided. Looking forward to seeing him in Rogue One.<br/><br/>Ahhh, Benedict Cumberbatch. I count myself among the Cumber...well I'll go with Collective for the sake of this review and my fandom just went up another notch with his portrayal of the title character, Dr. Stephen Strange. Brilliant, egotistical, talented, and let's face it a bit of an a-hole, Cumberbatch's journey from the top of the world/his profession to the lowest depths of the gutter is a roller coaster of emotion and a pure joy to watch unfold. The man was born to play this part.<br/><br/>Third, the writing. Once again the folks at Marvel have created a dramatic, engaging, action packed, funny three dimensional story that just also happens to have the fantastical elements of magic and superheroes. This is one of those films if you lose the fantasy elements actually still works as a story. So, even if you aren't a fanboy/fangirl of comics and superheroes the story resonates and you will enjoy. And if you are a fanboy/girl you'll enjoy the ride even more.<br/><br/>I've got to go all in on this M.C. Escheresque thrill ride and give this one an around the world and back snap. A ten in my book. Don't wait, definitely see this one on the big screen, IMAX 3D if you can.<br/><br/>One last word of CAUTION: STAY until the very end of the credits. As is Marvel's modus operandi there are not one, but two additional scenes in the closing credits. Don't gyp yourself by missing them."

Every actor killed their roles! They brought their characters to vivid life and really, they couldn't have done better if they tried. I especially loved Tilda Swinton! I'm so glad they changed the generic Ancient One in to something unique by casting her; she was spectacular!<br/><br/>The dialogues were brilliant! The perfect balance of wisdom, darkness and humour which reflects the overall tone of the movie. Honestly, I can't get over how well written and delivered they were; the Ancient One's lines specifically were the highlights of the movie!<br/><br/>And last but certainly not the least, I really have to applaud Marvel for exploring themes such as those of coping with injury and dealing with loss & grief. They addressed similar themes in Civil War as well as the Iron Man trilogy. It's so refreshing to have something like that happening simultaneously with the usual moral themes of hero movies. If you've been through or are going through something similar, it really does feel like a therapy session."

Doctor Strange has it all; action, comedy, tragedy, etc. There isn't a dull moment in this movie and the action scenes are very enticing. The story flows really well, and you will not want the movie to end. Everyone in cast plays their character well. Excellent movie that everybody should see, it is fairly age friendly.

","Do you remember the scene when Ariadne folds the Paris city in 2010 'Inception'? If yes, and you think that scene was breathtaking, watch 'Doctor Strange'. You'll find plenty more of such effects and these scenes are super-breathtaking. <br/><br/>Some major parts of the movie were shot in my hometown (Kathmandu, Nepal). Except for the scenes of Swayambhunath, Pashupatinath and some places, even I could not recognize the locations. Maybe because they were recreated with special effects and the result was superb. It is a matter of pride for us, when a big budget Hollywood movie chooses Nepali Architecture for their set. I am glad, I got to see it and experience it. Thanks for the whole movie team. <br/><br/>Story-wise, the movie seems average. The movies with the similar story are in abundance. But I know, those similar movies may never have special effects as good as this. How often do you get to see the whole street rotate? How often do you get to see the elements of the building constantly moving during the fight scene? How often do you get to see the city split, travel in fourth dimension? How often do fantasy and sci-fi blend so well that we have to find a new word for it? <br/><br/>The effects are executed very well. One might not enjoy it in small screen but while it's still playing in the theatres, 'Doctor Strange' is a must watch. Don't miss the chance to experience it. I highly recommend it."

","I rate this movie 10/10. In reality I wanna rate 9.5/10 but I can't choose that on website so I decided to rate 10. The first thing that I want you to do before go to see Doctor Strange is don't expect too much. I think the main reason that I love this movie is because I didn't expect too much (So if it's not good I won't feel terrible) Doctor Strange is a great movie in every way. The best thing of the movie is Visual Effects,they are really really good since the beginning. It will give you a feeling like when you go out of cinema and you look at a lot of buildings , you will feel like all of them will move or fall down like in the movie!!! And a plot is so great too! I love the way they tell the story of Doctor Stephen Strange because they made me understand him even I've never known his story before.And another one thing that I will talk about is our main actor,Benedict Cumberbatch. He is so amazing! He is a real DR.Strange! I can't imagine no one else in this role. His action,his feeling or the way he complains ,the way he talks,the way he does all of that is such an incredible thing.He is a very talented actor because he could make me forget the role of Sherlock Holmes and made me only think of him in the role of Doctor Stephen Strange. P.S. Others cast are also incredible too! I really like The Ancient One ,Mordo and Doctor Christine."

","You can rest assured that Doctor Strange is an astoundingly amazing movie and YES as good as any Marvel origin movie to date. I'm so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves and have not missed yet. The critics all agree (as if that matters) and they are single-handedly saving 2016 in movies.<br/><br/>This movie really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. It reinvents epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Then, they deliver visuals unlike anything that you've ever seen before. They certainly deliver a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun. This is, without a doubt going to be on everyone's top ten list come the end of the year. It's an origin movie for the ages."

","This film tells the story of a highly skilled, but also highly arrogant neurosurgeon who is severely injured in a car accident. He goes to the East to seek a guru who can heal the most severe injuries miraculously. After his arrival, he gets way more than he asked for.<br/><br/>I can honestly say, Marvel Studio has outdone themselves again. The computer graphics are spectacular. The scene in the trailer where New York City folds up and inverts itself already gets me fascinated, the extended treatment in the film simply makes me hold my breath literally because it is so amazing. The mirror dimension is just very cool, and basically everything visually is cool in the film.<br/><br/>The story is fast paced and engaging. The characters are likable, even Dr Strange in his former life. Tilda Swinton has this calming and regal quality in this role, that makes her very convincing as the Ancient One. I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>And don't miss the two post credit scenes!"

The movie should have finished as soon as Dr Strange acquires the eye of Agamotto and finds out he can control time.<br/><br/>From there on, he could just have just used that device to reverse time against the main villain and the movie would have ended!"

In my, perhaps not so humble, opinion - it's not very good.<br/><br/>It tries to be smarter than it is, with some pseudo sci-ency/mystical angle. And I can't see how the Avengers universe would benefit from more characters than it already has in it... It's bland enough as is, watered out for shareholders benefits.<br/><br/>There are better movies out there, this is just another attempt on milking the old Super Cow.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a good superhero movie, watch Dead Pool!<br/><br/>Don't believe all the Cumberpatch fans that really really wants this movie to work, it doesn't!"

","OK up to now it is clear as the sky that Marvel Cinematic Universe may never make a bad film for in eight years has put out 13 films and not a single one was disappointing, awful or bad, a bit underwhelming yes, not living up to its expectations yes but more than that ,nothing. And with the Sorcerer Supreme we are now in hits to losses 14 -0, damn.<br/><br/>So OK it was quit like Ironman meets Harry Potter, but the performances were spot on with Benedict Cumberbatch ,as it is common with this actor, becoming his role and convicted me that the mystic arts are in good hands with him, although he remind me a lot House. As for the rest of the team Mads Mikkelsen as the main villain ( Dude stop playing villains it doesn't end well for you, but you do it excellently so keep going) was good for Marvel standards and he would made Voldermord sake in his tunic(?). Even the love interest of the Doctor (not The Doctor) was not just there but she was truly moving the plot. Personally credits for that has to go to Rachel McAdams, she was an excellent choice for her job, after her take down of the Catholic Church in Spotlight.<br/><br/>To the effects,... I have years to see such since Inception, I mean OK they used the style of Inception but who cares, it was done in an awesome faction and I want more than that. It was a blast to watch such a beautiful and colorful scenes, that I felt a little bad that I didn't watch them in 3D.For costumes, I have only one thing to say, they were so much like their comic counterparts that I though they put them out of the pages and on to the scene.<br/><br/>But I have to be the Devil's Advocate and point out my minor in deed issues with Dr. Strange. The jokes weren't always on point and a little lesser some scenes and at times we got too much exposition. There are my only concerns with the movie, total nit pics!<br/><br/>All in all it is an awesome movie and if you can go watch on cinema, it worth every minute on them."
"amyramoon","10","3","7","12 November 2016"," Electrifying Intellectual Adventure
","As a long time admirer of Marvel, and the futurism science in all the stories, mixed in with divinity and human emotion, I was fairly impressed with this spectacle. Considering the top notch lightning quick actors, the dazzling special effects as is the expectation for this time and age, and the careful direction, I have very little to complain about. If I were to make it better, I couldn't, mostly considering I'm not a expert actress, director, choreographer, story teller, writer, or musician. While I do have a little talent in all of the above, as an observer, this movie would be better if it were longer, so the movie makers could further enhance everything that makes it so effective already. If you will be viewing this title for the first time, be prepared for a quick decisive acerbically witty action movie, with a dash of intellectual spirituality. The mind can heal the body!"
"monstermayhem32","9","3","7","10 November 2016"," A great film
","While Doctor strange may not be the more well known of the marvel properties like Spider- Man, captain America, or iron man but I will admit that the movie turned out to be a better surprise than anticipated. I would say the casting of bendict cumberbatch best known for his Sherlock Holmes role is great in the role as Stephen strange who is a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon whose life is forever changed after a car accident which leaves him with nerve damage to his hands. Despite his best attempts to get an experimental surgery to restore the use of his hands, it doesn't want and finds out from mordo in a place called shambala in which he learns about the mystical world and the ability to astral project and discover the infinite universes. Though there was some controversy regarding Tilda Swindon as the ancient one due to what was conceived as white washing but she does a great job in the role bringing a balance of wisdom and humor."
"triggerhappy-63862","9","3","7","10 November 2016"," Different in a good way
","As far as it goes for the marvel cinematic universe, I am pretty easily impressed. I have seen all of the movies and have thought that they were all really good (except for Thor: The Dark World, that one was not good at all to me). I walked into the theater for this movie knowing that I would probably be impressed once again, but when I walked out, I was going crazy about how good this really was. I will admit that it does follow the basic formula for the story that was made but it goes beyond that by providing amazing visuals and a really good performances from Benedict Cumberbatch. I knew he was an awesome pick for the part in the first place, but I did not expect him to play a character that could be more arrogant yet funny in the movie. The visuals were also astounding. Whenever there was an action scene in the movie, it was really cool to watch them fight using magic. Overall, while Doctor Strange may follow the basic MCU formula we have come to expect, it goes beyond that by having moments of humor, cool visuals, and good performances from Cumberbatch and the rest of the cast. In the end, it was different, but I mean that in the best of ways."
"Taidehaamu","6","3","7","7 November 2016"," Just above average. But deffiantly worth seeing.
","Before reading this review note that I enjoyed the movie and left it feeling positive, this review is meant as constructive criticism of the parts I didn't enjoy.<br/><br/>Can we just stop regarding marvel as a brave experiment? It seem like every movie they make, no matter how formulated and generic, is regarded as an experimental masterpiece. This circle of press hype about the brave new idea of basing a movie on an obscure comic book character with a silly name is getting tiring. <br/><br/>Now to the movie. As you would know through the excessive marketing Doctor Strange is the new Marvel superhero movie staring Benedict Cumberbatch as an top level Doctor with an attitude problem who, after getting to a car crash, gets trained to become a wizard, or something.<br/><br/>Oh and he also fights some bad guy in the end.<br/><br/>The movie follows the normal marvel formula of devoting the first half of the movie to an origin story and then rushing the end with an underdeveloped villain, in order to get an end fight scene. This movies villain of the week is rogue wizard master played by Mads Mikkelsen, who wants to give earth to an even more under developed villain.<br/><br/>To service this story there is some comedy that feels way more forced than usual. And some hand to hand action that is shot in the usual incomprehensible quick cut style. But the main attraction in this movie is not the comedy nor the action it's the ""mind blowing visual effects"" that make this movie worth seeing for those alone. The effects reference/steal from everyone ranging from Erik Johansson, Cyriak, HC Escher to Kubrick and Wachowski sisters. Creating an interesting and versatile landscape of psychedelic fuckery. And wow does this feel refreshing after a summer of movies using cgi to its lamest potential ranging from cgi turtles to cgi ghosts. To finally see cgi being used to push the limits of possible. <br/><br/>I'm so glad that the summer is over."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","3","7","6 November 2016"," The Infinite Possibility
","In ""Doctor Strange"" The Ancient One played by Tilda Swinton implores Stephen Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who suffers to save his very soul, ""Surrender, Stephen."" Stephen must surrender to not knowing anything. Only then, can he begin to reclaim his power and his life. This is an awesome surprise. Director Scott Derrickson's ""Doctor Strange"" is about transformation in the guise of an action movie, done with a sense of humor. Cumberbatch's Strange invents himself when the old definition of himself no longer works, and in fact is killing him. This invention is perhaps, the most noble of human pursuits. Capturing the poignancy with a sense of humor and ""Beyonce'"" jokes possesses an enlightened sensibility. ""Doctor Strange"" aspires for the heavens and never takes itself too seriously. <br/><br/>Acknowledge Derrickson, Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill for writing the brilliant story based on the comic book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. Signatures of the 1960's comic book materialize in the mind-bending psychedelic visuals. The ""Doctor Strange"" comics debuted during the time of Timothy Leary and the consciousness expansion movement. This ""Doctor Strange"" is visually masterful. With the folding metropolis visuals, and M.C. Escher generated mazes, Derrickson one ups Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"". His story is homage to the hero origin of Nolan's ""Batman Begins"". The exquisite martial arts sequences remind of the grace of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and the fluidity of ""The Matrix"". ""Doctor Strange"" is still uniquely its own about powerful sorcerers defending the world from mystical threats on infinite planes of existence. Here this is done sans drugs, happily. <br/><br/>Cumberbatch and Swinton have profound magic together. Marvel is astounding in choosing amazing actors, who transcend the medium with grace and humanity. Even with spectacular showcase battles of good and evil, the best scene occurs in the New York emergency room with Strange and The Ancient One. The Ancient One touchingly tells Strange what she sees beyond his arrogance and fear. I was in tears with the resolve. Noble ideas and powerful actors truly make ""Doctor Strange"" special. <br/><br/>Much has been discussed about casting Swinton as The Ancient One, originally written as an Asian character. I am Japanese American, aware of the sensitivity of the issue. I think Swinton is the best actor cast, and she delivers the message of nobility in all of us.<br/><br/>""Doctor Strange"" has somewhat of a trite beginning. Trite in the sense that we see the possibility of the world class jerk becoming the selfless hero. Dr. Stephen Strange is the brilliant egotistical neurosurgeon caught up in his own celebrity. He is handsome, rich, and virtually immortal. His arrogance alienated his true love Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), a courageous ER doctor. McAdams is amazing; her Christine allows us to see the good man in Strange beneath it all. Unfortunately, she isn't leveraged more. She has a heartbreaking scene with Strange, whose self pity destroys all. <br/><br/>Strange suffers a devastating car accident resulting in irreparable nerve damage to his hands. His career is over. His definition of himself is no longer. Having exhausted all surgical and rehabilitation avenues, Strange seeks out Jonathan Pangborn (solid Benjamin Bratt). Pangborn was a paraplegic, who miraculously cured himself. He instructs Strange to learn from The Ancient One in Kamar-Taj in Nepal. Strange travels to Kathmandu. He befriends Mordo (charismatic and calm Chiwetel Ejiofor), a powerful sorcerer warrior. He accompanies Stephen to The Ancient One, who is Sorcerer Supreme—protector of our realm from dimensional evil. The Ancient One sees possibility in Stephen, but his biggest obstacle is himself. <br/><br/>The Ancient One's best disciple Kaecilius (dangerous Mads Mikkelsen) has gone rogue, murdering his own and stealing a page from the magic book of Elders. The spells empower him to control time and serve the omnipotent Dormammu. Kaecilius is ruthless; however, he is a compelling villain in that his motives are laced with worthy intentions. The Ancient One may have also compromised herself in the battle of good and evil. ""Doctor Strange"" is about the Yin and Yang of the universes. Strange accepts the greater good and the consequences. His dear friend and protector Mordo can only see the dark and light. Balance lies in compassion and acceptance. There is no Yin and Yang in the extremes which is prophetic.<br/><br/>""Doctor Strange"" is a great movie. Michio Kaku said that there may be infinite number of universes, much like the Multiverse of ""Doctor Strange"". There is both wonder and comfort in this. The Ancient One saw infinite possibility in Stephen Strange. Perhaps ""Doctor Strange"" asks us see the infinite possibility within ourselves."

So far, because certain things need to happen that will turn the Doctor into a real guardian of the magic world.<br/><br/>-The effects are awesome.<br/><br/>BAD THINGS:<br/><br/>-The time-line of the MCU is having problems, since Dr. Strange was mentioned in other movies when wasn't magician yet.<br/><br/>-There is not good villain for this movie, but I think this is not totally wrong since it would be a lot for one movie.<br/><br/>-Too much jokes, and I am not saying that jokes are bad or something.

"RyanTesone","9","3","7","5 November 2016"," Marvel has done it again with an unusually-appealing acid trip
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>Marvel has done it again! Doctor Strange was a spectacular film that certainly deserves to be in the uppermost tiers of all existing Marvel Entertainment films. Though still lower on my ""ranking lists"" than Civil War, Doctor Strange has proved yet again that Marvel Studios can, and still will for years and years to come, continue to make coherent single-universe films that are all individual stories by themselves yet still manage to connect to the greater encompassing cinematic universe.<br/><br/>The greatest takeaway that I had from this film were the visuals, and I don't overstate anything here. The visual effects are, in my humble opinion, the most flattering and beautiful that I have seen in any Marvel film to-date (MCU or not). For such a ""strange"" concept, nobody would have imagined that such overwhelming visuals and computer-generated effects would function as seamlessly as they did. One other thing that should be noted is that you really should avoid LSD before walking into the auditorium to see this film, however (but this is a good thing! Because it was all a gorgeous joy-ride!)<br/><br/>Deriving from the visual effects comes the action. These action sequences were unique; the first of their kind. While there was still a lot of punching and kicking involved, the dependence on extraordinary magical/spiritual abilities adds a lot of sugar to the mixture in the best way conceivable. Watching the main characters literally flip cities dimensionally, conjure fantastical whips, and screw around with the concept of time in the midst of battle was quite a sight to see. Each and every one of the physical primary conflict sequences in the film fairly-surpassed anything I have seen from Marvel as of yet on a visual and spectacular level, and that is very-much a positive note.<br/><br/>As per usual, this isn't a full review without mention of the characters. Stephen Strange's origin was very-much highly- reminiscent of Tony Stark and Scott Lang: beginning the film as a jerk with an inflated ego, he grows on a psychological basis as the film progresses and ultimately saves the day (surprise, surprise....). I did like his characterization a lot and look forward to seeing him more in Infinity War. The other main characters weren't exactly anything special, but they were passable. The Ancient One is calm and collected yet still badass, Mordo's development is setting the stage for future villainy, and Wong provided grounds for Strange's snark. Yet, among these characters, Kaecillius (the active antagonist of the film) wasn't a heck of a lot more fascinating than some of the other lesser-appreciated Marvel Cinematic Universe antagonists (these include Ronan, Yellowjacket, and Malekith to name a few), but he was very- much an exciting character to watch in combat, as his aptitude for ""flipping"" the physical realm into convoluted and unearthly dimensions was an eye-opening sight to behold as Strange and co. fought against him. <br/><br/>And finally, Kaecillius' presence paves the road for Dormammu: either the highlight or the subzero aspect of the film as varying opinions online and elsewhere are made vocal. While he can easily be mistaken for another Thanos (being deep-voiced and intent on consuming the Earth while manipulating beings of inferior power doesn't help), I thought he was an awesome addition to this already- pleasing movie. And what made his presence greater was the fact that, wait for it, he wasn't nerfed! He was portrayed as perhaps the most powerful MCU character at the moment, superior to even Thanos.<br/><br/>So while still not quite up-to-par with Civil War, Doctor Strange was yet another fine installment in the MCU, to my delight. Really hopeful to see where this series goes in the future! It gets a 9/10 from me."
"thesar-2","6","3","7","5 November 2016"," Inception Begins
","""Wake up, Bruce. You're not in a dream of a dream of a dream. You are The One"" <br/><br/>Okay, not an actual quote from this movie, but since this is basically 50/50 Batman Begins and Inception, it might as well be. <br/><br/>Dr. Strange is just that, but as the movie progresses, mercifully, things made more sense. Though, unfortunately, what makes it better is what takes away from itit's just too damn long. As mentioned, it's 50% Batman Begins, only the scenes for him to become the Marvel® character he is unknown for, felt like the first Christopher Nolan/Bruce Wayne film stretched to two movies.<br/><br/>And speaking of Christopher Nolan, how did he not direct this? If the movie's not the Doctor learning his new powers, it's the entire city altering scenes from Inception. The only thing missing was that loud, pounding score.<br/><br/>I digress. The movie is actually pretty good, thanks to some humor, actors who were perfect for their roles and seamless CGI that never once looked fake. Well done, guys. Additionally, the story is fairly good, dialogue acceptable and the movie knew when enough was enough with whatever landscaped special effects exposition was happening.<br/><br/>Basically, the Doctor whono one's heard of mirrors Dr. House after an accident and seeks out non-Asian Tilda Swinton to teach him the ways of infinity and beyond. Naturally, there has to be a threat and Batman, er, Strange must learn to rid his shortcomings to end the movie as if he was in a Thor spin off. <br/><br/>I saw some young kids in the audience during my screening. Bad choice. Not that this is an adult comic book movie, à la Deadpool, even though it has more swearing than most I've seen. It's just a ton of talking, adult themed problems and little to relate to the little ones. Sure there are many spectacular visuals, some dumbed down humor and the Marvel® name attached to it, but I can't see this being understood for anyone under probably 10-11 years of age. <br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed this, my problem with these kinds of movies/characters with almost infinite power, is where do you go from here? While the movie was wrapping up, I kept thinking of all the other Marvel® movie's climaxes that could've been solved in seconds with Dr. Strange's powers. Where's the fun in that? The fun of those movies is having our heroes figure out how to defeat the bad guy by using both their super powers and weaknesses. Dr. Strange merely has to all-but wave his hand and problem solved. No fun in that!<br/><br/>Still, it's worth a watch, not in the bottom of the Marvel® Cinematic Universe, but also not in the top half.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Still hate those post credit scenes, and now they usually have a minimum of two, upwards of THREE! Mercifully, they put the first one only about a minute or two into the post credits, so I stayed for that one. I have no idea what happened 10 minutes later for the second one, and frankly, I don't care. You make your movie too long, such as this one, I want out. (I will, however, find it online, or catch it on my second viewing at home. At least, I can fast-forward/skip to that last one.)"

","After seeing trailer it was like this could be some new powerful story and it definitely was. Doctor Strange is a real doctor that had an accident and in his disability in operating anymore because of his hands unable to keep still in desperation he turns to The Ancient One. It changed his abilities and it was amazing to see how he just keep getting stronger. Marvel did a great job and easily explained his constant growth of power with his learning and photographic memory that allows him that. Fights between Kaecilius and protectors of Earth is just amazing, CGI is absolutely mad and crazy good with all changing of world it just magnifies everything and creates this insanely good scenes. Dark side scene were Strange is trying to drive it mad is very good and very clever. Benedict was absolutely great as he plays Strange with so much power, emotions and it was incredible. Mads as a main villain is perfect, he is such a good actor and has proved it but he lacks of more movies made but with his talent he could be one of greatest actors. Movie is absolutely hilarious with just enough comedic stuff inside and great plot. Only thing setting movie down is some of the characters felt like they were left behind and some of the CGI scenes may seem confusing with all that world altering scenes. This is one big hit for Marvel with great character introductions. 3.5/4"

Rachel McAdams was, I felt, wasted in the movie save for a little bit of comic element.<br/><br/>The movie lays out all the important elements of the comic books revolving around Dr. Strange: Lost pages of Vishanti, rise of Baron Mordo, Dormammu, etc. and yet lives up to the Marvel's cinematic standards of action packed and rocking VFX (which by the way surpasses a whole new level, better than the Guardians of Galaxy and Ant-Man). Special credit to Ben Davis and his team. Music by Michael Giacchino is cool and fits the action sequences well.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie not only introduces the world of mystic arts but also introduces the time gem and hence completes the entire set of infinity stones, priming up for the infinity wars that lie ahead making obvious that Dr. Strange will be a huge part of the team."

I'm informing you that when you see a 1-4 star reviews, you should check their profile and see if they're one of the biased butthurt fanboys or neutral individual. Actors played their characters well and true to the comics. The movie is missing dates, you don't really know when stuff is happening, how long certain scenes take, it feels a little rushed.

"socrates99","9","3","7","4 November 2016"," Occasionally exhilarating is much more than I expected
","I remember reading Dr Strange comic books when I was a kid. They seemed unusually daring back then, and this entertaining movie brings up vivid memories of the experience. You would think after all these years it would have been exceeded many times, but it hasn't. The idea of the metaphysical is still one we don't deal with convincingly; it continues to be scary and unreachable. And that makes the creation of the Dr Strange character even more impressive as it imagines us actually working at the nexus of our world and the other with nothing more than sheer imagination to guide us.<br/><br/>Normally I'd bet no one had the imagination to do that well, but I'd be wrong. Apparently Steve Ditko, with the help of Stan Lee, did have the imagination in spades. The comic book and now this movie is a fun exploration of magical themes where a reluctant Dr Strange finds himself drafted into the fight. It takes him repeated efforts to learn how to excel in the dark arts but he proves a worthy student and it's an enjoyable journey.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent choice for the lead. And the supporting cast does their jobs well. With the possible exception of the recurring circle of sparks (a little underwhelming) all the special effects are top notch. Tilda Swinton who I've seen in person, is notable as the impossibly good-looking Ancient One who just happens to be as bald as a cue ball. I really can't imagine any other woman looking as natural and attractive as her without a wisp of hair on her head.<br/><br/>All in all a good time at the movies. Oh and stay until the credits run out, there are a couple of last gasps you should see."

An extra 15 to 20 minutes while Benedict Cumberbatch was Dr. Strange and while training to be Doctor Strange would have been a lot better. Also the first fight between Doctor Strange and Kaecilius was a bit silly in a Mace Windu kind of way. My only other complaint is the second stinger with Mordo. It made no sense to me at all.<br/><br/>With that all said Benedict Cumberbatch and especially Tilda Swinton gave amazing performances. The highlight of the movie for me though was Wong played by Benedict Wong."

"RforFilm","9","3","7","4 November 2016"," Doctor Strange has put a spell on us with a fun hero, amazing visuals, and a new door to the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","I was at Disneyland the other day and saw that the line to meet Spider-Man and Captain America had stretched to over an hour at the busiest of times. If someone were to tell me that before Disney bought Marvel Comics, I would have honestly laughed in their faces. But who would have thought that the mouse house working with the capes ended up being the best thing for each other? Had it not been for Disney, we would have not gotten some of the recent output of films like The Avengers, Captain America: Civil War, Ant-Man, and my favorite, Guardians of the Galaxy. <br/><br/>For the Marvel cinematic universe to continue, they have to keep going into areas not yet explored. Most mainstream people are not going to read the comics, which details not just a universe, but a vast multiverse that makes the movies seem ant sized. Ant-Man gave us our first glimpse into the multiverse when the title hero shrunk himself smaller then molecules. What we're not shown is the dimensional side of the Marvel Universe, which contains elements of magic, fantasy, and even existentialism. That bridge is finally crossed when we're given our newest hero, Doctor Strange. <br/><br/>Stephen Strange (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is a successful neurosurgeon, but a very arrogant and egotistical person with little compassion for those around him, including coworker and former lover Christine (played by Rachel McAdams). He gets in a car accident that severs both of his hands. When experimental surgeries and rehab don't seem to be working, he's lead to a paraplegic who somehow regained his ability to walk. Strange is told by this guy to go find Kamar- Taj. In Nepal, Strange finds his way to a monastery where another sorcerer Mordo (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) takes him to see his teacher.<br/><br/>The Ancient One (played by Tilda Swinton) reveals her power to Strange, showing him an infinite cosmos of other dimensions and of the astral plane. Despite his arrogance, she agrees to teach him. He reads several books about the mythic arts and practices daily, hoping that he will regains the full use of his hands. Strange's abilities are advancing at a quick pace, giving question to the Ancient One on how he might have what it takes to become a sorcerer supreme. A former student of the Ancient One, Kaecilius (played by Mads Mikkelsen) summons an entity from the Dark Dimension called the Dormammu to destroy the planet, leading Strange into battle.<br/><br/>Where was this during the summertime? Doctor Strange feels like that blockbuster that everyone had been waiting for in the summer but never got. As a Marvel movie, not only does this stand alone (I didn't see that many references to the other heroes), but it has a very different feel from the others. I'd say that's on the hands of director Scott Derrickson (Sinister, The Exorcism of Emily Rose), who manages to create some of the craziest visuals for a super hero story. Some might compare a lot of the imagery to Inception, but this does enough to make it it's own.<br/><br/>Everyone's been saying, so yea, Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect person for this role who reminded me of Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man; he has a similar ego and sense of humor. I can't wait to see this guy join in with the Avengers. The majority of the cast is great too, especially Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is being set up for something bigger. Like a lot of the other Marvel movies, the villain again isn't that memorable (why do they keep having this problem!) and we can only hope that we'll eventually get a good one besides Loki from Thor, Kingpin from Daredevil, and Killgrave from Jessica Jones.<br/><br/>I'll give this nine levitating cloaks out of ten. Doctor Strange is a fun door into Marvel territory that is probably the best adaptation of the character. I haven't read his comic stories, but seeing this movie made me want to go down to see what other adventures the Doctor has been on.<br/><br/>Note- This was spectacular in 3D and I highly recommend you catch it in this format, though you'll still get a fun experience in 2D."
"MiaRaghavi","9","3","7","4 November 2016"," MCU explores endless possibilities
","One can head to the nearest IMAX until next month perhaps, if they are seeking a mind-altering, psychedelic experience. No drugs needed for this trip.<br/><br/>Scott Derrickson and the writers have done an extraordinary job in telling Strange's origin story in such an ingenious plot. A highly successful neurosurgeon cannot accept failure and hence only takes up treatable, yet challenging cases; brilliantly ends up enduring a spate of failures. The various intriguing symbolisms in the film reminds me of Cinema Paradiso, one of my all- time favourites. The film would also remind one of The Matrix for sure.<br/><br/>The screenplay is simply scintillating. Instead of making Strange a total jerk (to others in the movie) as in the comics (apparently), they made him less of an ass and more likable, and still a jerk initially. He tries to be funny and even makes jokes. Yet Strange can totally pass for a serious (read high-functioning) sociopath, a role that would come very naturally to Benedict Cumberbatch.<br/><br/>Speaking of Cumberbatch, although I am not a ""Cumberbabe"", I must say that Benedict Cumberbatch trying so hard to pull off a American accent is rather cute. Every time I caught him say a word in his native accent, it was a ""Ha!"" moment. Impeccable effort by the actor though, seriously, and his acting in the film is top-notch.<br/><br/>I need to find an adjective better than the best of adjectives to describe the cinematography. Even the ordinary scenes have some mind-blowing shots. Even the very first frame of the film is marvellous and Strange's intro is hilarious and fantastic. And even the new Marvel opening logo animation is superb. Marvel Cinematic Universe has truly explored the 'endless possibilities' in this film.<br/><br/>Like many others, I did not like the casting of Tilda Swinton in the place of an Asian master. Furthermore, a few elements of the plot could seem difficult to comprehend, but it will all make sense during the second and following viewings, I'm sure. It may be like how every time I watch Nolan's Inception, something new and interesting dawns on me. Well, I'm already prepped for 'having a nice trip' a second 'time'."
"okletmereviewit","9","3","7","4 November 2016"," One heck of a ride
","I went to see Doctor Strange last night and let me tell you, it was one hell of a ride. I saw it in 3D which is the only way I will watch movies nowadays, because its so immersive and makes the movie really come alive, at least in my opinion. Marvel Studios did a really amazing job on capturing the essence of this movie. If you want a good idea on how it is, think The Matrix meets Inception, meets Harry Potter.<br/><br/>If you don't know the story of Doctor Strange, well let me fill you in. Dr. Steven Strange was a brilliant neurosurgeon, and an egotist. In the movie, we find Doctor Strange (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) washing up to perform brain surgery. His prideful, ways have him showboating the surgery by not waiting for any imaging equipment and dislodging a bullet from the brain of a person who was thought to be dead.<br/><br/>After he has preformed a miracle surgery, he is rushing through traffic to go to a gala, when he hits another car, and crashes. In the process of crashing he crushes his hands, the very tools to which he was made famous for. After countless surgeries and experimental procedures he is left in destitute.<br/><br/>He then begins to wander the city and comes across a man who had sever spinal cord injury and was supposed to never walk again, but was and playing basketball, who tells him of a spiritual retreat that he went on in order to heal himself. Using what money he has left Dr. Strange flies to Kathmandu to search out this mystical temple and its healer.<br/><br/>He wanders the streets of Kathmandu, looking for any signs of where this holy temple may be. Getting desperate, and weary of looking. He makes a fated turn down a back alley street, where he is assaulted by a group of Pick Pockets, who target him as easy prey. They are quickly dispatched as Mordo (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) beats them down, thus saving Strange from certain death by the hands of petty thugs.<br/><br/>Mordo takes Dr. Strange to the temple, explaining that The Ancient One (played by Tilda Swinton) may be able to help him, but that he would have to be very humble in asking for help. Dr. Strange with his medical, and scientific knowledge, begins to dismiss the teachings and workings of The Ancient One, as no more than metaphysical BS. The Ancient One then sends Dr. Strange on a quick out of body journey throughout the multiverse the whole time narrating the journey with deep wisdom. And then quickly after he is brought back from this journey he is banished to the streets and the doors locked behind him. Begging and pleading for hours, Mordo convinces The Ancient One to accept him for training.<br/><br/>Through what can be assumed as months of training, Dr. Steven Strange begins learning the mystical arts and excelling at a phenomenal rate. While studying he discovers The Eye of Agamotto. A powerful talisman capable of augmenting time and space. He then uses it to reveal the missing pages of a manuscript, and discovers that The Ancient One has been harnessing energies from a dark dimension to prolong her life, and a realm of a dimensional being known as Dormammu. Dormammu wants nothing else than to absorb the Earth into his being and make it part of the dark dimension. Doctor Strange then learns that Dormammu's henchmen are devising a plot to overtake 3 power houses throughout the world, in order to allow his reign of power to be complete. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange then must battle Kaecilius (played by Mads Mikkelsen) a former student of The Ancient One, and top disciple of Dormammu, for control of the Sanctum's (three mystical power houses that create a magical shield that protects the earth). This is the point in the movie where Steven begins to really take point and understand the extent of the power that he has learned. An epic magical battle of the wills ensues where Dr. Strange, Mordo, and Kaecillius, all take the the streets of New York in 'Mirror Dimension' where Kaecillius bends space and time to create an augmented reality (if you have seen Inception this is where they flip the world upside down and sideways and things get really visually intense), The battle of wills continues until finally The Ancient One joins the fight and battles her former pupil in a no holds battle. She is then critically injured and all of reality returns to normal. As she lays dying in a hospital room, she and Strange exchange an emotional yet sagely goodbye on the Astral Plane. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange returns to the New York Sanctum only to find that it had been destroyed. He and Mordo go to Hong Kong, the where they discover that the last Sanctum has fallen and that Dormammu is in the process of over taking the Earth with help from his lackey Kaecillius. Acting on instinct and whim, Doctor Strange uses The Eye of Agamotto to turn back time and restore the city and Sanctum back to its original form, when Kaecillius breaks the spell and concentration of Doctor Strange. DS then flies into the heart of the dark dimension bringing along with him The Eye of Agamotto, where he then traps Dormammu and himself in an endless time loop. Driving Dormammu mad realizing that he is trapped inside of time and no longer existing outside of time. Strange strikes a bargain that Dormammu will retreat from the Earth and take with him all of his followers never to return again, to which a defeated and angry Dormammu agrees and calls back his forces. The movie ends with Doctor Strange taking up the mantel of Sorcerer Supreme."
"zdedyomix","6","3","7","4 November 2016"," NON-SPOILER - Could have been so much better.
","First off, I liked the film. It's good, not great. Excellent visuals obviously, but this film was definitely dipped into that Disney glaze. Having read the comics, Doctor Strange is a dark character, dealing with his demons, and he faces dark situations. There was entirely too much comedy in this film. I felt like I was watching a Disney comedy at a point at it took me out of the rest of the film, because I knew the stakes wouldn't be there anymore. A LOT of the comedic relief just did not work and really should have been left out, and this film would have been damn-near perfect, with the perfect tone fitting the situations surrounding them. GREAT score, some fine action sequences, GREAT cast and performances across the board, and superb written dialogue for Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo, Benedict Wong's Wong, and especially Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One. She stole the show for me, which is saying something, because I was on the fence about her casting from day 1. This film starts off mature, for adults, but then turns into a child's Disney film."
"fagsouza","10","3","7","4 November 2016"," The Doctor's in. Literally.
","I'll admit, when I first saw the trailers for Doctor Strange, I stepped backwards a bit fearing it was going to be Marvel's first fumble, for all those reasons you could imagine - It was using the same distortion styles as Inception, the story didn't seem appealing and not even the cast, a very well picked one, BTW, would be able to hold it... At least, on this judgment alone, I thought this one would crash on take-off.<br/><br/>I'm relieved to tell you this take-off wasn't just successful, this one is probably the best trip you'll ever take on your life. The visuals are fantastic, the action is great, the acting is spot-on and even the comedy hits all the timings here. Despite comparisons with Inception, for it's visual style, or the origin story being a hybrid between Tony Stark and Thor, there's something incredibly organic in this one, only feeling forced or rushed at very specific points. That's about the only chink in the armor for this story, it's perfectly fine and Scott Derrickson does everything he can with it.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch killed as Doctor Strange, this was a role MEANT for him. Yes, yes, there's the comparison with what we've seen in Thor and Iron Man, but it's an origin story, I accepted we can't get away with this and, besides, this origin is virtually the same as in the comics, well, sort of, as I said it's a bit rushed. But back to BC and how great he was in this - He can be arrogant and a tad selfish, but you relate with this guy. He's an ass at times, but you can see he does wish to do good. And the best of all, you accept and even BELIEVE his transformation along the movie, you feel like the same could happen to you if you took a trip to Nepal. Other actors also stand out pretty well in this, like McAdams, Wong, Ejiofor, and even Swinton, they all take command of their timings and weave a good impression in every scene, something I've rarely seen in any other movie. They make you laugh, they'll make you drop a tear or two and even make up a basic, but still pretty much believable drama.<br/><br/>The visuals and ideas are simply surreal, in all the good definitions of them, and they're totally exploited here. The idea that your world can be distorted and twisted upside down, the idea that you can manipulate time with a relative ease, the idea that you can easily make up a large or smaller portal, the idea you can literally troll your enemies with magic (The final scene is literally an example), everything is done here to not only leave an impression, but make it memorable at it's core idea. That and the excellent soundtrack, courtesy of Michael Giacchino, whom already earned his place for his works in Inside Out, Jurassic World and the Star Trek reboot.<br/><br/>The only big nitpick in this, and it's more of a nitpick than a problem, is that Mads Mikkelsen's role really could've used a LOT more time, to exploit his backgrounds and build up a lot more character. I mean, one thing the trailers showed us was a Khan vs Hannibal, and we kind of got that, but the ground could've been prepared more for the villain, something we all accepted Marvel is rarely good at. With a bit more of time, Mikkelsen could've killed it, too.<br/><br/>But still, it's a nitpick, and it doesn't spoil what's virtually a great comic book movie, one that's on par with the standards Civil War set and successfully kickstarts Phase 3 of the MCU. What can I say but 'Come right up, 'coz the Doctor's in.'"
"jvictor-07224","10","3","7","4 November 2016"," Another piece of cake! And what a cake!
","The film follows the same old Marvel's cake recipe. With doses of adrenaline and inserted comic reliefs. Dr Strange has indeed a darker tone than the films of Marvel, however nothing compared to what the trailers promised. (Such as civil war). The new character and his universe is introduced masterfully, but sin to explain certain other matters, such as the black dimension for example ... Nothing hinders the experience of the film, because we have to take into account that it is for all public. Certainly the maximum point of the film is its visual! It is simply marvelous. It is worth checking in a good Imax room!"
"pramodidentity-564-350671","9","3","7","4 November 2016"," It's a strange world mystic journey but it's Doctor Strange ;) yes you want it!!!!
","Benedict Cumberbatch is no way stranger to doctor strange, he nailed it! This movie going to add a completely new persona and edge to marvel universe, the magic, the cosmos, the unknown is no more unknown to marvel cinematic universe now. It's a big step to infinity war, and from here things are going to be changed. Throughout the movie, you will keep engaging and exploring the unknown world which keeps questioning the reality and the existence of the things the way we see it. It's a wonderful journey of the mystic world and a new ingredient in marvel's avengers series, Thor was just being but this is enormous and bizarre intriguing. Rachel McAdams's role was not much but she did total justice. This is the treat for the marvel cinematic universe and Benedict's fans. 3d effects and actions are authentic and enjoyable if you will watch in IMAX then it will be awesome. Some people will try to compare it will previous marvel movies, but you shouldn't as it's a new thing which all the fans have been waiting for. Even though you are not a fan of marvel's series which I highly doubt, you going to the enjoy this mystic journey! Just go watch it folks. it's strange but it's Doctor Strange ;)"
"parleon-thedon","9","3","7","4 November 2016"," Doctor Strange - review: Awe-Inspiring
","I went into this movie with low expectations. I don't read comic books, and so I know absolutely nothing about Doctor Strange.<br/><br/>I had fun with this movie. The action, the set-pieces, and the special effects are truly spectacular. I was in awe during the action scenes.<br/><br/>The story is easy to follow. It's about one man on his quest to become the sorcerer supreme. I enjoyed Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, and I thought he was great as the title character. Tilda Swinton gave a stellar performance. She played her part with some conviction. Chiwetel Ejiofor was great. His character had some layers. Mads Mikkelsen was good in the movie, and he played his part (did his job). I understood his motivation. Rachel McAdams is efficient in her role, but she doesn't get to do much, and her involvement doesn't change or add anything to the story. Doctor Strange gets more screen time and development. Ejiofor's character gets some backbone that does add layers to the story. Mikkelsen's character has a plot, and at times it feels like his plot is justified. Everyone's actions here speak out during the movie. They all have cause for what they're fighting for, and so their actions make sense (even the villains).<br/><br/>I liked this movie from beginning to end. At first, I thought it felt uneventful, but as it progressed it slowly started to become engaging.<br/><br/>The Doctor Strange movie is fun, clever, witty, gripping (at times), the action scenes are compelling, and as a whole it's spectacle.<br/><br/>I had no real problems here except that I felt some story points felt slightly rushed. I wanted to spend more time with the characters during certain parts of the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, Doctor Strange is fun, witty, spectacular, awe-inspiring, but most importantly it's filled with depth and story.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A"
"dave_maguire","7","3","7","4 November 2016"," Strange left me feeling strange
","So the next Marvel superhero makes his entrance in to the MCU, Doctor Strange is here, and I couldn't wait for it! <br/><br/>Being that many people, my self included aren't that well versed in the Doctor Strange lore the film is an obligatory origin story of how the brilliant neurosurgeon Stephen Strange goes from saving people on an operating table to become the ""sorcerer supreme"". The story wastes no time in getting on with the story and, after a short period where he demonstrates his brilliance in his profession he is involved in a car crash of his own making - let that be a lesson to keep your phone off when you drive folks - he struggles to find anyway to repair his hands through western medicine and goes off to find alternate healing in the east - and so begins the transformation to a sorcerer.<br/><br/>The visuals in the film as you'd expect from the trailer are stunning, with the world bending effects giving you a taste of what it would be like if LSD & crack had a baby. They convey the powers they are displaying very well, even if at sometimes you get a little confused. However on the flip side of it I thought the visuals for Dormammu were terrible and thought he looked awful - in fact he reminded me of Master Control from the original Tron film!? The cast is also very strong, with all the lead characters putting in brilliant performances throughout the film.<br/><br/>However, I left the cinema feeling somewhat ""meh"". The film was very strongly an origin story and, as a result I found the plot a little thin, and whilst the pacing of the film was good the pacing of the PLOT seemed a little strange at times. For example it is established at the start of the film that Kaecilius (A decent enough villain, but not involved in the film enough to be developed) is trying to contact the dark dimension, however he seems to take a break for a while to allow the ancient one to train Dr Strange up from nothing to a fairly competent sorcerer before he continues with his quest. Also Strange goes from being unable to conjure any spells to a master in very little screen time, now I grew up watching Rocky movies so you'll know I love a good montage! But all we get is a couple of clips of him stealing books from the library (Which is against the sorcerers ways) and also practicing spells from master sorcerer books that's he ""not good enough to use"" and ""are forbidden to read"" (which made me wonder why there weren't any sort of magic locks on them to stop anyone looking at them). I also found the comedy in this film just fell a bit flat. I'm not expecting it to be a laugh a minute movie but comedy and ""witty banter"" are a staple of the marvel films and all have worked well in previous movies, but some one liners & jokes seemed to miss their mark. I don't know exactly why this was but there weren't many people laughing out loud in the screening.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the film as well it seems to fall foul of showing all the best bits in the trailers as aside from the fantastic opening battle there is very little else to show, with even my friend pointing out there appears to be more running away than actual fighting in the film, with his cape kicking more ass than the Doctor does. <br/><br/>The 3rd act seemed a little weak as well with Kaecilius outing the ancient one to Strange as a user of dark magic, only for her to appear in the very next scene with the mark on her head confirming this, which isn't really explained by her either, and almost makes you side with Mordo on his feelings. And the final battle just seemed a bit odd, and I was a little confused and surprised at how easily he manages to play Dormammu, who comes off as a bit of an idiot in the end. I Didn't expect him to be in it as much as he was and I really hope this isn't the only time we see him in the MCU.<br/><br/>So whilst there some good points and a lot in the film to enjoy I just found myself a little disappointed overall with it and, ironically enough left the cinema feeling a little.....Strange."
"drawlife","8","3","7","4 November 2016"," Familiar origin story, but with a lot of awesome magic.
","Marvel finally embraces its magic and mysticism and it delivers. <br/><br/>I had a blast with this film, but however it felt way too familiar. Beat for beat it's as if it used the first Iron Man as a blueprint, with minor subtle differences, the obvious being the usage of sorcery and magic. Strange in a way goes through the same journey Tony Stark does in the first Iron Man film. He's an arrogant fellow learning to grow and become a better person.<br/><br/>The cast carries this film. Benedict Cumberbatch was born to play this role and very much looks the part as he does in the comics. I'm glad director Scott Derrickson and Kevin Feige postponed the film so Benedict can take on the role. The character of Stephen Strange and Tony Stark share some familiar traits, and even sport a similar mustache style. Compared to Downey's Stark, Cumberbatch downplays the swagger, and elevates the egotistical side. <br/><br/>His ex-girlfriend Christine Palmer played by Rachel McAdams is the one who grounds him, almost like Pepper Potts. She has nice tender moments, despite the short screen time she had. Speaking of short screen time, I wished Mads Mikkelson's Kaecilius had more. The problem is just screen time, because like Zemo in Captain America: Civil War, I did not feel like he was underdeveloped. I got his point and why he was doing what he was doing. It made sense in my mind, but I just wished there were more scenes of him. <br/><br/>Tilda Swinton effortlessly delivers her lines of wisdom and knowledge as the Ancient One, she and Doctor Strange have a that nice teacher and student banter. Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo has a nice arc set up for him to become the next villain, and I'm happy it wasn't rushed. He is a by the books kind of person and the situations he goes through will change the way he looks at things around him forever. I'm also happy that Benedict Wong's Wong wasn't a typical Asian manservant. <br/><br/>Aside from the cast, the action sequences, and the visual effects downplay the familiar story beats. Watching Strange go through dimension after dimension, it was as if the Steve Ditko pages were brought to life and that made me geek out pretty hard. The usage of the Eye of Agamotto was effective and cool. It turned out to be the item I thought it'd be and the idea of bending time to your own will is one of the coolest aspects of the film. Also a villain I sort of, but also didn't expect to see was a nice touch and a nice surprise as well. <br/><br/>The MCU is now fourteen movies in and Doctor Strange is a fine addition. Marvel Studios batting average is second to none and I absolutely look forward to more stories now that the origin is over with. <br/><br/>But aside from it feeling a little too familiar, it's Benedict Cumberbatch who carries this film strongly. Not to mention Marvel embraces the magic and mysticism very well. The visuals and action are a thrill to watch. It's a mind trip. Make sure you do not leave your seat, there's more to come during the credits. Just don't leave, you can wait to go to the restroom in another ten minutes. Also try to see this film in a real 70mm IMAX screen, it's worth it.<br/><br/>The doctor is in, and he's here to stay.<br/><br/>8/10"
"subxerogravity","8","3","7","4 November 2016"," Doctor Strange is a great one!!
","Doctor Strange is an amazing addiction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <br/><br/>It feels very different from the other films, like Guardians of the Galaxy different, which is good. Though Stephen Strange is a superhero like all the others, he's one of the few whose organs and powers are surrounded in magic.<br/><br/>It does have all the elements of a good Marvel Studios movie. It has good characters played by a great actors (Mr. Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong etc...), and a great story of a man who loses everything only to find out what he's really capable of. One of those stories to surpasses all film genres and it was done so well. Plus it's very light hearted with some great humor to go side by side with the action. <br/><br/>The visual effects worked so well too. If you are a fan of Dark Knight director, Chris Nolan's film Inception, you'll definitely be into this. Some really good action sequences in the film too. <br/><br/>It's a very impressive movie on it's own with a great story fantastic actors and good special effects.

"ekbatani14","8","3","7","3 November 2016"," Dr. Strange Seizes to Disappoint with Iron Man like Comedy and Clever Wizardry
","How do you fit another superhero into the overly stuffed Marvel universe? Create a dimension. This film exceeded my expectations as Cumberbatch pulls off the likable, charming Dr. Strange. Although Strange's character endures a awkwardly rapid change from a renowned neurosurgeon to a mystical sorcerer, the characters outshine the subpar plot. <br/><br/>Rachel Weisz appearance was all too short as her usual love interest stint. Contrary to fan outcries, The out-of-the-box casting of ""The Ancient One"" proved to be justified as Tilda Swinton nails the magician monk sorcerer. Mads Mikkelsen character was kinda just...there. Finally and certainly not least, Chiwetel brings his Oscar energy to the Marvel Universe with a powerful portrayal of Mordo. <br/><br/>All and all good movie- felt like I was watching Iron Man in a different dimension...on Mars. <br/><br/>Plot: 7/10<br/><br/>Acting: 8/10<br/><br/>Cinematography: 9/10 (Very visual, think Inception meets steroids)"
"Carycomic","9","3","7","3 November 2016"," I just got back from seeing a Wednesday night sneak preview.
","And I have to admit...it was pretty impressive.<br/><br/>Let me start the requisite elaboration by stating that I am one of the few who will willingly admit that I not only clearly remember the 1978 TV-movie with Peter Hooten in the title role and the late, great Sir John Mills as the Ancient One (aka ""Thomas Lindmer""). I also thoroughly enjoyed it. So much so, in fact, that any on-line Marvel movie pastiche I read that mentioned the good doctor automatically had me picturing Mr. Hooten as him!<br/><br/>Well! It took them thirty-eight years. But, Marvel and Hollywood finally found someone who can measure up to Mr. Hooten: Benedict Cumberbatch. Better known to BBC America fans as ""Sherlock"" (the original inspiration for CBS' ELEMENTARY).<br/><br/>His portrayal of Stephen Strange is a little more faithful to the Silver Age origin story by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. As in; a highly successful surgeon whose brilliance is only eclipsed by his narcissism. Only to lose his ability to perform delicate life-saving operations because of nerve damage to his hands resulting from a car wreck. The only difference being that he is not reduced to Tony Stark-level drunkenness in a waterfront bar when he hears about the Ancient One (by eavesdropping on a nearby merchant sailor).<br/><br/>Another difference from the comic book origin is that the Ancient One's sanctum is not some underground hermitage magically carved out of a Himalayan ice cave. Instead, it's a Buddhist-like temple in the modern Nepalese city of Kathmandu. And, where comic book Mordo was an unscrupulous, power-hungry Transylvanian baron, in this movie he's Afro- European (possibly half-Romanian/half-Ugandan?). With the initially same unconditional belief in the Ancient One that Obi-wan Kenobi had in Anakin Skywalker!<br/><br/>As to the Ancient One, ""himself?"" Instead of being portrayed as an elderly male Korean mage, he is portrayed by English actress Tilda Swinton (who did such a masterful job playing the androgynous archangel Gabriel opposite Keanu Reeves as DC's CONSTANTINE). While Rachel MacAdams plays Dr. Christine Palmer. A character originally published in a 1970's Marvel comic called NIGHT NURSE!<br/><br/>It's not for these mild departures, however, that I'm only giving this movie nine stars instead of a perfect ten. Nor is the deduction based on lack of decent good-vs-evil action. Rather, it's the visual effects used to depict the gigantic face of Dormammu (Dr. Strange's arch-enemy). In the comics, he's always drawn with a head of flickering flame and pupil-less eyes. As if he were the love-child of the Human Torch and Little Orphan Annie!<br/><br/>In this film, though, his eyes not only had pupils. His whole head looked more like a giant hologram of the Red Skull's face! That might be a lot more sophisticated than the Nameless One of the TV-movie (who, in 1978, looked more like a Ray Harryhausen animation). But, more sophisticated doesn't always equal better...as any disappointed fan of the 1997 re-release of the original STAR WARS trilogy can vouch for!<br/><br/>All that being said, however? I would still recommend that everyone who enjoys the good doctor's comic book adventures should go see this movie a.s.a.p. Because I was most definitely _not_ disappointed in it. And, believe me; if I had been? This review would have been twice as long-winded in my expression of that disappointment!<br/><br/>So, let the Winds of Watoomb whisk you to your nearest multiplex without further delay."

","Magic, sorcery and contortion of time and space -- this is all so new for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That's part of Doctor Strange's charm: It doesn't feel too much like previous Marvel iterations in spots, but then we're reminded most of the story is a generic superhero origin plot.<br/><br/>Which isn't entirely horrible.<br/><br/>Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is an egotistical surgeon who takes on flashy operations and gets paid the big bucks. The good doctor and Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), who assists him in surgeries, display their on-screen chemistry early as Strange is thrown into an operation to save a man's life. This is a man who had been incorrectly pronounced brain dead by Dr. Nicodemus West (Michael Stuhlbarg), a fellow doctor who seems to rub Strange the wrong way.<br/><br/>It was a pleasure to see Cumberbatch and McAdams work together on-screen. There's the smart-ass dialogue of the former that pairs well with the strong attitude of the latter. Their interactions are some of the highlights of Doctor Strange, but at times during their back-and-forth, I can hear Cumberbatch's accent slip ever-so slightly. Dang it, fix that, Benedict! Or don't and continue swooning most audience members.<br/><br/>This may just have been a spur-of-the-moment observation as I sat in the theater, but during a moment in the film where Palmer and Strange continue to poke fun st each other, it reminded me of a similar relationship: Thor and Jane Foster. It's almost as Marvel Studios learned from their previous failures and delivered on a smarter, more well-rounded relationship with McAdams and Cumberbatch.<br/><br/>After the initial scene, we get a small glimpse into Strange's high-profile lifestyle, filled with a quick cut to his drawer full of rotating watches ripe for the picking. Of course, it plays to another character in the MCU who started off with everything and felt invincible (ahem Iron Man ahem).<br/><br/>There's an interesting conflict developed thereafter by director Scott Derrickson (Sinister, Day the Earth Stood Still). It's quite surprising that a director notorious for horror was given the reigns of a Marvel film. However, it worked, and the darker tones of Doctor Strange benefited.<br/><br/>The story became predictable once our doctor traveled east to the village of Kamar- Taj after struggling to find Western medicine suitable for his near impossible recovery. This is the film's biggest flaw: It strayed from the Marvel formula in some moments while failing to make itself unique in others. The progression is methodical at this rate for the MCU's superhero origin films: Strange has everything, nearly dies, losses it all, only to find there's a bigger evil than the internal demons he faces.<br/><br/>Although, there's enough of a supporting cast here to make the ride enjoyable. Tilda Swinton (The Ancient One) gave the best performance of the film, the other Benedict, Benedict Wong (Wong) gave a fun performance, Chiwetel Ejiofor's role (Mordo) was safe, but good enough, and then there's the curious case of Mads Mikkelsen's role as Kaecilius.<br/><br/>Oh, Marvel villains -- why must your screenwriters continue to give you trivial roles? Besides the unique use of bending time and space, Kaecilius is written as yet another generic baddie. Please, spare me the clichés, Jon Spaihts and C. Rober Cargill (screenwriters). Viewers were able to see the fate of Kaecilius and his cult coming from miles away.<br/><br/>Another problem that surfaced from the writing is the millennial-driven humor. Ugh, I sighed and grunted at the Adele and Beyoncé jokes back-to-back. I was upset Spaihts, Cargill and Derrickson chose to go for the cheap jokes rather than stick to some of the better forms of humor found in other areas of the film.<br/><br/>But, those negatives were quickly washed away once the film ponies up the action. Doctor Strange's first combat sequence is spectacular. Kaecilius takes on Strange, and it left my jaw hinged wide open. Derrickson played with unique angles during combat scenes that didn't leave me with a headache, but the mesmerizing visual effects as time and space were bent became the most impressive moments of this film. These visuals were the best among any MCU film to date, and Doctor Strange was better because of them.<br/><br/>The film's pacing was handled well, and it functioned without much of a hitch within its one hour and 55 minute runtime.<br/><br/>I think there's enough highs in spite of its lows to make it a fun, upper-tier MCU film. Take away Marvel Studios' tag, and the film can be a player on its own without needing the Avengers' help.<br/><br/>But I wish they did away with the heavy-handed humor. Gosh, Beyo- I mean, Wong!"

","It's not everyday that a film is released that will bend the will of visual effects with a blend of an amazing story line. From the moment the film started, I knew that I was in for a once in a lifetime experience. It's not hard to understand that Marvel can take any property and make it into gold, but Doctor Strange seemed to be the one that I was skeptical for. <br/><br/>I'm a big fan for the character, but I disregarded my love for the character when it was time to critique. Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect representation of the character. Reading comics after watching the film, I truly heard his voice in my head. He gives the character the needed love from an actor. Many felt the casting choice for Tilda Swinton was morally wrong due to her not being Asian. I didn't felt that she took away from the movie at all. <br/><br/>This film sets up the future of the MCU in new ways that will absolutely blow your mind away. If your family doesn't have anything to do, do yourself a favor and see this movie. My biggest problem with the film is the Inception like scenes as seen in the trailer because I know many cannot handle that magnitude visuals. This does not take away from the film which I absolutely enjoyed. It wasn't overused, and that is the magic that Marvel put into Doctor Strange. The high rating is real. This film is absolute gold. I find that this is the best Marvel film since Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>The villain, Kaecilius, was a wonder to watch. He is a perfect blended character. You will totally disregard this character from the comics if you follow with the Doctor Strange comics. This is the best villain yet! You will understand while watching the film, but please do yourself a favor and get the prequel comic. I know it's become a way for Marvel and DC to make more money, but this comic will make you think after the movie. <br/><br/>This is Marvel showcasing that they have plenty of more options to play with after the next Avengers movie, and it's spectacular. Marvel is something special, but now it's more than special: it's genius. Many theorize the downfall or the over-saturation of superhero films, but this proves that Marvel is staying fresh. I repeat this: Take your family! The kids will be in awe. Doctor Strange will become the next big thing for Marvel, and it's not a joke!"
"namob-43673","9","3","7","3 November 2016"," Brilliant entertaining mind-trip but not perfect
","I was unsure whether to give the movie a 8 or a 9, eventually I gave it a 9 as a bonus for all the original fighting scenes and the mind-blowing trippy feast of a movie this is.<br/><br/>I am also not certain how to rank this movie in comparison to other Marvel movies. I would say that Winter Soldier, Civil War and this one are the best Marvel movies so far, but I am not sure if this is the 2nd or 3rd best.<br/><br/>At the end though this is more a great movie then it is a great Marvel movie. Sure it follows the Marvel concept and it is sometimes reminds you of the first Iron Man, but it is still its own thing, and very, very different from other Marvel movies. Hell, it is different from other movies in general.<br/><br/>The acting superb, fantastic acting. Oscar worthy acting. And speaking of Oscars this movie should win one for visual effects. If Dr Strange does not win the Oscar for visual effects something is very wrong. It also has a great journey for the hero, it has a great story, fantastic action, and it is very funny. Almost everything about this movie is top, absolute top.<br/><br/>But still, it does have flaws.<br/><br/>Mainly I think the movie is too short. Dr Strange struggle to fix his hands is over in like 3min. I think they should have dragged that out for 30min or so to really hammer in his pain, his frustration and his willpower to fix himself. And due to all the trippy worlds that fly by at breathtaking speed (watch it in 3D!!) the movie is over so fast you hardly have time to sit down. Several of the characters, mainly the villain, have too short story arch's and it feels like we never really get to know them. Yes, it still works because the actors are amazing, but the movie could have been much better with 20min more run time.<br/><br/>Secondly I do admit I am a bit tired of origin stories and so this, yet another one of those, is kind of tiresome. And yes, it works great here too, mainly due to amazing acting, but still; Origin. Again.<br/><br/>My third complaint about this movie is that it feels incomplete. Perhaps that too can be related to the movie being too short, but what I mean is that it feels like it should have been more. I cannot really put my finger on it, but if someone said that this was the first episode of 3 I would not be surprised.<br/><br/>And I almost deducted one point for not referencing the TV show AoS which is still the absolute best Marvel have done. Seriously; the best work they've done is not even acknowledged by Marvel lesser work, not cool. <br/><br/>All in all though a great movie, perfect entertainment for the whole family. Do not, seriously, do not go into the theater drunk or high, you'll trip out completely and end up in a hospital.<br/><br/>Very much recommended! Go see it, and see it in 3D."
"krikkedominick13","10","3","7","2 November 2016"," my opinion of doctor Stephen strange.
","the movie is the best movie i ever have seen, everything fits (the right move on the right cue) and the overlap from medical drama to ancient Asian to inception was for me the right move. the actors Benedict cumberbatch as doctor strange was a excellent choice, I see him perhaps join the avengers for infinity war and get all credit for (spoiler alert for avengers infinity war) defeat thanos. the bad guy portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen, sometimes cheesy but in the last moments of the movie he reaches his highest point. (remember this is my opinion, could be different for anyone else) now the special effects: to get all out of it you have to see the movie in the cinema in 3D. but they are all perfect edited into the movie. one more thing: be on the look out for Stan lee's cameo."

While he tries to find the cure, he is actually finding himself and the mysteries of the universe.<br/><br/>I like this movie because it has great special effects ( in fact, this effects reminded me a little bit about matrix and inception, but only better!) also all the cast worked amazing with their acting. The story is also different from other marvel stories, since it digs a little bit about the true meaning of life and why we are here in this world, in this universe ( which I liked) and also it has great fights !...<br/><br/>PS.

'Good job' to those VFX teams!<br/><br/>From the beginning of the film until the end, it didn't fail to surprise me. The script is excellent, the cinematography is superb, and the acting is great. This movie clearly shows the origin of Doctor Strange's powers without leaving the audience with questions.<br/><br/>The character development of Strange happens to be fast and for me, it's okay. <br/><br/>The story is great but the resolution is a little bit simple.

"tomjistgeorge","9","3","7","30 October 2016"," great escape and metaphysical movie
","if you like to ponder things beyond the news and elections Dr. Strange is a wonderful refuge. Great effects, superb cast, good sound... even without 3D it may leave you smiling and wondering what's next. PS: Stay for the credits there are hints of what is store. The symbolic ties to secret knowledge, a myriad of plot twists, the ever likable and star quality of Mr. C make Dr. Strange a rare find indeed. Tilda Swinton is mesmerizing (Orlando and the Beach come to mind). As the theme of magic, sorcery, neuroscience, astral projection, the ""dark sucking void"" all collide. You'll certainly have a good ride. Music is first rate, sound effects right on, though the film seems to be very dark ( in terms of lighting and projection) at times, it serves to make the mysterious more mystical. The melting of cities, time changes, light love interest also add ( yet do not detract) from the live action Marvel action. With or without 3D it is a welcomed film meant to be seen on the big screen."
"jmdietz-74267","9","3","7","30 October 2016"," Magnificently absurd
","A magnificent movie brimming with beautiful absurdity. This marvel movie succeeds in such a spectacular way by not being a marvel movie. The careful, delicate and different direction and cinematography blend so well with what is the most unique marvel stories brought to film. The concepts are brilliant and brilliantly executed, both creatively and atmospherically. Cumberbatch plays his character so well and helps to guide this plot forward in a way only Benidict can do. All and all the strange and the weird become so wonderful and beautiful in this movie that one could almost forget the over-arching plot line, if it weren't that this also was well- executed and had a fun twist. My verdict is watch it. Watch it now."
"NosworthyG","6","3","7","29 October 2016"," Another 'solid' movie from Marvel, but not the 'refreshing new take' many claim
","Doctor Strange was presumably named as such because Doctor Familiar does not roll off the tongue. However, it may have been a more apt title in a franchise that has become the Toyota of movie franchises with reliability being their cornerstone. A lot has been made about the 'refreshing' nature of this movie, however, this isn't the first time an intelligent, quick witted hero has fought and quipped their way to saving the world in a Marvel movie. Don't get me wrong, this is a solid movie, as most Marvel movies are, however, it hits the same beats as all Marvel movies before it, has the same brand of characters, has yet another bland sound track and puts on yet another impressive, yet heavily CGI visual feast.<br/><br/>Firstly, this movie's plot is written from the exact template that barely has time to gather dust in the Marvel vault before it's whipped out to produce another hit. We have a villain with a clear motive, to bring earth into a 'dark dimension'. Why? Why not? We have a hero who is cocky, head strong and a genius who will prove to be exceptional whilst not missing an opportunity to get a laugh. At first, the hero is somewhat in it for himself, but later comes round to being a team player proving that all it takes to save the world is a good attitude and a good set of friends. Though super intelligence and almost god-like powers doesn't hurt. In the end our hero out-smarts, out-muscles and out-quips his enemies by mastering some relatively vaguely defined spells relating to time and time-looping and using it against a giant CGI monster. <br/><br/>The movie does a decent job of creating its universe and a passable job of explaining its laws. Just enough exposition is given that on first viewing one does not feel the plot is entirely based on a series of screen writer conveniences, however, the movie very much avoids getting too complicated in its explanations and the audience is expected to give a fair amount of leeway to the plot, the ending being an example of this. Perhaps my biggest gripe with this movie, as with almost all movies in the franchise to date, is that it does the bare minimum when exploring its own philosophies. Strange's mentor, The Chosen One (or a title to that effect), espouses, almost off-handedly, that death gives life meaning. Why? The bad guys want to engulf the world in some sort of eternal life in the 'dark dimension'. What that would mean is glossed over. Also, if the giant CGI monster of this dimension lives eternally, does his life have no meaning as a result? If so, why can he even be bothered to try and engulf more and more worlds into his dimension. For a movie to transcend the 'good', it really needs to have more than a physical battle between its heroes and villains. There needs to be a battle of ideology. This movie alludes to this battle in passing before hurrying on to the next jump cut fight on a green room treadmill. Lastly, whoever first jokingly penned the term ""sling ring"" must have found it hysterical when it made it into the final script!<br/><br/>My next big gripe is with the music of this movie. Tony Zhou, from Every Frame a Painting, did a fantastic video discussing the Marvel Symphonic Universe where he puts a challenge to a bunch of people to sing a single original composition from a Marvel movie. No-one could do it. And after watching Dr Strange I can say I would once again be unable to sing a single melody from its soundtrack. The movie plays it very safe with its music. When excitement is happening, generic exciting music is playing, when something sad happens, generic soft sad music is playing and so on so forth.<br/><br/>Finally, to the visual effects. And yes, these are unusual and one feels like this is where the movie's creators wanted to get people to write their reviews saying ""this is a refreshing new take on the MCU"". Unfortunately, whilst the CGI is spectacular, I can never quite get over the fact that these are just a bunch of actors running on a treadmill in a green room towards a CGI portal that they really should have just created 2m away rather than 100m and they would have escaped danger easily. The action sequences are frenetic and heavily edited with seemingly multiple cuts a second. Keeping track of where characters are in space and time is impossible, though, to be fair to this movie, that is kind of the effect they were going for. Some of the visuals could rightly be compared to inception and one would assume the visual effects designers took a lot of inspiration from that movie. Yet scenes of people fighting inside rotating hallways just felt more real in Nolan's movie, perhaps because the were filmed in a real rotating hallway. It's the subtle imperfections in the actor's movements through the hallways and the way the light falls on surfaces that just can't be matched by computer generated images. The human eye and brain can always tell the difference.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is good. A solid 3 out of 5. It'll get you from A to B without missing a beat, 'oh what a feeling'. If you want a popcorn flick, it's as good as they get. However, the movie is once again played very very safe. If you were looking for the 'refreshing new look at the MCU' then you're going to walk away disappointed."

Fully deserves the experience of 3D. A dazzling work of art, high praise for the visual effect artists. Apart from the main attraction of the visuals, let me discuss the other great aspects of the film.<br/><br/>Although I was a bit skeptical, Cumberbatch was a fantastic piece of casting. Cumberbatch's portrayal was endearing and captivating, they are obvious parallels with Tony Stark's arc from an arrogant, egotistical, extremely intelligent man to a humble, down to earth superhero. But he is still a great character, feels similar but very different. <br/><br/>The ancient one stole the show, tilda swinton had an enchanting screen presence, wise yet mysterious. There was an interesting dynamic between the ancient one and Strange.<br/><br/>kaecilius was a surprising good villain, intriguing motivations although along with other marvel villains lacks screen time and presence. A better villain than previous marvel villains, but still not iconic as Loki.<br/><br/>Wong had great chemistry with strange, he has a wry humour, which was great. Strange and Wong played well off each other. Mordo was a strong, resourceful supporting character.<br/><br/>There's a significant character death, unexpected but incredibly impactful. Also, an interesting character arc happens setting up a role in a possible sequel. STAY BEHIND FOR THE 2 POST CREDITS SCENES.<br/><br/>This film has only touched the surface of Dr Strange's world, there is an endless amount of possibilities and potential to explore in future sequels. Down the line, as contracts for iron man and captain America end (sad days I know), Dr Strange's endearing presence can easily take up the role as the MCU's leading man. <br/><br/>I can't wait to see him interact with the fellow avengers, imagine tony stark mocking Dr Strange's use of magic. BRING ON DR STRANGE 2 AND INFINITY WAR."

","I'll be honest with you. Never, even in my wildest dreams, did I ever expect to see a character like Doctor Strange in the MCU. Just thinking about the scope of the worlds he inhabits, made me believe that this was a character that just wasn't feasible for a live action adaptation. I thought that even if they did introduce Strange into the MCU, he'd be a grounded character and confined to this universe alone, reduced to only doing Scarlet Witch 'hand wavy' magic (which tbh, looks pretty good). <br/><br/>Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>This movie is a game changer. Casual fans, or the general movie going audience might not realize the implication this film has on the entire landscape of the MCU. We now know that a Multiverse exist. Beings that are too 'spoilerific' to be mentioned here, have been watching over this universe. A vast plethora of villains and heroes of insurmountable strengths are, now suddenly, a possibility. Even crossovers from characters outside the MCU, can now be fit into the existing universe without any break or discrepancy in the continuity of the MCU. (I wouldn't hold my breath for that, but then again, Spider-Man happened)<br/><br/>OK, now that that's out of the way, let's talk about the movie itself. First off, what a cast. Give the casting guy a freaking medal, because EVERYBODY'S performance was so on point. Benedict is Doctor Strange. Period. Tilda Swanson, Mads Mikkelsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benadict Wong and McAdams were all great.<br/><br/>The story was a classic redemption, self discovery story, peppered with the trademark Marvel humor and quips, we've come to love and expect from each film the studio releases. One of my favorite characters in the film was actually The Cloak of Levitation. It's the JARVIS to Strange's Tony Stark. But the real high point in the story was in the third act. It diverged from the usual stock 'Blue beam shooting up into the sky' block buster ending. Instead, it offered something innovative, fresh and pretty damn imaginative.<br/><br/>Speaking of imagination, I think now's the appropriate time to mention the real star of the film. THE VISUALS. OH MY GOD. Watching Strange drift, whiz and fly through the Multiverse was like watching a painting in motion. The movie was full of breathtaking, sensory overloading, majestic and highly impacting scenes, that just left you dangling off of the edge of your seat. Really, the only way to watch this film is in IMAX 3D. No other way about it. The fight scenes were well choreographed and the film itself was beautifully shot. Scott Derrickson, take a bow, sir. You deserve all the praise you've been getting. <br/><br/>In closing, I'd like to say this. Doctor Strange was my most anticipated film of this year. Yes, even more that Civil War (This is coming from the biggest Spidey fan ever), or BvS, or even Deadpool for that matter. Simply because of the cast, director and the world building opportunity this film could provide to the MCU. And I'm ecstatic to say, that it did not disappoint. This is my favorite comic book movie of the year, and one of my favorite comic book movies of all time. Thank you, to everyone involved.<br/><br/>Ratings:<br/><br/>As a regular movie goer: 9/10<br/><br/>As a fan: 1,000,000/10"

I also felt the horizon shifting contortions were too abstract to imply real danger so the action became hollow for me. Although I give it points for CGI concepts and executions. There were excellent performances, Benedict Cumberbatch (with a flawless North American accent, no less) and Tilda Swinton are excellent performers and Rachel MacAdams can ring romance out of a dish cloth.

","An egotistical, world-renowned surgeon loses feeling in his hands and must search for meaning in what's left of his life. Seems like a fairly easy, if overdone, template for the next chapter in Marvel's sprawling cinematic universe. Yet, strangely (har har), there's very little character progression and the doctor's personal arc falls thoroughly flat. Following a brief stumble through his rolodex of former colleagues and a very short humbling at the hands of spiritual masters, Strange makes no personal advancement. He merely shifts from being the world's greatest surgeon to its resident sorcerer supreme. No penance, no spiritual enlightening, just a short rocky patch in his perfect life and then a nearly-immediate gratification. Shallow character development among the supporting cast, particularly in Mads Mikkelsen's villainous foil (underdeveloped rivals being a dirty habit in the MCU), doesn't provide the crutch that might have smoothed things over somewhat. The effects work is dazzling and creative, providing much more than we saw in the trailers, but that's really the only draw here. Jaw-dropping battle scenes and fabulous twists on reality are its bread and butter, and worth seeing for the spectacle alone, but the lack of a deeper context is disappointing."

I've spent too many hours watching motion pictures that are not worth anyone's time : I am referring to Iron Man 2 and 3, Thor 2, C. America 2, The Avengers 2, Guardians of the Galaxy. And now Doctor Strange as well.<br/><br/>I appeal to the readers memory for a comparison : does anyone remember Iron Man (2008, Jon Favreau)? Was it necessary to ruin every minute of that movie with senseless fights? Did the writers deem it mandatory to accelerate the story ignoring logical passages? Was ""Iron Man""'s only purpose to prepare the ground for an unwanted sequel? Of course not. And what do we have? A complete movie, entertaining and funny, inspiring and meanwhile full of action, and more importantly, an intellectually interesting experience. <br/><br/>""Doctor Strange"" is the opposite of all that. Too many side characters, too much ""noise"" : where's the true story? And the way he confronts the monstrous villain (the only moment the audience could have been actually interested in) : grotesque.<br/><br/>The CGI is so evident and ever-present one could almost say it's the only true protagonist of the motion picture. The visual effects are often remarkable, but one wonders if they are always necessary and proportionate to the scenes they are located in.<br/><br/>Just like the whole new superheroes saga : did we really need it?"

The difference of course is that in the film his character finds redemption.<br/><br/>The story is rather far fetched in that mystical forces are but an effort away as is the end of the world, and is just that bit overly rooted still in the comic book rather than being able to make a successful transition to film. The villains offer little menace due to an inability to relate the film to the real world. A comic book is aimed at children whereas a film needs to appeal to a wider audience and here it struggles. It's just too much of a suspension of reality to drag you in to believing the story. The hero of the piece is fast tracked through his training at a speed that must make all other trainees somewhat miffed adding to the lack of realism that even a fantasy film must anchor itself with.<br/><br/>The actors all do a good job, Cumberbatch included, and the effects are top notch but it's the story that lets it all down. It's just brought too much of the comic book to the film and as such it's too simple and at the same time too far fetched. It's not a turkey but it's not even close to getting into my list of films I'll watch more than once."

","trust me when I tell you this. you have seen all this before, many, many times. a lot of star wars sword fighting, for one. it's all computer generated nonsense, and the star, benedict Cumberbatch is very uncomfortable mouthing his lines. he better run back to television and Sherlock holmes. the other stars, ejiofor, Swinton and mc adams are simply wasted. the story is about a brilliant surgeon who loses the use of his hands and in search of a cure, finds nirvana. but in finding this inner peace, evil,in the form of mads mickkelsen, lurks to destroy the world. I lost count of how many times mads and benedict meet and fight, but it was a lot. this is a movie, where virtually anything can happen at any minute. that's not movie making to me. and yes, I know, i'm in the minority here. but I am not alone."

","Just when you were hoping that Marvel was going to boldly go where it has not gone before the studio delivers another one of its brands. <br/><br/>I'm as familiar with Dr. Strange as I am with Dr. Oz (not very). I have grown tired of Marvel's formulaic product which is becoming more pronounced now that is under the aegis of Disney (I fear that Star Wars may fall victim to the bland). Marvel is the McDonald's of movie studios. It churns out (seemingly daily) easily digestible & reliably satisfying movies that never rise above an OK cinematic experience despite some fantastic production values. (Counterpoint: they never dip below OK either.)<br/><br/>I had given up on the studio following that large order of fries that was ""Captain America: Civil War"". However, I was intrigued by this seemingly off-the-comic-interstate character of Dr. Strange especially when Benedict Cumberbatch was cast along with Tilda Swinton & Mads Mikkelsen. These are always interesting actors just like Chiwetel Ejiofor who is also here. They normally are not in this kind of movie (the same could be said of Robert Downey Jr. in another lifetime). Heck, I was delighted to see Daniel Bruhl in Civil War. <br/><br/>This movie IS different in many welcome ways from the other Marvel happy meal movies. The SFX are amazing. They're the best I've seen in the last few years. Imagine ""Inception"" or M.C. Escher drawings on steroids. They are trippy & far out, dude (here is your Oscar). Marvel has never stinted on production values, but you can say the same thing about all of those Transformers movies.<br/><br/>My main (ground) beef with this movie is that I wasn't emotionally involved with it. The actors all give very professional performances & the weird doctor's cape is a hoot. The time in the theater moves briskly. This movie is never boring. I wish, however, Marvel would stop putting on all of those extras scenes on during & after the credits unless it is the studio's way of making sure you see all of the names & companies that evidently work very hard to put all of this eye candy up on the screen & thus thanking them (that is something I respect & forgive them for).<br/><br/>Compared to ""Arrival"", ""Jason Bourne"" & ""Deepwater Horizon"", ""Dr. Strange"" didn't give me goosebumps watching it or any heart-in-the- throat moments. It IS occasionally strange. Think of a Big Mac with a dash of wasabi on it."

The reason you're reading this review is because you want to know if it is good. It's good. Is it great? Umm.. it's good. I mean, you will be entertained by the movie but you're not going to be totally blown away by it. You'll have fun and be blown away, Just not not totally. First off, the acting is great all around. The action and special effects are outstanding. The problem is the story isn't deep enough. You see him go from slightly above average joe to mystical super powered magic dude in no time. The whole magical realm and that bullsh!t is relatively unexplored. And, of course, the villain of this Marvel movie is a throwaway baddie. I hope they give us a director's cut of this su#ker because I'm sure 10 or 15 extra minutes of story, exhibition and dialogue will turn this into a more awesome of a movie."
"masonmorgan-92917","7","2","4","14 November 2016"," Just another average film assembled from the Marvel Factory
","After seeing Doctor Strange I am honestly shocked at how high it is rated. This is the third Marvel movie released this year so far and it is honestly not even remotely close to thee quality of the two before it. <br/><br/>To start, Doctor Strange in itself is not a terrible film. It isn't particularly great either, but it is at least somewhat competently made. It's just that compared to earlier Marvel universe films released this year and even before, it is extremely underwhelming and honestly didn't impress me too much. <br/><br/>The acting is mostly decent overall. While I have never read the Doctor Strange comics before, I can safely say myself that Benedict Cumberbatch completely owned the lead character. He is a perfect mix of arrogance and perseverance. While his character's mannerism is very similar to that of Tony Stark's, he is still very entertaining to watch and is probably the most enjoyable part of the film. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Mads Mikkelsen are also great, but their characters feel underdeveloped. It would have been nice to know more about these characters and their motives considering they take up quite a bit of screen time. My favorite character from the film was the Ancient One played by Tilda Swinton. She completely sells the almighty powerful and hair-lacking ancient warrior. While many have complained that she is not the same race or gender as the Ancient One from the comics, she still does a great job. Seeing her character effortlessly fight off countless baddies wielding her spell weapons and dressed in her golden yellow cloak is absolutely awesome and leads to some of the film's most enjoyable moments. Rachel McAdams' character however is grossly underdeveloped and seems to serve no purpose to the story whatsoever. The love story portion of the narrative felt so forced and clumsy that it would've been better off without it completely. And this is bad, even for a Marvel film.<br/><br/>The story is also extremely underwhelming. Doctor Strange's story is basically just a cookie-cutter copy of all Marvel films before it but just with a magic and sorcery filter over it. I understand it is a character origin story and it is based of the comic, but no effort was made to make the story stand out or be any different from literally any other superhero origin story. There were even times between the fight scenes where the movie was even boring. That surprised me considering that most of the Marvel films are entertaining and fun, but Doctor Strange's story was not at all compelling or interesting enough to completely hold my attention the entire time. But this is between the fight scenes. Those are a whole different story.<br/><br/>The fight scenes and visual effects almost make up my entire score. Doctor Strange is undoubtedly one of the best looking films of the year. The visual effects are stunning as they even manage to make flipping buildings and morphing cities look realistic. And yes, it does look a lot like Inception's mind bending visuals, but that doesn't make it any less spectacular. There are so many memorable fight scenes in Doctor Strange that it might be hard to find brawls on a linear battlefield interesting from now on. Also if you were debating whether or not Doctor Strange is worth seeing in 3-D, let me just say that it is the best 3-D I have ever seen. While I may not see many movies in 3-D, I cannot imagine it being much more impressive than it was here. The effects were mesmerizing and the fight scenes were a ton of fun to watch. It is just a shame that the film slows to a crawl after these fight scenes are over. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange doesn't flow very well at all. The film's momentum is all over the place and I found myself losing attention many times throughout watching. We would be treated to a spectacular fight scene but then after that is all over, we were brought back into the boring and uninspired story. There are quite a few good fight scenes however, but the balance is still off, which led to some genuinely unenjoyable stretches of bland dialogue, boring story and mediocre humor. <br/><br/>Overall, Doctor Strange isn't completely terrible but it certainly isn't as good as critics or IMDb users are making it seem. It is worth watching because of the special effects, fight scenes and Cumberbatch's portrayal of Doctor Strange but I was still left unsatisfied at the end. While it is certainly not the worst of the Marvel Universe movies, it is tied with Captain America: The Winter Soldier for the most overrated."

"mjnemet","8","2","4","13 November 2016"," ""Strange"" is not exceptional, but owes its overall success to striking visuals and solid characters.
","Doctor Strange is a visually appealing ""superhero birth"" film that introduces another wise-cracking hero and a new universe to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ultimately, the film owes its strengths to dazzling special effects, interesting characters, and well written dialogue. The overall story is pretty good, but clearly follows the ingredients and chronology of Marvel's origin story recipe. In other words, if you're familiar with many of Marvel's recent films, the Doctor Strange narrative won't present many surprises. <br/><br/>The main character, Stephen Strange, comes across very similar to Tony Stark. And Strange's arc is very comparable to Stark's in 2008's Iron Man. Both are selfish, egotistical, and wealthy at the start of their stories and encounter debilitating tragedies as a result of their overconfidence. After a period of struggle, both attain great power. However, it is not the power that causes their character growth toward selflessness, but the realization that their actions have adversely affected people they care about. It's a strong character arc for sure, and Doctor Strange takes its story into some different directions However, it is worth noting that this film is largely a repetition. As Bon Jovi once said, ""It's all the same. Only the names that change."" If you liked all of those Marvel origin movies and still want more, then you'll probably love Doctor Strange. <br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch gave a good turn as Strange and I imagine his portrayal will become a favorite for many among the Marvel Superheros. Rachel McAdams did a good job as his love interest and helped bring out the humanistic side to Strange, but the effort to make her character remain present throughout the film by having Strange return to her for medical assistance several times didn't completely work for me. With all of the fantastical achievements characters were performing with magic in this film it seemed a little silly that McAdams and other hospital staffers were sought to save the day several times with medical science. <br/><br/>That little gripe aside, it was a pretty good movie. The side characters and villains were compelling enough (I particularly liked the humorous relationship between Strange and the librarian Wong). It was entertaining throughout, interjected with humor that didn't overstep itself (like with many modern Disney films), and featured a final battle between the hero and shadowy villain that was both silly and seemingly clever. I recommend it."

","I happened to watch the movie in 3D, which made much more amazing, but in terms of the plot itself, it lacked originality. The characters, though well portrayed, seem clichÃ©d in creation. However, the actors were apt in portraying their characters. The plot was interesting, however, lacked proper development and seemed sudden in some actions and events. The progression of the characters' lives could have been better developed and the dialogues could have been slightly more meaningful. Even so, the movie managed to make me remain anticipated throughout. I would recommend it to others who seek fascination and wonder and breathtaking graphics."

The acting, directing and over all visuals are top notch. While the script is a bit predictable and at times very a to b to c - all the element works. <br/><br/>Magic is always something that is hard to pull off in films yet when done right (H.

","""Doctor Strange"" explores ideas not just foreign to Marvel movie, but pretty much any mainstream movie in recent memory, besides ""Interstellar"". If it's one thing, it definitely has ambition, something desperately needed in the MCU, and it also may be the best of the marvel movies. However, the flaws may be easier to overlook, but they're there.<br/><br/>The intro of the movie is one of its flaws. It starts with in action scene in another dimension with people we don't know yet, in a place we don't understand, with stakes that we can't understand. See the problem? It may look cool, and the action is well shot and choreographed, but there's no tension. In fact, we don't even know who to root for yet. <br/><br/>The movie's introduction to Dr. Strange should be the real beginning of the movie, because it's pretty great. It starts with a close up of his hands. They're steady. He's precise. He's confident. He's witty. He jokes around with coworkers while dealing with a life or death situation, and he doesn't make a single mistake. This introduction is smooth and smart. We see his determination to be right, and to be in control. A fast paced conversation with Christine Palmer, another doctor, done in a single take as they are walking, tells us about his past personal life and his history with Christine, which is apparently complicated. However, while she is a side character, Christine's character is too underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Strange is shown going extremely fast on a road with multiple people, putting their lives at risk, while also disregarding multiple people that need their lives saved because their problems aren't interesting enough. It is clear that this job isn't about helping others for him, it's about his ego. It's about being able to control everything, including death.<br/><br/>When Strange is in a horrible accident which makes his hands shake, he tries desperately to get his job back, because without it, he is nothing. He is incapable of keeping a relationship, because he is too focused on himself. He tries every medical possibility to heal his hands, but nothing works.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch is pretty good in this role, but some of his delivery, especially when he's angry, is kind of laughable. I know Cumberbatch is a very good actor, and it may be because of the American accent, but it just sounds melodramatic and a little corny when it should be serious. Nothing major, but it took me out of the moment a little.<br/><br/>Through a series of events, he finds a man who recovered completely from something he thought to be impossible, and this man tells him to go to some place in India (I can't remember the name, and the name isn't important anyway). Of course, he goes there out of desperation, and is told things that make him entirely skeptical, things that make no sense to him logically. What he doesn't know is that he knows so little. What follows his skepticism is some of the most surreal, mind blowing visuals I've seen in any mainstream movie, representing the multiverse and infinite dimensions. It's pretty awesome, and actually thought provoking. <br/><br/>While these visuals are pretty amazing in all of the mirror dimension scenes, and especially this initial revelation, one of this film's flaws is its over reliance on CGI. Don't get me wrong, most of it is pretty great, but sometimes its reach exceeds its grasp, and ends up looking just bad.<br/><br/>Anyway, Strange begins training, and there is some very cringe worthy comedy during this time, and other than that it's mostly expository dialogue.<br/><br/>The film picks up again when Strange begins using the Eye of Agamotto, a necklace that can control time. The real enemy is introduced and the film doesn't really let up from here. There is action set piece after action set piece, and they are all very well shot and original scenes, using the mystical, cosmic elements of the film in interesting and original ways, including a fight outside of Strange's body with another man who is outside of his body while Strange's real body is dying, but being saved by Christine. It sounds pretty complicated, but the director does a good job of making these ideas simple while watching.<br/><br/>One major thing that bothered me while watching these scenes in the real world, however, was how incredibly calm everyone was during these incomprehensible, mind bending events they were experiencing. People would walk through a portal into Hong Kong wearing weird Indian robes, and 2 people would have any sort of reaction, which was literally just running away. Christine, while surprised, also takes it incredibly calmly when Strange's reaches out corporeal self reaches out to talk to her, despite his physical body being on a table in front of her. Also, there is logic lacking in a few action scenes. Why not create a portal directly in front of you while being chased?<br/><br/>Regardless, what these crazy set-pieces culminate with is actually pretty powerful. It becomes about acceptance of our place in the world and acceptance of not just death, but ultimately the end of everything eventually. Even if you control time, death is one thing no one can escape. But that isn't a bad thing. Death is what gives life meaning and value. No death means no time, no time means nothing ever changes, basically living a moment over and over for eternity, which is worse than death. In order to embrace life, we must accept death.<br/><br/>Pretty deep stuff for a Marvel movie. In fact, it's pretty deep stuff for any movie. But despite the journey Strange goes through, and his realization of his inability to control everything alone, as well as his acceptance of his, and everyone else's ultimate demise, he comes out still not fully healed, his hands still shaking, an indication that he still has much more to learn."

Weird, even. But with the help of a Sling Ring, a Cloak of Levitation, and the Eye of Agamotto, it'll all be all right, alright?<br/><br/>Dr. Strange is actually pretty fun, not quite as fun as Ant-Man or Deadpool, but the visuals are great in 3D and worth the extra bucks.

","Doctor Strange, Marvel Studios newest entry in the marvel cinematic universe, is here and it is really good. Doctor Strange may not be as well-rounded as this year's Civil War, or some of the other Marvel gems, but it is a really good film on it's own merit. Doctor Strange features mind bending visuals, entertaining thrills, and a fresh look at the Marvel cinematic universe (MCU). Doctor Strange is yet another strong entry in the ever impressive MCU, which makes it harder and harder to argue, that Marvel is the premiere film studio today.<br/><br/>This movie described simply is like watching the avengers while on acid, and the special effects are perfect. In this film the characters dance between many different realities, and essentially within these realities everything can be manipulated by the mind. The special effects are amazing in this film, which is a true compliment, because many films this year struggled with overly digitized special effects. In this film, it's obvious that there are special effects, but they look very realistic.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is very good, as Benedict Cumberbatch brings his usual intense personality into his character. The action sequences are very well shot, and the film is subtly very funny. It's admirable that Marvel refuses to step away from humor, because it's become their true signature. One weak point about this film was that some of the characters were very flat, the villain especially so. Unfortunately, Mads Mikkelsen gives a great performance, but his character is yet another generic evil character, consumed by a bigger evil force, with little development as to why. <br/><br/>That being said this film wasn't all that original, but it didn't feel recycled either. This is most likely because this film introduced viewers to the more cosmic side of the MCU. Much like Guardians of the Galaxy took viewers off earth, this film takes viewers out of normal reality. It's impressive that Marvel can have so many characters in so many different atmospheres. <br/><br/>In the end this film is yet another solid Marvel film. It's not the best marvel film ever, but it's a very entertaining, funny, well-acted, and creative film that is perfect for viewers of all ages. The film struggled a little with a clichéd villain, some marvel clichés, and the occasional overly- expository dialogue. For those with children this film is perfect for them, and for those who love action or comic book film, give this film a look."
"hcarljohan","7","2","4","12 November 2016"," Solid albeit unspectacular
","Marvel has a real knack for chugging out enjoyable content and Doctor Strange doesn't break that streak at all.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the best things about the whole endeavor by far. It's yet another one of those castings where it's so perfect that you can no longer imagine anyone else playing the part after seeing it, much like Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans. The rest of the cast perform admirably too especially Tilda Swinton as the ancient one. Sure it would have been appropriate to cast an Asian actor but Swinton does such a good job it's hard for me to get worked up about it. The rest are quite good too but Mads Mikkelsen (playing the villain) and Rachel Mcadamds's (playing the love interest)feel underdeveloped. Not bad but not good either really, just kind of mediocre. <br/><br/>By far this movie's greatest strength however are the visuals and the action scenes. Comparisons have unsurprisingly been drawn to Inception and it is somewhat similar. Strange feels way more energetic though and get's more trippy and weird with the mind bending visuals. The effects are fantastic but I also love how it subverts the usual summer blockbuster bam, boom, explosions thing that we've all grown to expect. It feels fresh, new and very exciting to watch on the big screen. <br/><br/>The movie also has a lot of comedy and it works for the most part. Sometimes the jokes don't quite stick the landing but it's never cringe worthy at least. The biggest problem for me though is that the movie relies too much on formula. If you've seen any other Marvel origin story you'll see most things coming a mile away. Arrogant guy learns the errors of his ways and reevaluates his life to become a superhero (does Tony Stark ring any bells?). Still it's not done badly and I think the crazy visuals and the action scenes are enough to make the movie feel somewhat novel. <br/><br/>Another good Marvel entry that is sure to excite and entertain, although it's not likely to go down in cinema history by any means."

","At this point anything with the name Marvel attached to it, is box office gold, as is evident by their latest film, Doctor Strange. The Doctor is perhaps one of the least known out of all of their characters, yet he is still pulling in huge numbers. The big question is whether or not the film lives up to the hype, and I can honestly say, I'm not really sure. Dr. Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a world renowned surgeon, who is badly injured in a car accident. When modern medicine fails him, Strange starts looking for alternative treatments and finds a bizarre ancient group, that claims they can teach him how to heal himself, and do a whole lot more. The big appeal of this movie, at least for me was the special effects. I knew the effects would be good, but Marvel really out did themselves this time. I watch close to three hundred films a year, and I'm not often impressed by special effects, but the effects in this movie really blew me away. That being said, this is just one of those film you have to shell out the extra money to see in 3D. It's a completely different experience in 3D and you really will be amazed by some of the things they can do. As for the story, it really is the same thing that Marvel keeps doing over and over again. I've really enjoyed the Marvel films and while they are all unique in their own way, the underlying theme always seems to be the same. Someone gets hurt, they lose the girl they love, they find someone or a group of someones who help make them extraordinary, then they fight the bad guys and in the process get the girl. It's a formula that is in every single one of their films and it's getting a little tiresome. The bottom line, Doctor Strange is pure Marvel. What I mean by that is, it's the expected story, with unique traits specific to this character, a Stan Lee cameo, a cast full of superstars, two scenes after the credits, and perhaps the best special effects you'll ever see. If you're a fan of these films, you won't be disappointed by Doctor Strange."

The car goes out of control, goes off a cliff and lands in the bay by the Brooklyn Bridge. It was a wildly unintentional incongruous scene in a film filled with intentional incongruity. I forgive the filmmakers this scene because...<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is the best Superhero movie I have seen since GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.<br/><br/>The 14th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, DOCTOR STRANGE is based, somewhat obviously, on the Marvel Comic of the same name, that tells the tale of...wait for it...Dr. Stephen Strange, an arrogant surgeon (is there any other kind in the movies?) who's career is interrupted when he hurts his hands. When Western medicine cannot cure him, he turns to the East and the ""Mystic Arts"" to find a cure, he finds a whole lot more...<br/><br/>This film pulls together all of the things I like in Superhero movies - a hero I can root for played by a charismatic lead, stunning visuals, good fight scenes, humor (do you hear this, DC?), powers that make sense (in this world) and an ending that makes very good use of the hero and his powers.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch is perfectly cast as Strange. He has the poise, moves, grace, arrogance and humor to pull this complex character off. He also has the screen presence that makes you want to watch him in whatever he does - and he looks like he's having fun with the character. He is assisted by the great Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, the Obi-Wan Kenobi of this film. She teaches strange the Mystic Arts whilst also having a secret of her own. The always welcome Benedict Wong is on board as Wang, the keeper of the library where the secrets of the Mystic Arts are stored. He seems to be going through this movie with a continual wink in his eye. They are all fun to watch.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Rachel McAdams, Chewitel Ejiofor, Benjamin Bratt and Michael Stuhlbarg are all underused. My only guess is that all 4 of these are in it for the long haul and will be used again and again in later movies in this series - otherwise, why would these fine actors take these roles?<br/><br/>The only disappointment for me is Mads Mikkelsen as the main villain. It wasn't that he was bad in this movie - he wasn't, he was actually quite good - it is that he plays basically the same, mumbly, silent evil character that I have seen him play many times before - try something new, Mads!<br/><br/>But, the acting (and plot) aren't really the center of this film, the visuals are - and they are STUNNING. The special effects and mind-blowing worlds shown in this film makes INCEPTION look like a walk in the park. I don't normally recommend 3D for films (generally, its a gimmick), but the 3D really, really works in this film and helps enhance the dreaminess and mysticallness of it all.<br/><br/>All of which leads up to a thrilling finale. Doctor Strange has to learn to use his powers - and to learn the life lesson of putting others in front of himself - and they both dovetail nicely in a very satisfying conclusion that makes sense. I liked what they did here. Doctor Strange had to use his mind and his skills, not his fists and a gun - as a matter of fact, NO GUNS were fired in this film! And that is a plot twist I can roll with.<br/><br/>As always, in a Marvel movie, stay through the end credits for 2 scenes that will set up other future movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is well worth the journey you will take. It's trippy and good.<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

","Doctor Strange's tagline is as much plea as catchphrase: ""Forget what you think you know."" It's appropriate, given Marvel's fourteenth film subjects a smarmy, goateed playboy not at all unlike Tony Stark to a Batman Begins style Tibetan training montage, wherein he conjures landscape-folding magic(??) suspiciously reminiscent of Inception. Hmm. Still, by now it should come as no surprise that the studio who has made mega-blockbusters out of Norse gods, propaganda figureheads, and an anthropomorphic alien tree and sass-talking raccoon are used to being one step ahead of audience skepticism. And by the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth, they've done it again: Doctor Strange is exactly the wacky, winking dose of pixie dust needed to breathe vibrancy and psychedelia into keeping the Marvel formula if not quite Strange, at least not yet stale. Which, for round fourteen, should be considered nothing shy of magic. <br/><br/>Granted, Strange's story is anything but. There's no doubt that its central trope of arrogant, unlikely hero called upon to save the world treads perilously over-familiar ground, and the maddening speed and convenience by which Strange is accepted into his mysterious Sanctum and masters the mystic arts doesn't help. Still, director Scott Derrickson handles proceedings with consummate zest and bounce, navigating the potential disjuncture between cliché narrative and ludicrous occult conceit with such nimble humour (for every ""Eye of Agomotto"" and ""Wand of Wattomb"" there's a surprisingly witty Beyoncé gag. Yes, that's not a sentence you hear every day), including some pristine, tongue-in-cheek jabs at shallow Western appropriation of Eastern theology, that it all, astonishingly, feels breezy and effortless. It's a deliberately simple cinematic apéritif bridging the Big Important Movie Events of Civil War and the upcoming Infinity War (including the most slyly unceremonious Infinity Stone drop yet). And it's all the more enjoyable in its inauspiciousness. <br/><br/>This is not to say that Derrickson's conjurations are purely frivolity. He may rush Strange's inevitable rise to mysticism and heroism, but dwells extensively on the car accident (don't text and drive, kids!) that costs him his hands and superstar surgery career, and his agonizingly fruitless recovery process, crafting a disability allegory as poignant and heartfelt as Iron Man's. Even more notably, Derrickson doesn't squander his unprecedented opportunity to deliver the first genuinely weird multi-million dollar superhero blockbuster, and practically salivates through the requisite exposition sequences waiting to flood the screen with Steve Ditko surrealism. Without mincing words, Doctor Strange is a visual masterpiece, and the first superhero blockbuster to really showcase every scrap of its budget on screen. Strange's first plunge into the infinitely refracting multiverse is a no-holds-barred plunge into surrealism porn, like perusing a bismuth crystal from the inside of an astrophysical kaleidoscope on a roller coaster. It's a shock of genuinely mind-bending big budget wizardry - think Salvador Dalí directing an Audi commercial - and it's spectacular. <br/><br/>Although the film never really matches this first trip (probably wise, lest audiences start sinking through their seats into a pinwheel of endlessly undulating Thanos pupils), Derrickson weaves each action set-piece with similar insanity, making for some of the most visually inventive cinematic combat in recent memory. Landscapes bend, contort, and fold inwards like interlocking M.C. Escher gears, as Strange and his arcane compatriots unleash the powers of gravity, space, and time against each other amidst magic beat downs like laser-light tai chi, or projecting their 'Astral selves' into intangible brawls, while Strange's sentient 'cloak of levitation' borrows copious surreal slapstick from Aladdin's magic carpet, and is just as riotous. Michael Giacchino's musical score accentuates this familiar oddness, folding familiar hero leitmotifs into a sumptuous sonic burrito of harpsichord, sitar, and electric guitar plucking, like a Pink Floyd b-side (and don't worry - they show up too). And just when it looks like it might all be lost amidst another generic Marvel 'CGI blob blowout' climax, Derrickson deftly sidesteps the cliché, replacing the Doctor's boss battle with arch foe Dormammu (here a gigantic, spectral Thanos clone instead of his traditional flame-head self, disappointingly) with a weaponized Groundhog Day. And there you have it. Inception-Schminception. <br/><br/>No one sensible would've doubted the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the Sorcerer Supreme - who else could be magnetically weird enough to twist such otherworldly, spiritual gravitas and mouthfuls of nonsense words into something feasibly accessible? He's inevitably stupendous, but still a genuine revelation in how funny he is, his sardonic charisma spilling over the expanses of the screen. Yet, he's also acutely human - arrogant, sorrowful, regretful, Cumberbatch paints Strange's emotional arc so strikingly that it's surprisingly easy to buy his slide into devoting his life to protecting a mystical dimension his medical mind can scarcely accept the existence of. Tilda Swinton's Ancient One is appropriately bonkers, exhibiting perfectly cavalier comedic timing, and somehow more imposing and disquieting by adopting a perennial glazed, chipper smile, which pierces right to the soul. The rest of the supporting cast are given somewhat short shrift in terms of moments to shine - Chiwetel Ejiofor's (not yet Baron) Mordo is promisingly brooding with just a dash of unhinged, but bereft of sufficient characterization to hype his pending villainy, while Rachel McAdams outperforms her token love interest plot device, exhibiting unexpectedly credible emotions without overstaying her welcome. Mads Mikkelsen suffers the most, stranded with one of the blander MCU fanatic-du-jour. Still, the delightfully deadpan Benedict Wong steals scenes and laughs aplenty as bone-dry librarian-turned-confidant Wong. <br/><br/>Neatly inverting reservations with a sparkling wit, dazzling action, and hallucinatory gorgeousness, Doctor Strange may not reinvent the Marvel wheel, but it certainly transfigures it into a neo-cubist, inverted flying carpet for a spell (ha). Anchored by Cumberbatch's spectacular charisma, and some pleasant tweaks to the formula, Marvel's fourteenth may not be particularly unexpected, but it's undeniably one of their most spirited, and, certainly, Strange. Now exit through the gift shop of contorted, Escher/Dalí action figures. And softly rap a bar of Eminem. For Wong. <br/><br/>-8.5/10"

","Doctor Strange is one of Marvel's most visually impressive films featuring the strongest introduction to a new MCU character (other than maybe Ant-Man (2015)). As to be expected this movie has all the bells and whistles of your average Marvel movie: high stakes, interesting side characters, topnotch action-suspense and a rocksteady heroes journey that doesn't skim too much on all the world-building detail. It certainly seems like a tall order to add on a multiverse travelling sorcerer into the same cinematic space as a boatload of advanced super-humans, mechanical amazements, and virtual Gods. Rest assured they make it work; putting just enough mind-bending, reality-altering mumbo-jumbo into the soup to keep this Marvel train chugging to its inevitable climax. Not that you could do a lot to stop it to be honest.<br/><br/>Doctor Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) starts as a supremely talented but vain neurosurgeon whose use of his hands are tragically limited because of a serious car crash. Alone, frustrated and quickly running out of funds, Strange takes a trip to Nepal where rumor has it a secluded monastery may just have what he's looking for. Meanwhile a powerful sorcerer named Kaecilius (Mikkelsen) and his disciples have stolen the pages of a mythic book that have the potential to end time, reality, basically the whole world as we know it.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange installs itself as yet another well-oiled carnival ride in a world filled with well-oiled carnival rides. Assuming this is a good thing, those familiar with the MCU and its eventual endgame will once again be rewarded with a layered milieu of competent cinematography, kinetic fight choreography and a familiar mix of light-hearted gags. Look out for Strange's stylish and spunky levitation cloak as evidence of Marvel's ability to get a laugh even in the direst of situations. Furthermore, as a Marvel property, Doctor Strange features not one, not two but five Academy Award nominated actors each giving the film enough gravitas to create its own event horizon. Cumberbatch in particular does a splendid job dressing up a character of incredible intelligence and ego who, let's be honest he can do in his sleep by now. I'm not going to lie the possibility of him interlocking with the similarly pigheaded Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is getting me giddy with anticipation.<br/><br/>Yet for those of us expecting a little more - perhaps a little something closer to the acid-trip psychedelia of the original comics the movie sorta-kinda doesn't deliver. Don't get me wrong, all the components are there: stunningly surreal images, eastern philosophical pseudo-intellectualism, alternate dimensions etc., yet nothing really sticks with you after the credits role. Every time we plunge into the deep end as far as visual splendor, we're immediately shuffled through like a hurried tour through a black light painting exhibit. It's a shame too because if the film dared to slow down, the daunting visual homages to MC Esher, Roger Dean, Storm Thorgerson, Rene Magritte and whoever did King Crimson's album covers would have been properly internalized like Inception's (2010) hallway fight scene.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is it feels a lot like the car is pulling the horse. Marvel Studios have found a malleable director in Scott Derrickson who up to this point has made moderately successful horror films and one particularly wrongheaded remake (cough cough Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) cough, cough). Derrickson manages to insert some flourishes of his own into the script as a co-writer but as a director he's completely railroaded by the studio. It's like he's playing with borrowed toys and doesn't want to scuff them up for the sake of maybe telling a better story.<br/><br/>Overall however, Doctor Strange is a taut action movie that delivers exactly what you'd expect and then some. Far from being completely safe, the film features some incredible action set-pieces including a show-stopping battle sequence while a city is being destroyed in reverse. That in itself, along with Strange's first encounter with the supernatural is worth the price of admission. Marvel has ushered in their expansive universe into a new age where magic can exist with science without someone from the Thor movies explaining it away as science that's ""just more advanced"". At this point it's hard to say if an audience member can just come in from the cold and watch Doctor Strange without knowing a little something about the rest of Marvel's hero gallery. But at this point it's hard to find anyone not familiar with the franchise. Plus since they made what could have been a hall of funhouse mirrors into yet another roller coaster, if you're not already sold on Marvel, once you've seen one, you've seen them all."

","Dr. Strange - 8.25/10 One movie I was bound to watch in a theater. I don't believe in watching movies about the time they get released for the simple reason that it would mean washing my face and being social. Needless to mention, the times that I have been to a theater of any kind I went alone. Same for this movie. The internet is filled with discussions and criticism about every possible angle of the movie, especially ""DORMAMMU, I'VE COME TO BARGAIN!"" and bits and pieces of the movie are indeed questionable but for me the real stick in the mud was not being able to utilize Mads Mikkelsen to his potential. Now when I say the guy has a certain talent to him, I mean it. Though if you ask me, someone like Giancarlo Esposito would be ideal for the role; Mads has a villain-like charm to him that can be realized completely only when the direction is apt. Which brings me to my other point: Marvel movie villains are pathetic. One would not expect anything equivalent of say Ridley's Dr. Lecter but even 10% of him would be a delight to watch. That said I can only hope that Marvel takes note of this and does justice to Thanos because only God knows what a catastrophe it would be otherwise. Moving on, I tend to be biased 9/10 times when I have to review Cumberbatch as the lead or even when he is playing the duck. So, I'd leave out my critic with respect to him. Tilda Swinton shows some of her Only Lovers left Alive level performance in this one and full points to her, though the direction in the last of her scenes was not up to the mark. What I loved most is that Ejiofor has moved on since his 2012 days and started making adult choices when it comes to signing movies, The Martian and Dr. Strange included. He is also showing good timing skill. A win-win for everyone, I bet. Benedict Wong is one actor I have always adored and his filmography shows an upward graph as well. I like how Ejiofor and Wong have been re-cast together albeit successfully despite there being a lot of other options. Also, I guess movie with 2xBenedict is worth a watch, so I'd recommend go book a seat and enjoy your date with Dr. Strange."

","For the 14th movie in a franchhise, Doctor Strange feels like one of the more original movies in Marvel's catalogue, even if the plot is kind of paint-by-numbers. Cumberbatch and Swinton stand out among a great cast with no real weak links. Strange as a character seems like a cross between Tony Stark and Gregory House and Cumberbatch taps into that hybrid fantastically, to the point where he now seems like a Robert Downey jr in the sense that you can't imagine anyone else in this role. <br/><br/>Marvel is clearly getting weirder and the subject matter in this movie comes completely out of nowhere. Oddly, that never really bothered me as it doesn't really even feel like an MCU movie apart from the style of humor and occasional Avengers references.<br/><br/>The villain is, again, kind of weak in presentation. He is portrayed deftly enough but there just isn't enough meat on the character to chew on. And thats really my only real gripe about this otherwise amazing new chapter in Marvel. I can't wait to see where they take him from here."
"eshwarmail","8","2","4","6 November 2016"," A very generic origin story trope innovatively packaged with visual effects, hilarious script and strong casting
","Marvel has a special knack for origin stories and it is quite evident with Doctor Strange. Easily one of the most visually innovative of the lot recently along with Ant-Man and the familiar climax destruction sequence has a smart twist too. A barrage of funny one-liners (occasionally corny too) and lead-character orientation reminds you of the first Iron Man movie, casting of Benedict Cumberbatch is definitely a winning decision. <br/><br/>Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), apart from being a gifted neurosurgeon is also arrogant and egotistic. His world comes crumbling down when he meets with a car accident that leaves his fingers unstable and incurable. Unable to leave his legacy and on the verge of being bankrupt, his desperation leads him to Kamar-Taj - an alleged healing place in the Himalayas headed by The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). While she helps him get better after an initial reluctance, the place draws him into a world of mystic arts and dark powers. <br/><br/>The primary working factors for this movie are visual effects, Benedict Cumberbatch and the breezy funny script. Even when delving into the multiverse and time bending concepts - the complexity is replaced with a humorous use of them where the negotiation with Dormammu, stealing books from the library and the astral projection gimmicks in the hospital especially standout. The imagination shown in Inception to alter physics is taken to a completely different level here and is well assisted with 3D effects. Mads Mikkelsen isn't as menacing as required for Kaecilius character and Chiwetel Ejiofor is also underwhelming as Mordo. But the Tilda Swinton definitely looked and did the part and Rachel McAdams is as reliable as ever. The credit time sequence which serves as a prologue to its next installment though very much expected, still generates enough excitement to look forward to. <br/><br/>A very generic origin story trope innovatively packaged with visual effects, hilarious script and strong casting"
"camandwill23","6","2","4","6 November 2016"," It's Good...ish
","Doctor Strange is a movie that does everything very well while also doing it very poorly at the same time. The movie through in and through out is eye candy, probably the most beautiful looking Marvel movie to date. It's plot is passable, and the characters are mostly developed. However Doctor Strange struggles most with motivation and purpose. Many times during the movie I found myself questioning what the purpose of everything was. The movie provides many broad answers to questions we didn't ask. Doctor Strange is not terrible but it feels like the time and dedication spent could've made a product that had a lot more depth. The whole movie felt rushed. Characters never really develop, and when they do it is off screen. Doctor Strange mostly succeeds in the comedy aspect but some jokes are just plain bad or cringey. The action and gore in this movie was pleasantly surprising. Fight scenes felt very new and thrilling and the gore felt dark and real. Doctor Strange is good but it's flaws are very obvious even from the first watch."
"Oberrated","8","2","4","5 November 2016"," Effects to be wowed by. A compelling story. A character done right.
","'Doctor Strange', as I anticipated, met my expectations well. Marvel has forever done such a strong job at creating stories and investing ones at that. As an introduction film, 'Doctor Strange' ranks among the top for me, sitting only behind 'Iron Man' and 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. As I previously said, we witness a Marvel story that strays away from what we are used to. We are introduced to magic and spirit instead of genetically altered beings and high-tech suits... First and foremost, this was one of the most appealing-to-the-eye films Marvel has made. It is the best 3D movie I have ever watched in theaters and I would highly recommend to view in this format but of course, a standard viewing will satisfy as well. To my friends and myself, we each made reference to 'Inception', and 'Doctor Strange' surely gives off that feel, yet better. A wild trip for any viewer... I believe that Benedict Cumberbatch was made for this role. His suave charisma and witty intelligence carries the film with his every appearance on screen. Easily the star of the show, as if you would not have guessed that as is... From start to finish, 'Doctor Strange' was simply a wild and insanely appealing film to watch.<br/><br/>Now, this part is for the viewers who want negative points on Marvel films and believe it or not, there are some. Within 'Doctor Strange' I found the comedy (which is something many anti-Marvel viewers criticize frequently) a bit too much at times. There would be moments where it felt unnecessary and could have just been done without. Regardless of being too much at times, the comedy was still funny and initiated a laugh out of me but I can not silence my opinion of thinking it could have been done without... The dialogue in moments seemed drawn out. Seconds could have been shed off if certain parts were not so dialogue heavy and the story just continued with a natural flow. Again though, not movie breaking, but minor moments existed where I noted it... I had a point where I found an issue, personally, with Steven's discovery of the awareness of Kamar-Taj. While this a spoiler if I were to delve deeper, if you wish to know, feel free to get in touch... Lastly, Miss Rachel McAdams. While I adore Rachel in most of her films, she just felt like an extra in this film. The unnecessary love interest that could have been done without and no one would have even realized she went missing. Might be just me, but you be the judge.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Sorry for the long review, and I appreciate you if you have read this far in its entirety. Bottom line is that I highly recommend a view or two of 'Doctor Strange'. It is such a mind-blowing trip to view through its use of special effects. All actors and actresses bring their characters alive. It is fun entertainment for all kinds of viewers and is simply a show unlike any Marvel flick we are so used to.<br/><br/>--Oberrated--"

","The pace in this film is so strange, in that it is without question, the most blistering of all the MCU installments, seriously, without equivocation! Yet somehow, even with that, there was a good 10 minutes in the film that loses you quite a bit, and not because it's bad, but I feel it's a symptom caused by how fast this film moves, that when it just slows down to a standard pace, you feel a type of jet lag, yet still on top of that, you feel that Doctor Strange could've easily, been longer than just 1 hour 55 minutes.<br/><br/>The humour. Marvel needs to tone down on the humour. There were areas, and enough in fact, where the humour struck the right chords, but, like Age of Ultron, Doctor Strange suffers from a strangle hold of jokes and unnecessary humour. There were parts, and noticeably so, where humour needed to be thrown to the wayside, especially because of the type of actor Cumberbatch is. Strange may be a Master of The Mystic Arts, but Cumberbatch is a Master of, Dramatic Arts... So again, I wish Marvel would've given him more room to be that.<br/><br/>The love story between Strange and Palmer was, too secondary, instead of it faintly manufacturing itself, in the background. Musically, it would be a breakdown, instead of being that, bass- line, which gives a song that oomph. I didn't get the chance to really love Palmer in that way (again, a pace issue), McAdams can make you fall in love with her characters, however, McAdams, as always, was an extreme pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Alright, now for the strangely amazing. The opening sequence of this film was ""WTF"" amazing. It sets your expectations unusually high, another reason why for a brief period, the movie loses you as it tones down, but, it brings you right back up again, and this time... It doesn't let go. The magic, the fight sequences and the visuals representing them were absolutely spectacular.<br/><br/>I also applaud Marvel as to how they approached a villain in this installment. Kaecilius didn't want to kill, rule or destroy. He wanted to neutralize his painful past, for himself and all, with what he thought was a gleeful future, through the main villain - Dormammu, who was just too strong for Strange to beat, so instead of winning or defeating, Strange rather did some neutralizing of his own, by outsmarting and, bargaining. The concept of Good and Evil pretty much remains the same in film, and it's no different in this particular one, however, the attempt of freshening it, was unalike.<br/><br/>The final fight scene was, exceptionally sublime, brilliant and worthy of noting as a testament, to Scott Derrickson's successful attempt at showing us something we haven't seen before. Forget reverse motion and freezing of time, what Scott did was depict time being bent on itself by portraying it in a way I've never seen; the present playing itself out during an occurring past. The idea deserves a: ""Thank you"".<br/><br/>The story wasted very little time, and tended to be a bit too direct, but it came together very well. Motives were explained, and the reactions from the characters concerned, were understandable. Cumberbatch was class and the cast was quality. Scott played around with horror elements, and I'm happy he did. Ben Davis, once again displayed expertise in his craft. The visuals in Doctor Strange could've easily seemed heavily disarranged, but they came out magnificently. The score sounded a lot like Star Trek: Into Darkness, so perhaps Giacchino could've done a bit more, but overall, he was very good.<br/><br/>Out of 10, like a constantly changing reality, I give it a 7.6 that keeps spinning into a .9, then .6, then .9... So, 7.7/10 it is, that I'll round off to a spinning 8... Because an 8 right way up or upside down is still an 8, and horizontally, it's infinity... Ideas and concepts this film captured very well. Strange was strange indeed."

","I was really looking forward to this movie but I was a bit worried about it. first of all the origin story of Doctor Strange is... strange... not as a whole but at the root of it you have a man of science and logic asked to leave that behind and believe in magic, in whole new world beyond this one.<br/><br/>... and why wouldn't he in a world were gods walk among us with their thunder hammers and a man from the 40's was thawed to fight again? Magic in such a world just seems like a given, why would he be so strongly against it?<br/><br/>The other thing is Cumberbatch, he is such a strong presence on screen that I worried it might not work as a super hero movie, that I would only see him as cumberbatch. <br/><br/>The GOOD =<br/><br/>Well the movie was just the right amount of serious and popcorn fun, it was light hearted enough to give you a little chuckle every now and then but still heavy enough to make you feel like what's happening is important. a good mix and what marvel does best! <br/><br/>The BAD =<br/><br/>There are a few.... lets call them howky choices made, the car accident was over the top and after it I just wondered how he survived with just a hand fracture, by all accounts he should have lost a limb or two at least!!!! I also don't get love of kaleidoscope in the effects, there was something in the movie that made it look like it was made in the late 70's early 80's with the use of those effects but then some AMAZING crazy effect will happen that'll bring you back to the here and now it was an odd mix. The humor here is good, it seems to defuse a serious moment at times which I get but just think some worked to the films credit and others lessened a big moment.<br/><br/>Summery =<br/><br/>A fun movie Amazing performances crazy effects Watch it! 8.5/10"

","Doctor Strange is about a surgeon with Tony Stark level arrogance and ego that lost the use of his hands. He discovers a place that will teach him mystical arts that will eventually restore what he lost. While there he gets thrown into a classic battle of good vs. evil and having to save the world.<br/><br/>I did enjoy this film but it didn't seem to have the memorable moments of Winter Soldier or Iron Man. I think this movie will stack up very well with the other Marvel movies, just by the actors performances alone though. Cumberbatch was definitely the right choice for Strange as he played the character very well. I don't think there has been this type of perfect casting for Marvel since Downey Jr. as Iron Man. Rachel McAdams was also great as Christine Palmer. Their chemistry was again very similar to the Pepper Potts and Iron Man but I honestly felt Strange and Palmer worked better together. I think they are my new favorite duo. Mordo, The Ancient One and Kaecilius were all great as well. They all made this an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The main problem, I guess i have with this movie is the visuals. I am talking about the bending buildings and all of that eye candy. Yes it was great to see, but it just feels like too much filler. I would have preferred more character development on the villain, so we know more about him. The other problem I have is again the cringe forced one liners and jokes. Strange was trying too hard to be funny at times. I appreciated the more subtle comedic attempts by Mordo and Palmer. That is the type of humor I enjoy to see and hear. There is one more character in this film that was funny as well but since it wasn't shown in the trailer I will not say any more.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange was a very enjoyable watch even though I wouldn't put it at the top of the Marvel list. 7.2/10"
"josh-psn","8","2","4","4 November 2016"," Oh man was this good! (A few nitpicks)
","~NO SPOILERS~<br/><br/>The movie was a very good entry into the MCU. If you're reading this and trying to decide if you want to spend your money and see it now, DO IT. It's one of my favorite MCU movies now. <br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch is great as Dr. Strange. All the character's are likable which helps the story progress.<br/><br/>My only problem with the story is that it progresses almost too quickly. Mainly in the beginning. The theatrical release is just short of 2 hours. 1:55 to be exact. At times they jump forward a lot with little explanation of what happened in between, but it's nothing super story breaking. What was missing kind of felt un- needed, however it would have been nice to have. Perhaps we'll get it with the Bluray/DVD release.<br/><br/>My other issue is the ending. It was kind of anti-climatic. Not much to it, but it serves it's purpose, and opens up a lot of possibility for chaos in the MCU. The Avengers definitely don't know what lies ahead of them.<br/><br/>I'm giving the movie 8 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>-1 star for the movie progressing too quickly in the beginning. -1 star for the anti-climatic ending."

","Doctor Strange is another great movie in the MCU. While it may not introduce anything new plotwise, it is loads of fun to watch, with its humor, action, and Oscar-worthy special effects. <br/><br/>Script- Like I said before, the plot is nothing new, but still good. Doctor Strange and The Ancient One are well-written characters, although the villains are underdeveloped. <br/><br/>Direction- Like almost every other MCU movie, the movie balances humor and serious parts very well. The humor is well done and did not feel forced, and the serious and emotional moments are convincing.<br/><br/>Acting- Nothing too special, but the actors do a great job at portraying their characters. <br/><br/>Directing- For a movie like this, the directing is going to be challenging. The cinematography is amazing considering how much is going on in some scenes. The directing is solid.<br/><br/>Visual Effects- This is what makes this movie worth seeing the most. It is mind-bending and jaw-dropping, with lots of color and things going on the screen. This is one of the movies that you need to see in IMAX 3D, or at least in 3D. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie is a lot of fun to watch, and although it is nothing groundbreaking in most areas, the visual effects alone are enough to make this movie worth seeing. 8/10."

","Doctor Strange does just about enough as the 'smaller' Marvel film of the year to keep momentum up, even if it doesn't completely thrill and excite as one hoped it would. Still, it's brave and it's bold, introducing a new character so early into Phase Three and its a visual thrill, serving up some of the best effect of the year; in fact, I'd go as far as to suggest this is a front-runner for Best Visual Effects at the upcoming Academy Awards. You can't help but become frustrated that, after the incredible Civil War earlier this year, Marvel can't keep up with their own bar of success, but they still remain the clear frontrunners of the genre even with this more middle of the road serving.

","I was exhausted by all the Marvel movies so felt a bit reluctant to see this but I was pleasantly surprised. Sure some things are still beyond understanding but there is something better about this movie.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch is watchable and suited to the role. He isn't too ugly to be a hero because he just suits this strange hero.<br/><br/>The story draws you in from his injury to his healing in Nepal. The space and time bending fight sequences are quite novel and not as confusing as you might imagine. Though I didn't get all their spells and the back and forth. I usually don't like Tilda Swinton in movies but here she was actually quite good. Rachel McAdams is a so lovely that it adds a human warmth and sweetness to a cast that would have been a bunch of mainly fine but not very attractive British and Continental actors.<br/><br/>The visuals demand a big screen viewing and they are quite something.<br/><br/>Watch this one even if you have Marvel fatigue."
"TheFriendlySniper","8","2","4","3 November 2016"," Why be normal when you can be Strange
","When you're strange, no one remembers your name. Unless your name is Doctor Stephen Strange. <br/><br/>Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a rock star neurosurgeon. Top of the game and very sure of himself. He's the guy that would find a way to save a patient that his colleagues would otherwise give up on because they simply do not have his level of brilliance and intellect. And Doctor Strange lets them know that they're not on his level because he also happens to be an arrogant a-hole. His co- worker and ex-girlfriend Doctor Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) even made herself a rule to not date other co-workers because of her past experience with him. When Stephen gets into the horrific car accident that would change his life forever, I heard a guy in the audience exclaim ""Serves him right!"" Couldn't even blame him for saying that.<br/><br/>So how does such a person transform into a hero that the audience could root for? That's part of what makes this such an interesting movie. Seeing the transformation of a very egocentric man to a man that genuinely cares about others. I believe that a huge part of the movie's strength lies in this ""character study"" and Benedict Cumberbatch does a great job portraying it.<br/><br/>But who helps the good Doctor make this grand transformation? That would be The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). She is, in my opinion, the coolest character in the film. We all know that Tilda Swinton is a brilliant actress and she's no different here. Her character is the old and wise leader of the secret society of sorcerers that protect Earth from ""mystical"" threats. However, similar to Captain John Miller from the movie Saving Private Ryan, she is something of a mystery to those she leads. Even Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), one of her closest disciples in the film, doesn't know everything there is to know about her. Yet he follows her without question. My favorite part of the film by far is the introduction of The Ancient One to Stephen Strange. She shows him in spectacular fashion that he doesn't know as much as he thinks he does. A truly breathtaking sequence.<br/><br/>Another member of this secret society is the film's villain Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen). Nothing against Mikkelsen who I think is an awesome actor, but I found his character to be one of the weak points of the movie. He is yet another variation of the ""brilliant student gone rogue"" trope that we've seen so many times before. I believe that one of the major criticisms of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is that their villains usually aren't that great. Unfortunately, I do not think Kaecilius is going to do a whole lot to combat that criticism.<br/><br/>Speaking of combat, let's get to the ""fun"" part of the movie - the battle sequences. Spells & sorcery. Controlling time itself. Astral combat (yes, you read that right). These are just some of the concepts used in the film and they make for some truly amazing sequences unlike what we have seen in any other Marvel movie before. Imagine if you took the action from The Matrix Reloaded and Inception, blended them together and sprinkled some magic on top. That's the action in Doctor Strange and it is as awesome as it sounds. Props to Marvel. So many movies made and yet they still find new ways to amaze us.<br/><br/>At 115 minutes, Doctor Strange runs a little less than two hours long. Somewhat fast paced, which left some aspects of the film feeling rushed. Exposition is relied upon a bit too much as a tool of explanation for my liking. Some jokes fell flat. Weak villain as I mentioned before. However, these little nitpicks of mine did not ruin the experience for me. Far from it. While not perfect, this film was a fantastic introduction to Doctor Strange and I cannot wait to see how he interacts with the rest of the team in future MCU films. <br/><br/>My score - 8/10. Go see it in IMAX. Make sure to stay for the mid- credits and after credits scenes."
"seige-hound","8","2","4","1 November 2016"," The Most Visually Striking Marvel Film So Far
","If there's one thing Doctor Strange has going for it, it's the sense of style. This is an incredible looking film, like Inception except take out the symbolism and amp up the excitement to eleven. The film convincingly makes magic look cool, and in a totally different way to other film's portrayals of magic. This ain't a Harry Potter rip off, that's for sure. The Magic here is a mix of Eastern philosophy, metaphysics, and some classic sci-fi mumbo-jumbo, but it feels fun and convincing enough.<br/><br/>I feel the film does lack in some areas. Mads Mikkelsen severely underused in his role as the villain, Rachel McAdams plays a romantic interest more boring than Natalie Portman in Thor (seriously Marvel, please work on your female characters. Besides Black Widow and arguably Pepper Potts, you are lacking in that department) and the Doctor himself is a bit unlikeable in a few bits, but really it's a redemption/hero origin story, so it's not as bad as it could have been.<br/><br/>I really did like Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, though. There was some controversy surrounding the casting of a British woman as a person who was in the original comics an old Tibetan man, but Swinton does a great job as playing a very unconventional 'wise person' trope. She is powerful, but has a sense of humour, and her casting bypasses the potential of some questionable issues of racial stereotypes present in the original version of the story. I also liked Benedict Wong as the temple librarian. He's a great minor character that really fits into the Marvel Universe.<br/><br/>The greatest of commendations really goes to the Post Production crew, with some of the best looking visual effects I've ever seen. I saw it in 3D, and while it isn't at all necessary to do so, the 3D effects really did elevate some of the more abstract and hallucinogenic sequences in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Doctor Strange is up there as one of the better films in the Marvel Canon, and in my opinion, the best looking one so far."
"MichaelNontonMulu","8","2","4","31 October 2016"," The Strangest Super Hero of Marvel yet...
","This is not the stereotype Marvel's superhero movie. It's not full of fights between Avengers superheroes with the great villains. It was an introduction to a brand new superhero who was as strange as his name was. His power was not strength or fly or anything, but instead it's more mystical. It was mentioned in the movie also if Avengers were guarding from the physical threats, the people in Kamar-Taj do them differently. <br/><br/>The movie had tons of crazy special effects. My most memorable scene would definitely be the fight before the finale and of course the finale fight scenes as well. Those were awesome. The sound effects were also cool and also the make up effects. However, I could not help to have some feeling of familiarity on the multiple dimension scenes with those in the 2010 movie Inception (with Leonardo DiCaprio).<br/><br/>I maybe biased here as I like Benedict Cumberbatch especially since I saw him in Sherlock TV series (which I happened to review all 3 seasons of them before) and I think that his performance here as Dr. Strange was awesome. I agreed with the producer/director's view that he IS Dr. Strange. I understand that was the reason why the movie was scheduled rather later as they insisted on having Cumberbatch to have the schedule for playing as Dr. Strange. He was charming here and made a lot of funny remarks and a bit naughty as well (see his funny ""relationship"" with Wong).<br/><br/>However good Cumberbatch performance here and the good special effects here, I am not too sure though if people can relate to this kind of super power in the movie. It maybe a gamble I think for Disney/Marvel in this one. But then again who knows? When they tried making Guardians of the Galaxy earlier, they somehow made it a successful one as well. Marvel always had a way of doing that in the past. <br/><br/>Anyway, if you are looking for a different kind of super hero without the physical appearance of the bulky with super strength, super anything super hero, then this one definitely is something different which you can try. It is a safe movie for children or young teens (no violent scenes or adult scenes at all). As usual Marvel movies, please do not leave the edge of your seats. There would be 2 scenes in the mid post-credit and at the very very end. Those scenes would give you insights on what would happen in the near future Marvel universe. Oh, this movie also having a shorter running time compared to other super heroes movies which was less than 2 hours even including those end credit scenes.<br/><br/>For my complete review, pls see in michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"
"Thatmoviesguy","8","2","4","30 October 2016"," Dr. Strange Review
","Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange I thought was a casting error because as much I like Cumberbatch as an actor and his resume speaks for itself. I just couldn't see him as the hero type in the Marvel Universe. I was wrong, his performance as Dr. Strange is perfect.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch plays an egotistic neurosurgeon, highly talented and well respected in his field. Finds him self unable to continue with his career after a horrific accident. He goes in search of unconventional treatment where he discovers the world is not all that it appears to be and learns how to harness these new found skills. Co-staring alongside Cumberbatch are Chiwetel Ejiofor, Tilda Swinton and Rachel Mcadams. All of whom you can not fault in there performance, no weak link.<br/><br/>With so many superhero movies to date, another origin story I thought was sure to disappoint. Except it didn't, it was very intriguing and had a good flow to the film a pleasant surprise. I think not knowing an awful lot about this Marvel character made for a more enjoyable experience. As far as origin movies go, this could be considered one of the best. The strangeness and complexity makes this a must see. Review 8/10"

","This wasn't the superhero movie I was expecting, more training and mysticism than actual superhero origin or saving the day. Tons of trippy special effects, along the lines of Inception with shades of The Matrix thrown in. This does look good, it's visually dazzling, following a neurosurgeon named Stephen Strange as he seeks an otherworldly cure for a severe injury to his hands. In time his quest leads him to study the ancient art of sorcery from a mystic in Tibet known as the Ancient One.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and as expected he does a great job here, problem is I just hated his character, he's a dick; selfish, egotistical and I sure don't feel sorry for him or his mangled hands. I also didn't care for the American accent, even if it was perfect. Several vague characters in this, the bad guy (Mads Mikkelsen) is not fleshed out at all (what's his deal?) he's just a villain with cool eye makeup. Benedicts love interest Rachel McAdams is also wasted in a small nothing role, as well as being very excepting of Dr. Strange's turn of events when she finally sees him again as a separated spirit ghost person. I might have had a few questions like where have you been and WTH! The cloak was fun."

"walkingwithprimeval","9","0","0","1 July 2020"," Marvel's magnificently mind-bending masterpiece!
","I'm not the type of person who usually goes for fantasy films with magical elements in them, like the adaptations of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter books or even Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. But there are a few exceptions here and there, like the case with Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven produced by B-movie king Roger Corman and staring Shakespearean actor Vincent Price (which is what Marvel's Doctor Strange reminds me of the most). All that being said though, I think this is the one to really get me hooked on the genre.<br/><br/>The whole reason why I was intrigued to go see this in the first place was because I heard former critic C. Robert Cargill (I've always known him better by his alias as Carlyle, back in the day when he used to be a part of the Spill review crew) was going to be the one to write its screenplay, which got me really excited to see what he'd contribute to the film when adapting its comic book source material. The end result of his screenwriting effort was a pretty solid script which had some tight pacing, as the film never felt as if it was overstaying its welcome with unnecessary scenes of pointless filler padding out the runtime.<br/><br/>I love the character arc Stephen Strange goes through (with terrific acting from Benedict Cumberbatch), as his character's growth consists of him changing from an arrogant, cynical Tony Stark-esque personality to a more humbled human being with a newfound, open-minded perspective on life after dealing with the trauma of his near-fatal car crash. At the very heart of it all, this film's intimate story is about a man whose career of being a genius neurosurgeon has come to an untimely end and thinks his life is now completely devoid of any purpose because it's all he's ever known when in actuality, there's a new way for him to still have a meaningful life and help people again by becoming a larger-than-life superhero, selflessly thinking about the wellbeing of others (it's quite profound stuff, when you really get down to thinking about it. Definitely something I can partially relate to). It almost seems like a bold move on the filmmakers' part to have their leading star be a somewhat unlikable, stubborn know-it-all who's a bit of a jerk.<br/><br/>As the same with all Marvel's films, they always get a veteran actor for a prominent role. For Ant-Man (2015), it's Michael Douglas. In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), it was Kurt Russell. With this, it's the always brilliant Tilda Swinton playing the wise Sorcerer Supreme herself, the Ancient One. In fact, all the pivotal cast members gave spellbindingly good performances: from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Strange's mentoring magic-practicer who judges his every decision, to Rachel McAdams as Strange's old flame who harbours a great deal resentment towards his ungratefulness attitude. Mads Mikkelsen's Kaecilius isn't really all that much more than a herald for Dormammu's arrival, but at least he's got himself a clear goal that he's working towards obtaining.<br/><br/>I have a particular fondness for this Marvel movie, as it goes against the many conventions of what a standard MCU film entails and actually takes some risks by mixing up the formula of a fairly straight-forward superhero movie as we know them today. Whereas there'd typically be the remnants of a destroyed city during the spectacular end battle, they manage to avoid that cliched trope by putting one back together again. Instead of physically challenging the big-baddie villain in a one-on-one punch-up fist fight, he uses a clever little trick he learnt earlier on in the film's duration to help him gain the upper hand over his malevolent opponent, thus achieving his nonviolent preference as the pacifistic Master of the Mystic Arts (now that's what I'd call a new take on the ""setup and payoff"" in action films).<br/><br/>To put it simply, this movie is a marvellous display of eye-candy that's filled to the brim with all kinds of trippy, psychedelic imagery which is certain to blow your mind away! (It's just a real shame I never got the chance to see this the way it was meant to be seen in IMAX 3D, so then I could've properly taken in and appreciated the stunningly intricate visuals that showcased its brightly-lit colour palette). With all the creatively off-the-wall fight scenes, it's obvious they wanted to emulate the ascetic of an old-fashioned wizard's duel, capturing the look and feel of something like Vincent Price and Boris Karloff's famous confrontation in The Raven (1963). Also, can't forget about the wondrously enchanting musical score composed by Michael Giacchino that replicates the same style of synth music which a lot of those older, sword-and-sorcery dark fantasies had back in the '80s.<br/><br/>For many personal reasons, Doctor Strange may in fact be my favourite Marvel movie of them all for its innovative way of retelling the same old worn-out, tired superhero origin story by putting a fresh spin on all the combining factors that go into making it. Simply revolutionary."

","This film prides itself on being a mind bending psychedelic adventure, but it never really lives up to that statement. There's mind bending psychedelic scenes which are great, but there's just not enough to make the film that different from a phase one marvel movie. There is not enough magic to break Doctor Strange out of the generic superhero movie mold. The dialogue is sometimes just plain awful, with characters saying words that push the movie down to a bad B-Movie, and misplaced or unfunny comedy is sprinkled throughout the entire film, with the exception of Wong who has some funny scenes. Speaking of laughter, the big bad at the end is laughably bad. Down to his design and how quickly Doctor Strange defeats him he's probably the worst Marvel villain to date. The other villain like Mads Mikkelsen's Kaecilius is forgettable, but he fits the villain role fine. The third act has a really good unique format to it and contains some good themes, but the execution surrounding it is poor, and it masks the quality of Doctor Strange's good character moments. Overall, Doctor Strange is a movie with a high amount of squandered potential due to it's poor execution, and it fails to exploit what worked in the movie by there being not enough. So I give it a 5.3"

","I didn't expect much of this film, mostly because I really never cared for Dr. Strange or this side of the Marvel universe. To me the good Doctor was best left in the failed TV movie from days of yore. But I was wrong. Scott Derrickson brings a great dare I say edgy sensibility to a character who could have been all too much like an Iron Man clone, but with sorcery. The only thing I can really say I have misgivings about are Marvel's all too familiar villain problem (despite the amazing actors cast), and it feels like it's all over too soon."

Prepare to get your mind blown as reality folds in upon itself, conceptually and physically, as Strange crosses paths with unique and powerful characters who attempt to aid him or are his foe. There were so many meaty and mind blowing visuals that they were simply mesmerizing. To top it off, they complemented the story and weren't not just for fluff. While being a serious and weighty subject, there was an appropriate level of dry wit comedy mixed in as Strange is just a normal human. Some may see that as foolish cockiness. I didn't give it a full 10/10 as the story was a bit to expected or done before from the 10,000 feet level as I pretty much knew how it would end up.

","I did enjoy this movie. As with all the Marvel movies, the special effects were excellent and the premise was novel and engaging. I was disappointed by the lack of humour that is so prominent in those other films of the Superhero genre (e.g. Iron Man). In that way, it felt more like a DC movie than a Marvel. The attempt at humour with Wong near the end was poor in the extreme. Although, I did laugh at the cloak pulling Doctor Strange about.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor is an amazing actor and brings his own special magic to any role he plays. I especially liked him at the end when he changes to bad and I look forward to watching him in the next instalment. Tilda Swinton was a bold and interesting choice as the Ancient One. This is a complex character, especially when one is never quite sure what side she's on. She looks pretty scary bald.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch is another matter for me. He is fantastic in Sherlock and it suits his acting skills down to a tee. However, in Doctor Strange I found his accent annoying and his performance somewhat overacted or underacted at most times.<br/><br/>My main criticism of the film is the cynical prequel plot. It's a half film in the rolling, money making juggernaut of Marvel. It felt to me like they got part way through, ran out of ideas and thought they'd release it anyway because people will always eat it up if it has the Marvel name. He solves the end problem so easily - ""Oh I'll just loop time"" - woo hoo, the Dormammu followers are gone, the big scary demon (that the Ancient One has apparently fought for hundreds of years) is gone. Yes it was a clever ending but disappointing too. <br/><br/>Overall, if I had paid to go to the cinema to see this I would have walked out unsatisfied."

","I enjoyed this film, but then again I thought I would. I've always been interested in the world of Dr. Strange since I am a huge Marvel fan. His world is one where the threats to Earth are of a more indirect nature and sometimes things that are hidden in the darkness lurk just out of sight, planning on bringing the darkness to our world! So not a typical hero movie as there are elements of other films in here such as The Matrix and Constantine as the film does revolve around a shifting of reality and darker dimensions full of unspeakable things that wish to destroy or enslave the world.<br/><br/>The story has a neurosurgeon, Doctor Strange, getting into a car accident where his hands end up shaking badly and all but useless in his particular field. He tries to do experimental surgeries, but they all fail. He finally ends up going to a foreign land where he hopes to find a person who apparently helped a man walk again. What he finds himself in, is the world of mystics and sorcerers. He becomes the student of the ancient one and soon his unrealized talents begin to quickly develop. Unfortunately, another former student of the ancient one is trying to use pages stolen out of a book to gain the powers of the dark universe where a creature named Dormammu lurks and wishes to have the earth and all its people! <br/><br/>I enjoyed the film, but I have seen others who have not liked the film. Which is fine, but seriously, if you do not know the source material and do not pay attention, that is kind of on you. I read one review where the person complains that Strange defeats the more experienced sorcerer; apparently, they missed the fact Stephen has a natural knack for using magic and in the comics he becomes the sorcerer supreme. Also, that was an infinity stone he used to win the day and those are actually Beyonders in infantile state and a Beyonder is one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe.<br/><br/>So, the film was a fun little distraction while it lasted. It was nice to see it wrap up in under two hours, these days every comic film usually goes like two hours and twenty minutes. This one felt fast and that is a good thing. Sometimes films tend to drag when they go on for too long. I thought the film had some cool special effects and was a nice start to the more mystical side of the Marvel universe. It is also accompanied by two scenes during the credits and both were pretty good. They both actually lead into other films, whereas the scenes from the latest Guardians of the Galaxy film tended to be more of a comedic nature. I look forward into delving into this strange universe more in the future."

","Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a witty and somewhat arrogant genius neurosurgeon who has it all, until a car accident destroys his hands. No one and nothing in Western medicine can improve Strange's condition, so he sets off on a journey to the mystical East, where The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), opens the gates to worlds and powers that Strange did not know existed. These powers come handy when Strange has to face off with Mads Mikkelson's disgruntled Kaecillius in a mirror world, where anything and everything can be manipulated.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange isn't a bad movie but as far as originality, the origin story is there but the overall concept appears to have been done. Everything occurs at a random pace and mainly wondering as to how he wanted to become this sorcerer simply from wanting to have his hands heal. The character reminded of Iron Man but here he is more unlikable and appears to think he is more superior to everyone else (though he does tone down his arrogance as the film passes). The comedy in the film is filled with little subtle jokes that could have been wiped out, no need for pop culture references for laughs and giggles. The movie felt in every way too simple and predictable and that Dr. Strange was never in any real danger. Not much suspense or thrills which the trailers showed, and the villain wasn't menacing or threatening enough. Although the ending was quite satisfying but obvious. Doctor Strange feels like a mash up of either Batman Begins or Prince of Persia, Inception and Harry Potter. We hope the sequel is more entertaining and overall satisfying."

The fights scenes in a mirror world, controlled by the Subconscious mind is really mesmerizing. I really enjoyed the scenes where the villain chases the protagonist superhero. However, I found something really annoying about this movies is the climax.<br/><br/>If you remember the climax scene of this movie, then you'll come to know that the ending is really unrealistic. The main villain earlier told Dr. Strange that he works for Dormamu, who destroys the Universes and convert them into his dark worlds. He can make someone immortal, against any time constraint. If Dormamu himself controls the time, then how come Dr. Strange trapped him in the time loop; asking for a bargain. Otherwise this film is really a nice one."

The supporting cast is decent especially McAdams as the love interest and Tilda Swindon controversially cast as The Ancient One. Sporting some of the most inventive spectacle since Inception, Doctor Strange marks another successful execution of the Marvel formula with dazzling visuals, a sharp sense of self awareness and an ensemble of solid performances, namely the commanding turn from Benedict Cumberbatch."
"adamph95","9","0","0","6 January 2017"," Loved this film! May contain Spoilers
","Knowing nothing from the comic books this is a great film and origin story. Dr. Steven Strange plays a Tony Stark sort of character but a little more of an asshole. The first 10 minutes of the film before the accident he's full of himself and has it all. After the accident, he loses it all and goes on the journey to grow and learns many things from the Ancient One played by Tilda Swinton. The Character Development is great, the fighting/magic battles are great and the reality-bending is Amazing! Some flaws in the film (in my opinion) are from the villain and main villain. So Kaecilius played by Mads Mikkelsen was a former student taught by the Ancient one and he went ""rogue"" and learned the dark magic. In the film, he seems to be the main threat which he sort of is until the ending where we see this ""Thing"" BEING come to destroy earth but DR. Strange saves the day using the time gem to do a constant loop of time until the enemy gives in to Strange's demands. So the villains to me weren't great. Another flaw I find is with Racheal McAdams character. I was hoping for a bigger role for her instead of a ""love interest"". Other than that the film is Amazing. This was one of my favorites of 2016. #RIPAncientOne"

","I don't usually write reviews, but this film is just too overrated to not warn people about it.<br/><br/>Plot?<br/><br/>I mean, I could go into detail, but it would be like trying to count the holes of a Swiss cheese. So let's just recap the more important and obvious ones: The main character is a surgeon, yet he can't seem to do a simple overtake (even after looking at the road exactly 1 second prior). The bad guys are just bad, for the sake of it? I mean infinity is great and all, but surely one would do a little bit more research, before betraying their master and going on a rampage around the world, or is that just me? The rest of the movie, I could've written in sixth grade and it would've made more sense.<br/><br/>Humor<br/><br/>There were some giggle-worthy moments - it's the only reason I'm giving this so many stars. Although they clearly didn't know where to stop, as the ""Destroyer of worlds"" was made to look like an ignorant kid tired of playing with a toy he's had for 5 minutes .?!<br/><br/>CGI<br/><br/>I've never experienced motion sickness, but I imagine this film illustrated it pretty well. The action was harder to follow than in one of the Transformers movies and that is saying something. Aside from the inception rip-off spell, the apparently ONLY other spell they used to teleport, looked it was done in MS Paint 10 minutes before the movie was completed.<br/><br/>The rest<br/><br/>Sadly there simply isn't much more to this movie. Absolutely zero character development, with the exception of the villain reveal in the credits, even though he was evil from the start, so not a lot there either. Apparently saving the world before it's destroyed isn't that important, since you can always go back in time and fix things. And that's the whole movie.<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>I would need to slice my IQ in half to even go along with even the most basic developments in this so-called movie. The main character isn't anywhere close to relatable, neither are any of the villains. And once the novelty of the ""fancy"" effects has worn off (about 5 minutes after you first see them) there isn't much more to see here."

I didn't feel anything for the characters, they were like puppets dancing in front of me. The only good in all this was the acting of Benedict Cumberbatch (an excellent actor who did a good job with a really bad script - I'll say it again, really BAD script) and the VFX (they were pretty and colorful - who said Transformers from part 2 to 10?).<br/><br/>To sum up, although it has a few jokes that will make you laugh. The film was supposed to give you a magical, emotional and exciting experience.

The supporting cast was excellent as well. I liked Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, and Chiwetel Ejiofor were great as their respective characters. The main villain, Kaecillius, felt underused which is disappointing since they got a great actor like Mads Mikkelsen to play him. The best part of Doctor Strange was the visuals. They were beautiful. It was worth paying the extra money just to see the movie in 3-D. Doctor Strange is one of the few movies that wearing 3-D glasses actually enhanced my enjoyment of the movie besides The Avengers, Ant-Man, and of course, Avatar.

"adean81","Null","3","8","9 November 2016"," Review of Doctor Strange
","When I first heard about Benedict Cumberbatch being cast as Doctor Strange I had my reservations. The guy from the Sherlock show is going to be a mystical superhero? My doubts lessened my anticipation for the movie. However, all of that negativity went out the window when he first appeared on the screen. Cumberbatch did a great job in the titular role, especially with the comedic moments. In fact, this movie had a great cast all around.<br/><br/>The movie picks up running with the plot and goes right into an awesome action scene. This forces the audience to accept the alternate realities and magic that are displayed in this movie. The visual effects are simply spectacular. From the mystic energy, that is produced from the hands to the bending of the buildings. There are some trippy scenes like looking through a kaleidoscope. Despite all of that the movie is still fairly grounded. Visually this movie looks stunning. <br/><br/>Another amazing aspect of this movie was the fighting choreography. The martial arts used were outstanding and looked authentic. Tilda Swinton's character The Ancient One and Chiwitel Ejofor's character Mordo had some great fight sequences against the movie's villain. Played by Madds Mikelson, Kaecilius is one of the better villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He had a good motive and felt he was justified in his reasoning. The final conflict was a little bit out of this world, but for the most part, it works. <br/><br/>While the tone of the movie was more dark and serious than most of the Marvel movies, there were still great elements of comedy that provided some levity to the film. There are a few jokes that don't land and feel a bit forced but for the most part, the comedy is great. One thing that I did appreciate about this movie, is that unlike other Marvel movies, there was no forced romance. The love interest angle is there, but never really focused on and does not draw attention away from the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange provides a great origin story for an unusual superhero. One of the movie's strengths is the character evolution of Dr. Stephen Strange. There is some parallel to Tony Stark in the first Iron Man movie. However, the difference is that Strange is more reluctant to fight until the end of the movie when he realizes a crucial part about possessing power. This movie offers a look at a different and unique superhero with a supernatural power-set. Strange doesn't just rely on his powers but his mind to defeat his enemies. It may be the weirdest of the Marvel movies but there is a really great story behind the wonderful special effects."

","I love the MCU not since Phase One have I disliked a single movie that they've produced and Doctor Strange is one of their finest. Now I love the Captain America and Thor franchises but I've always liked seeing them introducing new characters into the mix and this is with a doubt their most ambitious movie since The Avengers. This movie is truly different from anything else we've seen in this universe and I loved that about this movie. The magic in this movie truly brought something new it made for some incredible, jaw- dropping visuals that convinced you of the power of these people. Benedict Cumberbatch was perfect for this role not only does he have a (surprisingly) convincing American accent but he's also able to bring his charm and wit to the role that makes him a much more human protagonist. Rachel McAdams was really good in this movie she's in it just the right amount and had some really great chemistry with Cumberbatch that made it all the more sad to see him fall apart. Chiwetel Ejiofor has truly become one of my favourite actors he was great in this film and I liked that they took their time set him up in this movie and I truly cannot wait to see him again. Tilda Swinton proved all the haters wrong in this movie she was great and coming across as wise and intelligent and hit just the right note of intrigue. By far the most common complaint among Marvel movies are the villains but I really think they nailed it here with Mads Mikkelsons character. Not only did I love the design of the character but also his motivations were somewhat understandable and in a way you can see where he's coming from. The magic in this movie is truly amazing they use it in practical ways that further proves that Marvel can take anything from their comics and make it work on screen. The movie does suffer from its conventional telling of an origin story and makes you realise that we've seen the structure before which is a shame considering the great lengths they took to establish a different kind of world with this movie. <br/><br/>I found Doctor Strange to have terrific performances, characters, villain and have a good heart to it. This defiantly leaves me wanting more from this stranger side of the Marvel Universe. <br/><br/>91%/A"

","From the beginning, the movie had great actors, great writers and a great trailer. I was optimistic when I started watching, but simply put, it's poor story-telling. Drunk friends bragging of conquests innumerable have a better sense of plot and pacing.<br/><br/>Before we get to it, Cumberbatch, McAdams, Ejiofor and Mikkelsen had good performances. I'd say kudos for Tilda Swinton, which is a great actress in her own right, but the role was convoluted from the beginning and it felt awkward.<br/><br/>First of all, let's discuss the drama. Each origin story tends to be inspiring, and that is because of the darkness and despair that precede the hero's rise. However, at any point when something got even a little tense, someone would make a joke to diffuse the situation. I'm not talking only of Cumberbatch, though he made great use of his dry Sherlock humor, I'm talking about Mordo, Christine, Sorceress Supreme, Kaecilius.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the plot. If you see a superhero movie for the first time and see this, you might go out of the cinema a bit happier than you went in. If you've started watching around, say, Batman Begins - well, the move's so recycled it's positively green: The Chosen One (anyone tired of that?), Fast learner, learn an ancient art in a Very Short Time, the not-a-killer discussion, doubting your teacher, evil monologue, getting a bright idea from the evil monologue.<br/><br/>What about the love subplot? The chemistry was there, but in the face of saving the Earth - again - I couldn't have cared less. Why was that hogging screen time? In conclusion, go watch the Dr. Strange animated movie. It's slow-paced and it narrates explanations all the time, but it's a much better story."

","Speaking as a civilian here, (read neither a Marvel or DC fanboy), I have never personally been a fan of the Marvel movies. Sure I enjoyed some a bit here or there, but in terms of their offerings, I always thought Marvel excelled in their TV series rather than their movies. I actually thought that Marvel's collaboration with Netflix is where their strength was, in that shows like ""Daredevil"", ""Jessica Jones"" and ""Luke Cage"" changed what the superhero genre could and should be, and what a fan could and should expect from it.<br/><br/>""Doctor Strange"" marks the first time for me, when I was actually looking forward to a Marvel movie. And this time with good reason. I was surely not disappointed and them some! I had a lot of fun watching 'Doctor Strange"", which is why you go to movies in the first place. It was a solid movie, well made, great cast, with truly excellent visual effects and action set pieces. So it totally deserves the success it's getting. It is also a very well calibrated movie and at around 115 minutes, its running time is the perfect length. A big round of applause for Benedict Cumberbatch who steals the show (even thought the show is his) and every frame he is in, as well as Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen, Benedict Wong and Rachel McAdams.<br/><br/>There are many things that you might forgive and overlook while watching a genre movie, but one of the things that absolutely cannot be forgiven, is if said movie is tedious and boring.

","I just returned from seeing Doctor Strange, staring Benedict Cumberbatch as a third- tier Marvel superhero who specializes in magical power. I have to say that these Marvel superhero movies seem to keep getting better and better. Who would have thought that someone could take a character virtually unknown beyond comic book fans and turn him into a cinematic triumph? <br/><br/>Casting Cumberbatch to play the gifted but initially arrogant Strange was a masterstroke. Cumberbatch brought the same brilliance (but not the same personality) to the character of Doctor Strange that he's brought to Sherlock Holmes. With the help of his outstanding performance, the movie managed to achieve just the right balance of humor, action and personal drama—and yet, not the same balance as in, say, Avengers, Thor, Deadpool, or Guardians of the Galaxy. I both laughed and exclaimed in excitement repeatedly, and even got choked up once or twice. <br/><br/>The movie made the best use of Industrial Light and Magic's (and other companies') special effects, giving us a heady and trippy brew of CGI and practical effects. I don't usually comment on movie special effects, except for, as in Iron Man 3, when the producers seem to forget that movies aren't about special effects, but the special effects in Doctor Strange really conveyed a perfect sense of the otherworldliness—or other dimensionality—of Doctor Strange's magical world that really enhanced to the movie, setting it apart from the other Avengers-related movies, despite occupying the same physical world.<br/><br/>I have give kudos too to composer Michael Giacchino, who also wrote the scores for the three recent Star Trek films, Jurassic World, Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol, Fringe, and the upcoming Star Wars: Rogue One. Giacchino gave us what I think might possibly be the single best score for a Kevin Feige Marvel movie to date. <br/><br/>I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the great performances by Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo, Strange's mentor, and Tilda Swinton as the enigmatic Ancient One. Despite limited time, Rachel McAdams put in a sympathetic, appealing performance as Strange's one-time romantic partner and fellow surgeon, Christine Palmer. Benedict Wong contributed a nuanced if brief performance as, well, Wong, the stoic librarian of the library of magic. Benjamin Bratt, who's done wonderful and varied performances on TV in Private Practice, 24, and Modern Family, and as the voice of an alternate Superman in Justice League: Gods and Monsters, did yeoman's service as Jonathan Pangborn, a character with almost no screen time who the filmmakers added secretly at the last minute and who plays an important role to the future of the film franchise. <br/><br/>The film contains one more brief but brilliant performance, but I won't spoil it for you except to say that you should definitely stick around for all of the film's closing credits. Doctor Strange was so good, in fact, that I'd recommend sticking around for the all of the film's closing credits at least twice."

But above all else it has a captivating story line that it's guaranteed to keep you at the edge of your seat the entire movie.<br/><br/>Not only do you see the birth of a hero whose painful transformation from a self absorbed neurosurgeon to something much greater will take him to other realms (literally), but you also get to witness the introduction of MAGIC into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, not science-based magic, but real and ancient magic, that opens the MCU to worlds of infinite possibilities.<br/><br/>This is hands down one of the BEST Marvel movies so far, on par only with the likes of IRON MAN, Marvel's The Avengers & Captain America: Civil War.<br/><br/>I am a devoted fan of Marvel Studios and tonight they have proved why, In Marvel We Trust.<br/><br/>My Score: 10/10."
"alexanderpirkas","10","3","8","4 November 2016"," The next awesome installment in the MCU
","-Directing:<br/><br/>Director 'Scott Derrickson' known mostly for directing thrillers, did an incredible job building this amazing and STRANGE world and at the same time connecting it into the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is fast-paced but the camera pace is not, something different from the rest of the Hollywood movies nowadays. Scott amazingly captured every scene, giving it a different feeling based on the scene itself. He also gave some horror elements that really gave a ""tone"" of excitement. The only negative about his directing is the close-combat fights. They were really choppy with bad- camera moves. Something that the Russo-Bros did perfect in ""The Winter Soldier"" & ""Civil War"".<br/><br/>-Plot/Story/Writing:<br/><br/>The Story begins exactly where the ""Doctor Strange Prelude Comics"" left and so the audience that read the preludes will benefit a lot. The First act is emotional and does a fantastic job introducing some of the characters and giving them (in a secret way) a backstory. But it goes through kind of fast, and I think five more minutes into the film just for the first act would give a much more ""complete"" storytelling. <br/><br/>-Actors&Characters:<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch...what can be said about this guy? He's AWESOME. Marvel really tried to push him to be the new face of the MCU instead of ""Robert Downey Jr"" and they KIND of succeeded. Benedict BECAME the character, he is enthusiastic, energetic, smart and you can easily relate to him. But to become the face of the MCU we have to see more of him (a lot more). Benedict Wong as Wong was my favorite character behind Stephen Strange. He's this serious guy who doesn't get most of the jokes but at the same time he is funny without him noticing. Rachel McAdams was a great supporting character as Christine Palmer. She was helpful and not just the (girl-for-the-hero) like Pepper in Iron Man or Jane in Thor, she had a great personality and gave Stephen a lot more ""character-story"". Mads Mikkelsen did a excellent job as the villain Kaecilius but the movie itself didn't give him much of story...but the Prelude Comics really benefit his character and actually give him a story so you can get attached to. So the audience that read the preludes have a benefit against the ones who didn't read the preludes. Tilda Swinton & Chiwetel Ejiofor did as well a great jobs as The Ancient One & Mordo. The two character had really emotional and compelling moments together but overall they were kind of ""overshadowed"" by the other characters. <br/><br/>-Visual Effects:<br/><br/>The visuals in this movie are like nothing I've ever seen before. They're trippy, exciting, and ""mind-bending"" like some are saying. Almost all the effects are excellent & realistic. But I say almost because the effects on the humans while they are jumping and doing all that crazy stuff could have been better...but Marvel is known to really struggle on the human-VFX so its not a surprising. <br/><br/>-Conclusion:<br/><br/>Even if Marvel has now jumped into Phase 3, this film proves they're still capable of doing an origin-story and not make it feel 'strange' among the rest of the mcu movies. The humor is good (especially if you like the one-view-point jokes), the fights could have been better but the chase scenes are fantastic. With a really compelling story Doctor Strange is one of the best MCU films to date and gets the 3rd place in my personal top3 Marvel Movies."

The magic is very well done. The story is sorta typical bad guy stuff, however the way it plays out in the film is great and not really predictable. The music is awesome even though it doesn't really shine through the film like other films do (Star Wars and Spielberg films) but it does its part very well and I am happy Michael Giacchino took the job of scoring this film.<br/><br/>All I can say is just watch is.

"aaddiiss1","9","3","8","27 October 2016"," Marvel has yet again turned their B class property, into a mainstream media sensation. But the villain remains an issue.
","Psychedelically mind bending visuals, a solid story, effective humor, and a top-notch performance from the cast. The downside as always, is the underused villain. Despite Mads Mikkelsen having some really good moments on screen, he could've used more screen time and a much less generic motivation. My same opinion applied to Rachel McAdams' character who could have been a much more compelling and energetic love interest of the title character.<br/><br/>But overall, Doctor Strange in my opinion is one of the best Marvel and comic book movie to date that successfully took us into the magical and multi-dimensional realm of the MCU. If Benedict Cumberbatch could be the better Sherlock than RDJ, then I believe he could be the new face of the MCU after RDJ's contract expired. Plus, have you ever seen an actor playing 2 characters in the same Marvel movie? ;) #mildspoiler #keepyoureyesandearsopen<br/><br/>Oh, and may I remind you that watching experience could be much enhanced when high?"
"baroncoco","1","3","9","11 June 2017"," It's terrible; and I loved the original comics from the start...
","That's about all there is to say. Spoilers? Spoil what? The fact that it's crap? Listen, the original comics, written by Stan Lee before he became a complete sellout -- and much more importantly drawn by Steve Ditko the Great -- were amusing little takes on the pseudo-mysticism of the 60s; not ashamed to draw light vs. evil, etc., not ashamed to cast Asians as Asians (Tilda Swinton, I hereby summon your mother ship to come and take your freak self home). But now, with so many labored retakes and remakes and serious, pretentious treatments of the same general area...it's just exhausted. And not a note of humor in it, because Stan Lee doesn't have any humor, anymore, just big fat dollar signs rolling out of his mouth (and I know from personal experience). One more thing, Keira Cumberbatch: beware of overexposure. A lot of people who used to respect you are getting pretty damned sick of you selling out for every buck that comes along, and taking every part in sight. Remember Miss Knightly: nobody gives a damn about her, outside of the usual Pirates of the Caribbean fans, anymore. Virtue, as always, if found in occasional refusal and sticking to serious quality. Otherwise, in life as in your profession, you run the risk of appearing a whore... Although that risk may be long past, and the verdict in. Cumberbunny, indeed..."

"kaylitrengen","10","3","9","7 November 2016"," Marvel's New Movie is Pretty Strange
","""Death is what makes life worth living—knowing your days are numbered,"" said the Ancient One—oh and speaking of numbers, how about this one, $192 million Doctor Strange brought in over its first weekend released. Now Marvel has a knack for great casting, universe integration, special effects, and (of course) Stan Lee's cameo. As far as casting, Wowza, Benedict Cumberbatch once again nails it in a starring role; from a doctor with a 100% success rate to a lost cause with ever shaking hands—Benedict, like RDJ or (either) Chris, was Marvel's perfect choice. Integration is a necessity when it comes to the string of Marvel movies, and while the movie tells Dr. Strange's own story of growth into the hero everyone loves, and at the end: it introduces another infinity stone; gives a peak about where Dr. Strange will appear next; and essentially develops another villain Dr. Strange must come to terms with. As far as special effects go, well it wasn't quite what I expected, it was better! If mystical spells and a cape with a mind of its own weren't enough, how about rooms converging on themselves and entire cities becoming 20 drifting islands in the sky! And last but not least, Stan Lee, the man who made it all possible, had his own cameo (maybe not the same caliber as the Deadpool cameo) which was funny. All in all, Doctor Strange was another great movie to come from Marvel and let's all appreciate the universe they are trying to create beyond the comics."
"KeyBrains","10","3","9","7 November 2016"," Doctor Strange Enchants!
","Alliterative accolades abound as Ditko's dark dimension descends on downtown Hong Kong in the third act of MCU's latest triumph, DOCTOR STRANGE!!! If Iron Man 1 was the jolt as the roller coaster begins its climb and Avengers is the thrilling descent from the first and tallest hill then we're now upside down doing loops and manically laughing with excitement. Doctor Strange is as great a super hero origin film as we've ever seen and as fantastic a special-effects display as has ever been accomplished. 10/10, take all of your friends and family, see it again, and do so unabashedly. <br/><br/>Where to begin but the beginning? Tilda Swinton's Ancient One is thissss close to stealing the whole show, but for the strength of the show. She gives this film so much gravitas, so much intrigue, and a purity of creative zaniness that you simply buy-in right away with no hesitation. She is the backbone character of the movie; the mentor whose lessons we all wish to be taught. And we all hear the decry ""HYPOCRITE!"" and we wonder What does this character embody? How does she remain ageless and why is she a white chick? When Strange first gains admittance and begins to beg Fu Manchu for guidance we all slyly smile at the switcheroo. And we also see in that scene the clear winning option for our character; we want Tilda! <br/><br/>And I'll get to Benedict Cumberbatch in a second, but first Wong and Mordo. Wong is a major triumph of this script. He delivered on two of the funniest moments in the film, was perfectly reinterpreted as a sorcerer-librarian-warrior, and had brilliant chemistry with Strange. Mordo's character arc progressed smoother than Valtoor boots on Vaseline. I love where they took us with this character's journey and am very happy they fought the urge to have him be the heads/tails villain of the film. <br/><br/>Mister Doctor -Strange, maybe- himself was absolutely the star of the show because it was his adventure all the way through. In a universe of Gods, ants, Groots and anti-tank SuperSuits we hadn't yet delved into the world of MAGIC. It was Cumberbatch's nimble hands as an actor that carry us through this multiverse of gorgeous visualizations and imaginative showdowns. I love how Doctor Strange's battles come down to much more than fists. His cape supplies the brawn and his mind and cleverness are his advantage. This was realized perfectly and in doing so the film avoids any face-smashy, lava-vomit pitfalls that have plagued the adventure film genre. <br/><br/>The gigantic self-contained film is strongly written with brilliant pops of humor supplied by Dan Harmon (*Troy/Abed slapslap*) and brought to life with the most visually engrossing special effects that we've ever seen. The beautiful color palette and straight-from- the-books aesthetic of the multiverse, etc. had me grinning ear-to- ear. In short, Doctor Strange is revolutionary while also being exceedingly accessible and a classic hero's journey story. Like Star Wars: A New Hope, this movie is a master class in how to deliver an age-old tale with flair."

","Favorite marvel character, so was concerned expectations might be too high- grandson agreed this might be best marvel yet, Not sure which is the best: acting, cgi, humor, or action scenes. Suffice it to say it scores high on all levels. Don't usually think 3D makes a difference but it certainly adds a lot to this movie. Can't believe how well they entwined the clever humor with the dramatic scenes. Thought it started a little slow, but in retrospect, the character development , character flaws and motivation were well established in the early scenes. Will be hard to wait for the sequel or seeing the doctor in other Marvel offerings. Recommend it for dr fans and for newcomers or those into other characters in the Marvel universe."

Dormammu is so lame, isn't he suppose to be one of your most powerful villains, Marvel? The final defeat was just insulting to me as a viewer. <br/><br/>I felt they made this movie just to show us the green infinity stone so they can let us know there's an Infinity movie coming after they make a couple more of these brainwashed no good movies.

","The movie started out great and I thought it would be worth watching. The first 20 minutes of the movie was all right, but after that it went downhill, with a ridiculous story, lack of proper explanation, and below average acting. Apart from the visual effects, the movie is utter crap. Usually comic book based movies, even when the story involves magic, tries to include at least a minimum level of rationality in the plot(like Thor for example) but the story of this movie didn't even keep up to that minimum level. The only thing I liked about the movie was the presence of Benedict Cumberbatch(His acting was good as always).<br/><br/>If you like visual effects, then you may watch it but that's all you're gonna get. Everything else, especially the story, is just terrible. Apparently, as long as there are visual effects in an MCU movie, people give it good ratings irrespective of the quality of the story."

It reminded me of Michael Bay's Transformers movies. The movie itself was too short to tell the whole backstory of Doctor Strange, and a lot of that character development was lost. The plot itself moved too quickly to really gain the momentum that you wanted to feel for Doctor Strange and his plight, but fell short. <br/><br/>Was the studio ACTUALLY trying to make a movie about Doctor Strange? No. Like Suicide Squad, Doctor Strange was a quickly thrown together mish-mash of the Doctor Strange we grew to enjoy in the comics to tie the characters into The Avengers: Infinity War, by pathetically revealing at the end that heart of the amulet Doctor Strange wore was an Infinity Stone. <br/><br/>Don't waste your money on even renting this film.

"Semisonic","4","2","5","15 February 2017"," A big shiny interdimentional fart
","""He's compensating for something"", that's what Shrek said when he saw the tall and impenetrable castle of Lord Farquaad for the first time. Well, in a way, the same could be said about Doctor Strange. This film has so many talented and trending actors involved that it could either be absolutely great or... or all that talent and gravitas were simply a distraction from something profoundly failing. Cloud Atlas was an example of the former. This film, alas, is one of the latter.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange goes off the hinges from the very beginning, when you see people as serious and dramatic as Mads Mikkelsen and Tilda Swinton go full Last Airbender and start waving hands as if they had a seizure. You might be hoping that it's just an awkward intro and another acclaimed batch made of Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rachel McAdams would do better. Alas, that talent also gets wasted on waving hands and saying pompous nonsense. Well, except for McAdams, who basically remains her typical cute/sensitive/soothing self, thus giving this film one of its scarce redeeming points.<br/><br/>However, it's not the characters that cause Doctor Strange to fail. Separately, they are rather amusing, and the talent and charisma the actors still possess bring in a handful of small ironic or witty or indeed dramatic and touching episodes which we could actually enjoy.<br/><br/>But when the main story kicks in, it all goes sideways. Because the world of Doctor Strange is not just lacking a strong guideline. It's also ridiculously rehashed, looking like a product of a perverse carnal love of Harry Potter and The Matrix that took place inside Christopher Nolan's mind while he was trying to go deeper by taking another LSD pill and reaching into that fractal trip. It might even sound cool, like who doesn't love HP or The Matrix or Inception. But, albeit intricate and appealing by themselves, together those concepts are as compatible as a fish, a dog and a bird: pulling each in its own direction and ultimately letting the combo go stale. Towards the finale the film gets so dull and generic that you would have to force yourself to keep attention to what's going on.<br/><br/>It's obvious that, after several decades of comic books and almost 20 years of screen adaptations, Marvel is in crisis of coming up with new interesting characters to build new stories around, while the old characters gradually wear off. The last Iron Man was a mess, the last Thor was a dark dullfest, and a fresh addition of Ant-man resulted in a complete travesty. The only hero that still pulls his (and his colleagues') weight is Captain America, which is even more surprising considering that he's far from the most popular superhero Marvel owns. The studio still manages to mix its toys in rather interesting ways, making them fight either alongside or against each other. So my only hope for Doctor Strange is that his addition wouldn't ruin that already overcrowded mob scene. Because in Marvel's world there are way too many marvels already."

"corin_charly","8","2","5","15 November 2016"," Make room Avengers...Stranger things are in town now
","Let me give you some advice. Forget everything that you think you know. Doctor Strange is no typical Marvel movie. Despite the naturally awful yet hilarious jokes, the random Stan Lee Cameo and the surprise (well. Hardly surprising anymore) end credit scene this new Marvel Installment Is truly mind boggling. The film may take a side note to its bigger and more well-known compatriots, the Avengers, but Doctor Strange make its voice well heard through its wonderful style and spectacular cinematography. <br/><br/>The Doctors tale starts off in typical fashion, with Strange's origin story, but soon we are taken into unfamiliar territory upon Strange's quest to heal his hands. We are taken to a Himalayan temple in Kathmandu. It is here where the true mind distortion begins. After a moment of doubt, Strange starts to believe when he is taken into a literal out of body experience, and this is only where the madness commences. We are then gets taken into a world that I can only describe as a hallucination that is caused by use of Magic Mushrooms, which I believe must be the only way the writer and the cinematographers came up with the idea for the visuals in this crazy two-minute sequence. There is no simply no other way to put it. But the kaleidoscope-like void entices Strange as it does its audience. And it is from that moment that the arrogant Doctor learns the ways of the mysterious magical monk, played by the captivating Tilda Swinton. But also, Strange quickly learns that this magical world comes with its downsides. The threat of the malignant Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) a former student of the Kamar- Taj temple provides the films antagonist. And the introduction of a new alien being comes along to help shake up the marvel universe.<br/><br/>Gravity defining, time evolution helped with a dash of the effervescent and magical New York (which always seems to be in trouble in these Marvel films. I'd move) are tools at the films disposal. And they're used with great imagination. New York city becomes a folding book, dimensions are broadened and a particular highlight is the battle in New York, where the visual effects are used in enthralling style. Time becomes disoriented and a new instrument is welcome into the marvel film universe. Cumberbatch, like almost everyone cast in Marvels films, is an inspired choice. He adds cockiness and the playboy mannerisms, á la Robert Downey Jr, required for the character. Despite his character arc not making complete sense (he's an arrogant and selfish jerk who suddenly becomes selfless and good willed with no build-up) he adds some humour relief and undoubtedly steals the show becoming a welcome addition to the marvel superhero team. Rachel McAdams and Chiwetel Ejiofor are sacrilegiously underused but came good whenever used on screen without enough to shout about. Mikkelsen never seemed a big enough threat and hardly stood up with Cumberbatch's hero. Tilda Swinton provides her usual crafty and I- know-what's-best-and-you-don't tone to the film and is an efficient enough teacher for Mr Str.*ahem*. Doctor Strange (Is that the new ""Its CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow?"")<br/><br/>Doctor Strange provides a welcome break from the troubles within the Avengers world. Its stellar lead performance and its reality defining Oscar worthy visual effects *claps hands* alone make it one of Marvel's best. Scott Derrickson and crew do a magnificent job at displaying such a complex and fascinating world whilst giving Benedict Cumberbatch his moment to shine even if the others don't get such an opportunity. A risky move by Marvel but they have passed yet another test and in doing so they have changed the Marvel movie universe forever, and made its possibilities endless."

","Okay, I'll start right out by admitting I'm a huge Benedict Cumberbatch fan so went in to this with high expectations. They were met! The role of Captain Strange allowed us to see Benedict change and grow into this character, which he did in splendid fashion. There was not one role miscast in this one. Everyone was terrific! The special effects are phenomenal. And in addition to the action -­ lots -­ there is some laugh out loud humor, too. I would have gladly given this movie 10 stars but for one thing toward the end of the picture that I did not like­ - it made little sense and less logic. No spoiler here,­ you check if out and see. Also, when I see a movie I like I enjoy sitting through the credits while still wrapped up in what I've just experienced before venturing out into the real world. Was glad I did.

"charliesonnyray","8","2","5","12 November 2016"," Phase Three is Looking Good
","If Marvel keeps this streak up, they might possibly make a superhero film on the same level as the Dark Knight. Doctor Strange is about a neurosurgeon named Stephen Strange who has it made. He's rich, famous and he even has an on again, off again girlfriend. However that all changes when he gets into an awful car accident and completely ruins his hands. It looks like he can never operate again so he does everything he can to fix his hands. His last ditch effort is to seek The Ancient One-a Celtic mystic that resides in the far East. Stephen then finds himself in a world of magic, sorcery and alternate dimensions. The rabbit hole goes deeper though as one of the Ancient One's old students has sided with an evil entity named Dormamu who wants to-you guessed it-take over the world and Stephen is the only one who can stop him. Even if this movie wasn't tied to the MCU, it would still be very interesting and a great film in and of itself. It still has many of the previous entries' quirks such as goofy humor, great action but one dimensional villains. However, they balance that out with new things such as psychedelic visuals, great character development and creative action sequences. They really go all out with the possibility of magic and many of the best parts of the film revolve simply around the idea of these people being able to bend reality to their will. The actors all do a spectacular job as well bringing life to these performances. But of course this would all be for nothing if it weren't for the great writing and characters. Even though this villain is nothing to brag home about, we might get another new villain in the future that's just even more menacing and interesting.

","The trailer for the movie that I saw says it's like nothing you've ever seen before. I think that was a pretty good description, as the special effects are nothing short of astounding, and I'm sure worthy enough for Oscar consideration in that area. That might be the best reason to catch this flick, although Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role of the title character. This is one comic book I never read as a kid, so of all the Marvel movies that I've caught, and I think it might be all of them, this is one I came in on cold and I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie in fact turns a lot of typical super-hero conventions on their head. There's a reference to The Avengers in the story as a team that protects the physical world, while Doctor Strange's mission will be deemed as protector of the metaphysical one. One will have to simply take it on faith that the story line's treatment of astral projection, temporal manipulation and mirror dimensions can be translated into the real world, so accepting all that will be key to enjoying the story. For the most part I did, though that whole business with Strange challenging Romomu in the time loop dimension seemed to me a little forced.<br/><br/>As an origin story for Doctor Strange, I thought the narrative was pretty effective, forcing Stephen Strange to face the unconventional in the treatment of his physical condition following the accident. He starts out as this really arrogant guy who's stuck on himself as much as he's stuck on science, and it takes the combined effort of The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), Mordo (Chiwetel Ojiofor) and Wong (Benedict Wong) to bring him over to a multi-dimensional way of pursuing knowledge. If there's a downside to the story, It may be that Strange put it all together just a bit too quickly, but given the challenge of fitting things into a two hour movie, I guess we can excuse the rush job.<br/><br/>In my theater at least, it appeared that most viewers are now conditioned to hang around for the after-film previews of coming surprises in the Marvel Universe. This one actually had a couple, with a tease of a Dr. Strange/Thor hook-up that makes sense in terms of off planet adventure, while the second one suggested a future confrontation between Strange and his former mentor Mordo. Either way, we haven't seen the last of Doctor Stephen Strange.<br/><br/>Oh, almost forgot - Stan Lee is in this one, just like he is in almost all the movies of Marvel characters he helped create. I'll have to go back for a second look because he comes on screen as a truck driver saying ""That is hilarious"", in a scene that didn't seem to connect with what was going on at the time. And there was a lot going on at the time."

","I would be plastered with guilt were I to give in to the common consensus that Doctor Strange is a masterpiece and bury my thought regarding this film. Simply because this is yet another motif that Marvel has overused to the extent that any interesting dynamics soon appear normalised. An overly egocentric protagonist diminishing his own egotism to serve a higher cause is certainly not unique in the Marvel universe: Tony Stark also shares this resemblance. Nevertheless, since the film is constructed largely based on the comic, it may not be so justifiable to attribute the humdrum motif to the screenplay.<br/><br/>Despite my keen disinterest in this repeatedly harnessed motif, the urge to be lavish in my praise for the essence of the plot prevails. To dull one's ego in order to obtain knowledge is a powerful message conveyed by the film, reflecting the ideal attitude towards learning: an insatiable thirst for wisdom with an mind open to novelty. The notion that the boundaries between black and white are sometimes blurred, that good and evil are not a binary concept but two extreme ends of a spectrum where everyone lies in-between, bears much weight, as it shatters the utopian image of an impeccable protagonist.<br/><br/>I shall not make any concealment of my fondness for the cast. Besides Benedict Cumberbatch for whom I leave an extravagant amount of avidity, the image of Hannibal Lector seen through Mads Mikkelsen beams me up the moment Kaecillius emerges. The elegance in a minimalist style evident in Tilda Swinton has never failed to make me flutter.<br/><br/>The visual effect is superb, as always expected from a world- acclaimed production. The visual, or more precisely aesthetic, aspect of the film also pleases me much. I can draw some similarities of the visual concept of multiverse from Inception, which appear enjoyably mesmerising. The concept art is enchanting, given the fair admixture of modern cityscape with serene Oriental scenery.<br/><br/>The sole unsatisfying thing that bugs me about this film is the character development of Kaecillius. The portrayal of other characters is complete; yet the image of Kaecillius appears obscure. Very little ground is devoted to illuminate this character, arguably due to his insignificant role, as he seems to cease to play in following films. Had this figured been painted more definitively (include his own story in the narrative), the contrast with Stephen Strange would be more pronounced, seemingly more persuasive when building the tension of clashing ideologies."
"matthewssilverhammer","9","2","5","10 November 2016"," Another Marvel Winner
","Marvel's Doctor Strange is a visual feast of magical fantasy in the vein of Harry Potter & Aladdin. While its tone is in-line with the larger MCU, its style stands-out from its decidedly similar counterparts. With trippy universe traveling and Inception-on-steroids world bending, it's one of the few superhero entries in recent years whose giant scope is fitting, whose immense danger is understandable, and whose convoluted mythos works. In a make-believe world without boundaries, Doctor Strange runs with gleeful and refreshing abandon. Plot-wise, it has all the familiar origin-story beats: everyday genius discovers powers, his disbelief eventually gives way to the truth, initially struggles with powers, realizes he has inexplicable skill ""inside him"", and then uses his powers for sacrificial good. Its strength, as is the case with most MCU films, is its bright character and small moments of humanity. Strange starts as an intentionally less-charming Tony Stark before becoming a less dense Thor-like hero, surrounded by spiritual gurus, ageless sages, villainous space-jumpers and character-enhanced capes. It would be easy to allow overt piety to overwhelm the screen, but that is sidestepped nicely with great humor that plays with the intersection between normal reality and spiritual reality. That balance isn't always struck perfectly, however. Early on, there are too many strange tonal shifts and some pace-halting exposition that get in the way. Even the larger visual greatness is stunted at times in the frantic and hard-to-follow combat scenes. However, it's still a popcorn-fueled mind-bender that is (at worst) a middle-of-the-road Marvel film, which still puts it way above most blockbusters these days."
"reallyallthings","6","2","5","10 November 2016"," Stunning visuals with a movie that is sub-par at best.
","The first scene opens and immediately the movie forces Dr. Strange's genius upon you. You can't escape it, except if you know the first thing about medicine you'd know that every so called challenging case he takes up are no-brainers. His overconfidence in his abilities, his blatant disregard for his colleagues including the woman he apparently harbors feelings for and his desperate attempt to come off as witty is a cringeworthy experience.<br/><br/>In fact, if you have watched House MD, you'd be convinced that Benedict Cumberbatch has made a desperate but failed attempt at channeling Hugh Laurie. Laurie too is British with a fake American accent in his show; the difference being Laurie's accent happens to be quite convincing. While we are on the subject, Dr. House is legitimately wittier and Laurie is an actor whose acting skills are versatile, contrary to Cumberbatch who always plays the same old ""high functioning sociopath"" in every movie and is a repetitive actor with nothing new to offer.<br/><br/>As the movie goes on, we see Dr. Strange losing his dexterity which is a tragic event for anyone, even more so for a surgeon, but again I was unable to empathize with the character portrayed on screen. Why should I care about an egotistical jerk who is not even funny. This is a fault in the script which should have spent a little more time developing the character and feelings of Dr. Strange, and a little less time on the over lengthy CGI scenes.<br/><br/>The CGI was undoubtedly stunning; the 3D effects were outstanding and had great depth with an almost lifelike quality to them. The scenes of Nepal portrayed were astute and flattering. The kaleidoscopic rotation of the NYC landscape was as enchanting as it was captivating. Sadly enough, the visual aspect of the movie was its best part. Wait, I take that back. The best part was Chris Hemsworth as Thor in the cameo, providing us a hint to what's happening in the upcoming Marvel movies.<br/><br/>That brings me to my next point, Dr. Strange as a superhero is not someone you would root for, or in my case, fantasize about dating. His cloak, in fact, is much more appealing than the hero himself. This makes me reiterate my previous statement, the script should have focused on character development because empathy is what makes Marvel superheroes endearing. Thor's banishment and subsequent penance, Hulk's fear of hurting people, Wolverine's agony filled unending life and Iron Man in his entirety – these are some traits that made us love the previous superheroes. Dr. Strange has no such traits in his arsenal. If you ease your eyes and look, you would see that in his cloak and superhero suit combination Dr. Strange looks like Iron Man from several angles, even the facial hair is exactly the same.<br/><br/>The thing I loved about the movie was that it ventured into the metaphysical universe and focused on spirituality and the wonderful human psyche which has always been a personal fascination of mine.<br/><br/>The character of The Ancient One played by Tilda Swinton is nearly flawless, right up to the point where she is stabbed and killed off in a sequence that seems unnecessary. It is true that unless the mentor is dead or incapacitated the mentee cannot realize his true powers, but unlike most Marvel movies, this trope seems excessively forced here. We didn't even get the time to marvel at The Ancient One's staggering power and agility.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes Marvel movies, well marvelous, is the presence of a slick villain whom you love to hate and hate to love. Loki, Ivan Venko, you name it. Dr Strange lacked in this department too. Dormammu, while powerful, was not slick enough and his Zealots appeared like the minions they were, right from the start. I suppose that might change in the sequel when Mordu becomes the villain that we would love to hate.<br/><br/>The dialogs are pretty good, especially the sass that oozes out of the side characters, in particular, Mordu with his Wi-Fi password, Wong with his stoic face (#restingbitchfacegoals) and every other dialog of The Ancient One. It is a onetime watch especially if you are following the Avengers- Infinity Stone plot line and for the stunning visual effects.<br/><br/>· PLOT – 4/10 · COSTUME – 7/10 · ACTING – 5/10 · DIALOG – 7/10 · SCREENPLAY – 9/10<br/><br/>· OVERALL RATING – 6.4/10<br/><br/>What changes would you have made to the movie?

","While going to see the movie after several good reviews, I was pondering as to why capable actors accept these type of movie(where the scope of acting and thus challenge is minimal. At that time, I reached a conclusion that comic book characters are not any less creative than your regular movie characters. In fact they are product of a far wider (and sometimes wilder) imagination, giving actors opportunity to portray something they never thought of in their life. Hence it's a good enough motivation(of course the number one motivation is big money in the big blockbuster franchise).<br/><br/>As I started watching the movie, I realized in the opening sequence itself that this isn't going to be amazing. And the reason being, while the special effects looked real, they didn't felt real -- neither to me or the actors who were supposed to be in a warped 'building-bending' realm. Why? Because there were no stakes. If you ask yourself, is building bending upside down world adding anything to the chase? It wasn't making it difficult for anyone. Compare this to the Inception, where there was a race for lives against time. This was like, 'Oh, let me twist things a little' **wink, finger snap.<br/><br/>The story was very generic, bland and frankly it looked like it's assembled as per the standard operating procedure of Marvel Studio. I did not find the character of Dr. Strange intriguing. He acted well, but could not make me seriously care for him(part of the reason being the funny lines whenever things went towards serious.) When you don't look or act like a real person(I know it's about a Sorcerer, yeah, I know), I can't care for you like a real person. Therefore I wont' care if you die halfway (although, I know you won't die halfway because it's already announced that Dr Strange in next MCU movie) People are praising Tilda Swinton for her role, which I did not find charismatic at all. She looked like a lizard and not the Sorcerer Supreme they said she was. Compare this to Master Li Mu Bai in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, he nailed the role as a superior skilled master. (And if you can notice, he is Asian, unlike Tilda Swinton). The villain(s) were weak and other supporting characters were forgettable. I feel sorry for Rachel McAdams, her role was the worst.<br/><br/>So in all, it wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't a satisfying movie. It felt like a fast food item. It has some taste but no nutrition. And just like fast food, people are addicted to these type of movies and they are making tons of money for their studios. Marval has perfected this crime and DC wants to do the same. I have no idea, why people are writing good reviews for these big budget, blockbuster franchise movies. They does nothing more than burning your pockets and killing your brain cells."

","Commonsense will tell you that this Marvel material is beyond any sensible retelling, as there is not enough acid to go around. So relax and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>The plot and screenplay are totally built by the numbers, so you will feel as if you have seen the film many many times before. It shares with most bad films a feeling that it is just a flow of disconnected scenes. <br/><br/>And yet the reason why this works is entirely because the special effects and the actors meld into the MCU so nicely that all the scenes lose concrete meaning. In a film about mystic dimensions, this works in the films favour. Your lack of engagement kind of backs the premise, and the relaxed pace draws you into a stupor. But unlike the overly silly Guardians of the Galaxy, this takes itself seriously enough.<br/><br/>Even the fact that the film is copying Batman Begins, Big Trouble in Little China, the Matrix and to a lesser extent Inception just let you relax into it even more. You will learn nothing, yet be entertained."

","I have never read a Doctor Strange comic. There, I said it. I am an enormous comic book fan, but I have never even deigned to pick up an issue. The reason being this; Strange has always been too well, strange for me. His immense, and undefinable power has never attracted my interest, and I've often wondered how a ""sorcerer supreme"" could be the source of any decent storytelling. Well, thanks to Scott Derrickson, I wonder no longer. <br/><br/>While bearing many of the telltale signs of the MCU, Dr. Strange is a rather unique organism. While an orgin story, it is not one of physical strength, or endowment of immense power, but one of magical study. Yes, that's right, magic. Not science we don't understand yet, pure, honest-to-goodness. abra-cadabra, hocus-pocus, magic. Dr. Strange, a self-absorbed medical genius, is confronted with an existential crisis, in which he must humble himself, and learn an entirely new profession. Cumberbatch plays excellently, a man who's entire world comes crashing down upon him, and who must remake himself as a new man. <br/><br/>The love interest, a crucial component of any Marvel origin story, surprisingly turns out to be one of the most compelling parts of the film. Christine, Strange's ex-lover, is there the entire film, not as a romantic counterpart, but as a friend, and several times as a savior. There is love between the two of them, but divergent from the Marvel norm, the kiss at the end of the movie, is one on the cheek. <br/><br/>The movie is though, carried almost solely by its action. This is the most unique and entertaining part of the film. Buildings fold in upon themselves, capes put men in chokeholds, and portals are used as a weapon in combat. But in my humble opinion, the best action sequence s the scene in which while being operated upon, Dr. Strange engages in astral combat with his enemy. It encompasses the movie perfectly. It is brutal and unrelenting, and totally unseen by the world we live in. It is hard to understand, and confusing; the physics of the astral world are left mostly unexplained, and the viewer must figure out for themself what the combatants will or won't pass through. Most of all, its funny. Christine's baffled expressions as objects crash around the room are hysterical. <br/><br/>Like I said before, I had no expectation of enjoying Doctor Strange, but I did, Immensely. Simply because it is so delightfully different. Marvel has realized that in this golden age of comic book movies, a tonal differentiation is required for a movie to be fresh and engaging. This is an excellent call on their part. While Doctor Strange's manipulation of reality as a cinematic technique can be a bit shticky at times, its definitely fun to watch."
"lasttimeisaw","7","2","5","7 November 2016"," Another solid brick on the MCU's ever-expanding wall
","DOCTOR STRANGE, this latest MCU addition, officially takes audience to a more cerebral plane of brainy Sci-Fi concepts such as spiritual dimensions, astral world, immortality, eye of Agamotto, time-bending superpower, infinite time loop, etc. through the induction of the esoteric Oriental mystics, passed by The Ancient One (Swinton) in Nepal onto the elite New York neurosurgeon Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch), whose hands have been fatally injured in a car crash, and initially he seeks for a magic cure to grant him a way back to the operation table, before soon he will be saddled with a more challenging responsibility (the Siamese twin of power), to save humanity from ruination. So a resultant reaction from a non-comic reader, there is simply too much to ingest at a clip. <br/><br/>Hubris is Dr. Strange's fault-line, he has earned himself a God-like competency to save patients under critical conditions and (both inwardly and outwardly) gloats about it. Subtextually, that could be the reason why the goddess of fate and destiny decides to mete out punishment by taking away his ability. Humility is the ultimate salvation he need to foster along with his sorcerous training, it always takes some time for our hero to realize that. <br/><br/>As the introduction piece of Dr. Strange, the movie adopts a common-or-garden narrative arc to detail Stephen's transformative journey, his romantic tangles with co-worker Christine Palmer (McAdams) serves only as a side dish, but one must give credit to Palmer's ""don't explain to me what is happening"" precept, that is a life-saver, the less she knows, the more likely she will survive in the sequels. <br/><br/>The most enthralling nugget from this 14th entry of MCU is its paradigm-shifting, kaleidoscopic vista (although risking of being a deja-vu from Christopher Nolan's INCEPTION 2010) juggling with horizontal-vertical landscape mirror shifting, gravity-flouting kung-fu fighting, eye-opening out-of- body experience and stellar astral dimension, where dwells the super-villain Dormammu, who in fact, is devised with a bathetic exit strategy which foregrounds this ever-so-frustrating superhero genre's ingrained villain quandary, they all must appear too-big-to-fail with their omnipotence and doomsday menace, although no one in the audience would give a second thought about their invariably pre-designed defeat, to a degree it is impossible for deus-ex-machina to be plausibly brought to save the day. <br/><br/>The cast accomplishes a solid job, Cumberbatch is an accent-wizard, and pleasurable enough to keep his Cloak of Levitation in his benevolent mien with a touch of egotism still needs to shed. Ejiofor is underused as Stephen's mentor-degraded-to-sidekick Karl Mordo, whose loyalty turns sour in the aftermath to anticipate the next chapter (we should never break the law of nature!). Mikkelsen's Kaecilius is a very Shakespearean villain, excels in his own narcissistic soliloquy (Hannibal style), while his acolytes are not allowed to deliver even one line besides fighting and running. However, it is Swinton's ageless incarnation as The Ancient One raises the roof, she is a guru, a mystic, a leader, a warrior and an enigma all in the same time, one can only beef why her character should be so unceremoniously dispatched after her indomitable entrance piece, just because her mission is fulfilled after Stephen assumes the mantle? That is a disgrace. <br/><br/>Another brick on the MCU's ever-expanding wall, DOCTOR STRANGE is visually inventive, but story-wise unambitious, yet, his idiosyncratic sorcerer background could be welled mapped out onto a more heterogeneous cinematic scope, to elicit something substantially reinvigorating from an over-familiar, one-dimension confined THE AVENGERS' assembly."
"Ben_Cap","7","2","5","7 November 2016"," Visually Refreshing, Fundamentally Stale
","After the success of Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014, Marvel Studios started looking at all of those comic book characters previously thought to be too niche to be made into movies through a different lens. Now not just the Iron Men and Batmans get their own movies but also the little guys as well. This means we are bound to get come good copy cat movies and some bad ones. I am here to tell you where Doctor Strange falls on this spectrum.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch at first seemed like a strange(no pun intended) choice to me when it was first announced. Not that Ben would not be able to handle the role but he seems to me like the kind of guy who would feel above such roles. Cumberbatch brings a sort of legitimacy to the table that other than Robert Downey Jr. I don't think we have seen in a Marvel movie. This guy brings it and never feels out of place. He is funny and charming which seems like a must for a Marvel movie at this point but Cumberbatch elevates the playing field here. The rest of the cast is also filled out with studs such as Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen, Tilda Swinton and Rachel McAdams. I can't say a bad thing about one of them and this movie is no different. I can appreciate the diversity of the cast, even though Tilda Swintons' character may be a bit white washed.<br/><br/>As shown in trailers and other countless promotional material, director Scott Derrickson uses some pretty impressive visual effects to morph the world of the movie. I originally thought this would become intrusive and headache inducing but it is used well. It seemed that just before I would start getting dizzy the world would snap back to normal. I can also appreciate that even when the world is spinning and the background turns into something out of a Spirograph, that all the action is clearly visible. So many action scenes are ruined by shaking the camera all over the place and I am very much in the camp that likes to see what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes no new ground is being broken here. It follows the formula that has been cemented into the super hero movie genre. The hero's journey where two thirds into the movie the hero discovered that the villain he has been fighting pales in comparison to the power of the real evil that has been controlling our secondary villain the whole movie. Then it seems like the way to defeat the main villain is solved much quicker than the semi-villain. I know writers were brought in to try to punch up the script pretty late in the project but they were not able to save the ending from being somewhat underwhelming.<br/><br/>With all of the enjoyable things that Doctor Strange does and the small list of thing is does wrong you would think Doctor Strange would be getting a better score from me. My problem lies in the fact that these super hero movies are starting to feel very cookie cutter to me. There are not many risks being taken in these movies and they just want to find a way to keep giving people the same things with different utility belt wrappings. To be fair the other side of the spectrum is DC who can't seem to figure out not only how to make a good movie but just a movie that does not seem to spit in the face of the source material. Doctor Strange is not as good as the Guardians of the Galaxy's and Ant-Mans of the world but it is certainly better than Suicide Squad and Batman Vs. Superman which is good enough for at least some of my approval."

","Doctor Strange is the 14th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is directed by Scott Derrickson (Sinister, The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular character, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo, Rachel McAdams as Christine, and Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius. This movie is a different take on the superhero genre as it ventures into the fantasy world of magic. Thankfully, this film provides yet another great entry into the entry into the highest grossing movie franchise of all time.<br/><br/>For the most part this movie does a very good job of introducing audiences to the character of Doctor Strange. Other than scientific experiments, other worldly entities, or advanced technology Doctor Strange's plot involved Magic. This is something completely new to audiences as the paranormal side of this genre was previously unheard of. After a devastating car crash Doctor Strange loses his career as a surgeon. When western medicine fails him he travels to Asia in order to be healed by other methods. The other methods or magic here is taught to Strange by the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). Once Strange is introduced to magic this story truly takes off and becomes interesting.<br/><br/>While the first half hour of this film is completely necessary to introduce the character of Doctor Strange, I felt that the plot dragged a bit. I was not truly engulfed by this film until the magical elements were introduced and thus the pacing drags in the beginning. After that however viewers are thrown into the mystical world of Magic. This magical world is a visual feast. While I do not often talk about visuals in films, I can honestly say that this film blew me away. The CGI, style, and visual effects here are astounding. There are some truly mind bending visuals here including buildings shifting and turning inside out, extra dimensional travel, and even characters floating outside of their bodies. Action scenes in this movie are also very well-choreographed and extremely stylish. This kind of visual spectacle hasn't been seen since the film ""Inception"" and for that I completely praise the movie. Along with the visuals we're treated with a great soundtrack full of classic hits that viewers are sure to be pleased with.<br/><br/>Long before the production of this movie began fans have been saying that Benedict Cumberbatch should play Doctor Strange and they could not have been more right. Cumberbatch does an excellent job of portraying the arrogant yet humorous Strange. The transformation between egotistical asshole to dimension bending sorcerer supreme would not have been possible without Cumberbatch's great performance. Along with Cumberbatch Rachel McAdams plays the love interest in this movie. While it could be argued that her part in this movie is necessary, I believe that her character simply did not serve a purpose in the film. While her performance was not bad by any means, the character simply felt shoehorned in so that Strange would have a love interest (like almost every Marvel superhero to date). Wong (played by Benedict Wong) is a great side character and provides some much-needed comic relief. Also, Tilda Swinton who plays the Ancient One does a fantastic job of portraying a character who was originally an old Tibetan man in the comic books. This was a change that I was unsure of going into the film, but I was ultimately satisfied with. Unfortunately, the villain character of Kaecilius is rather weak. His motives are quite clear, yet is criminally underdeveloped which is a shame because Mads Mikkelsen is one of the most talented actors out there.<br/><br/>Scott Derrickson's horror background grants this film an eerie tone, with several disturbing and frightening images. Overall however, these horror elements lend themselves rather well to the story and Derrickson's directing is quite impressive. This film does a very good job of differentiating itself from the rest of the Marvel universe and standing on its own. The great acting, visual effects, and story here are more than enough to carry Doctor Strange past being just another superhero blockbuster. Doctor Strange is a movie that audiences will most likely remember thanks to its intriguing story line and visual effects. Score: 8/10"

The things that I didn't liked about the movie was the screen play as it felt a kind of rushed as I wanted to know more about the backstory but it was then overlapped by the suspense followed by epilogue, Rachael McAdams felt just a figure in the movie and Benedict Cumberbatch actually didn't had to flex his muscle as he was still playing the same arrogant guy from Sherlock without Watson.

It is a movie with excellent jokes, but that also knows how to set a serious mood, perfect special effects to go with it as well. In terms of coherence with the original story, it pretty much tells you the beginning, or rather, the rise of this superhero, little to no alterations made.

","I was so excited to watch this movie and I was satisfied. Doctor Strange is a must see. I have yet to watch it in 3D but without 3D it was amazing. Benedict Cumberbatch did the American accent so well even though he's natively British I give it a 10/10 for that. But the only problem that I had with the movie was that the green screens weren't the best but that's just me being picky about little things. The Stan Lee cameo was awesome (like every marvel movie). And the scene after the credits might hint to a future Thor movie? The plot was really good. It stayed true to the comics, and had a lot of funny characters that I actually cared about. It also showed a good amount of emotion . So if you need a super hero movie to watch,or if you just loved the comic like me I'd totally recommend Doctor Strange."
"KineticSeoul","8","2","5","6 November 2016"," Strange but fun experience
","With a lot of superhero movies that came out in the past with the hero fighting against villain or villains. They needed to bring something new to the genre to keep things a bit fresh. And ""Doctor Strange"" is the film the Marvel Cinematic Universe needed to bring to the table. While past good or even great superheroes movies delved into science fiction and Norse Mythology. It is for the most part grounded in reality despite other worlds and superpowers that is already set and predictable. Now it delves into altering reality and time by using mystical arts. Even going into astral and multiple dimensions. I wasn't sure what to think of this movie when I first saw the trailer. Because I usually found magic to be pretty boring in comic books because there really isn't a set of laws and there isn't any boundaries. So the possibilities are endless. Which can lead the hero or the villain to just use magic in just about every circumstances to overcome or avoid a conflict. Thankfully this film cleverly constructed it to make it seem like the heroes were actually in jeopardy. And added stakes to the conflict the character Doctor Strange must adapt and grow wiser and selfless in order to conquer. By washing away parts of his arrogance, selfishness and cynicism. But even in the beginning with those traits he did came off a charismatic and even sort of magnetic. Because of Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, because he is such a likable actor. He was hesitant about taking on this role but I am glad he did. Plus a lot of doctors have a bit of a god complex because of their profession anyways. When it comes to the special effects, CGI and action sequences it nothing like I have ever seen before. I mean I have seen some aspects of it, but not like this. What makes the action sequences stand out in this, isn't just the mind bending kaleidoscope like settings but it's clever choreography and execution. When it comes to the plot, it is a bit of a generic superhero origin story but that didn't take away much from the experience. Although I would have wanted more depth to Doctor Strange's downfall of the pain and turmoil he has to go through. So when he is able to rise, there would be a bit more impact to it. Plus I also though the training aspect of the plot was a bit glossed over. But I guess that was to quickly get to the superhero elements because they were on a budget after all. To sum up the plot, it's a mix of The Matrix, Iron Man, Inception, Kung Fu Panda and Alice Through the Looking Glass. I personally think it's okay to borrow elements from other movies as long as at it's core it does have it's own originality. And for the most part this does have it's own flare to it and it's own unique elements at it's core. I highly recommend you check out ""Doctor Strange"".<br/><br/>8/10"

","Doctor Strange - My Rating 4/5 Its a Mind-boggling, Mind-bending cinematic experience in 3D with Cumberbatch excellence. You will see scenes that you have never seen before or maybe have seen something similar(eg. Inception) but not like this.<br/><br/>Benedict plays a Tony Stark-like successful neurosurgeon whose basic characteristic and mannerisms are very similar to his own Sherlock or House i.e arrogant genius. So he meets an accident where his hands get messed up for which he goes to find a cure in Nepal. There he meets a ""Guru"" who is more like ""Morpheus"" in The Matrix and makes Strange realize that there's more than the ""real"" world. So he learns ""mystical arts"" or magic and there's this big threat which needs to be stopped.<br/><br/>What makes this movie worth watching in 3D are the effects in those magical scenes where as a viewer, you feel immersed like you are a video game character. Cumberbatch is, I don't even have to say it, he's the best choice for Dr. Strange. Supporting characters were good too, specially Rachel McAdams. And the best part, THE CLIMAX. Its not just about the cool effects/action, its very smart how Strange deals with the threat. The only weak thing I can think of is the ""forced"" humor. Some parts it felt funny, some it felt unnecessary. But overall, really worth your money.<br/><br/>P.S. And don't leave the seat when the credits roll. Remember, its a Marvel movie."

","Being a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch after watching Hobbit was simply the best decision I've ever made. Quite frankly, I was a bit skeptical when I saw the 2 trailers of this movie. But after watching this movie, I felt that Marvel has realized the true meaning of VFX and writing.<br/><br/>Although I don't have extensive knowledge about Doctor Strange's character but after watching the movie, I managed to understand the superpowers and the story behind it. <br/><br/>The direction was kept tight under all circumstances and the VFX was very smooth. New York and Hong Kong were shot beautifully and the editing was super crispy. <br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch performed phenomenally as Stephen Strange but some parts such as the interactions with Mordo could've been better because I felt he brought some mentality from Hobitt<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo was simply fantastic. She has the potential of playing decent villainous roles. The evil humor and the betrayal he showed was absolutely spot-on<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams on the other hand was a bit of a letdown in the movie although she is a decent actress but at this time around, I felt that she came up on set but just to earn a quick buck.<br/><br/>The background and sound design were purely efficient which kept the film's flow abstract. Something that Zack Snyder should learn about<br/><br/>Although the movie was short but the ending needed an additional sub- plot like whether Doctor Strange finds out that Mordo has gone to steal the energy but becomes a clueless scene due to the shortness of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this movie amazing apart from the shortness and Rachel's acting, it is pretty epic. Doctor Strange is worth watching at 3D or IMAX at a theater near you."

","Simply put, Doctor Strange is 'next level'. Yet it is simple.. straightforward. It knows some aspects can be too heavy and over the top, but embraces those elements.

He might be the perfect Sherlock Holmes, but he was born to play Doctor Stephen Strange. The movie wastes no time in explaining Dr Strange's origin and as an audience member you really do get invested in the character even though you might be seeing him on screen for the first time.<br/><br/>The acting performances are great, although, at the end of the movie you might be left wanting more from some of the characters.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a perfect addition to the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).

","'Doctor Strange' is the latest hero and film added to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With great power comes strange abilities, and boy does this film deliver elements of the weird:)<br/><br/>1. To start off, 'Doctor Strange' is the definition of a ""good"" movie, and that's pretty much all I can say about it. The one and only thing that makes this film stand out are the visuals and unusual powers the characters possess. In no way is it horrible, but it falls short of being something great since the world of Doctor Strange had damn near unlimited possibilities. We've seen the science and fantasy before, but this film deals particularly with magic and the supernatural. I can easily compare the tone of this movie to 'Thor: The Dark World', where it's satisfying but just okay.<br/><br/>2. Apart from the journey of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to find the Ancient One and regain proper use of his hands after a terrible car crash, the plot revolves around a rogue master named Kaecilius (Mad Mikkelsen) who has stolen pages from a book of spells in order to open a dark realm and unleash a dangerous evil entity. As far as intrigue, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't fascinated with the character of Strange himself, and his training in becoming the Sorcerer Supreme. The visuals are stunning, the creative action sequences, and (of course) Mr. Cumberbatch are by far the best parts of the film.<br/><br/>3. For years now, Benedict Cumberbatch has been one of my top five favorite actors, and he delivers the best he can. The only personal flaw of mine is that I don't quite see him as Doctor Strange quite yet. I believe the script wasn't as keen as it could be on developing the character to the point where he feels solidified in this universe. Mad Mikkelsen is scary and physically brutal as Kaecilius, but the writing just isn't there to give his character more weight. He had the potential to be just as lethal as say....The Winter Soldier, yet the script doesn't do him justice nor the rest of the main cast.<br/><br/>4. People may compare Stephen Strange to Tony Stark when it comes to ego and arrogance, but Strange is not so self-centered to the degree of Stark. Rachel McAdams is hinted to be Strange's love interest as the film progresses, but the dynamic between them isn't what you might expect. The only warning I'd give comes during the climax. Let's just say I got flashback's of 2011's 'Green Lantern' when a particular threat is introduced during an inter-dimensional sequence. The movie is only 115mins long, but things feel extremely rushed, especially the transition of Stephen Strange into the Sorcerer we know.<br/><br/>5. I also give both Tilda Swinton (Ancient One) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (Mordo) a lot of credit since they play their respective roles to great conviction. If you do go see this in theaters, I strongly recommend that you wait till the very end, cause there are two amazing post-credit scenes, one in particular which sets up another highly anticipated Marvel film slated for next November;) <br/><br/>There are so many things to touch on, but they are so minor it can be overlooked. I really like this movie, although as much as I wanted to, I couldn't fall in love with it. All that being said, 'Doctor Strange' is still one of the better comic-book movies this year right behind 'Captain America: Civil War'."

","If it weren't already a comic, I would be scratching my head as to where this was coming from.<br/><br/>There are familiar elements in every Marvel film, and this one checks them off one by one. Doctor Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a Sherlock meets Tony Stark arrogant genius neurosurgeon who is forced to seek out alternative treatment for his damaged hands after starring in this year's feature-film distracted-driving PSA.<br/><br/>He meets the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), who while teaching Strange how to tap into the energies of the multiverse is facing a crisis brought on by her former pupil Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) attempting to bring about Earth's demise.<br/><br/>It is by no means a secret that this film, like all Marvel solo films, ends with the hero facing the villain in a big showdown. The real surprise, though, is that the very nature of Strange's powers means that you don't really know what he's going to pull out of the hat next to solve a given problem.<br/><br/>This makes it an enjoyable narrative to follow, even if the witty anecdotes sometimes go too far and break you out of the moment, where you realize there was just five witty comments in a row, and this is supposed to be a drama (ish).<br/><br/>With all that being said, see this film. Just don't come drunk. Or high. The visual effects will be trippy enough."

","A Marvel film that gets it right. These aren't actors, these are Actors.<br/><br/>This film shocked me. Initially interested by the cast and not being familiar with Dr. Strange, I went to see the Thursday previews. I have to say, I unabashedly enjoyed this, having never enjoyed a Marvel film. While they usually feel like paint by the numbers, this film, while unable to escape those same trappings, was elevated by the outstanding performances and the direction that felt like it was able to deviate from the mold most of their other films are trapped in.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch, who can do no wrong, is perfect as Dr. Strange. He's quick, sharp, debonair, and intelligent. He's a hoot to watch in this film. Equally as exciting in such an unexpected turn is Tilda Swinton. She could have a standalone film, her character is so interesting. The chemistry between this entire cast was electric and while, of course, the story is fantasy, if you can sit through that and manage, you won't regret it for a second.<br/><br/>As for the score, it felt very Hollywood, very expected, and didn't interest me the slightest bit. The overall craftsmanship was strong but was like all other Marvel films, love it or hate it.<br/><br/>My bottom line is, if you can get past the comic book characters, their silly quirks, AND the ridiculousness of this story, there are brilliant performances that await you and a fun roller coaster ride all because of them. 8/10."
"bigmadams","8","2","5","4 November 2016"," What an exciting and trips ride!!!
","Plot Synopsis: Brilliant but arrogant surgeon Stephen Strange has his hands crippled in a car accident. His ego and pride see him refuse to accept his diagnosis and he spends everything he has on treatments to repair his ruined hands. When all western methods fail, he learns of a place in the far east called Kamor-Jar and heads there in desperation. But instead of finding a cure, he finds that his reality is only one of countless possible universes. And he then begins his journey to becoming the Sorcerer Supreme through mastery of the Mystic Arts.<br/><br/>""What an exciting and trippy ride"" is what you will be saying after you have seen Doctor Strange. A movie that has been described as arguably Marvel's best film adaptation to date. Although I personally wouldn't go that far, as I feel Guardians of the Galaxy still holds that distinction. But this amazing piece of popcorn cinema does come very very close. Benedict Cumberbatch was simply the perfect choice to play Doctor Stephen Strange on every level.<br/><br/>Marvel Studios even went as far as to delay the making of the film so they could cast him in the role. Cumberbatch is a very in-demand actor in Film, TV and the stage. So initially he was forced to turn down the role. However, so sure were Marvel Studio heads that he was the right man for the job they put everything on hold in order for Cumberbatch to complete his other obligations. This is not a common occurrence in the film industry I might add! When it comes to making movies, time is indeed money. Normally when a studio's first choice of actor can't or won't commit, they move on and re-cast the role.<br/><br/>So the fact they were willing to wait over a year to ensure the perfect casting shows a great commitment to quality on Marvel's part. And it was definitely the right decision! Cumberbatch nails Strange to a tee. The other casting choices, however, were met with controversy and accusations of ""whitewashing."" And while I can certainly understand how some people may have felt, these claims are unjustified. The reason why Tilda Swanson was cast as the Ancient One (Doctor Strange's teacher in the mystic arts) is simpleAsian stereotypes suck!<br/><br/>People need to realize the comic was created in the 1960's where such practices were normal. But, you couldn't get away with that stuff todayand rightly so! That is also why the character of Wong (Played by the aptly named Benedict Wong) is not Doctor Strange's manservant (as originally portrayed in the comics) but is instead a formidable Master of Mystic Arts, tasked with protecting some of Kamor-Jar's most valuable relics and books. And as far as the gender swapping of the Ancient One character goes, the answer is pretty simple again.<br/><br/>The only other female character in the film is a Doctor Christine Palmer (Played charmingly by Rachel McAdams) who is Doctor Strange's love interest. But the character has a total screen time of about 6 minutes by my count. So really, it was a necessity to have a strong female character with depth get a decent amount of screen time in the movie! And the film is far better for it in my opinion. Tilda Swanson plays the role of the Sorcerers Supreme with a certain amount of glee. It is pretty clear that she had a lot of fun playing the Ancient One. And the chemistry between her and Cumberbatch is obvious.<br/><br/>But the movie isn't without its faults! Chiwetel Ejiofo's Karl Mondo (a skilled Master of the Mystic Arts who is a little too by the book for both Strange's and the Ancient One's tastes) adds little to the story. However, it's clear by the film's end (and post credit scene) that he will play a larger and hopefully more interesting part in Doctor Strange's future adventures.<br/><br/>The movies villain Kaecilluis (Played by Mads Mikkelsen) is proof that DC has always had the edge over Marvel as far as fully fleshed out villains go. Not that any of that is Mikkelsen's fault! He is a brilliant actor working with very little to go on. The fact is that Marvel comics (as amazing as they are) never could quite come up with truly great bad guys. At least none that could be considered on par with the likes of DC's infamous rogue's gallery.<br/><br/>Now as far as the special effects goAMAZING is a word that I quietly uttered to myself several times while watching this film. This is definitely one of those films you simply have to spring the extra few dollars for to see in 3D. A 2D viewing of this film simply wouldn't do it justice. Overall, Doctor Strange is definitely something movie goers will be impressed by. And comic book nerds like ourselves won't be disappointed either I don't think."
"Kazombie","5","2","5","3 November 2016"," Mystical and Immersive
","I would like to state the fact that I am foremost a comic book fan and grew up reading all sort of comics. My favorite was always DC (Superman and Batman particularly) but I never let that fact get in the way of my enjoyment. A good comic book story was a good comic book story at the end of the day. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange is not as well known a character as the other Marvel Comic giants like Spiderman, The Hulk etc. Growing up, I always used to skip past the Doctor Strange bundle of comic books and pick up more well known character based comic books. Although, I was always intrigued by the well drawn covers of magical and mythical beings. <br/><br/>When I saw the trailer come out last year, my intrigue was piqued once again. So this morning, I went in to see the first show of Doctor Strange at my local cinema.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a very immersive and impactful introduction that immediately drew me in. Doctor Stephen Strange is a strange character indeed who is not your typical do-gooder. Yet even with all his shortcomings and arrogance, I felt connected to his character and I was very eager to see his transformation and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>All the characters are very well written. Mads Mikelsen's character was not as menacing as I would have liked him to be. Nonetheless, he is a worthy opponent to Doctor Stephen Strange. <br/><br/>The multi-dimensional VFX play a very important role in the cinematography and are done extremely well and tastefully. I enjoyed the pacing, the action, the humor and VFX. <br/><br/>The Stan Lee cameo and post credits scene with a well known Marvel giant is a tradition and is always a nice touch.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film to all comic book fans. Please let's not indulge in the rather childish comparison between DC and Marvel and enjoy a great comic book adaptation to the silver screen.<br/><br/>A comic book lover."

","I'm so glad I'm not a stoner because this movie would have fried my brain. In the words of my fave Kiwi musical comedy duo ""It's very trippy David Bowie"". OK let's be clear this is no ""Inception"", but it does try to warp your mind along with time and space a bit like the other Doctor (Doctor Who.) On this crazy journey a former neurosurgeon tries some Eastern healing, but ends up getting a black belt in the very dark mystic arts. Doc Strange is at times comical and who better to handle this role than the one all the Cumber Bitches follow...Benedict himself. He loves a period piece so a flying cape fits him perfectly. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Tilda Swinton join an impressive cast list, however it sometimes (read often) feels a bit twee and try hard. It didn't leave me wanting more even though clearly that's the intent of this latest Marvel superhero being brought to life on the Silver Screen.

","The movie is a mindless setup of entertainment and ""Marvels"" at that. The story is emptier than the Boötes Void, but there is action and a somewhat logical sequence of events.

(though I'm not a 3D fan, in any case)<br/><br/>The characters make sense, be it a bit stereotypical and without dept, but kudos to Tilda Swinton for a daring look.

","Marvel takes another risk with making a movie with one of their relatively lesser known characters. Benedict Cumberbatch uses his Sherlock skills to make the egoist Dr Stephen Strange to be likable.<br/><br/>He plays a cocky, brilliant neurosurgeon whose hands are shattered after a car crash. He travels to Nepal and to a secretive temple called Kamar-Taj headed by the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) where he learns mystical skills and magic when he broadens his mind and accepts his part in the multiverse.<br/><br/>Marvel Studios gets all trippy with multicoloured Salvador Dali inspired sequences that also owes a lot to Christopher Nolan's Inception of folding cityscapes.<br/><br/>The plot is perfunctory though. Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen made up to look like a glam rock star) is a former student of the Ancient One, who believes there can be eternal life and the Celtic Ancient One has been holding out as to her real source of her powers. He makes a pact with an entity from the dark dimension that wants to destroy the planet.<br/><br/>There is something Harry Potter like about this film, especially as some of the scenes were filmed in London. There is a nifty sequence with the Cloak of Levitation that has chosen to be with Dr Strange.<br/><br/>Solid support from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo who teaches Dr Strange to fight and Benedict Wong as the protector of the ancient books. Rachel McAdams plays Christine Palmer, a fellow medic and love interest of Dr Strange. McAdams incidentally appeared in the Robert Downey series of Sherlock Holmes films."
"alindsay-al","9","2","5","28 October 2016"," Another fantastic marvel film that is truly unique
","I am a huge fan of the marvel cinematic universe and I think it is just getting better and better and this trend continues with doctor strange. The premise of the film sees a rich surgeon suffer horrific injuries, on his route for help he encounters a group that can help him and give him the opportunity to become doctor strange. Benedict cumberbatch plays Stephen strange and he is truly excellent in the role. He was funny when he needed to be but also had allot of depth to his character. You see true progression in his mentality and it makes him such a fun interesting character. Chiwetel ejiofor plays mordo in this film and he is probably the most interesting character in this film, his relationship with strange is fascinating to watch as you see both of their point of views with the situation. Tilda swintons casting as the ancient one received allot of criticism but she was great in this as a teacher for strange that had many layers to her character that made her a very interesting character. Rachel McAdams an Benedict wong at both great in this film for their roles but I do slightly wish they were in the film a little more. Madds mikkelson is a great actor and he does the best he can as the villain in this film with a few memorable moments he just doesn't have much to him at all which does hurt some of the conflict in the film. The story is a real good origin story for strange that seems him develop as a character really well, it also does a really good job for the majority of the supporting characters as well. However, I wasn't a huge fan with the last act of the film because I feel like it wraps up a bit too easy. The script has some really good humour in it but also mixes good drama that makes you really care about the characters. The style is so unique it is unreal, there are parts of the film that are completely trippy but they give this film such a unique feel. Also the magic battles were really cool and different in this film. Overall this is one of the better marvel origin films and is definitely worth a watch."
"brankovranjkovic","6","2","5","1 November 2016"," Dr strange – Story about what is Beyond Reality.
","Firstly let's take a quick look at Benedict Cumberbatch's filmography; (Hands up if you spot a pattern )<br/><br/>He played an arrogant investigator in 'Sherlock Holmes'. He played an arrogant scientist in 'The Imitation Game'!. He played an arrogant military officer in 'War Horse'!!. He played an arrogant villain (Khan) in 'Star Wars into Darkness'!!!. Guess what  he plays an arrogant neurosurgeon in this origin film of 'Doctor Strange'!!!! +++ OK enough of that +++<br/><br/>The film kicks off and after a brief character building section, we see Doctor Strange speeding along a windy road, he loses control of his sports car, the resulting accident causes devastating injuries, and he almost completely loses the use of his hands (pretty essential for a surgeon). <br/><br/>Ironically the only surgeon able to perform the necessary surgery on himself, is himself. After some failed experimental surgeries, Strange meets a former paraplegic who is, not only able to walk again, but is playing basketball after receiving some 'special' spiritual treatment. <br/><br/>Strange needs to go to Katmandu to seek the same treatment. He ends up unlearning everything he already knows and learns about magic and the about other dimensions. He's enthusiastic and even studies from books he shouldn't s be reading. His skills quickly improve, and essentially he needs to choose whether to regain the use of his hands or to use his new skills to defend the earth from evil mystical demons. <br/><br/>There are some amazing Mind-tripping visuals, that are absolutely stunning, especially in 3D. The special effects are kaleidoscopic, there are zero gravity fighting scenes in the streets and hallways, there are buildings that collapse and fold into each-other. <br/><br/>The only criticism I have is that even though the themes this film explores go far deeper than regular marvel films , it's hard not to compare it with 'Inception' or 'The Matrix' and for that reason I feel it lacks some originality. <br/><br/>Recommended for a slightly younger audience that might not be too familiar with the two other comparisons."

"taryllsbaker","9","2","5","30 October 2016"," Visually, think Nolan's Inception mixed with Kubrick's 2001, but on a serious acid trip.
","Doctor Strange is written & directed by Scott Derrickson and stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Mads Mikkelsen, Tilda Swinton, Michael Stuhlbarg and Benjamin Bratt.<br/><br/>A former neurosurgeon embarks on a journey of healing only to be drawn into the world of the mystic arts.<br/><br/>Expand Your Mind. This tagline defines the film perfectly. Marvel's Doctor Strange takes us beyond our world and explores the many alternate dimensions, using phenomenal visuals to further expand the Cinematic Universe. In some ways this film feels secluded and disconnected from the MCU, yet it features the familiar wit and style of previous instalments. It's satisfying to experience something so vastly different to what we've seen before with such an incredible array of colour and critique. The history feels real, the set pieces and locations feel real, and most importantly, the characters feel real. This film is so refreshingly short and sweet, allowing for a more immersive experience, without any feeling of painstaking pacing issues. <br/><br/>Cumberbatch is surprisingly brilliant as Stephen Strange, a substantial amount of importance is present in his performance. It seems we have another comical addition to the MCU, with Strange being similar to Tony Stark. His humour is sharp and well- timed, but in no way detracting from the dark quality of this film. Tilda Swinton plays a mysterious character named 'The Ancient One' who reveals to Strange the unseen powers beyond our dimension, with wonderful charisma. Wong, as Wong, delivers many humorous opportunities for Strange, and thus becoming a recurring back-and- fourth. Kaecilius isn't developed enough as a character to be judged to a huge extent, however Mikkelsen's performance is satisfactory. McAdams co-stars with a fairly underwhelming act but has some good moments. Hopefully her character will be developed in the future to give McAdams some room to expand on the background and ongoing relationship with Strange.<br/><br/>'Expand' seems to be a recurring theme, doesn't it? Leading me to the original score by Michael Giacchino, which is somewhat memorable if only because the main theme is cutting undeniably close to his work on Star Trek. The other pieces are fitting but I felt a more ancient approach could have been taken, in order to branch out the theme of the entire film. However, there are some beautiful string arrangements, which is always the case with Giacchino. I wouldn't expect much more from a Marvel soundtrack, though at least it feels like they're trying to push in a more appealing direction. <br/><br/>Speaking of new directions, the visual effects are stunning. This is a visual spectacle, a masterpiece. The MCU has never looked so beautiful, vibrant and alive. With Strange's new metaphysical abilities, we can see the world in a new light. Think Nolan's Inception mixed with Kubrick's 2001, but on a serious acid trip. The Art Direction is impeccable and everyone from the Art, Sound, Special and Visual Effects departments should be extremely proud of their work. This is captured and showcased superbly by Ben Davis, who has worked on some brilliant projects in the past, including James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014.<br/><br/>Overall, there are some small improvements to be made, but I have no doubt that these will be developed upon in future instalments. These are barely noticeable, however, and in no way detract from the amount of fun you will have watching this film.<br/><br/>Verdict; The story is great, the characters are great, but it's really the visual design and effects featured in Marvel's superior Doctor Strange that puts the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange, 9/10."

They portray multiverses in such an amazing an interesting way. The negotiation with Dormamu is my fave scene in the movie. The time loop was propably one of the most clever ways to ""defeat"" a villain i've seen in a movie. It also shows what kind of person is Stephen Strange. In the end i think its propably my fave marvel movie and i am excited to see more of Strange's world"

","I'm a huge fan of the MCU, but still i haven't had really high expectations for this movie and it still disappointed me a bit. The beginning where we get to know Doctor Strange was to short and with way to big jumps in the time line. Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius was for me a waste of such a talented actor. They introduced him as the villain pretty bad, i would have liked to see a bit more of him, for example his origin story. And in the end the Storyline was pretty weak at all. At least i can say the CGI and the effects are fu*king awesome. Most of the fights look pretty cool and some of them are a real mind fu*k to watch.<br/><br/>One thing more. I'm not 100% sure if i've seen this right. When they are in the temple in London you can see it from the outside for a second and then there's is a plague which says, if i remember it right, 177B Beeker Street. This is for sure an Easter Egg to Benedict Cumberbatch's prime role as Sherlock, who's living in the 221B Baker Street. I say it again. I'm not 100% sure but go and watch it by yourself.

","""Dr. Strange"" ranks as the best Walt Disney Studios and Marvel Comics' collaboration since ""Iron Man."" Mind you, I've confined myself strictly to the Disney/Marvel franchise and excluded the Marvel Comics/Twentieth Century Fox franchises: ""X-Men,"" ""Deadpool,"" and ""Daredevil."" Not only is director Scott Derrickson's sixth movie a dazzling example of bizarre superhero histrionics, but it also qualifies as a splendid origins epic in every respect. Wisely, Derrickson confines this supernatural masterpiece to 115 minutes without slighting any character or leaving any threads undone in its formulaic template. Benedict Cumberbatch is truly a revelation as Dr. Steven Strange, and his character follows quite an arc before the film concludes. Audiences should know that ""Dr. Strange"" has two scenes before and after the end credits that are essential to the film. Steven Strange possesses an abrasive attitude, and ""Dr. Strange"" adheres to the Disney/Marvel formula that originated with ""Iron Man."" Dr. Strange is just as arrogant as Tony Stark. These two prima donnas begin as ordinary humans with extraordinary gifts before hubris and bad luck combine to topple them from affluence. Similarly, they recover from these seemingly insurmountable ordeals with the incentive of a powerful mentor and emerge as larger-than-life titans. Unlike the colossal collateral damage that has highlighted virtually every Disney/Marvel movie to date, ""Dr. Strange"" embraces an alternate strategy. This movie eschews the real world and lapses more often into the imaginary realm. The heroes don't destroy cities in their efforts to subjugate the villains as they have usually done in previous Disney/Marvel extravaganzas. Furthermore, Derrickson channels ""The Matrix"" in the depiction of Dr. Strange's makeover as he learns about how to exist in different dimensions. Meantime, in its biggest departure from the Marvel comic book series, Derrickson and company have broken a tradition. They have cast Oscar winning actress Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One who introduces Strange to the wondrous mysteries of the mind. In the comics, the Ancient One was a guy rather than a girl. <br/><br/>""Dr. Strange"" serves not only as a sensational Marvel Comics adaptation but also as commentary on a national epidemic of distracted driving that has swept the country since the advent of cell phones. Protagonist Dr. Stephen Strange (Oscar nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch of ""The Imitation Game"") is an eminent, world-renowned surgeon who has achieved unparalleled feats with his hands. As he is searching for his next surgical triumph, Strange is careening along a swerving mountain-side highway without a care in the world. He has his phone switched on in his sleek sports car and it debating to accept a new patient when he loses control of his vehicle, smashes into another car, and flies off the highway like a UFO, and crashes miles below in obscurity. When he awakens after surgery, he finds his hands permanently mangled. Repeated surgeries gain him nothing, and gifted surgeons like he once was refuse to take his case for fear of ruining their track records. Eventually, Strange spends so much money than he loses virtually everything he had acquired, and he loses the woman that he loved the most, Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams of ""The Vow""), who refuses to have anything to do with her after he insults her. Later, during his rehab, Strange alienates his rehab therapist. The therapist tells Strange about a similar man, Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Pratt of ""The Infiltrator""), who triumphed over his limitations. Strange is shocked to learn that this patient recovered from an impossible spinal injury that nobody has conquered. Desperate to know how Pangborn accomplished this unheard-of feat, Strange accepts Pangborn's advice and travels to a monastery in Nepal. Strange blows the rest of his dwindling funds and approaches the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) in the mountains. She shows him familiar pictures of the human body, and Strange accuses her of being a quack until she knocks him out of his body into an entirely different dimension. Performing an about-face, Strange humbles himself before her as he plumbs the depths of his mind that he never thought probable. Although he never recovers his long-sought after manual dexterity, he becomes a different person who can alter time and space. Little does he realize that the mystical world that he has entered has been traveled by others who endeavor to exploit their new-found power to destroy the world. Along the way, he establishes his identity as Dr. Strange, not as Mr. Strange or Master Strange. Like all memorable Marvel movies, ""Dr. Strange"" sacrifices the life of one of its primary characters to endow the film with a sense of depth. <br/><br/>""Sinister"" director Derrickson, ""Prometheus"" scribe Jon Spaihts, and ""Sinister"" franchise writer C. Robert Cargill have created a thoroughly entertaining film fraught with nuance and detail. The villains are smart, strong, and resourceful adversaries that look truly malevolent. The villains are interesting but never sympathetic, and ""Casino Royale"" villain Mads Mikkelsen is perfectly cast as the leader. The titular hero must endure trial after trial before he acquires his unique powers as Dr. Strange. Like any worthwhile superhero saga, ""Dr. Strange"" puts the fate of the world at stake, and our resilient hero must contend with enemies far more formidable than he until he masters his skills as a sorcerer and defeats them. Derrickson and his writers have forged believable, sympathetic characters that we care about. ""Dr. Strange"" amounts to an enjoyable load of hokum embellished with mind-boggling visuals. When the heroes and villains tangle, they create worlds within worlds to stage their Armageddon-style showdowns without endangering the rest of humanity. The sight of cityscapes folding up like accordions is nothing short of spectacular. If you've seen the Leonardo DiCaprio thriller ""Inception,"" the sprawling cityscapes behave in similar fashion as our heroes battle to control the arena with the bad guys. You may figure out who decides to give up their life to ensure the safety of future generations. Provocatively, fadeout at the end doesn't necessarily guarantee the triumph of good over evil."

","Even though Disney bought Marvel you should not attribute this rubbish to them! I can not remember when the last decent Marvel film was out in the cinemas but this should definitely be on the 'do not watch' list along with Avengers Age Of Ultron, and Guardians Of The Galaxy. There are at least one or two more but I can't think of the names of them right now! The characters are all exceedingly bland, I felt nothing for any of them. Not one is really all that memorable. The all-powerful The Ancient One wasn't powerful enough to stop pages from a spell book being stolen at the start of the film so not quite so all-powerful. Strange, after a car accident/crash joins a mystical retreat to learn how to use his hands again because he supposedly can't use them. Before going and finding the retreat he tries shaving but can't do that yet he can use his hands for everything else! The other characters are all secondary and lesser to Doctor strange and because the character, like the plot and the story(line) has so little to it, the film is padded out with stupidly long interdimensional fight scenes that make the film really confusing as there is no reason and no explanation for them. They just happen."

"sosmetallin","8","2","6","20 November 2016"," Totally worth your time(but with some flaws)
","Doctor Strange (the 14th entry to the MCU) is the origin story of the Marvel character...Doctor Strange(obviously). Dr Steven Strange is an arrogant neurosurgeon who will immerse himself in the world of mystic arts hoping to cure his hands which have paralyzed after a car accident. Before I talk about the details, I want to say that the movie is definitely good, with some interesting strengths, but some weaknesses as well. I strongly suggest that you watch it in the cinema or a big screen(40+ inches) to fully experience its spectacle (3D is recommended). I haven't read any of his comics, so I will judge it clearly as a movie, not as a comic adaption.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the visual effects, because it is the easiest part. They are seriously good, like Oscar-nomination worthy. I don't think I exaggerate. Not a second will you feel like you are watching something fake. And this is, of course, an accomplishment given the extraordinary(Inception-like and even more impressing, I dare to say!) scenes you will witness. They make up the most of the action, which is breathtaking and probably the strongest aspect of this movie. But it's not only about the cool-looking battles, the story is also pretty good. It has the basic structure of Iron Man but the ""mystic arts"" factor is what makes it unique. I will talk again about the story, because here lies the major problem about the movie. As far as the characters are concerned, they are all pretty likable. Steven Strange is the intelligent arrogant guy with humor that eventually changes his mind and uses his intelligence for the greater good. And, of course, Benedict Cumberbatch is really good at this role. He plays arrogant guys all the time. I also liked Rachel McAdams' character as Strange's love interest. Not necessarily an important character, but because of her, some really funny moments occur so it's always fun to watch these two together. Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One plays well her role, although I did expect more from her as a character. You see, in movies where the protagonist learns some sort of a new art, we as viewers usually create a bond with the teacher/master along with the protagonist. For me it was a little disappointing to realize that her character was not so developed. Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius was not particularly great but above the average Marvel villain. He is not the ""muahaha I want to destroy everything because I am bad"" type of villain. He just does what he thinks it's right and you can understand his motives. He is menacing and poses a threat even for the Ancient One. We don't really get to know him well and that's why he is not a remarkable villain. All the other characters like Wong and Mordo are good as well and often contribute to the comic relief of the movie. Now, let's talk again about the story and focus on the pacing, which was the biggest weakness of Doctor Strange. The problem is that it never takes its time in order for us to get to know something or someone well or introduce in depth this new world. Do you remember in Harry Potter some scenes in Hogwarts' classrooms where we are taught along with the characters about various spells, creatures etc? Those scenes help us immerse in the world of the movie. Doctor Strange lacks such scenes. It always feels like the director introduces us to a new important about the plot element and then moves on quickly to the next one, so that Steven Strange transforms from a neurosurgeon to the Mystic arts master of the comics as soon as possible. Personally, I would like ten more minutes dedicated to the introduction of the mystic arts world. In my opinion, it would make certain characters more likable and the whole theory about mystic arts more believable.<br/><br/>However, Doctor Strange is still a fun movie with lots of incredible reality bending sequences, an interesting main character, humor and a clever ending.

","I was so lucky to have seen Benedict Cumberbatch twice in one week, once as Hamlet (which I also saw in London) and then yesterday as Dr. Strange. One word for the man: Magnificent.<br/><br/>This time he's Dr. Stephen Strange, a brilliant neurosurgeon (with an excellent American accent) who loses the use of his hands in a dreadful car accident. He is advised to go to a place in India to be healed, since modern medicine can do nothing. There he meets the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) who introduces him to the magical arts and tells him that he can heal himself. <br/><br/>Strange learns that the temple is a secret group out to save the world from the dark forces, led by Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen). He has stolen a page from an ancient, secret book and taken off with three zealots. There is fear he will take over the world with the help of Dormammu.<br/><br/>The highlight of this film, besides Cumberbatch, is the incredible special effects that are eye-popping. The film goes by very quickly. The cast is top notch, with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, and Rachel Adams along with those mentioned above. <br/><br/>One word of caution - in order to see the whole film, you need to stay through the entire credits to the end, as there is a scene during the credits, and then at the end of the credits, there is another scene. This one is critical and sets up the next installment.<br/><br/>British actors come over here to make money, and I can't criticize Cumberbatch for taking on this franchise. Is it the way I would have gone with his career? No. I would have preferred him to go the Eddie Redmayne or Sir Anthony Hopkins route, and I frankly don't understand some of his film choices. I suppose they were all part of a build-up, but why appear in Black Mass in a supporting role and Zoolander 2?<br/><br/>His television work has been exemplary and more along classical lines; he has formed a production company, so let's hope the material matches the abilities of this man's talent.<br/><br/>Anyway, see Dr. Strange. It's fun, amazing to look at, and has excellent acting. It's more than I can say about the endless previews we sat through."
"Chiller7","7","2","6","14 November 2016"," Spectacular effects, bland plot, recycled Marvel formula
","My background knowledge going in: I was first introduced to Doctor Strange in the 90s Spider-Man cartoon. Mary Jane joined a cult, so Spiderman had to get assistance from Doctor Strange in order to save her. Those were some of my favorite episodes. Good stuff. I've also seen Marvel's 2007 animated Doctor Strange movie, which was very good.<br/><br/>The good: This movie's visual effects are amazing. Warping space, time, and reality has never looked so trippy. Watch it in 3D - it's worth the ticket price.<br/><br/>The bad: This movie sticks so close to Marvel's tired formula that it also suffers from the same shortcomings as Marvel's other movies (bland villains, jokes per minute that often feel forced, unnecessary girlfriend character, world-ending plot that somehow never feels like much of a threat, underwhelming climax) and ultimately unfortunately feels kinda bland. I hate to admit this as a fan of the Marvel movies, but this felt overly predictable and full of recycled elements in a few too many ways.<br/><br/>Characters: Isn't Doctor Strange himself essentially the same character as Tony Stark/Iron Man? From his personality (talented but arrogant), to his backstory (rich showoff whose injury leads to humility), to his penchant for making sarcastic jokes and pop culture references, they're almost the same guy.<br/><br/>The villain and world-ending plot of this movie, you've seen already in numerous other Marvel movies. How's the underdeveloped bad guy and his world-ending plot of this movie different from the bland bad guys and world-ending plots of Thor the Dark World, or Guardians of the Galaxy, or so on?<br/><br/>Dr Strange himself feels like the only character with a fully fleshed out personality in the movie. No one else seems to have enough of a personality to be understandable. The villains, in particular, had no personality whatsoever. And Dr. Strange's allies were a bit too baffling to make much sense. I understand they're supposed to be mysterious people, but as soon as we learn a little bit about them, the movie moves on, so we never quite get to know them or their motivations. This becomes a problem when they start to play bigger roles in the main plot, even though we still don't really know them and who they are as characters. And the romantic interest was weak. She was oddly played for laughs more than as a serious part of the movie. The joke was she's unusually underwhelmed and unimpressed by all the magic. It's amusing, but if the movie won't even take her seriously, it's hard to seriously believe that these two are in love at all.<br/><br/>Music: Michael Giacchino is usually a talented composer, but I have to call him out here; he may be getting a little lazy. His theme for Doctor Strange sounds way too much like he simply copied and only slightly modified his own Star Trek theme. They sound very similar. Who let him get away with this?<br/><br/>Inconsistencies: Lots of apparent inconsistencies with the rest of the Marvel movies here. Maybe the Marvel Cinematic Universe is getting too big for its own writers to keep up. The timeline of events in this movie don't quite match up with the other movies, notably the Doctor Strange reference in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), which was an exciting easter egg back when we first saw it, but now makes little sense.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: This is a movie that's generally fun, enjoyable, effects-filled, and action-packed, but it's a movie that plays it very safe and ends up rather formulaic, instead of daring to do much of anything to surprise you. Marvel has a formula that works for them and the success of their movies can't be denied, so you might ask why fix what's broken? But this is the 14th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie so far, and the old Marvel formula's getting a little repetitive. I'd like to see them take bolder risks and go in more unexpected directions than what we got here."

The acting is high quality, especially Tilda Swinton, and it's a departure from the standard shoot 'em up entertainment of the Avengers and other Marvel films. That said, it's a vacuous, trite, self- important piece, much like the character of Dr. Strange himself. <br/><br/>It's not overly sentimental; I will give it that. But its fantastical plot leaves the audience cold. If I had seen this film ten years ago, it would have been fabulous. Today, it bores me with its mysticism. And despite the attempt by the writers to get us to buy into the world through the character of ""The Ancient One,"" I'm not buying. <br/><br/>Mads Mikkelsen is great as the villain Kaecilius, but still, I don't care. There are no fast and easy romances in the film, and that's another plus. However, I found no love for any of the characters. Cumberbatch embodies the character of Dr. Strange well, even his smarminess, which is annoying at times. And he looks just like what I imagine Dr. Strange would. His ""cape of levitation"" skirts the edge of being a mascot akin to R2D2. I think they held back on the cuteness, and that was a good choice. <br/><br/>However, Wong, played by Benedict Wong, is too much of a stereotype of the stoic Asian man. That WAS annoying. Chiwetel Ejiofor was excellent as Mordo, even with some of the understandably silly mystic lines. Swinton's ability to make the mystic talk credible was worth the price of entry. <br/><br/>In all, it's a decent origin story with a haphazard structure and chaotic action scenes. Rating: Matinée<br/><br/>The film looks great and has great acting. The mysticism and actual story were a great excuse for entertaining action. However, for all the talk of 'spirit' in the film, the movie contains little. <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"

That's a good thing, but it also made as little sense. Who cares though as this film is pure fantasy and it's SO packed with effects you won't care about its flaws; like why are they bending cities around to almost no effect. You can bend a city but you can't trap anyone? Are you doing all this just to show off what you can do?

The imagery works for the film blending ancient magic and current times, but it's not Cumberbatch's best role and there are a lot of standardised movie comedy lines given to him which disrespect his great acting ability. Well placed being released before bonfire night here in the UK as a lot of sparkler sort of effects and such.<br/><br/>So should you see this movie? Of course, it's Doctor Strange! Will you love it?

","Dr. Strange (RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: Stunning visuals elevate a good film to an excellent one.   GRADE: B+  SYNOPSIS: After a serious accident, an arrogant surgeon discovers a  much greater power on his road to recovery.  JIM'S REVIEW: Trippy! Far-out! Rad! Cool, dude! These dated expressions  of awe serve a purpose in describing the latest heady concoction known  from the Marvel factory, Dr. Strange.  Fate creates the man...the man being Dr. Stephen Strange (played to the  hilt by Benjamin Cumberbatch). Strange is an egotistical gifted surgeon  who befalls a serious car accident and seeks help on a more mystical  bent. Traveling to Nepal he meets Mordo, a trusty guide on his road to  find out. (Chiwetel Ejiofor, another talented actor who deserves a more  challenging role but still offers much class to his role.) Our hero  eventually connects with The Ancient One (a racially miscast but quite  enjoyable Tilda Swinton) for enlightenment of the mystic kind. This  oracle shows him the ins and outs of magic and healing while imparting  him superpowers and mind-game control (plus a nifty Cloak of  Levitation) to fight evil forces (with the help of terrific  state-of-the-art CGI).  Our superhero's journey to self-discovery takes over the majority of  the screen time before he does fly into kung-fu combat, as most Marvel  heroes do, following the formula of most action fantasies. His nemesis  is a worthy villain, Kaecilius (nicely played by Mads Mikkelsen), a  convert of The Ancient One who has conveniently gone off to the dark  side. The screenplay by C. Robert Cargill, Jon Spaihts, and the  director tries to keep predictability at a minimum and doesn't always  succeed, but he does develop his characters well with enough depth  without sacrificing the adrenaline rush that we has been accustomed to  expect from this genre.  While the film is continually creative and imaginative, it lacks some  originality in its story and visuals, owing other sci-fi predecessors,  specifically The Matrix Trilogy and Inception, big time, but director  Scott Derrickson masters his film's visuals astutely. There is much  eye-candy to behold and the action is non-stop thrilling. Probably no  more spectacular than a memorable soon-to-be-classic set piece  involving mirror images and buildings that effortlessly folding under  each other. This phantasmagorical origami lesson is a kaleidoscopic  marvel of CGI inventiveness. (M.C. Escher would be proud of this visual  op art of suspended architecture and other worldly structures on the  move. Even Hieronymus Bosch would smile wryly at the surrealism hinted  at elsewhere on display. The look of the film is truly a thing of  beauty. (See this movie in the IMAX 3-D format, if possible, for total  immersion.)  Benedict Wong and Rachel MacAdams offer fine support in minor roles.  But it is the strong production values that had this moviegoer  transfixed throughout this blockbuster pop entertainment spectacle. The  film is a remarkable technological achievement, a instant classic and  one of the best comic book superhero films ever. It wisely allows  strong character development, a clever narrative, and stunning action  sequences to merge effortlessly.  Marvel Studio's Dr. Strange does live up to its moniker. It is just  that...strangely hypnotic and a visceral marvel. Go see it."
"DannyDnB","5","2","6","8 November 2016"," Average Marvel film.
","The latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe aims to introduce a new character into the mix of thunder gods and talking raccoon's. Doctor Strange is the MCUs first extra-dimensional sorcerer, and, portrayed by the great Benedict Cumberbatch, this character really is brought to us in an engaging way.<br/><br/>The film is in the same vein as the other films of this universe. It has the same color palette, and this was great to see. I really like the way it felt like a Marvel film, it made the experience relatable, and helped to keep me engaged throughout the film. <br/><br/>However, while I do look at this as a good thing, I feel like the film sort of plays safe the entire time. It is a very generic superhero origin story, and at the very core of the piece, it plays out in a very old-fashioned way. <br/><br/>The story tries to explore dimensions which are not of our own, and it does so in a way that makes this concept the center of the entire production. The only problem is, it's still just a Marvel movie, and, operating within the Marvel framework, it is very difficult to see it as anything more than a fun blockbuster.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that this is necessarily a bad thing, but I do feel like I was not as blown as I thought I'd be after seeing the trailers released a few months ago. Behind the otherworldly aspects, this is a story no different from any other superhero origin story I've seen. It's all the same thing. A man living a fairly normal life undergoes a certain experience which leads to them discovering that they have changed in some sort of way. Slowly they learn that they have abilities that aren't normal, and over time they learn to use the abilities to defeat a villain. It's all very cliché.<br/><br/>On a positive note, this film is visually dazzling and I would recommend it mainly for this reason. Even if the story is cliché, it is still beautiful to watch. The actors all gave great performances and I do think that there are some really cool lines to be heard in the movie.<br/><br/>It is definitely not a bad film, but it really didn't blow me away like I thought it would."

","Great beginning and the best LSD Trip on Screen so far, but potential wasted from the middle on.<br/><br/>In the beginning the movie is quite spiritual and has some wisdom. The wisdom is deeper, than in usual movies of that genre, but still far away from deep. For example :""..we can not lose our demons but only live above them..."" This statement is deeper than the usual black and white philosophy of movies like star-wars etc., but still not really paradox as our quantum universe seems to be. Living above our demons, means no transformation, but only constant control. In order to master our demons, we have to actually stop fighting them and make peace with all our darkness. (see Erich Fromm /C.J.Jung) This realization is maybe the greatest Challenge to movies, books etc., because what can we write about, if the good is also bad and bad is also good? <br/><br/>The movie first states that humans have a spiritual power, but quickly subjectifies it into smth which is material and not paradox at all. Spirituality becomes just another world to master and conquer. Surrender becomes a control of the ego, rather than an openness to something greater, than the material world. It acutely becomes all about magics, a movie for children. No mysticism like in matrix, (Neo realized the brightest light in the darkness of the machines, when he lost his eyes). More and more the special effects in the movie take away the viewers ability to imagine and go deeper into the subject and so the mystery and mystic feeling changes to a decent visual experience. In the beginning it was absolutely great, because the effects was driven by mysticism and a spiritual wisdom, which watered down towards the end."

","Love Mads Mikkelson and Benedict Cumberbatch. Benedict makes a great Dr Strange. The interaction of these two characters and Dr Strange's good sense of humour is what scored most of the points.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie and story itself were lackluster. The visuals were Inception copies. But the manipulation of buildings and roads is only magical when used sparingly and in the right setting. In this case the Inception-like visuals were relied on too much and the action and story were secondary.<br/><br/>At one stage I thought they have remade Casper. I was a bit put off by this to be honest.<br/><br/>The Marvel movies follow a formulaic approach to story writing that is cumbersome unless you're a 10-year old.

"ctowyi","7","2","6","1 November 2016"," Doctor Strange made superhero movies fun again
","I read a lot of Marvel comics and possess good to excellent knowledge in all the characters in the MCU except two - Howard the Duck and Doctor Strange. The former is self-explanatory, the latter I know uses mystic powers to fight villains. That doesn't interest me. Magic, IMHO, is a cheat code and with that the dude can conjure anything out of his imagination to win any bout. Boooooooooring. However, great word of mouth brought me to the cinema and I must say this is the best Marvel movie I have seen this year. <br/><br/>From an archetypal megalomaniac for a villain to a flawed hero to a Defcon One destruction-of-yet-another-city climax (poor New York City again?!), superhero movies adhere to an overused template. Doctor Strange doesn't do it differently in a broader sense but it made the journey through the tropes suddenly feel refreshing, and that is one mark of an excellent film. The visual and sonic effects are absolutely marvellous. The opening action sequence which featured a kaleidoscope of turning and tilting buildings is simply jaw-dropping. The world building is so interesting and exhilarating. In a lesser film, the lengthy exposition would have kill it beyond the point of resurrection, but here it feels so rollickingly fun. I didn't even need to park my head outside the door, I willingly put it in my lap and devoured all the excesses like a sponge. <br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch (I read in a friend's FB post that a couple of girls called him Benson Cucumber :)) anchors the movie superbly and it is difficult to see another actor in the role of Stephen Strange, an egotistical narcissist turned superhero. But it is especially hard to despise him even when he is at his most selfish. Cumberbatch is heroic in the way he allows his character to joyfully take over any situation and call out anyone who doesn't serve his purpose. When he fights, it is not with the zeal of a focused Avenger who is hellbent on saving the world. It is with the constant one-upmanships of a cunning jokester. He doesn't plummet the villain till he is a pulp, he makes the baddie give up wanting to fight him. <br/><br/>My wifey never likes movies with high concepts like time travel and time paradoxes, but surprisingly she never complained about this one bit. It totally succeeded in making the big concepts bite-sized and they served the story well. That is another mark of a good film. The movie also never takes itself seriously and pokes fun at the ridiculousness of it all. We live it cathartically through Strange as he constantly wants to sieve through the bullshite to find the scientific explanation behind it. Other than Cumberbatch, all the supporting roles came out aces. Yes, some of them do feel under-developed but the film got the measure between fun and pathos just right. <br/><br/>This is one Marvel-ous movie and just like that, it made superhero movies fun again."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","6","31 October 2016"," Marvel succeeds again
","It's strange but Marvel Comics seems to be able to provide an endless run of new characters for movie outings and a succession of successful screen adaptations, while DC Comics struggles to move beyond Superman and Batman and does not always score highly with its cinematic adventures. <br/><br/>The latest Marvel character to hit the big screen is the lesser-known American Doctor Stephen Strange, played with aplomb by British actor Bendict Cumberbatch, and we are presented with an origin story that explains who he was before he became a super- hero and how he acquired his extraordinary powers. It's clear that Strange will be back on our screens because we have two extra clips, one early on in the credits and another at the very, very end of the credits.<br/><br/>The story-line is pure hokum with characters like The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton at her androgynous best) and an evil one called Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen as a baddie yet again) and much talk of The Astral Dimension, The Dark Dimension and The Mirror Dimension plus copious references to energy. As The Ancient One explains: ""Through the mystic arts, we harness energy and shape reality"". Yeh, right ...<br/><br/>Yet the whole thing zips along with great gusto and is leavened with some humour both visual (such as a Cloak of Levitation with a mind of its own) and verbal (such as a reference to a WiFi password). Above all, it looks wonderful with shape-shifting buildings and cities that put the beginning of ""Inception"" in the shade and frequent rides into the edges of our universe and apparently the centres of other universes. The special effects are impressive and, if you like 3D (I don't), you will probably want to take your glasses along."

","""DR Strange"" is the one of the most powerful character in MRVEL Comics. The master of magic's who save the world from the accidents, enemy of the multiverse as per comics. Who can control one of the most precious infinity stone i.e. Time Stone. For these reason he became more powerful super hero.
We all know that marvel comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe is occupy a large number of fanbase. Doctor Strange is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 14th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . The film was directed by Scott Derrickson from a screenplay he wrote with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as surgeon Stephen Strange along with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Benjamin Bratt, Scott Adkins, Mads Mikkelsen, and Tilda Swinton. In the film, Strange learns the mystic arts after a career-ending car crash.
If we see the plot of movie , In New York City, Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant
Neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car crash, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who Mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange,
Revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. The actual movie starts from here; in between this plot we all notice that Dr strange is the owner of a well sharp mind. So he quickly learns the mystic arts. As we concentrate in the dialog of the movie each and every dialogs are very powerful and meaningful also. The ancient one's dialog on the Dr strange give up the ego and saw the entire world how world is actual in nature. One of the best dialog in movie in my view is- ""who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange?"" by the ancient one. And another most precious dialog is ""We never lose our demons, Mordo we only learn to live above them."" To Mordo who is master of mystic art and martial art also and trained it to Dr strange.
In graphics quality and screenplay and CGI effect is top class. And movie is ending by MCU in it's own style. We get two mid credits scenes where, Strange decides to help Thor, who has brought his brother Loki to Earth to search for their father, Odin.In a post credits scene, Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses to walk, telling him that Earth has ""too many sorcerers"".
To get rate on movie I gave 10 on 10 as a marvel fan and also for this beautiful movie. I recoment you to see this beautiful movies. I told that you my fall in love with marvel comics and MCU movie creating style. And the last word from me ""iss aanaat bhramvand me tum kon ho review parne wale?"". HE HE. Just watch the movie."

"fernandoschiavi","8","1","2","8 March 2020"," The film brings elements that significantly expand the Marvel universe: magic, mystical objects or even upside-down action scenes in impossible scenarios
","After some continuations of the universe, Marvel presents another of its main characters, making room this time for the exploration of the mystical world. Created by designer Steve Ditko and screenwriter Stan Lee, the character first appeared in Strange Tales # 110 (July 1963). Just like in the comics, in this movie adaptation, Stephen is described as a brilliant and selfish surgeon. After a car accident that severely damages his hands and hinders his ability to perform surgery, he travels the world until he reaches a place found between the mountains of Nepal, the Kamar-Taj, where he meets the Elder. After becoming one of the former students of the Supreme Wizard, he begins training in both the mystical and martial arts to become the Supreme Wizard of the Earth.<br/><br/>Directed by Scott Derrickson, known for directing horror films, such as ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005)"", The Entity (2012) ""and Deliver Us from Evil (2014)"", Marvel takes a risk by addressing a different theme and give a darker tone to your universe, with magicians, sorcerers, manipulation of matter, and mental powers like telepathy, telekinesis. And the director knows very well how to create a more serious atmosphere, of characters tormented by mortality.<br/><br/>Starring Benedict Cumberbatch in the main role, the actor knows exactly how to show his main characteristics in a masterful way, especially in the first act of the feature, before he was introduced to the mystical world. The entire transformation of Stephen is shown in an interesting way, which begins the projection by emphasizing his narcissistic and arrogant side and at the same time his genius in the profession. Shortly after the car accident and all failed recovery attempts, upon hearing a tip from an acquaintance he considered intractable in the past and who healed in Kamar-Taj, he begins his journey of transformation. What appeared to be the end was just the beginning. From then on, the film follows a standard formula and has already been repeated several times: the student, the master, the villain who turned against the master, the phase of self-discovery, training and the climax of the story. Even though it is repetitive, as it is a history of origin, the formula is understandable.<br/><br/>A skeptic who believes only in science, when he arrives on the scene imagining himself to be an unattended medical board, Stephen soon discovers that it is about something else, ""reorienting the spirit"" to better heal the body, mysteries that exist outside the senses, worlds without end, some benevolent to life and others dark, where powers older than time lurk thirsty and anxious. Dr. Strenge goes on to try to find out who he is in this multiverse. The training he goes through is thought provoking to the public, in which he will have to silence his ego for his power to emerge. These are sequences that, in addition to showing the training, present more about the past of the villain Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), about relics such as the Rod of the Living Court, the Access Rings to other worlds, the Mirrored Dimension, the Eye of Agamotto, the Mantle from Levitation, the Black Dimension where Dormammu lives - the destroyer of worlds, the Sanctums of power created by Agamotto that protect the world and the magicians that protect the Sanctums from beings from another dimension that protect our universe.<br/><br/>From there the plot takes us to the attempts to destroy the Sanctums and the entrance of Black Magic, travels between worlds, epic confrontations in scenarios thought to the millimeter. The visual effects of the feature are exquisite, helping a lot to present this world of magic. There are many scenes made entirely in computer graphics and that do not let us notice any artificiality at any time. The scenes are psychedelic, frantic and impressively ingenious. The dynamics of all the action through the exchange of dimensions through the portals is done with extreme originality. No wonder, it is one of the favorite productions to give an Oscar to Marvel in this category. Ben Davis' photography mixes daytime and nighttime scenes exploring and offering different possibilities to the direction. A curiosity is that the scenes that take place in the streets of London are very reminiscent of the photograph used in another film that involves magic, in the case ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"". Michael Giacchino's soundtrack also sets the story in a slightly darker and more mysterious mood.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, we can highlight the always beautiful Rachel McAdams. More than a doctor's romantic interest, Christine Palmer is one of the doctor's connections with the material dimension and is one of the few people who sees Strange apart from his so inflated persona of the ""legendary surgeon"", and this is well explored in several scenes that help to humanize the doctor. Tilda Swinton, playing the Elder, also does very well as the master of our doctor, being a key player in the plot. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Mordo) as one of the grandmaster's students and Benedict Wong (Wong) as the comic relief for the production's rarest scenes of humor. The film's weak point is the villain Kaecilius, who does not prove to be a real threat. It is more a puppet than an antagonist. We don't feel a real threat when we see it, and that adds some of the strength of the final stretch of production, which is resolved in a simpler way. A waste of the excellent Mads Mikkelsen.<br/><br/>Scott Derrickson knew how to command a story with many interesting elements that significantly expand the Marvel universe. It's all very well balanced: magic, mystical objects or even upside-down action scenes in impossible scenarios, within the context of the film and of parallel dimensions, seem even more natural than a Captain frozen for 70 years defeating villains with a Vibranium shield . The story focuses on the presentation of Dr. Strange's universe and only briefly quotes The Avengers. A more direct link to the Marvel universe can be seen in a post-credit scene. Some tips are loose for future sequels and just imagining what this world of wizards / wizards has to offer in future films, the expectation only grows."

Ancient one is a interesting character.
I though she would be that flawless person that dies near the end of the movie but they showed that she has flaws and that nobody is perfect which is a great addition which strengthens the movie.

","I must confess that superhero films do not have me jumping up and down with excitement as they appear to be aimed at twelve-year-olds and those who need to see non-stop explosions and destruction to hold their attention. The first Batman with Nicholson was entertaining and funny, even the original Superman films had reasonable plots and enterainment value but Marvel and DC took the whole genre in a new direction As time has gone by, each successive superhero film reduces the human element while increasing the special effects and CGI. Doctor Strange has taken all this to a new level - I doubt if more than five minutes were filmed without using blue screens. It's sad to see the film industry deteriorate to the level where garbage like this draws huge box-office, encouraging more of the same trash to be produced. Hollywood's obsession with PC plotting and characters has lowered standards even further. The few intelligent films being produced for audiences prepared to follow a character-driven plot struggle to make a profit so we appear to be stuck with superheroes for the foreseeable future."

","As far as the extended Marvel universe goes, there are a handful of entries that seem like they were hastily whipped together for the sake of introducing a character so that he or she can be included in an 'Avengers.' This is the case with 'Doctor Strange,' as not even an American-sounding Benedict Cumberbatch can save the film from mediocrity.<br/><br/>To be fair, at least 'Strange' is unique, and not a fourth 'Iron Man' or a third 'Spider-man' reboot. Director Scott Derrickson deserves credit for steering this behemoth, as it boasts some pretty amazing visuals and pretty cool settings (Nepal, anyone?). Sure, there's some 'Inception'-like building shapeshifting going on, but it still has a nice look. But when it comes to the content of the story, it's pretty basic (a cocky doctor suffers a setback in his life that he must overcome).<br/><br/>As for Cumberbatch, while a great actor, he doesn't feel authentic as a Marvel superhero. The humor injected into the dialogue feels unnatural, as if he is being forced to become Tony Stark. Similarly, Rachel McAdams is usually a great actress but her role as Dr. Christine Palmer is just not a good fit. As for the rest of the cast, a bald Tilda Swinton is hands down the best part of 'Strange' as the mysterious ""Ancient One,"" while Chiwetel Ejiofor and Benedict Wong make for good sidekicks.<br/><br/>While not the worst of the bunch, 'Doctor Strange' could have been much better had a few adjustments been made to the story and cast."

Trained by a sorcerer known as The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), Strange learns powerful magical spells that come in handy when he and his new friends are attacked by Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), who is trying to help a dark being from another reality take over Earth.<br/><br/>While the script might be lacking somewhat in originality and clarity, every last cent of the budget is up there on the screen, director Scott Derrickson delivering mind-bending special effects sequences that really grab one's attention, from the opening fight in London in which buildings fold and distort, to the spectacular car crash that claims Strange's dexterity, to the astounding finale in which our heroes battle the bad guys while time runs backwards (words can't do this incredible technical feat justice: it needs to be seen to be believed).<br/><br/>While not the greatest film in the MCU, Doctor Strange is a worthy enough entry that provides enough eye-candy for the duration.

","So Marvel told the basic origin story of Doctor Strange (Earth's supposed Sorcerer Supreme). But, didn't it feel a bit undeserved? Like really, what did Dr. Strange have to suffer through in order to become the master of mysticism? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! However, Marvel does have a chance to rectify this situation and make this character one of their better franchise movies by simply following up the first movie and making the classic magnum opus Triumph and Torment. If they made this as their second movie, not only would it flesh out Dr. Strange more by showing that he actually deserved the title, but it would also introduce Marvel to the something that it has sorely lacked throughout ALL it's movies; a complex villain more worthy than all of its heroes put together: Dr. Doom. After butchering nearly all of the Thor movies and killing off Odin like some B-rate character, the fans deserve this movie! Stop being lazy Marvel and finally do your films some justice!"
"Enchorde","8","1","2","12 May 2018"," Prepare for Strange..
","You should really be prepared for the kind of movie this is, because this is a movie that you will probably love or hate. Luckily, the first scene presents what kind of movie it is. You will get an action movie, with spectacular graphics and effects, but also with an mind warping edge that might go some steps too far in warping reality. Especially some of the battles contain so much altering realities, changing directions and effects that it is hard to take it all in and follow the action. But it is also beautifully done, and if you enjoy these kind of effects, you will have a blast through out the movie.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor Strange. An egomaniac jerk that following an accident learns that there is more to the universe than most of us knows. Cumberbatch is a quality actor, and he got good help in Ejiofor, Swinton, Madsen and McAdams (which has a too small role for her talents). All do well, but this is not a character driven movie, so they don't get many opportunities too shine. But it is also a feat too pull of an action hero, and they do well all of them. But fans of Cumberbatch from his previous work might be disappointed. He is not the real star in the movie. The effects are, along with the universe that the movie presents.<br/><br/>I do enjoy those kind of movies. When I watched it I thought of both Matrix and Inception... there are more than a few similarities. I enjoy the Marvel universe that connects to a bigger whole. This was another piece to that puzzle, and it fits well.<br/><br/>And, as in most Marvel movies, don't miss the crazy credits (the extra scenes - yes there are more than one) in the credits after the movie.<br/><br/>8/10"
"southdavid","6","1","2","19 April 2018"," Stranger Things
","I rewatched ""Doctor Strange"" in preparation for his role in ""Avengers: Infinity War"". To be honest, I'd been putting off watching it again, as I felt going in it was my least favourite film of the MCU - this second viewing confirmed that, but did remind me that it has lots of great moments. <br/><br/>Renowned Surgeon Stephen Strange loses the fine motor skills in his hands following a serious car accident. With all traditional medical options exhausted, he heads to Tibet following rumours of a break through cure. There he meets The Ancient One who introduced Strange to the mystical arts and the ability to tap into powers from another realm. But this power can be corrupting, and one of the Ancient One's former pupils, Kaecilius, returns with a plan to release Dormamu and ancient and powerful evil. <br/><br/>So, what are my problems with this film? They are mostly in the first half of the film, and mostly around Benedict Cumberbatch. Shackled to an accent he never quite masters, the first glimpses of a successful Stephen Strange aren't enjoyable. His arrogance is understandable, and part of the arc that the character goes on, but the wit is missing. Jokes throughout this film feel forced and fall flat, which is really strange when you consider how successful the 2017 trilogy of ""Guardians 2"", ""Spider-man Homecoming"" and ""Thor: Ragnorok"" would be. Despite the reliable supporting cast, this humour failure extends to them too. <br/><br/>It does look good though, the Inception (let's go with inspired, rather than rip off) folding cities in a mirror universe are really good. In fact all the visual effects are as impressive as they've been since day one. (18 movies without a bad special effect is pretty impressive). The ending is really good though and, without spoilers, it's nice to see one of these films end with the hero coming up with a plan and outwitting the villain rather than simply overpowering him, or a Deus Ex Machina finish. <br/><br/>I like the way they left the character in this film, and the ""Thor Ragnorok"" cameo pushed towards a better written character. I have higher expectations for the good Doctor in Infinity Wars and hopefully beyond."
"Simply-Red","5","1","2","16 April 2018"," Over the top graphics, not in a good way.
","I really liked this as it started. I realized I was getting in to a Marvel movie and I expected as such. It's a fantasy superhero flick.<br/><br/>My problem with it was the ridiculous over the top graphics. To me it was like a 16 year old playing around with visuals on a computer. Without getting in to spoilers, I'll just say the graphics, in way too many scenes is far to ""digital"" in appearance...almost cheap computer ""playing around"" and a lot of the graphics made zero sense as to why they were happening, it was there just to be over the top...we used to see visuals like this, many, many decades ago with a kaleidoscope...using no electricity. Maybe thats why I wasn't impressed.<br/><br/>I was excited to see this after the good IMDB reviews, but I'm learning, reviews are not exactly tailored to each person. Almost everyone has a different take on things, like belly buttons, opinions are something everyone has, and they tend to be a little different for each person. But, here's my review for whoever it may help.<br/><br/>If you dont mind graphics just for the sake of over the top graphics, you might like this movie. For me it all took away from what looked to be a fairly good story, then cheapened by excessive computer graphics."
"andrewroy-04316","3","1","2","25 March 2018"," Bizarre and poorly executed plot and world construction doom Doctor Strange
","While there were many moments that were enjoyable to watch, frequently I was left scratching my head over how the many mystical items function, or the progression of the plot and characters. The conflict was extremely poorly developed and we never get anything more than token ""come to the dark side, it sounds super enticing and we all exude very evil vibes"" from either of the bad guys. The way the magic and world functions was not well explained, and it felt like many magical things were thrown in as deus ex machina and not explained at all, such as relics or the mirror dimension. Even the Time Stone, which is the crucial premise of the climax and the most important element to the MCU, was not clearly explained either. Time and control were attempted to be considered as themes, with some success, but no real resounding or thought-provoking messages. The visual effects were quite good, but it felt almost comical in its wild effects with a lack of explanation or plot behind the things that are happening. The ending and acting were fine, but overall was unimpressed."
"hugh-deasy","10","1","2","10 January 2018"," Fairly true to the original
","I used to read Dr. Strange comics as a teenager and always found it the most imaginative of the Marvel universe. The movie capture much of the magic of the magic. Benedict Cumberbatch is great in the title role and Tilda Swinton shines as the ancient one. More convincing than an ancient old man with a beard - though that might have been good also. Chiwetel Ejiofor was good as Mordo - going through the degeneration from loyal hack of the ancient one to doubting Thomas in a believable way. Mads Mikkelsen was suitably threatening and believable as the arch zealot Kaecilius and was a worthy foil to the growing power of Strange. 
 <br/><br/>The special effects are wonderful - the dizzying mirror dimension scenes as well as the encounter with the Dread Dormammu (did they use 'Dread' in the film - maybe not). The pace is good and there is indeed a reasonable character development in Strange from the egotistical materialist to the less arrogant contemplative of the mystic arts. The film captures well the multi-dimensional world of Strange and evokes the threat from extra-dimensional beings in a way that's commensurate with the sense of awe in the original comic rendition. The film never degenerates into an overly fantastic atmosphere, with scenes in the hospital and city streets anchoring the fantastic in the real. The costumes are just right and true to the comic vision. I was glad to see that this film was added to the cinematic Marvel universe. Scott Derrickson directed the whirlpool of action well and gave it the right balance of real and fantastic. Strange's pilgrimage to Katmandu was reminiscent of Bruce Wayne's to Asia to find himself with a guru. <br/><br/>Anyway - all in all a fine film and afterwards I felt I could open a portal into another dimension."
"bkoganbing","6","1","2","13 August 2017"," The Doctor Is In
","One of Marvel Comics great superheroes finally gets his turn at screen immortality. Doctor Strange who has a manner similar to the TV doctor named House is a rather self satisfied and smug individual. He's a genius and he makes sure everyone knows it. But one night he's involved in a serious automobile crash and his physical body fails to heal entirely. He's left with a palsy that makes being a surgeon out of the question unless you mean tree surgery.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor John Strange and like Tyrone Power in The Razor's Edge he goes to the mystic east to find healing with the Ancient One, a gender bending guru played by Tilda Swinton. He learns a lot about the metaphysical nature of the earth and how worlds co- exist in the same space and how some chosen few like he's been chosen are guarding the portals between those worlds. When those worlds are open it can get real messy.<br/><br/>There are times where the plot gets a bit vague and I guess you have to have been a Marvel Comics fanatic in order to get a lot of the subtleties in the story. Something I do not claim to be.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange did get an Oscar nomination for Visual Effects and we'll no doubt see a sequel if the demand is there and the money is right."
"jimbo-53-186511","5","1","2","10 August 2017"," A reasonably interesting story, but it never quite manages to fully get into its stride
","Brilliant neurosurgeon Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) finds his whole world turned upside down after he is involved in a serious car accident whilst he is on his way to give a speech. Strange survives the crash, but ends up with severe nerve damage in both his hands which forces him to quit his job. Things are looking bleak for Strange, but when he hears about a man who made a full recovery from life-changing conditions at the hands of the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) Strange heads to Nepal hoping that she will be able to do the same for him, but nothing could prepare Strange for what he was about to witness or what he was about to become....<br/><br/>The first thing that needs to be acknowledged here are the special effects which are terrific and are some of the best special effects that I've seen. Whilst the effects are great I did start to form the impression that they were more important to the director than the actual story and it starts to get to a point when the special effects engulf the story and, at times, it just becomes a bit too much.<br/><br/>The story itself is quite interesting in its early stages where Strange seeks out the Ancient One in the hope that he can be healed and returned to his normal life. I also found the training aspect to be interesting as well - particularly with Strange's struggle to create gateways. However, in the second half it becomes much less interesting as we see Strange battling against former Master Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen). Perhaps part of the problem lies with the fact that I didn't really care much for the characters and was never really interested in their own personal struggles. A lot of the characters here aren't well developed and their motivations also seem rather weak. All of the inter-dimensional warring and protection of Sanctum's aspect of the narrative is glossed over resulting in a rushed and rather anti-climactic final act.<br/><br/>On balance, Doctor Strange is a reasonable film with a mildly interesting story, but despite appearing to be an intelligent film it lacks depth and isn't a particularly exciting film to watch. I also couldn't help but sake the notion that it may also be full of its own self-importance."

The character development is just right. It's not too shallow and not too over done which I hate (like c'mon, just get to the chase, no one cares about how or why the character did this or that). I especially loved Doctor Strange's arrogant ego in a way that I could actually feel what he was feeling. I also loved the added clichéd humour.<br/><br/>I don't really know what else to say other than the fact that I liked this movie. This movie is exactly what I expected, and exactly what I wanted. <br/><br/>For the people who are reading this review, you are probably thinking ""ugh, whatever, this guy probably just loves those superficial, clichéd, and heavily CGI'd movies"" and you're right, I like them.

"TxMike","Null","1","2","9 May 2017"," ""I've realized the problem with the world - too many Sorcerers.""
","I watched this alone at home on BluRay from my public library. Superb video and sound, the powered subwoofer was given a good workout.<br/><br/>""Dr Strange"" is a character created by Marvel, first appearing in comics in 1963. Doctor Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats.<br/><br/>This 2016 movie serves as the origin story, a brilliant but egotistical surgeon has a car accident which severely damages his hands and hinders his ability to perform surgery. He searches the globe for a way to repair them and in Kathmandu encounters the Ancient One. After becoming one of the old Sorcerer Supreme's students, he becomes a practitioner of both the mystical arts as well as martial arts. Along with knowing many powerful spells, he has a costume with two mystical objects—the Cloak of Levitation and Eye of Agamotto—which give him added powers. Strange is aided along the way by his friend and valet, Wong, and a large assortment of mystical objects.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch is Dr. Stephen Strange and Rachel McAdams is his girlfriend, Dr Christine Palmer. Benedict Wong is Wong and Tilda Swinton is The Ancient One, borrowing from the dark side to live for so long. In this movie Strange's chief adversary is Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius, out to defeat time for the universe.<br/><br/>This is good ""popcorn"" entertainment with well-respected actors. The story itself is rather simple and not very different from many fictional sorcery and magic stories. The movie borrows heavily from such movies as 'Back to the Future' (space-time continuum) and 'The Matrix' (bullet time cinematography and mystical double-speak), 'Inception' (bending roads and buildings), and all those shows which have featured multiverses and alternate universes. <br/><br/>What is great here are all the digital effects and the sound track. Yes, just 'popcorn' entertainment, and Stan Lee makes his usual cameo appearance, sitting in a bus laughing at a comic book. Curiously there are a couple of brief scenes after the credits have been rolling, and one, with Thor, after the credits are finished. I suspect most viewers missed those two."

"fluturoj","5","1","2","16 April 2017"," The worse movie in the series so far because it wants you to believe that magic on earth is the most natural thing and every human being is cable of practising it.
","One major problem with this film: why is your world plausible and what makes Doctor Strange the chosen one. Are you telling me that everyone that walked in that temple could have learned magic like that? Captain America and Hulk are products of science, Iron Man of Money, Thor of his alieness and goddess but what about Doctor Strange? He is suborn, arrogant and ambitious and that's why he is the chosen one? Well so are at least 5 million other people in planet earth. The magic had no back up here, its Earth why should there be magic? Are you expected to be childish and believe it just like that? Nope. <br/><br/>Real-life link: Everyone has a reason for his/her action. Kaecilius believes he is saving the world because he has been lied by his teacher. Of course he is going to question everything she has taught him. Trust was betrayed. A villain with not a villain aim, just a greedy one. <br/><br/>Plausibility: The worse part of this movie. For a movie like this it is crucial that you back up your fantasy world. Why is magic possible on Earth? Every normal human being can practice magic if it enters that temple now and can see the spirit out of body? This is just ridiculous. The worse part was when Strange's spirit talks to Christine like it is the most natural thing ever for humans. Hated that. If that magic was possible because of the infinity stone that would make the movie awesome but no, it just expects us to believe that every human can do magic and magic is the most natural thing on earth. <br/><br/>Villain: Strong. Double Villain. The former student turned bad and the overall villain of all the Marvel Movies. They can't beat either of them and that is what makes them strong. Kaecilius could only be beaten because Dormammu takes him and Dormammu can not be beaten at all, he only accepts a deal that sets him free and that's how the earth is saved. <br/><br/>Storytelling: Strong. Keeps you interested. Starts with the life of Strange, the accident and his pursue to get his old life back. He learning magic seems a bit rushed (he is a natural dah) but the end is unpredictable and surprises you, you don't know how they will safe the earth. A great surprise is to learn that Kaecilius was actually right and the perfect accent one is not so perfect since she draws energy from the dark dimension, the same dimension she fights. <br/><br/>Character development: Strange learns that there are many ways to safe the world. At the end of the day he looses nothing. All the control he had as being the best doctor, that is not multiplied by millions since he is now saving the world. Arrogance still there I'd say. <br/><br/>Acting/Casting: Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent choice. Makes an arrogant character likable. <br/><br/>Overall, the worse Marvel movie so far, not because of its story or characters but because it wants you to believe that magic on earth is the most natural thing and every human being is cable of practising it."
"CinemaCocoa","5","1","2","13 April 2017"," It's fun and entertainment is only skin deep.
","One wonders why Marvel, of all franchises, is in a rush?<br/><br/>Super surgeon Doctor Stephen Strange has his towering ego dashed to the ground when he is in a terrible car accident that ruins both of his hands. Seeking any medical aid to restore his fame and fortune, Strange is directed to the mystical Ancient One, and from there his life is never the same again.<br/><br/>Oh Marvel You really have audiences around your little finger now, don't you? You can make anything and people will come in droves. I am starting to wonder if the Marvel bubble won't so much burst as it will shrivel up in a slow, sad demise, if this latest installment is anything to go by.<br/><br/>I had very high hopes for Doctor Strange. Marvel movies are starting to get formulaic, it is possibly the most famous criticism now, and what could be more of a gear change and shake up than removing all the techno-babble, shrinking suits and super serums and have magic instead. Mystical, spiritual energies, other dimensions; a melting pot of possibilities and quite likely the glue to a much bigger Cinematic Universe that can finally leap from our own world. With a strong actor playing a character who is the antithesis of all those things, how can it go wrong?<br/><br/>They found a way.<br/><br/>Director Scott Derrickson is more synonymous with horror films: The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Sinister and Deliver Us from Evil making for three of the five films he has directed. The film starting off with a near-silent scene in a mystical library, only to have a man beheaded by our film's stock villain Kaecilius (who is sure to join the ranks of forgotten Marvel villains) you might think that this is going to be a Marvel film with a different tone. Progress further still and we have some surprisingly drawn out and sober hospital surgery scenes, the first act climaxing with the doctor's accident.<br/><br/>But then things take a turn for the Thor: Dark World. While Benedict Cumberbatch fits the role, as do the other actors (including Tilda Swinton, her character's Celtic origins literally explained in the script) the script is wooden and utterly forgettable. So much exposition and meaningless explanations was quite possibly the worst angle to approach this new dimension of the MCU. Even the humour seems forced at times.<br/><br/>Surely the action is good? Sometimes. Remember the fight scenes in Batman Begins? The ones that are all elbows and mid-sections, without giving the audience a clue to what is happening? Yeah. Imagine that, only with energy weapons that dazzle lights everywhere. And the action is taking place on a Transformer. A Transformer the size of Manhattan.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the kaleidoscopic warping effects that dazzled in the trailer is great. For the first ten minutes. Inception pulled off rotating corridors and endless stairwells in two ways that Doctor Strange does not: by conserving the 'wow' moments, not splurging them all over the place constantly, and by using practical effects. Am I just getting old, or are people blind to shoddy CGI now? Both this and Civil War have had glaring problems with CGI. What takes me out of an experience? A bendy Benedict Computerbatch bouncing around harmlessly in rotating corridors and over floating platforms that do not exist.<br/><br/>I felt really put out by Doctor Strange. Marvel's track record for ""origin stories"" is really high, but this feels more like the wayward and overconfident sequel. Elements are good, Cumberbatch is good; the first act is solid setup and gives old Sherlock a lot to work with. The costumes and set designs are decent. I can see these elements being used better in future Marvel films. The final reality-bending trick was cool too, despite being desensitized to it all by that point, and the gratefully small amount of tethering to the MCU was welcome too. Some nice little nods (like seeing the Avenger tower in the city skyline) that make it feel connected without needless cameos.<br/><br/>But the pacing is a frightful mess. I didn't feel like the characters went through sensible transitions of development; the plot just took leaps when it needed to and the characters just accept things when they need to.<br/><br/>It's fun and entertainment is only skin deep, and the future quality of Marvel Studios productions can be called into question."
"kirbylee70-599-526179","10","1","2","8 April 2017"," Mystical Marvel
","If you're a fan of the Marvel Universe films that have transpired over the past decade or so then be prepared to go someplace they haven't until now. Most of those films have transpired in our known world, a world of reality. But Marvel Comics fans always knew there was another world to be covered, a world of the supernatural. With the release of DOCTOR STRANGE we are finally given our first taste of that world.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Doctor Stephen Strange, an egotistical surgeon with tremendous skills who waste no time with hopeless cases, instead focusing on only cases that can be put in the plus column. The film opens giving us a glimpse into that personality as well as the only potential love interest he's had in his life, Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams). They may have parted ways but the affection has remained.<br/><br/>After a day at work and on his way to a catered affair Strange runs off the road and crashes his car and his hands in the process. He wakes to find his hands encased in plaster and rods with the outlook for his returning to work as a surgeon highly in doubt. After pursuing several paths to healing he eventually remembers a man who seemed to walk when there was no hope of his ever doing so. This leads him to the Far East and a city known as Kamar-Taj. It is here that Strange is brought in to the mystical world of the supernatural.<br/><br/>Brought into the city by Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), one of the sorcerers who protects the world, Strange is introduced to the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). She shows him that there is more to the world than just the physical by taking him out of his body and into the astral world. When he returns he begs to be taught more.<br/><br/>The film builds on this displaying Strange' training as well as helping the viewer to understand more what this mystical world is all about. Realities are altered, perception is a hindrance and magic is real. Strange is taught not just how to move from one location to another via portal but how to defend himself as well in preparation of protecting himself and the world around him.<br/><br/>A short sequence at the film's opening saw a page from an ancient book stolen by Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), a zealot with a few followers who has left Kamar-Taj with ill intent. Strange is shown that there are 3 locations in the world that connect to protect it from evil, one each in London, New York and Hong Kong. While learning this the London center is destroyed and New York is under attack by Kaecilius and his group. The blast suffered while watching London fall has tossed Strange into the New York center and he battles to protect it, even having an ancient artifact attach to him and become his weapon.<br/><br/>This is merely the first battle between good and evil. More is at stake here, in fact the entire world is at stake as Kaecilius attempts to provide an opening for Dormammu the ruler of the Dark Dimension. Friends and alliances are built, trust is destroyed and more is learned as Strange moves forward. The eventual showdown fills the climax of the film delivering the punch one has come to expect from a Marvel film.<br/><br/>As a fan of comics for some time I've enjoyed every film Marvel has turned loose on the world. They have captured the fun, the excitement and the full color world seen on paper for decades and transferred those to the screen with a love of the source material. Rather than turn their back on the comics these movies came from they embrace them. That is well in evidence here in DOCTOR STRANGE.<br/><br/>If you've read the comics then you know what to expect as Strange moves into the world of the mystical universe. As I watched Strange enter the Dark Dimension I sat mesmerized as the images from those comics were brought to life on screen. Even in past Marvel films nothing has equaled this when it comes to capturing has until now only been seen on those pages. It was amazing to see.<br/><br/>This movie is so well rounded, combining just the right amount of pathos, humor, action, revelation and story that you can't help but be drawn in. Cumberbatch shows that he is not a one note actor sitting back and collecting praise for his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. While he remains loyal to that program he shows here that he can take on more roles and do them well just as he has with several other film projects. As with Hugh Jackman who took on the role of Wolverine one would be hard pressed to consider anyone else in the role of Doctor Strange after watching this film. The entire cast brings their characters to life in the best way possible. For me the sign of great acting is not realizing you're watching actors. All offer that type of performance here.<br/><br/>DOCTOR Strange for me is one of those super hero movies that you can pull off the shelf and watch at any given moment. When it ends you long for the next chapter, the next film in which Strange will appear. Word is he will be involved in the AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR film coming next year. Until then we'll have to spend our time with this film.<br/><br/>An added note. As with most Marvel films don't shut this one off as the credits roll. There are two teasers to be found here, one as they finish."

Based in New York City's Greenwich Village, Doctor Strange must act as an intermediary between the real world and what lies beyond, utilizing a vast array of metaphysical abilities and artifacts to protect the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Leaving his female interest (Rachel McAdams) he encounters a fellow traveler Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Wong (Benedict Wong), the evil Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelson), and the true star of the film The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). The special effects enhance the story as well as any fantasy movie around, but it is the wry sense of humor as well as the intelligence of Benedict Cumberbatch that makes the film a welcome addition to the Marvel Comics spectrum.

","Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) has a big problem with egomania. A top neurosurgeon in NYC, he does work miracles but, his ego is enormous. Needless to say, his attitude prevents others from liking him, including another surgeon, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) who the doctor seems to admire. Yet, pride goes before a fall, as they say. One fateful night, Strange drives too fast in his hot sports car, while talking on the phone, and he crashes. It's horrendous. Yes, he's alive, but his hands are badly damaged and to a surgeon, that's the universe. After extensive physical therapy, his hands remain shaky. Desperate, he learns that a paralyzed man now walks again, after a trip to Nepal. With his finances extremely low, Dr. Stephen nevertheless takes the trip to the faraway land, searching for The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). He almost doesn't make it until he is saved on the street by Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor). What luck! Mordo is also trained in the mystical healing and brings Dr. Strange to his supreme teacher. Strange's ego is still inflated and The Ancient One has to be convinced to offer him hope. After studying chakras, amulets and other long-forgotten abilities, Doctor Strange is reborn. However, not to surgery, as there is a more pressing matter. A former apprentice, Caesillius (Mads Mikkelsen) of the Ancient One is causing tremendous problems on earth. Dr. Strange's first mission may be to try and stop this formidable foe. Can he do it with the help of Mordo, The Ancient One, and another mystic named Wong? First, I do not watch many superhero movies as they are not my preferred view but, finding Cumberbatch a very compelling performer, I chose this one. Mr. Benedict does not disappoint, as he is a very handsome and talented actor. Likewise, the other thespians are first rate, especially Swinton. But, I was hoping to see a movie where a superhero uses his unique powers to rescue average folks and, somewhere along the way, get the girl. This does not happen. In addition, while the special effects may have been better on the big screen, on my paltry 20 inch they were busy, confusing, overworked. In other words, they did not enhance the tale for this viewer. Perhaps there will be sequels, where Doctor Strange has a chance to save the world and romance ladies at the same time. Til then, its a mixed bag of entertainment."

","Dr. Strange is a sorcerer and this is his origin film. There have been enough super hero movies, that we all understand how this works. Someone kind of normal (but who has either extraordinary smarts or nobility) gets gifted (or troubled (the Stan Lee vision)) with extraordinary power and must overcome personal consideration to accept the now famous maxim best articulated by Uncle Ben, ""With great power comes great responsibility"".<br/><br/>Stan Lee was to comic books in the 1960's what Bob Dylan was to music. He churned out an exceptionally wide and diverse set of genre expanding works. I've always found that origin tales, like the first Spiderman, the first Ironman, the first Captain America are can't miss movies because the stories are simple hero stories and Stan Lee and his team created a number of great characters who's stories just convert directly into a movie so well. I have to admit that I don't really know or remember the Dr. Strange origin story, and am not that familiar with the character from the comics to judge how directly this movie correlates to the old comic.<br/><br/>And to me, that gives us the first of a number of problems with this movie. We've seen this before. An arrogant self-absorbed super genius. Basically the Tony Stark of doctors.<br/><br/>The next problem is how rushed everything seems as we run down the super hero to be checklist. 1. Establish a villain with a prologue. 2. Establish the vanity / flaw of our character. 3. He gets taken down by fate. We get about a five minutes for each one. It seems very rushed Then he heads off to solve his problem. He goes from a green recruit, not accepting and humble. boom...they throw him a curve-ball and he overcomes it. boom...next time we look somehow (because of his natural aptitude) he is top of the class. boom....just when he figures he go-ts what he wants...the villain shows up. (This is slight spoiler: Actually as he is saying the words, ""I didn't do this to become part of some cosmic war"". The cosmic war starts.) So, they have compressed the whole narrative into the most linear story they could.<br/><br/>I think that they could have alleviated this by using a flashback. In this case, Dr. Strange could have been battling the villain at the beginning, and then they could have taken us back through the process it took to get him to where he winds up. This especially would have worked since this time, time is an important element in the plot of this movie.<br/><br/>The CGI special effects didn't win me over. First, Dark City and a few other movies have worked this M.C. Escher twisting physical reality concept before, and all though visually stunning, they come across as slightly silly at times. I give them some leeway here, because like I said, I don't know the Dr. Strange backstory well enough to know if these visuals are a sweet spot for fans of the original comic. I assumed they were.<br/><br/>The cast of this movie is absolutely tremendous, and it's unfortunate that none of them get enough screen time or an expanded enough character to really shine. But, these actors are great throughout and they definitely don't hurt the movies credibility.<br/><br/>There are a few small tie-ins at the end to the bigger Marvel Universe and the Infinity Stones and the coming war.<br/><br/>Nothing wrong with this movie except the rushed feeling of the story and the linear cookie cutter steps it takes us down. but...hey, it's about a Mystical Super Hero."

","Plot; When a brilliant but arrogant surgeon is severely injured in a car accident, his quest to be healed leads him to an ancient sorcerer who offers him much more.<br/><br/>Despite a lot of hype to the contrary, Doctor Strange is every inch a standard Marvel film. That's not a knock, just an observation. McDonalds may make more than just hamburgers, but even their chicken sandwiches taste like McDonalds, if you catch my meaning. Here we swap super serums and rocket-powered armor in favor of hocus pocus. There's a patina of difference, but nothing substantive.<br/><br/>With a connect the dots origin story and an extremely weak and undercooked villain, it's up to star Benedict Cumberbatch to carry the load, and thankfully he's up to the task. His Stephen Strange has more in common with Tony Stark than Steve Rogers, and his journey from arrogant, self serving doctor to hero is made believable thanks in large part to Cumberbatch. He's surrounded by a solid supporting cast and some dazzling visuals, but the whole affair reeks of been there, done that."

"sharky_55","5","1","2","3 March 2017"," Stan Lee: That is hilarious!
","Doctor Stephen Strange is by my count now the third rich and arrogant jerk to be run through the Marvel blender and come out the other side a superhero. These stories of redemption are easy suckers because the heroes are merely sitting on the other side of our affections and all it takes is a little goodwill and roughly hewn smirk for audiences to be won over. Robert Downey Jr. played fast and close to his real life persona, and Chris Hemsworth more than looked the rugged part, but also spoke with natural confidence. For all the detractors of the MCU and the criticism it attracts for being formulaic, Doctor Strange knew it would hit a home run by simply retracing the paths of this formula. Anyone who's seen Sherlock already knows how condescending Benedict Cumberbatch can be - it was just a matter of shaping him towards looking out for the greater good. <br/><br/>But real pitfalls don't really exist in Doctor Strange. The arc of the arrogant man brought to his knees by unfortunate circumstances and made to defrost and learn a little humility is a crowd pleaser, as the studio's track record has already shown. Yet Strange happens to casually master every spell-bending, kung-fu kicking lesson thrown at him, and by day two he is already sneaking into the library and speedreading all its ancient formulas (he has photographic memory, as you do). You can't simultaneously humble a protagonist but keep prodding him forward as the chosen one, destined to bring balance to the force or protect the Earth or something. Strange keeps reaching for his plotted redemption, attempting to swallow his ego and think about someone other than himself for once, but how can he do that when magical capes of levitation are throwing themselves at him and ancient immortal beings are passing on enormous burdens for his shoulders to carry? <br/><br/>There is an abundance of excellent actors here - Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Mads Mikkelsen, the painfully under-utilised Michael Stuhlbarg - and barely a solid character between them. Wong is Wong, guardian of the library and a master of the mystic arts, but is quickly relegated to being the straight counterpoint to Strange's comedic quips. Marvel's humour is by now purely fan service, one-liners served on a platter directly to the audience, crafted via scientific method to elicit the most laughs. When someone mentions Beyonce, Drake or wifi passwords, they're addressing the audience through the screen, and the movie's characters treat these moments as required formalities. Yes, Wong silently humming Single Ladies is a nice touch, but why reduce his role in the climax to one reeking of bathos, as if he's become the giggling punchline to a long running joke? Between that and having his corpse being pulled from the rubble via time-reversal, he hasn't been given a single capable moment. <br/><br/>Mikkelsen should feel the most maligned of the cast - the screenwriters have resurrected a D-level villain for the purposes of a single film, and him to become the unfortunate victim of Strange's origin story. Kaecilius sports edgy, alien guyliner and monologues morosely of his noble purposes for seeking power from the dark dimension (yep, that's what it's actually called), but the script doesn't bother to throw some flashbacks or even the name of a dead spouse to bolster his motivations. Eventually he's swept aside for the big gas cloud baddie in the finale. Strange's method of attack here is clever, but the scene descends into what is essentially a gag reel. The story builds up to the moment by stressing the need for Strange to finally act selflessly, but the endurance act isn't the eternity of torment that it needs to be. It's supposed to test his newfound resolve, but instead of gritting his teeth as the death beam incinerates him, he's rolling his eyes and mouthing ""not again"" like a Looney Tunes character about to succumb to gravity. After all that, the movie pretends to warn us of the fatal dangers of playing with time but then uses it as a precursor to what will eventually happen - it's an exposition stepping stone, designed so that his mastery of time manipulation doesn't feel too strange. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange bursts at the seams trying to squeeze in all its new rules, villains and mystical powers into yet another piece of the Infinity War puzzle. Marvel deserves praise for pulling off something magnificent and unheard of in bringing unwieldy comic material to life, and joining all the strands together. Yet looking closely these movies are only loosely cobbled together by whispers, cameos and the infamous post-credits scenes. One of the most inexplicable moments in Civil War comes when Spiderman and Ant-man suddenly pop out from behind the greenscreen to take their place on opposing sides of the skirmish. All the comic book fans cheered, but what about those of us in the audience that wanted some motivation?"
"ReelLifeReviews","7","1","2","12 February 2017"," Visually stunning, but lacking in story
","FINALLY a movie worthy of 3D. This has been such a gimmick to me in other movies. This one takes full advantage and it really adds to the experience. The visuals are truly impressive. The story itself could have been better, though. I didn't feel connected to very many of the characters. With this not being a mainstream Marvel character, I was hoping to learn more about this world. Tilda Swinton seemed bored at times. I think she was going for stoic, but it didn't always read that way. Too many of the jokes fell flat and they came off like jokes rather than feeling natural if that makes sense. An entertaining movie overall, however."

","This film is so much fun, it's hilarious, it's got some of the most complex, most elaborate action sequences I've seen all year, and I can't stop geekin' out about the cloak of levitation. This is Benedict Cumberbatch making his grand entrance into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie is awesome movie.<br/><br/>In New York City, Stephen Strange loses the use of his hands in a car accident. After learning of Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously was able to walk again, the Strange seeks him out, and is directed to Kamar-Taj which the secret compound Kamar-Taj with magic. After strange arrival to Nepal, he seeks Kamar-Taj. The Ancient One shows Strange her power, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. Amazed, Strange begs her to teach him, and she eventually agrees. <br/><br/>Strange begins his tutelage under the Ancient One and Mordo, and learns from the ancient books in the library. Strange learns that Earth is protected from other dimensions by a spell formed from three buildings called Sanctums, found in New York City, London, and Hong Kong. The task of the sorcerers is to protect the Sanctums. Strange become sorcerer over several months, even secretly reading from the text Kaecilius stole from and learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, comparing his arrogant yearning for power to that of Kaecilius, who believes, after the deaths of his loved ones, that everyone should have eternal life.<br/><br/>Kaecilius and his followers use the stolen pages to begin summoning the powerful Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time does not exist and all can live forever. This destroys the London Sanctum, and sends Strange from Kamar-Taj to the New York Sanctum. From the attract, strange got Cloak of Levitation. Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that her long life has come from her own use of Dormammu's power. Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One, and escapes to Hong Kong. The ancient one then dies, despite the best efforts of Strange. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead and the Sanctum destroyed, with the Dark Dimension already engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to turn back time and save Wong, before creating an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment forever. After killing Strange many times to no avail, Dormammu reluctantly agrees to leave Earth if Strange undoes the time loop, taking Kaecilius and the zealots with him.<br/><br/>Strange returns the Eye, which Wong calls an Infinity Stone, to Kamar-Taj, and then takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies. In a mid-credits scene, the Strange decides to help Thor, who has brought his brother Loki to Earth to search for their father Odin. In a post-credits scene, Mordo confronts Pangborn and takes the energy he uses to walk, stating that Earth has ""too many sorcerers""."
"mjplysaght","7","1","2","3 February 2017"," An absolute spectacle. Apart from that, pretty standard
","At this stage in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the standalone movies have become pretty predictable. The sheer frequency of these films and the existing knowledge that they're not going to kill any of the characters off because they need them for ensemble films is common at this point, so there are no major stakes.<br/><br/>Also, after thirteen films in the MCU where they have more or less fleshed out the majority of these superheroes, suddenly now we're being introduced to a fresh face? Just a tad jarring. The introduction to Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange is nothing we aren't used to. Typical fall from grace and redemption story.<br/><br/>The cast are all respected thespians in their own right, but there are no Oscar worthy scenes here. Well, in terms of acting, anyway. The CGI, absolutely. The visuals in this film are so trippy and well done that it deserves its Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects. It certainly took a few leaves out of 'Inception's book and the result is truly mesmerizing.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it's just a pretty standard addition to the backlog of Marvel films. The villain isn't that impressive, the threat is easily stopped and it's pointless to get invested in emotional stakes."

","Oooooooooooh! I am a massive fan of Sherlock, and Benedict Cumberbatch is a great actor... So his casting in this movie was EXCELLENT in my view...<br/><br/>So, was it good - Well, honestly - I thought this was excellent!!! It was thoroughly entertaining if a little jumbled.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One was a controversial choice to many, but honestly I could not give a damn... Yes, it is an Asian character in the comics, but Hollywood KNOWS that it needs big names to sell seats - And her acting was fantastic!<br/><br/>The Story, while not the greatest had some fine action scenes and though it borrowed a little too heavily from Inception - It all worked!<br/><br/>And it is damn humorous as well... Some great Funny Moments...<br/><br/>So why only a 7 if I enjoyed it so much? <br/><br/>Well, yeah there are bad points - To Quote Rossatron, a popular YouTuber and Movie Making Critic, The 'Geography in the fight scenes gets a little convoluted and can be quite hard to follow at times. <br/><br/>The fight scenes are all epic but it can be difficult following the various characters.<br/><br/>And there must have been some kind of 'Behind the Scenes' discussion... As they made a TERRIBLE CHOICE asking Cumberbatch to try and do an American accent!!! OH BOY IT IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH SOME OF THE WORST ACCENTS IN MOVIES EVER!!!<br/><br/>Only slightly behind Sean Connery trying to do Irish in The Untouchables...<br/><br/>Benedict tries really hard to maintain the American Drawl, but it sounds so fake... and far too often he ends up reverting to British!<br/><br/>I know that in the comics Strange is an American Doctor, but GOD DAMN IT its an Adaption!!!! Play to the strengths of your leads!!! <br/><br/>Would it have been that hard to believe that Strange was a British Doctor who had migrated to the US for better opportunities to test his skills? NO! It wouldn't... And it would have saved us from the TERRIBLE Accent that Cumberbatch delivered!<br/><br/>And its the accent that makes the film unintentionally hilarious too often... It slips in and out so much you wonder if Strange has a Split Personality!<br/><br/>No, It has to be said - Its an enjoyable movie... Not perfect but to launch Doctor Strange into the Marvel Universe, it works!<br/><br/>Now lets just hope they do NOT ask Cumberbatch to try and be American again and try and get a little more focus behind the action next time instead of relying on the effects to sell the film.<br/><br/>Far better than I actually thought it was going to be... Just minor niggles let it down."

","Its no secret that Marvel is a money making machine. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has grossed billions of dollars and remains a force every year. Overall, I think the franchise has been very successful in bringing comic book heroes to life through origin stories and combining the heroes for action epics. Marvel's latest installment was introducing the masses to Doctor Strange. I wasn't very familiar with the character so I was cautiously optimistic going into this one.<br/><br/>The films stars Benedict Cumberbatch in the titular role. Benedict is a great performer and I think he's always remarkable in what he is in. Doctor Strange is about a arrogant but precisely successful neurosurgeon who gets in a life changing car crash that messes up hi hands. Strange searches far and wide for a way to get his hands working again. he travels to Nepal and is introduced to a fantastically magical world of sorcery where he can do more with his mind and alter reality, time, and the world from harnessing the power within.<br/><br/>First off, the effects in this film are great. Its immensely psychedelic and extremely graphically busy. The skyline is constantly shifting and worlds are bending and all of it looks up to par. It was reminiscent of some of the sequences seen in Inception. The fight scenes in the film also do not disappoint. Its got what it needs to keep thrill seekers engaged. Marvel also gathers a very talented cast to add to its never ending list of A-listers involved in the MCU. Mads Mikkelsen is a brilliant performer, although he's a bit of a shallow villain in this.<br/><br/>The film has too much going on in concepts. A person's soul? can come out of their body, there is a giant demon thing that's trying to destroy the world, there are shortcuts that lead to major cities, buildings can be moved, there is a mirror reality, a moving cape, fireballs, time can be put on a loop its insane how many things happen in this film. Its not that its hard to follow, its just that the film becomes conceptually ugly the longer it goes. It doesn't feel like other Marvel films as the world that is created isn't very interesting and feels bland despite all the visuals involved.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch plays a great Doctor Strange. He's an egotistical guy who becomes humbled and is yet witty and remains flawed. He's a welcome addition to the Marvel Universe, I assume he will be a part of the next Avengers film. Its just that this origin film doesn't really stand out as you are just thrown into the world of sorcery and just have to accept what is going on. Its an admirable effort but pales in comparison to some of the other heroes in the MCU. There is still room for improvement and I'm curious to see where this goes.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

I'm not sure this film managed to develop his full potential (both as actor and as character). Maybe there was not enough time for this.<br/><br/>However enough with this, speaking of time... I lost the time perspective of the story. W/o telling more about what has happened in the film - I'd like simply to say - I have no bloody idea how long he was mastering his skills. At some point he just... became really good. My understanding is it happened rather quickly. Targeting the 17 or lower age they made a huge focus on the potentially attractive 3D scenes (fights, chasing and city-building concept type the Matrix...).

When he is faced with difficult circumstances, he turns to sources of help that are more spiritual and metaphysical than he would have in the past. <br/><br/>I find it interesting that Marvel addresses so many different worldviews and religious ideas in their characters. Dr. Strange is no exception. He comes to accept a traditional far eastern type of spirituality that is different than the views of Marvel's other characters. It is a clearly non-western spirituality that contrasts the traditionally Judeo-Christian worldviews of the western world. It seems as though they are trying to be more inclusive of other worldviews, which may or may not be a good thing."

","Doctor Strange is a sci-fi/fantasy type of movie. Not only does it include the special effects of magic, but is also part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe which is very much so sci-fi. The special effects are amazing and literally mind blowing. When the characters are in the mirror dimension and distorting space, it is a sight to behold. Buildings collapse in on themselves and other buildings as the city spirals and twists. The story is quite simple. Doctor Steven Strange, an expert surgeon, gets into a car crash that ruins the mobility of his hands. He can no longer do what he loves as a surgeon. He goes through a rough patch seeking treatment after treatment. He learns about this place that helped a paralyzed man recover fully. He finds himself in a place that teaches the mystic arts. He then learns magic and ends up saving the day at the end of the movie. There were many different story lines in the comics that this movie could have taken, but I think they nailed it. The only reason I gave this a nine instead of a ten is because of the way Dormammu was depicted on screen. In the comics and some cartoons, you get to see Doctor Strange's greatest foe, Dormammu. He is typically depicted as a powerful being with a dark head covered in orange-ish yellow-ish flames. In the movie, Dormammu does seem powerful, but his face looks more like blue and purple stripes that constantly shift. This distracted me from the scene because it seemed wrong."

","Overall, I think that Dr. Strange was one of the better Marvel movies to have come out recently. While some of the plot was a little cliché, the overarching universe that was created within the movie was fresh and interesting. <br/><br/>In the case of the Dr. Strange, I really liked the redemptive qualities of his character. The development of him going from a self interested surgeon to a self sacrificial magic wielder with a heart for others was well done by the script writers. It's always cool to see a character get knocked down a couple notches to then reinvent their own character, as they realize that they are not the center of the universe. As a Christian I personally love seeing this element in movies, as it is a reminder to put others before ourselves, just as Christ did for us."

From spectacular visual effects to humorous dialogue to stupendous acting were some of the many positive aspects of the film that remained with me.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is one of my most-liked superhero's and when I heard they were making a movie about him I was overwhelmed with excitement. And now after watching the movie I was definitely not disappointed.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is a great film to see for anyone who loves superhero's or previous Marvel films. It subsumes the sense of adventure and action we have admired from the previous movies. Make sure to stay during the credits as there are two cliffhangers to leave us with avidity, especially during the Chris Hemsworth (Thor) scene.<br/><br/>If you have not seen the movie yet, I would expect to be pleasantly surprised as the trailers deviated from the true feel of the film.<br/><br/>Some of the negative points of the film would be that there was a conspicuous prominence given to the special effects aspect of the film which sometimes got rather repetitive whereas, personally I was trying to focus more on main character of the film. Another thing that could have been improved in the film would be to accentuate Stephen Strange's transformation more evidently as I was confused to why he suddenly was able to stand a high chance against Mads Mikkelsen during their first battle.<br/><br/>Overall, Doctor Strange was a excellent film and I would certainly recommend it to anyone. <br/><br/>My rating for Doctor Strange is: 7.5<br/><br/>Thanks Josh."

The visuals in this movie is AMAZING! The magic effects, the illusions, the background, the mirror sequences and everything that has got to do with magic in this movie is so well done! <br/><br/>2. It tells a good origin story for Doctor Strange. It sticks with the origin in which Doctor Strange was in a freak accident which caused him to break his hands, lead him to meet the Ancient One and train to become Sorcerer Supreme of Earth.<br/><br/>3. The casting was great! I really feel that the actor for Doctor Strange was a great choice. Same goes to Chang, Mordo, Dormammu and Gina. I am not so sure on the casting choice for the Ancient One but she wasn't that much of a bad choice either.<br/><br/>4. It really helps explains how the magic has been existing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. How, while the Avengers are saving the world, the Sorcerers defend the world from inter-dimensional threats.<br/><br/>Now for the bad:<br/><br/>Wow, where do I begin?<br/><br/>1. The villain choice was so bad. They could've used Mordo and Dormammu as the main villain but no, they had to use another corrupted villain who is the same as Mordo in the comics. Dormmamu was defeated in the most poor way possible. Yes, people have mixed thoughts on the, ""Dormammu, I've come to bargain!"" scene. I have a negative.<br/><br/>2. The jokes and humor scenes were overused too much. At first, I was okay with the humor. This IS Marvel by the way. But when they overused it too much, it was hard to take this movie seriously. It was like in every act, they through something that is a joke, wise- crack, clumsiness, mess ups or anything that is suppose to make you chuckle. <br/><br/>3. The use of Mordo. Mordo was shown playing Chang's role in the comics by fighting side by side with Doctor Strange. It felt like a Sinestro copy in Green Lantern. The hero's biggest enemy is at first allies with you but soon becomes corrupted and becomes a supervillain. Mordo could've played the role the original villain played but no.<br/><br/>4. The story almost it feels like it is going nowhere. <br/><br/>5. The opening sequence is similar to the Iron Man movie. Where it opens up showing the personality of the main character rather than have his personality develop over time in the movie.<br/><br/>Now for my own personal thoughts:<br/><br/>It is not the worst superhero movie this year. It just fails to live up to the hype of what I was expecting. But is it really terrible? Definitely not! It is really fun to watch and there is a scene in the movie which just blows your mind where you are like, ""Holy sh******tttttt!!!"" It's just that they overuse the humor and the story is really predictable. It is not the best Marvel production. It is definitely the second best superhero movie released in 2016. For those who haven't seen it, I would recommend it to those who don't mind the overuse of comedy and a predictable plot with a poor villain."
"peefyn","7","1","2","4 December 2016"," Not strange enough
","Marvel has found a winning recipe, and though I do not agree that all of their movies are the, I would love for them to stray a bit further from their formula. Dr. Strange is different from the other movies in that it covers a different aspect of the universe they are working with, and it allows for some different types of actions and gags. But other than that, it's more of the same. The plot itself is not all that interesting, and the characters feels a bit too dumbed down (to the point where it seems like anyone are open to completely changing their allegiance over nothing). It was fun to watch, but it's hard to not think about the potential that is there.<br/><br/>The visuals of this movie is great, but mostly they consist of distorting architecture and changed gravity. There are few nuggets, with branching of hands and other worlds, and this is the kind of things that could have made this movie into something completely special. Hopefully they want to push in that direction in the future."

","From Iron Man to Captain America, Thor, Guardians of the Galaxy, to this. I'm a big fan of Marvel movies(Not in comics). I've watched all their movies especially the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, and so far Captain America: Winter Soldier, next is CA: Civil War, then Guardians of the Galaxy are my top 3. This new/strange movie of marvel, Doctor Strange, is really different from the usual marvel movies. The effects were really great, mind-blowing, so does the acting of Stephen Strange himself Benedict Cumberbatch. He owns the character, his accent was fine, the humor (which is always present in every MCU movie) was there. I didn't expect too much about this movie that's why i was so impressed, and i can say, Doctor Strange movie can stand alone without any help from the Avengers. It was 9/10."
"annuskavdpol","6","1","2","1 December 2016"," Dr. Strange is like an ER sitcom
","The movie Dr. Strange 2016 is a movie much like the television shows House or ER. It is about a doctor and how he copes in his life. Perhaps he is always trying to either help himself or help others. On a certain level there is a philosophical meaning to this movie, for example, should the doctor help himself and keep himself safe - like a paramedic or should the doctor try to help all of society as best as he can? And then if he continues to help the whole of society, by fighting off evil, can he still be called a doctor, or does he transcend his role to be omnipotent? The role of the Ancient One could be seen as that of a dictator - but she does seem to be a wise woman. It is clear that Western doctors today probably get pulled into Buddhism and alternative methods of healing throughout their practices. Doctors, too must wonder about good and evil and maybe Dr. Strange is more a movie about trying to contribute to society versus thinking only about oneself, choosing altruism versus survival of the fittest. Maybe this movie is about caring versus struggling and about truth versus lies."

","Ah what a shame, this had the makings of a great film, perhaps the best of the Marvel Universe. The acting is superb, absolutely first class, special mention to Benedict Cumberbatch, who created a believable Dr. Strange. All the actors on top form, in fact without the acting this film would have been a flop. So what's the problem? it missed opportunities in the script to add depth to the story, it felt edited to hell, dumbed down safe for 8 year olds to watch. If the script writer reads this, then why was there not a shot for a few minutes of Dr. Strange being tempted to return to his old life, back to normal or continue and be a superhero. Why was a few minutes not spent emphasizing he was a playboy hot shot surgeon, a flash car and apartment does not cut it, why was a few minutes flashing out the bad guy played by a very underused brilliant actor Mads Mikkelsen why a few minutes not showing avenger(s) in the big boss fight scene being helpless but needing Dr.Strange. It just needed a bit more work, an extra 10 mins would have given much more depth to the characters. There is one HUGE plot hole, just suffice to say someone takes a lot of effort to get something when another person just walks in and gets it. Too much special effects, copy from inception, loses then the action whats going on. Anyway, for all that go watch it, its a nice safe predictable formulae film, great with popcorn and cola watching on the big cinema screen just don't expect another Guardians of the Universe."

","I'm a big time Marvel and Benedict Cumberbatch fan (anyone else catch the ""yupp"" the same way he says it on Sherlock?) But the writing and directing for the movie didn't live up to those two things. The time line in the beginning was a mess! I understand it was likely hard to come up with another way to fit all of that in, in a short amount of time, but this didn't work. For the first 20 minutes or so of the movie, it was a complete snooze fest. It picked up in the middle and was good for the rest of the movie. The ""mirror dimension"" looked really neat, but didn't make much sense beyond that. I'm big into sci-fi and science, but this left me scratching my head as to how it actually worked. I view Benedict Cumberbatch as one of the greatest actors of our time, he should of had more opportunities to show case that."

","""We never lose our demons, we only learn to live above them."" Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) is one of the best neurosurgeons in the world, until an accident leaves him crippled. When he hears of a miracle cure he seeks out the person that can help him. What he discovers is far beyond medicine and will change his life, and the fate of the world, forever. I have become really burnt out on comic book movies but I was interested in this one simply because it looked like an Inception type of movie. I was not disappointed. This was my favorite Marvel movies since the original Thor. This movie really felt like it could stand on its own without having to add 20 different characters with 20 different plot lines. The humor was great and really was used in good places, although a few times it seemed unnecessary. All that being said, for someone who wishes they would make original movies again I did like this one, simply due to the fact that this felt like a movie and not another link in a money-grab chain. Overall, an Inception type comic book movie that had the feel of something new and fresh. I just hope they don't end up doing this character to death like they have with Iron Man and Captain America.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","2","22 November 2016"," There's plenty familiar about 'Strange,' but its world comes impressively to life
","Believe it or not, there was a time – eight years ago – when Iron Man seemed just as obscure of a comic book character to the public as Doctor Strange had been (until now). So it would surprise no one if in 2024, Stephen Strange was almost as much of a household name as Tony Stark.<br/><br/>The similarities between 2008's hugely successful first step for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and ""Doctor Strange"" don't end there. Both films are entertaining, funny and tell the story of a cocky, career- focused protagonist who must become a hero for the sake of his own salvation.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch stars as a Strange, a hugely successful neurosurgeon whose life, life's work and consequently, soul, are crushed when his hands are crushed in a horrific car crash. Seeking answers to restore his ability rather than accepting his reality, Strange travels to Kathmandu, where he discovers Kamar-Taj, a temple that trains people in the mystical arts. There, Strange learns from the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) how to alter dimensions of space and time.<br/><br/>Strange is another comical narcissist (if Cumberbatch and Downey Jr. ever appear on screen as their Marvel characters together, watch out) who must humble himself to defeat evil, in this case Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), a rebellious former pupil of the Ancient One who has set out to destroy the sanctums keeping Earth's dimension from the dark dimension, dominion of the evil spirit Dormmamu.<br/><br/>If it's not obvious from some of the plot description, the biggest script challenge for ""Doctor Strange"" is balancing the need to acquaint viewers with the mystical side of the Marvel universe with the need to tell a compelling story. Director Scott Derrickson, with his regular writing partner C. Robert Cargill and help from screenwriter Jon Spaihts, keep ""Doctor Strange"" relatively short and forward-moving even with the necessary exposition. The sacrifice is in a bit of the realism of the timeline – Strange takes on his new mantle (or cloak, I should say) relatively quickly, a problem mostly covered up by the entertainment factor and perhaps the realization that audiences get what an origin story is and don't need all the usual tropes.<br/><br/>An origin story is really what ""Doctor Strange"" is at heart, so Derrickson must bring a more unique dimension (no pun intended) to the film through his vision. That artistic direction (which Derrickson sold Marvel on to get this film made) is the film's bread and butter. The ubiquitous nature of superhero films and their tropes demands that each film bring something unique to the table, and ""Doctor Strange"" does with its ""Inception""-like reality-bending world and action sequences.<br/><br/>The set of rules that comes with fighting enemies in a ""mirror dimension"" opens up so many possibilities to bring the audience something new and ""Doctor Strange"" flourishes in this space. The line between green-screen stunts and clever camera-work gets blurred very quickly, and in an era when amazing digital effects are commonplace, that kind of trickery goes a long way in impressing the audience.<br/><br/>All this to say ""Doctor Strange"" is just like every other Marvel film, only different. The characters and story conventions are built similarly to the studio's previous offerings, but the aesthetic is one of a kind. Even the humor, at times, feels forced, and that's long been a hallmark of Marvel's cinematic style, but Derrickson has created new trappings to tell one of these same old albeit still enjoyable stories. Undeniably, as the ""Strange"" world becomes more familiar to audiences, future ""Doctor Strange"" films will have to up their story game, but for now, we can just enjoy the entertainment.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"RileyOnFilm","7","1","2","22 November 2016"," Seriously good but could use more humor
","This film is very good. The visuals are probably the best feature but it has a solid cast, good acting, and a very able hero to add to the Marvel film universe. There were several times I lost interest in the characters and what they were doing, a better story with more aside type humor might have helped that.<br/><br/>This film is serious, that's for sure. It starts out with a doctor making life or death choices in surgery. From there is transfers to Hong Kong and the focus is on learning martial arts and a Zen mindset. My 9-year- old found these parts very boring. To me, they were OK in that they were part of the machine of telling the story. I did think those scenes could have been eliminated in retrospect.<br/><br/>There is a villain and he is certainly hated and scary. It is unclear where he gets his powers though and so he seems flat. It would be nice to get more back story on him. The visuals, mostly CGI, are stunning and they really drew me in. This idea of ""folding in"" dimensions one upon another is hypnotic and this part of the story is told well.<br/><br/>Tis film is very polarized on its hero. I would have liked to see his relationship with his colleague/lover developed. This could have opened our minds more to his motivation. As it is, the first half of the movie is basically just life events that lead up to the car accident. The second half is him flailing to find a way to make his hands stop shaking. That is the only motivation in the film really.<br/><br/>There is a lot of action here. If you want something visually stunning, Doctor Strange is for you. Some viewers might find the focus on training a bit long but there is plenty of action here as well. I guess I would have liked to see this film ""get to it"" sooner but then again, I am not familiar with the comic book storyline. I would definitely recommend this film to Marvel comic fans and those interested in Eastern meditation, martial arts, and the Doctor Strange character."

","Tonight was an awesome night especially after getting to see Doctor Strange (2016). Now to set the record straight, I've always loved comics though Doctor Strange I'd never gotten to read; after seeing this amazing Marvel movie I'll be collecting them all.<br/><br/>When the trailer for Doctor Strange (2016) released I was a bit skeptical given a lot of the films released since the ending of 2015 coming into 2016; the trailer just made the movie look more than good. It seemed to be one of the over the top films that the trailer shows everything, in this case it wasn't. Doctor Strange (2016) turned out to be an off the charts amazing film filled with great acting, a beautiful story line; and the graphics were far superb! If I could give this film a higher rating then I most certainly would. The team that put together this film all the way to the marketing did an amazing job and produced a great film which left me inspired to go collect every Doctor Strange comic and collectible that I can get my hands on. This film is a must see!"
"wildhunt1-585-849528","10","2","7","3 November 2016"," Strange Things Are Afoot...
","Grade: 9.8/10 A+<br/><br/>Just got back from seeing Doctor Strange in IMAX 3D, and I have to say...WOW, what an experience. The movie was awesomely done and deserved IMAX 3D treatment. I'm going to go see it again tomorrow in 2D just so I can compare, however.<br/><br/>Play by play, this is how I grade Doctor Strange:<br/><br/>Story: 9/10 (Excellent) I will admit while the story of Doctor Strange was awesome, I can't call it perfect. If they had given another twenty minutes to Stephen Strange before the accident, it might have been perfect; as it was, you barely got to see him as the ass he was before he began his training; and while it's a very minor thing, I think it would have helped the movie overall. But other than that minor complaint, the rest of the story was solid, including his training and the end of the movie. There is a reference to Captain America: Civil War, but if you're not paying attention, you'll miss it.<br/><br/>Character Development: 10/10 (Perfect) This may seem like a bit of a contradiction considering what I just said about them needing to show Doctor Strange being more of an ass, but what little bit you saw of him being an ass was perfect. None of the characters in the movie felt like they were underdeveloped, including the villain, who may say they didn't understand his motives. Maybe I just gleaned more than they did, but I was happy with how all of the characters turned out.<br/><br/>Direction: 9/10 (Excellent) The way Scott Derrickson told the story of Doctor Strange was one of the coolest ways anyone could have told this story. And while it wasn't perfect, I can't complain too much, but there were a few parts I just wish they had done better, like the portrayal of Stephen Strange before his accident.<br/><br/>Casting: 10/10 (Perfect) I loved everyone in this movie, including the much maligned Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One. I'm not going to state whether they should have chosen an Asian to be the Ancient One. I can understand why they did it, and Tilda Swinton did a fantastic job, so as far as I am concerned, she is now the Ancient One.<br/><br/>Acting: 10/10 (Perfect) I wasn't really worried about the acting from the cast because the cast is great, but I was worried a bit about Benedict Cumberbatch using a non-British accent. I shouldn't have worried.<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10/10 (Perfect) Cinematography and special effects in this movie actually probably deserve a 20 out of 10 because...damn. The movie is beautiful, from start to finish.<br/><br/>Music: 10/10 (Perfect) The music does exactly what it should: It adds to the movie but doesn't distract from it. It's there in the background, almost forgotten, but when you do notice it, it's important. Good job.<br/><br/>Pacing: 10/10 (Perfect) It kept my attention from attention from start to finish. The movie did not drag even once.<br/><br/>Sets and Costumes: 10/10 (Perfect) From the New York Sanctum Sanctorum to Doctor Strange's look, the costume and set designers did a brilliant job. When Benedict Cumberbatch got into full costume, including his Cloak of Levitation and the Eye of Agamotto, my hands shot into the air in a sign of happiness. Doctor Strange was born, and it was a joy to see.<br/><br/>Enjoyment: 10/10 (Perfect) As soon as Doctor Strange was over, I wanted to see it again. Which is why I'm going again tomorrow. I have to see it again.<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing this movie in IMAX 3D at least once. However, if you are the type who gets sick from 3D movies, avoid this one like the plague. The inter-dimensional effects could make you sick. It didn't me, but I could see it possibly happening to someone. Still, go see it in 2D if nothing else."

The introduction of Benedict as Dr. Strange as a new superhero will surely spice up the heat for Robert Downy Jr. The visual effects showcased by this movie is a masterpiece. Fixation of Sherlock with laws of physics, his memory palace, time controlling and all that geeky stuff is clearly visible in the movie. The story of Dr Strange is portrayed in a very elegant manner.

This is a sickening trend in Hollywood, and Doctor Strange makes sure you KNOW that they don't care a single bit about Asian people.<br/><br/>Shamefully horrendous acting by BC only adds insult to injury. A story line that has no rhyme or reason doesn't help. No one cared about Doctor Strange to begin with, but he got a movie anyway, and they still managed to blow it even worse than you'd imagine. Think Ant-Man with more racism.<br/><br/>I wish I could rate it a negative 10, but IMDB only allows as low as a 1.<br/><br/>A pathetic movie with pathetic acting and pathetic whitewashing.

","Short and sweet, this movie is FUN, FUN, FUN. The film is very fast-paced and features very good performances, and likable characters. I feel as if it goes without saying it is both visually stunning, and even daring. There are some film-making flaws in this film that I normally would address, but this movie is so enjoyable, those flaws are ultimately outweighed by how fun watching it is. If you care to hear about the negatives, here they are. Even though the fast pace of the movie is a plus, it can also hurt the film's story sometimes, which is extremely important, and can take away from some of the characters. Yes, the stunning bending and altering of surroundings is enthralling, but it can be a bit overkill. Though that's nit-picky. I am a big movie music guy, and Michael Giacchino's score is somewhat of an awkward mix. It has moments of a very basic Marvel score, and it has moments that almost sound like a mix of medieval, Mexican, rock, and Chinese styles that just don't go well together. Mads Mikkelsen I thought did a great job with his character, but like with all Marvel villains there are funny moments that somewhat take away from the villain. I do want to mention that the humor in Doctor Strange I think is better than most of Marvel films. Like I said, these faults are very much outweighed by how enjoyable the film is, and I would recommend seeing it in theaters, and especially in IMAX 3D."
"malmborgimplano-92-599820","10","2","9","3 November 2016"," The most fun I've ever had being nauseated
","This film exceeded my expectations--clever, well-paced, visually sumptuous and entertaining in a non-formulaic way. Cumberbatch is wonderful as always in a role that's cunningly crafted to build on characters we've already seen him play, with a heavy emphasis on Sherlock, but with a warmth and relatability we're not used to in the usual Cumberbatch braniac. Maybe it's because he's playing an American braniac--he does it very well, I think.<br/><br/>I went to an IMAX showing that had reserved seating, and though I'd thought I was selecting a seat in the back of the theater it turned out to be right in the middle of the front row. I didn't complain because I've watched movies that way before and I thought it might actually make the IMAX effect better. Yes and no--a little blurred on the periphery sometimes but when it was all in line it really threw me into the middle of the action. And that's where the problems started. I've been experiencing a touch of vertigo, and though that just made the initial sequences in the multiverse just a little more intense, by the climax of the film I was really worried that I was going to ralph. Nothing like this has EVER happened to me in a 3-D or IMAX film before. But I never even considered leaving the theater or even closing my eyes because I was too interested in what was going on.<br/><br/>I'd like to see this again while it's still in theaters, because it really is a fun movie to watch in IMAX, but I'll definitely do some Cawthorne exercises beforehand, and I'll insist on sitting farther back in the auditorium."

If there was a Marvel movie that was going to revitalize my interest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it would have been this film. Doctor Strange is a different sort of superhero and usually tells different sorts of stories that are much more comics and science fiction in nature, compared to more common Hulk-Smash Marvel storylines. This film boasts an especially fine cast with Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's ""Sherlock"") as Stephen Strange and Mads Mikkelsen (who plays the lead in the brilliant and under seen ""Hannibal"" TV series. Watch it NOW if you haven't!) as the villainous Kaecilius, along with Tilda Swinton and Rachel McAdams. But despite a strong cast, a more interesting of superhero than most, and top notch production values, it's hard to put my finger on what went wrong with the film.

The overuse of visual effects, taking the great looking visuals from Inception and trying to make it more psychedelic and the stupid last 20 minutes, what's wrong with these guys.

","This film is based on a series of comics that I used to read many years ago. Its been so long that I cant really remember all that much, but I do remember that the comics were quite random in that the world it built had endless possibilities. So when this film concluded it did set up the possibility for that to be furthered in future films. Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange) was really good in this.<br/><br/>His character arc is quite formulaic though. He starts out an arrogant holier than thou surgeon, but is brought down to earth when he is almost crippled while driving his over powered luxury car off the road. The road to recovery is littered with the usual trials and tribulation until the answer lies in the realm of the metaphysical, a realm that a straight laced surgeon has difficulty accepting. Accept it he must of course, because, as per usual in this type of story, the fate of all human kind rests in his surgically capable hands. <br/><br/>The CGI effects were quite good. In fact they won an academy award. I admit I got a bit bored watching this though; I found the story to be predictable.

","The pace at which the events happen, constantly interrupted by forceful injections of juvenile humour, renders the potential threats inconsequential.<br/><br/>The peeps behind the story are trying terribly hard to explain the minute details such as how Doctor Strange became the iconic bearded wizard instead of focusing on an actual story.<br/><br/>A mystical weapon chooses him and has a mind of its own. The same weapon renders gravity pointless yet during a key fight that exists only to show off repetitive special effects, our hero is running, sliding, falling etc... Defective mystical weapons?<br/><br/>Astral plane... Where physics law still apply, where people fight as they would in physical form... Forget all you know yet the astral plane is exactly as you know it.<br/><br/>There are two types of special effects: the kaleidoscope distortion and the conjuring or sparky light which can either be portals or weapons. These effects are used over and over and over and over and over again taking all the magic out of it.<br/><br/>The way the real threat, a cosmic entity, is defeated isn't unlike two kids bickering and taunting each other, a scenario that could easily stop if one decided to turn away and pay no attention. If the said entity, a supreme being with infinite powers, simply chose to ignore Strange, I believe Strange would give up his plan once a zillion ... That would be spoiling it. The director made no secret he was inspired by The Matrix and Strange would have created what agent Smith did... All this terrible villain had to do is sit it out. Possibly one of the worst ending of any Marvel movie.<br/><br/>I could go on but not without spoiling it. It's one for the kids and there's better things to watch on telly."
"ian_calders","4","1","3","8 April 2017"," Enough with origin stories?
","This is not terrible film but its not good either. Maybe I am just getting bored of origin films but I certainly found myself getting bored with this film. Most of it has been done before, not that long ago, and many times better.<br/><br/>The film makes a big mistake early on by introducing the antagonist with a fight that he is losing, this is just poor story telling as its hard to see the antagonist as much of a challenge after this. Cumberbatch does a reasonable job as the hero but a lot of the jokes fail to land (something that is even lamp-shaded). Tilda Swinton is completely unconvincing in the mentor role. Her performance reminded me of Gabriel in Constantine and whilst it worked brilliantly in that role she just felt paper thin in this role (to be fair it might be the writing not the performance).<br/><br/>Where this film really loses the plot is with the effects, I'm not against CGI but good effects should be there to enhance the story and immerse us in the world. In this case however the effects are often jarring and confusing. Its hard to follow a fight scene when the world is shifting all the time in the background. Finally I have to question why they put time manipulation in the film, I thought it was because this was the main power of the comic book character but apparently not. The trouble with time travelling and time manipulation is that its incredibly hard to do well, it often robs the story of gravity because of the lack of consequences of your actions when you can just rewind or go back in time. This film fell into that trap with both feet and the final 'showdown' was completely unrewarding as a result."

","Doctor Strange is a poorly written movie - The story progresses too slowly in parts and jumps ahead in others. The movie has a weak story with weaker characters and depends too heavily on impressive graphics and humor. One of the few upsides is that it has a strong catalyst, which successfully kicks off the story. Overall, Doctor Strange is a solid five out of ten - I wouldn't spend time watching it again."

Tilda Swinton is compelling and you just can't go wrong with Rachel MacAdams so the acting is beyond excellent.<br/><br/>I'm a major Doctor Strange fan, too, and there's always the worry that a movie of the comic will fall over (witness the first Judge Dredd movie). It's never going to be easy and this, I think, does a pretty food job. However, it's really not quite good enough.<br/><br/>Why?

"mounirrmaged","2","1","3","31 January 2017"," An overrated, generic marvel movie
","Doctor Strange is the latest installment in the marvel cinematic universe franchise and it is directed by Scott Derrickson (sinister, deliver us from evil). The story follows Stephen Strange, the top neurosurgeon who loses the ability to use his hands after a car accident and his quest for spiritual healing from the help of mystic arts. Much like most marvel movies, the plot of the film is thin and doesn't have much to tell. It follows the simplest form of film making without taking any creative risks or new ideas. The moving point starts at the tenth minute of the movie, the car accident. This is incredibly rushed because barely anything is known about the main character except that he is egotistical and a great doctor. The films gives no detailed insight about his humanity or how he interacts with the real world or how his life is. Nothing of that is given in the film, which weakens it. How is the audience supposed to emphasize with a character that was poorly built from the get go? And it doesn't stop here, the character is basically Tony Stark 2.0 but instead of the armor, he uses magic. Benedict Cumberbatch gives his best to breathe life in Stephen Strange, but the performance falls flat due to the weak script. The only charisma he has are the quips and jokes, which become tiresome really fast. The lack of any dramatic tension or internal conflict makes the character barely 3 dimensional. Stephen does change by the end of the movie, but it feels unearned. This film could have been a unique entry in the superhero genre due to its subject matter: a pure fantasy world filled with magic and other bizarre worlds. But, much like Thor (2011), all of this creativity is overthrown for the sake of decently conceptualized visuals and a generic story that offers no new perspective. The villain in the movie, while not as terrible as the mandarin or other bad mcu villains, is not great either. A mediocre villain with your typical, generic motivations. The film implies a conflicted past between Kaecilius and the Ancient One, but it is not explored. Just as the rest of mcu movies, Doctor Strange has no memorable musical score, and it barely even services the movie well. It doesn't add any form of weight or emotional levity. It is extremely superficial and used only as a tool to make the scenes less awkward or make it funny. Marvel is abusing the solo movies as well as the directors and audiences by giving movies whose sole purpose is to build up to future franchises. The one thing that was truly good was the visuals, which was not mind blowing as people say. Overall, not a terrible movie, but not a good one either."
"kane_1371-117-231060","8","1","3","25 January 2017"," Marvel finally made a good comic book movie
","Marvel movies like the movies of its parent company Disney are the literal definition of mediocre and overrated. Through out the decade long tenure of the Marvel cinematic universe and over 10 big budget releases I can say with certainty that no one of the movies released stood out as an actually good comic book movie. Maybe an exciting action flick but not a good comic book movie and this is where even Fox surpasses Marvel let alone Sony with Spiderman films or Warner with its DC titles. Iron man didn't cut it and Avengers with its Chitauri invasion plot certainly didn't either. The reason for that is two things cinematography of Marvel movies which is uninspiring to say the least and Marvel's usual lack of interest or ability in preservation of its source material when transferred over to the big screen. Take Civil War into consideration a movie I watched again recently just prior to watching Doctor Strange and still ended it with being confused by the sheer idiocy of it. Marvel has been doing some really unappreciated things with its source material since the first day and when you want to bring in the comic book fans, the people that have made mcu actually possible you just should not treat these materials so badly. This is why the general consensus among the hardcore comic book community about mcu is mediocrity. In fact the only other movie of the mcu to come close is Guardiana of Galaxy and won't you know it it was a movie loved by both the average movie goer and the hardcore comic book fan. <br/><br/>So lets see what Doctor Strange did right. Doctor Strange kept it very real and close to the original material, it didn't mess around with important characters and plot points too much and kept it on point and interesting. There was no line or no shot wasted every thing had a point and delivered on its promise of leading to something else. The visual effects of the movie was just amazing, the cinematography of this movie was very well done and it was very good for a comic book movie. it was breathtaking to watch and if it wasn't for that explosion a few years back called inception it would have been really really ground breaking, alas. The choice of Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange was perfect, he is a Supreme actor playing the part of sorcerer Supreme. The changes made to the Ancient One although unfortunate did not affect the character on a fundamental level and is possible to be ignored. The sound effects are sharp and good but the soundtrack vague and bland. The movie also includes the signature humor of mcu yet again while here unlike Avengers 2 or many other Marvel movies it does fit the situation and this actor,even though origin story of Strange is very dark and serious. Talking about origin story there were indeed some plot points missing in the movie like the first encounter of Strange and the people ofnthe ancient one or the monsters attacking earth etc but thid movie managed to savor as much as possible and very good at that too. It was very refreshing to watch a mcu film that didn't dumb down its plot to hide bad writing. Maybe it has a lot to do with the fact that this movie was much more visual heavy than dialog heavy but whatever it was I know I want more of thid. I can only hope that Black Panther movie follows something similar."
"kaydunton","Null","1","3","21 December 2016"," Interesting movie
","I agree with other negative reviewers when they say the main characters were not developed enough to care about them. They don't have a good build-up to see progression or personal growth. I can't comment on acting because I get too caught up in the plot to notice acting. I notice the bad acting in a lot of Lifetime movies though. People are complaining about the formulaic plot, but I was too distracted by the weird sorcery, time travel, and dimension thing to notice it. Witchcraft in this movie was portrayed in a very different manner than what I am used to seeing in other movies, so it particularly distracted me. The evil elements and villains were really different from what I was used to seeing, and that made the movie interesting even if the plot was too much of a brain dead action flick. People complained about how the plot is illogical because Dr.Strange is new to sorcery, but he was able to beat top sorcerers, but they explain it by saying he is smart with photographic memory. He read a lot of magic books. Others complain that they didn't show how why he got interested in sorcery, that was clear to me too; He switched from caring about a cure to caring that the whole world was at risk of annihilation. Morivation was there. Others complained the romance didn't make sense and came out of nowhere. What romance? It was an ex girlfriend feeling sorry for him. Then it seemed more like a friendship built on familiarity, no romance. I watched this movie the same day that I watched Disney's Moana and I thought the plots of these two movies were so similar. No one else mentioned this. Really, watch Dr.Strange and Moana on the same day and you will see what I mean. Somehow this movie inspired me to work harder for what I care about. The concept of the dimensions and the motivation for the evil villains were very creepy and unique to what I am used to watching."
"klarabaumeister","5","1","3","3 December 2016"," Looks cool but is trippy
","Doctor Strange has me on edge. There are some things I really liked, but some things were very unexpected and trippy. The things I liked were basically Benedict Cumberbatch - the guy's an amazing actor - and the visual effects. They just looked cool, all the colours and moving buildings etc. <br/><br/>But the story did not catch me one bit. When I watched the trailer I expected something similar to Inception and that is not what this movie is at really (except for some visuals). Maybe it is because I only watched one trailer and I don't know anything about the comics and that stuff, but I expected something that is mind-blowing and not as weird and trippy as this movie (of course I expected something weird but not in that way). It's more about fighting the dark dimension and some really weird bad people than travelling dimensions and discovering a whole new world. When Doctor Strange first finds out that there is more than the dimension he knows, it looks like he's on an acid trip, I could not take that part seriously at all (even though it looked pretty cool).<br/><br/>Another thing that kind of irritated me was all the jokes. First, this movie is serious and dark, but then, I think to lighten the mood, ""jokes"" are made which are simply not funny in a situation like that. I have to say, some people in the cinema laughed though, so I think it's just not my kind of humour. <br/><br/>Anyways, all in all this movie looked cool and has some great acting, but the story is not for me. I suppose people who know what to expect or just like the story more would love this movie, but unfortunately I did not really enjoy it."
"ryan-03308","8","1","3","28 November 2016"," Another great movie from the marvel universe
","Doctor Strange is the fourteenth film brought to us by Marvel and I have to say it is probably the most daring due to the complexity of it but Scott Derrickson and his team have brought us a great movie here. It is essentially another origin movie and you can guess what is going to happen but I do love the Marvel films, with exception to a few and a lot of people don't agree when i say Iron Man 3 was pretty bad. This movie however doesn't go into a lot of depth involving the characters and goes more for the special effects to amaze the audience. The movie starts with a quick scene introducing Kaecilius (Mikkelsen) stealing a page out of a book owned by The Ancient One (Swinton), there is a fight scene involving a lot of magic and Inception type buildings moving before Kaecilius escapes with the page. Kaecilius is a former student of The Ancient One who has turned evil and is looking to become immortal, he believes the only way to do this is by teaming up with Dormammu, the ruler of the Dark Dimension. We then move to the movies protagonist, the brilliant and arrogant Doctor Stephen Strange, we are shown how brilliant a mind he has while performing surgery and showing off his 70's music knowledge before setting off to save another patients life who has been declared brain dead. With most origin movies the hero usually finds himself after the death of a family member but not with Strange, his family are never mentioned and the only person he was ever close with. Christine Palmer (McAdams) is still alive and working with him. Dr Strange is one of the best neuro surgeons in the world but his life is suddenly turned upside down, paying less attention to the road than he should be he is in a life threatening crash which leaves his hands so damaged he will never perform surgery again. Strange goes into a desperate state of trying everything from stem cell treatment to physiotherapy and spends all the money he has in the process. During a physio session his physio tells him the story of a man who would never be able to walk again and stops going to physio, one day he walks by the same man in the street. Dr Strange doesn't believe this story and the physio shows him the patients files, Strange tracks doen this patient who tells him where he was healed. In a last hope for Strange he sets off and ends up in Kathmandu where he meets Mordo (Ejiofor), he takes Strange to see The Ancient One and this is where the real special effects of the movie kick in, Strange is subjected to an experience that throws him through an experience he can only explain must be caused by LSD, he is thrown through an attack of colours in the screen that will leave you thinking what just happened, not to mention when his hands grow more hands. His training with The Ancient One begins and here there are a few funny scenes with Mordo and the library keeper Wong (Benedict Wong), the jokes and the one liners do keep coming from Strange and Benedict Cumberbatch does a good job of pulling the character off. As the movie goes on Kaecilius attacks and he and Strange end up fighting and here he comes by his Cloak of Levitation, I do like the fact they don't take the film too seriously and joke about things like the cloak. As the movie goes on we are subject to more special effects including an astro projection fight and the introduction of the dark universe and the Dread Dormammu, we learn things about certain characters that will escalate in the sequel and that The Ancient One may not be all she claims. The film does come to a climax with Doctor Strange facing off with Dormammu and bending time and space in a funny but dark way. I did really like this film, it was an origin story that didn't go too much into the depth of the characters, they didn't try and explain why The Ancient One was a woman and not an old Asian man, there is a funny scene at the start when Strange mistakes an old man as the ancient one. Derrickson could also have done more with Mikkelsens character, Mikkelsen is a really good actor and he has proved this but wasn't given much to do in this film. I will hand it to Derrickson and his team though as this was always going to be a hard film to pull off with the effects and the spells and everything else from the Dr Strange comics. I would highly recommend anyone who hasn't already seen this film to go and see it now."
"gcsman","9","1","3","22 November 2016"," Nice take on a unique character.
","I'll give this a 9/10 for the excellent acting, the nice special effects, and the usual Marvel production quality. This character (Dr. Strange) could have gone horribly wrong in translation to the screen but they pretty much got it right. And I went into the theater with some trepidation because Dr.Strange is probably my favorite Marvel character of the whole works, so I really didn't want to sit through a travesty. I actually started reading the comics in the honest-to-god Steve Ditko era (declaring my age here), loved his (literally) un-Earthly other-dimensional settings, and was totally grabbed by the ongoing plot that went on issue after issue unfolding bigger, deeper layers of reality from Nightmare to Mordo to Dormammu to Eternity.<br/><br/>Once I saw that Benedict Cumberbatch signed on for the lead role I was pretty confident that he'd capture it. (and I don't think there are that many top actors who could nail the combination of strength, self-confidence, intelligence, with just a bit of willingness to step over the edge into unreality. Robert Downey Jr may be great for Iron Man but he'd have ruined Dr.Strange.) But the other roles really filled out this movie. Rachel McAdams was great (and underused) in her role -- rightly upgraded from Night Nurse to a full-fledged doctor -- and she commanded the screen quite equally with B.C. in their scenes together. Would love to see her again. Benedict Wong was the surprise hit as the stone-faced librarian, and Chiwetel Ejiofor turned in his usual solid work as Mordo, someone who starts out on the right side but turns out to be just too rigid for his own good.<br/><br/>Now some minor cavils (nothing huge, but these prevent me from going to 10/10).<br/><br/><ul><li>Tilda Swinton really commanded her role as Ancient One. The 'whitewashing' didn't bother me all that much, but what did bring an 'arrgghh' reaction was tying her power to the Dark Force, revealed at the end. That would *never* be the real (= comics) Ancient One's style.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dormammu -- hmmm. Yes, he's the powerful villain Behind It All, but why just a huge black stony face?? The comics version (a complete humanoid figure, but with a head that's just a ball of flame) worked perfectly well and was plenty scary enough.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Where's Clea??? Can't they bring in Dr. Strange's REAL love interest, and from another dimension no less? oh well, maybe next time.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>and I was really hoping Scott Derickson would go ALL the way to the real, Ditko-esque scenery -- alternate dimensional worlds built of nothing but overlapping geometric shapes extending off into the distance. They did get pretty close, especially in the rapid-fire 'grand tour' that the Ancient One put Stephen Strange through near the beginning. I just wanted more.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, pretty satisfying and a great addition to the Marvel movie universe."
"siderite","9","1","3","20 November 2016"," Marvel does it again
","I had low expectations for this film, yet Marvel did it again and created an almost perfect movie. Where it failed, again, was the villain.<br/><br/>My early concerns were easily dispelled (pardon the pun), as after 15 minutes of exposition we got right into the action. Cumberbatch is perfect for the role, even if he is, you know, British. Rachel McAdams is lovely, but her role is so purely supporting that the movie doesn't even try to explain how she immediately adapts to a situation that Strange took several special effects heavy hours to.<br/><br/>In fact, if I was to voice a critique, it's that besides Strange everybody else was purely a supporting character with no other real reason to exist, and that includes Thor in the after credits scene. Tilda Swinton was amazing as the Ancient One, doing with facial expressions what the writers failed to do in her dialogue, but her character is there just to guide and die. Mads Mikkelsen played such a clichéd villain that no matter what he would have tried to do it would have fallen short. Don't start me on the henchmen, that didn't even speak. Every single character in the movie except Strange did not need a name or a backstory.<br/><br/>Other than that the movie was great. Entertaining action, some funny moments, excellent special effects that somehow didn't jar the brain - well, except maybe the overuse of fractal reality - and good acting all around. It presents us with the superhero paradox again, though: why would a powerful sorcerer with access to time manipulation and an infinity of universes care about protecting Earth? My guess is that there is where the Marvel universe will begin to unravel, when they try to balance the various story lines they started which are orders of magnitude of power apart."
"shivamt25","7","1","3","19 November 2016"," Another delight by marvel!
","Doctor strange is, well, strangely different but at the same time, similar to other Marvel movies. It is intriguing and thrilling but at the same time it seems like it is shot in a completely different style. As I said, it is a delight to watch, but gave it a 7 because I expected more. When you have such an elaborate concept on which you can build on, adding the almost perfect star cast why does it feel like that still something is missing? The film failed to thrill me when I expected the most. I was looking for some ""wow"" moment which never came. Even if the movie is good, you need that moment which remains in your mind when you go home after watching it, i think the movie lacks that.<br/><br/>There is no way I would ever blame the star cast for this because these are all my favorites, like McAdams, Ejiofor, Cumberbatch, Swinton etc. All played there part as smoothly as they did in Spotlight, 12 years a slave, Sherlock and (so many good ones for Swinton, but)We need to talk about Kevin, respectively. So, I would totally recommend you to watch this movie, if possible in 3D IMAX, because that is the main pull factor of this one, effects."
"tomgillespie2002","7","1","3","11 November 2016"," Another hit for Marvel
","While the focus for the Marvel Cinematic Universe of late has been on sequels and superhero mash-ups, producer Kevin Feige and his team are more than aware of the heavy roster of iconic crime-fighters which have yet to grace the screen and who fans are crying out to see. Yet they are also clearly wary of the trappings of the origin story; the obligatory introductory movie which must cover how the hero came to be and have him face-off with a bad guy in order to establish their ass-kicking prowess. This was cleverly side-stepped in Captain America: Civil War earlier this year, with Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther both being eased into the universe in somebody else's movie.<br/><br/>But there is one cult favourite that hadn't been given the modern- day treatment by Disney and Marvel Studios, and one who hasn't graced our screens since the unintentionally hilarious 1978 TV movie starring Peter Hotten. Doctor Strange, originally created by a true unsung hero of the comic-book world, Steve Ditko, was a counter- culture favourite in the 1960's for its psychedelic imagery and Eastern mysticism, particularly popular amongst students and Pink Floyd, with the latter incorporating one of Strange's trippy panels onto the cover of their A Saucerful of Secrets album. Strange is probably the most awkward character for Marvel to bring to a mainstream audience, but Marvel don't seem put off by a challenge, especially after they somehow turned five obscure space-travellers into one of their best and most successful movies with Guardians of the Galaxy (2014).<br/><br/>Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a world-renowned neurosurgeon enjoying the life of fast cars, expensive watches and an astronomical ego. After a car accident leaves him with mangled hands and the inability to operate, he pushes away his on-off girlfriend Christine (Rachel McAdams) and heads to Kathmandu in search of a cure. There he finds The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), who opens Strange's eyes to magic and the astral plane, and a group sworn to protect the planet from mystical threats. With defected sorcerer Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and his zealots on the loose trying to open a portal to the dreaded Dark Dimension, Strange studies to perfect the art of magic under the tutelage of fellow sorcerers Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Wong (Benedict Wong).<br/><br/>Scott Derrickson's Doctor Strange ultimately falls pray to the tropes of the origin story, treading similar water to the likes Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger and, especially, Iron Man, but manages to distinguish itself from the others thanks to some truly dazzling imagery. Derrickson, a huge fan of the early comics, stated that most of his inspiration came from one of Ditko's most jaw-dropping drawings, depicting the Sorcerer Supreme standing high above what appears to be multiple dimensions, each defying the laws of physics as we know it. Early on, the arrogant doctor is shoved head-first into a roller-coaster of alternate worlds, and the effect is extraordinary. Like one hell of a good acid trip, Strange receives a mind-f**k of an awakening, as do we. This is the kind of beautiful, hypnotic imagery that CGI was made for, to create something otherwise impossible, not to make a camera appear to glide through a close window.<br/><br/>Marvel have always hit the mark with the casting of their heroes, and Cumberbatch adds incredible charisma to a hero who is, at first anyway, rather loathsome. But Doctor Strange is also backed up by an unbelievable supporting cast of award-winning thesps whose presence ensures that you keep taking the gobbledegook-heavy exposition scenes seriously. Swinton is smiling and playful in a role that usually calls for a stone-faced drill sergeant, and Ejiofor adds dimensions (no pun intended) to a character who has one of the most intriguing arcs in the film, which will be of no surprise to anyone familiar with his comic-book incarnation. Mikkelsen and McAdams also make the most of underwritten roles, with the former especially adding weight to what is another wafer-thin Marvel villain. It really is one of the most impressive line-ups in recent memory, and not just for a superhero movie.<br/><br/>It is, of course, far from perfect. The insistence on staying with the origin formula really do hamper the potential of Doctor Strange, with the teases of the endless worlds left to explore hinting at a crazier, bolder film that could have been, but will hopefully come. Some of the supporting cast are also left hung out to dry, especially Michael Stulhbarg's Dr. Nicomdemus West, whose minuscule screen-time gives the impression that most of his scenes were left on the cutting-room floor. Still, these are gripes in what is otherwise a fantastically entertaining film, packed with action scenes that really are like nothing I've seen before, despite the ill-conceived Inception (2010) comparisons. The film's ongoing box- office success seems to signal a sequel will be inevitable, where I hope Derrickson will be granted permission to really let loose. But for now, this is yet another hit for Marvel."
"anilmobi","7","1","3","16 November 2016"," Into the strange world
","The movie on whole is good but could have been better. I think, the buildup from a person seeking cure for his trembling fingers to transformation of a superhero could have handled much more elegantly.<br/><br/>Firstly, for a movie of this kind, the whole point of an ordinary person moving into shoes of a superhero is the key, in my opinion. But this has been shown in a hurry and it is difficult for the audience to relate to. The second point is , in a single flash the lead actor gets his magical power without much effort. There is not much struggle to attain these powers. Finally, there are too much of multi- dimensions and , if the same story interwoven with the real world, could have been much more interesting.<br/><br/>In summary, you don't feel bored, but it could have been better. A wonderful opportunity wasted."
"ChaWiFu","7","1","3","14 November 2016"," Slow start, overly long dialogue sequences and CG overkill
","To date, I will say this is the first real miss in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I rate the movie a 6.5. Some movies will get rounded down from 6.5 to a 6 when I have to rate it on IMDb, other's get rounded up. Doctor Strange get's the benefit of the round up. It wasn't bad, but it does have some substantial flaws. Some of the flaws are in the story, but this review won't go over those.<br/><br/>Initially I was put off a bit by Benedict Cumberbatch's generic American accent. He did a fine job, it was just a bit distracting. I don't know if comic book fans would have cared about a transplanted Englishman in America being Doctor Strange or not, but having the quintessential English actor work his mouth around Americanized English kept pulling me out of the story. It was as if this thought kept occurring: ""He sounds really American right now. But he isn't."" <br/><br/>The good doctor's background is slow to develop. We spend a bit too long finding out how great a neurosurgeon he is and how awesome his own intellect is and how shallow he is and how obsessed he is with his own health. Iron Man did it better and kept the story moving at a good pace.<br/><br/>There were also long sections of expositional dialogue that could have been shortened. During these long sequences in the theater I would find myself no longer engaged and wishing for the FFWD button on the remote.<br/><br/>The CG effects were a 3D animator's dream and a movie watcher's nightmare. Realizing the comic was based on the interest in mysticism and drug use one has to expect some *interesting* sequences.<br/><br/>This movie put too much emphasis on the psychedelic ""kaleidoscope"" effect, especially considering the movie only mentions drugs in passing. As seen in movie previews we get hand-to-hand combat in the middle of the kaleidoscoping city, hand-to-hand again in a kaleidoscoping ""arena"", kaleidoscoping again when Kaecilius learns his new power and so on.<br/><br/>It was almost dizzying at first, in an awesome, visually arresting way. The viewer feels pulled into this tunnel of never ending movement and we search for some sense of ""correctness"". The characters both struggle and triumph in the ever changing landscape.<br/><br/>Other ""trippy"" sequences are also injected where they weren't needed with Doctor Strange falling through a dreamlike series of CG animated colors and kaleidoscoping shapes.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses and these effects are constantly being used, and used to excessive length, it becomes visual overkill. It is another distraction that keeps the viewer from being fully engaged.<br/><br/>I left the theater thinking the movie was just ""ok"". It did not live up to my hopes and Marvel expectations."

","Doctor Strange me too surprising, admit that the movie was based on comic I least expected it, the more I found it very good, the cast is impeccable, Benedict Cumberbatch always excellent, Chiwetel Ejiofor well, Tilda Swinton who was very critical because making a character that is masculine in HQ, she sent well, Mads Mikkelsen even being great, your character as well as most of this cinematic universe of Marvel, he is barely tapped, plus at least is better than many, Rachel McAdams for many was ill taken advantage of, I already think your character appeared enough, and Scott Derrickson that was super criticized for not having a movie good curriculum, made an excellent direction, the look of the film is quite psychedelic, and confusing until you can leave the person to fool more in terms of visual effects the movie is the best of the year in my opinion, most still have Star Wars Rogue One, the script has some problems and the film has some unnecessary jokes breaking a little more Doctor climate Strange is without doubt one of the best 2016 films, has good moments of action and humor, even some misplaced jokes, an incredible look, great cast and excellent direction.

With a forgettable villain who must be stopped before he gives our reality to Dormamu. I like the writers they have made stuff I like before and they wrote a pretty decent origin story action packed good vs evil story. But we've seen so many it's like ugh huh. And I'm pretty sure they changed Rachal McAdams character because from what I remember her name is Clea not Christine For an story tale that's representing its source material on the big screen it succeeds for originality it doesn't it's like Iron Man but with magic and a bit of Batman Begins. The Visuals are astounding and the acting is top notch. But aside from that I really loved watching the mystical spectacle that is Doctor Strange.

"filmsbyq","7","1","3","13 November 2016"," Doctor Strange - nice addition
","A difficult character to brought to life, plus a better villain/antagonist than most Marvel films, makes Doctor Strange a joy. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Stephen Strange, a brilliant, egotistical, neurosurgeon whose hands are irreparably damaged in a car crash. Though he loses no fingers, the nerve damage to his hands is so severe, he is unable to carry on as an elite neurosurgeon. Desperate to regain his status as a highly renowned neurosurgeon, Strange uses all of his connections and resources in an effort to regain his ability to operate.<br/><br/>When all conventional avenues are exhausted, Strange finds himself seeking more obscure solutions. As options rapidly disappear, he hears of a man who through some secret method, regains the ability to walk. Tracking down the man, he is directed to a mystic in Tibet called The Ancient One. <br/><br/>Strange travels to Tibet and tracks down The Ancient One. When he is shown a world beyond the known realm, he is initially sceptical. Staying on, he learns and accepts that there is more in the world than what he knows. <br/><br/>The school of mysticism at which he resides as he learn the ancient arts, comes under attack from a former student, Kaecilius, played by Mads Mikkelsen. Kaecilius is eager to gain more power, The Ancient One is determined to stop him and, being under her charge, Strange feels honour bound to join the fight. <br/><br/>Directed by Scott Derrickson, a filmmaker more use to helming horror films if his IMDb credits are to be believed, Doctor Strange follows the path of many superhero films before it, with the first act showing the origins. With Doctor Strange being one of the lesser known comic characters, the origin story is a necessary addition in this particular film.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch is perfect as the narcissistic Strange, believably condescending to all who he feels do not meet his professional standards, which is everybody. When he is forced to seek help after his accident, even as he tries to be conciliatory, his disdain for those less talented than he was still shows. <br/><br/>Derrickson's direction of the crash scene is good. Even as you know it is coming, you still feel the enormous significance of the crash as his hands are obviously damaged. He really allows Cumberbatch to act, leaving the camera on his face in the hospital scenes after the crash. <br/><br/>Mads Mikkelson as Kaecilius is a wonderfully understated, though still fearsome adversary. Every time he is on the screen, with his rent-a-hench persons, he brings chaos, leaving you with the sense that there is a real danger. <br/><br/>Though set in the real world, the mystic realms are well done, especially since over the years film-goers have seen every type of special effect in film. The effects in the film, given the premise, are only used sparingly and when necessary, thus not pulling you out of the story. <br/><br/>Though the dialogue is clunky in parts, the quality of the cast, for the most part, carry the film through. Not that that should be a surprise when looking at the cast. Besides the aforementioned Mikkelson and Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Benjamin Bratt also lend their talents to proceedings.<br/><br/>Also in the film, possibly the weakest link, is Rachel McAdams as Christine Palmer, the love interest. McAdams is a serviceable actor, having appeared in many films, usually in quite prominent roles.<br/><br/>It is just that, for me personally, she is an actor who is almost nondescript, generally in roles that had they been taken by another, lesser known actor, would not affect the outcome or quality of the work. With perhaps the exception of Southpaw, she is forgettable in every film she has been in. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange is a pleasant way to spend two hours and is a welcome addition to the MCU."
"sujanfaster","9","1","3","12 November 2016"," A visual MARVEL
","Whenever I write reviews on MARVEL films, I am usually singing praises and Doctor Strange is no strange to this;-) Doctor Strange is the purest example of film with visual effects on point. It is thoroughly entertaining, engaging and overall visually stunning MARVEL masterpiece. It is not your usual MARVEL universe flick but although it might evolve to be one in the future. But this is great more as an independent film. Doctor strange is intelligent, humorous, fast paced and of course I am never tired of mentioning this again and again: visually brilliant.<br/><br/>The story is about the self obsessed genius and rich doctor who meets a fatal accident. Ironically the nerves on his hands don't work the way they used to (I am not sure about the medical terms for this). Hell bent on finding the cure he embarks on a journey to Nepal to find cure via mystic arts which he doesn't believe in. And then the movie suddenly shifts to amazing mode. The supernatural elements kick in with unbelievable visual effects. Then the movie is about how Doctor Strange becomes someone more than he is, learns things that is beyond our mere imagination and helps his guru (The Ancient one) to fight off evil powers who are about to take over the world. The story line may seem quite the usual stuff, but it's the representation that makes this film extraordinary. I personally haven't read the comic books but I am quite sure this film exceeds even the comic book readers' imagination. Action sequences take you to different worlds, time dimensions and whatever you just cannot think of. The MARVEL brand of humour is as usual a success. <br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch couldn't have asked for a better role to be as a MARVEL superhero. Doctor Strange is almost an alter ego of his TV role Sherlock. Tilda Swinton as 'The Ancient One' is pure gold. Her performance makes this film much intense. Chiwetel Ejiofor is one of my favorite actors and he is brilliant as well. Scott Adkins could have been used for much intense action sequences and I also feel the film doesn't do much justice to Mads Mikkelsen's acting talent. Rachel McAdams plays the typical antagonist's love interest or friend whatever who is just there to stay amused like the rest of us. Benedict Wong as Wong has a very funny and engaging role.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is probably the best visual effects movie that I have ever seen. Try not to think much of the visual effects but just watch and enjoy. And please please do see it in IMAX if you have access to an IMAX cinema."
"mohitextreme","9","1","3","8 November 2016"," Magical!
","This movie on the wishlist of every movie-goer (especially Marvel fans) ever since the trailers rolled out on the internet.<br/><br/>Here's a quick review -<br/><br/>Story - Albeit a simple story of a super-villain wanting take over the universe, the presentation saves it from being just another action-adventure flick. The movie moves linearly without any big twists and turns. Honestly, I am a bit disappointed by Hollywood these days; almost every super-hero movie ks based on the exact same theme - super-villain sends powerful guys on the planet to take over the world, a group of guys defend only the major cities like London, Tokyo etc., a talented but arrogant person quickly turns into a superhero and saves the world and promises another sequel to his acts.<br/><br/>Special Effects - The real hero of this movie are its amazing, beautiful and spectacular visuals. There are many mind-bending scenes and they can be best enjoyed when watched in 3D. This is one of those few movies that actually looks better in 3D than in 2D. The visuals somewhat reminded me of Inception but this is on a different level altogether.<br/><br/>Acting - Every single actor played his part well. Rachel McAdams' role was almost useless but she looked good. Benedict Cumberbatch was the star of the show with his amazing dialogue delivery, great one-liners and a beautiful portrayal of doctor-turned-superhero. He simply rocked! <br/><br/>Overall - The movie could have been made at least 20 minutes longer. It felt a little rushed. It is enjoyable from the very beginning till the end and not even a minute of it felt boring. The cinematography is spectacular, the magic sequences are enthralling and there are quite a lot of hair- raising moments! The climax is beautiful and clever!"
"Villamondo","9","1","3","8 November 2016"," Dr. Strange treads his ""venerable"" path with praise-worthy integrity
","As a fan from the original comic book genre version, the Dr. Strange movie did not disappoint me. In fact, I presently think it's the best rendered Marvel comic-to-movie yet. You may recognize references to the Eye of Agamotto, The Living Tribunal, The Wand of Watombi, Dormammu and more. Wong, the original ""man-servent"" of the Ancient One, is here portrayed as a librarian and takes his place as a comrade, as does Mordo, who renounces the path afterwards, which is true to that character's original story arc. But it is Dr. Strange alone who travels the dimensions to confront Dormammu in the climax, fighting to save our world from the dark dimension, as frequently occurred in the original Stan Lee plot template. <br/><br/>Every aspect that moves this from flat, two dimensional comic book story to a slick, special effects, superhero movie is done with finesse and respect for the original story and an adult audience. The humor is always on point. Consider the ""Cloak of Levitation,"" which was a plot contrivance from early on. It faded into being a mundane, yet integral part of the costume after years of the literature, but imagine the neophyte Strange struggling to control it. It actually has a life of it's own, with a fickle affection and it's own ability to kick ass.. in a comical way.. it is just a friggin piece of cloth. A sublime moment of humor arrives when Dr. Strange masters the cloak, pops his collar, and finally announces his character name properly. You see, he egotistically prides himself on his earned ""Doctor"" title. It is initially, repeatedly, and sometimes intentionally, misused as Mister Strange and even Doctor Mister, thwarting Cumberbatch's ""must have"" moment to announce his character (as in ""Bond's the name, James Bond"").<br/><br/>Yes, Dr. Strange, as well-known from his comic book origin story, was an arrogant, egotistical, self-absorbed, narcissistic etc, etc, surgeon (played with smarmy perfection by Cumberbatch, who also nailed it physically.) A tiny fault I would have with the plot is that, as Strange progressed beyond this persona, as would befit his evolution into ""master of the mystic arts"" he would still carry on as a smarmy deliverer of one liners far too far, yet always more laugh-worthy than inciting a groan. Also, hard to believe the self- absorbed famous surgeon would drive so recklessly to cause that automobile accident which precipitated his defining motivation to change his life and seek ""The Ancient One.""<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton nails it as ""The Ancient One"" (my other initial gripe.. The Ancient One was never no chick), helping Strange to overcome that worldly ego and to become a proper Master. Condensing about 10-years of Marvel real-time story plot, the ""venerable"" (they almost always invoked that adjective) Ancient One passes. This was a devastating development in my comic book world, but now a necessary plot contrivance for a movie that must sell the franchise in less than two hours. This does not mean we won't see The (transcended and apparently trans-gendered) Ancient One elsewhere since the Marvel Universe has now officially extended beyond life and death and time.<br/><br/>If you're like me you may have even shed a tear as Stephen Strange makes his pivotal life-choice. He can have the healed surgeon's hands of his quest and return to his normal life as a celebrated surgeon with his nice, and loyal, and fairly tolerant surgeon- girlfriend or he can toil in unacknowledged glory defending the entire world and various other swaths of reality, battling evil in alternate harrowing dimensions. It is the well-worn Buddhist and Christian path of renunciation, but that is not mentioned nor is it important to feeling the poignancy of his choice, as he appears in astral form to guide his girlfriend into saving his life on the surgery table, only to rise from death and tell her, ""sorry babe, I got to go."" <br/><br/>Conjecture with me as Dr. Strange got conceived in the early sixties with Stan Lee, kicking it in the Marvel offices with artist, Steve Ditko (R.I.P.). Gangly Stan would have his feet slung up on the desk, the lone creative writer for ""the Mighty Marvel house of ideas,"" spinning out stories like a spiderman's web into a handful of pulp literature titles by each one's demanding monthly or bi- monthly deadline. He turns on Ditko and proclaims, ""Hey, howzabout a new comic superhero using magic powers."" (This was not a highly original notion and DC comics had ""Dr. Fate"" way back in the ""Golden Age"" as part of ""The Justice Society,"" a precursor to ""The Justice League of America."" Some of those Justice Society characters made appearances in the DC movie, ""The Watchmen."".. but I digress). And then Steve Ditko would have told Stan, ""Let me see what I can do for this magic guy's illustration."" <br/><br/>I have noticed a historical precedent in many great comic book origin stories that the artist earns equal credit with the writer (perhaps due to costume design and other character features being extra-significant to graphic media ?) So I wonder, and it's probably easily answered, if Steve Ditko's artwork wasn't a great contributing inspiration to crafting their magic-powered super-guy into an awesome dimension-hopping avatar. The Dr. Strange comic magazines were always visually stunning. Early stories would include references to astral projection, ectoplasmic forms, and spells, which gave the feel of a bonafide venture into mystic and occult possibilities. Mr. Lee always ""did his homework"" out of respect for the intelligence of his readers, and he garnered legions, young and old alike.<br/><br/>This is what made Dr. Strange so appealing. All comic book stories stimulate the imagination and tell epic tales of heroism and good vs. evil, but Dr. Strange was out to mess with your mind and extend the boundaries of your reality. I would say of the movie as well, ""Mission Accomplished."""
"christineyoon","9","1","3","8 November 2016"," Doctor Strange - A Visual Adventure Through the Mystic Arts
","In Marvel's plan to release feature films about relatively unknown, individual superheroes—such as Ant-Man and Deadpool—it succeeds again with Doctor Strange, introducing the mystic arts and the spirit into the modern superhero film. Once again, Marvel changes the archetypal ""hero"", with an unprecedented origin story and a new set of superpowers, other than the typical super strength and iron suits that we are used to in other superhero movies. Doctor Strange takes a look into the life of a brilliant and wealthy neurosurgeon. In the operating room—reminiscent of Grey's Anatomy—Dr. Stephen Strange was the central individual, the surgeon performing the delicate, life-saving surgery on the brain. He was pompously easygoing, knowing that he was remarkably intelligent. Outside of the OR, Dr. Strange lived affluently, with an extravagant penthouse, luxurious car, and expensive belongings. In addition, he maintained a steady relationship with his girlfriend, Dr. Christine Palmer. His career as an accomplished neurosurgeon was cut short after a severe car accident, as he lost control of his hands. For months, Dr. Strange looked for a surgical cures from around the world, undergoing several operations, only to spend all of his money and lose his relationship with Dr. Palmer. Desperate, and with nothing else to lose, Dr. Strange finally turned to the spiritual answer for his tremble in Nepal, where he found the Ancient One, a master of the mystic arts. His arrogant attitude shown through, as he was incredulous of the existence of the mystic arts. However, after a demonstration by the Ancient One, Dr. Strange realized that he knew nothing, and he entered the school for the mystic arts, learning from the Ancient One and Mordo, a sorcerer. Dr. Strange, an intelligent man, was able to pick up the mystic arts quickly by reading books and self-teaching. However, he quickly discovered the dangers revolved around the mystic arts, the villainous sorcerers. Kaecilius was a sorcerer who learned from the Ancient One, but became corrupted by ambition. He sought out Dormammu, a powerful villain who wanted to consume the universe containing Earth, and learned to manipulate reality. The Ancient One, protector of the Earth, passed on her duty to Dr. Strange, now a gifted sorcerer. He was fiercely reluctant, as he turned to her just to fix his tremble so that he could return to his work. However, he realized his situation and his new power, and with Mordo and another sorcerer, Wong, they fought for the maintenance of their Earth. Dr. Strange finally defeated Dormammu with the manipulation of time, but he was still left with protecting the Earth from future threats. Director Scott Derrickson contributes to the strength of the comic book film, as ""Doctor Strange"" leaves audiences in awe and wonder for a new superhero.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is bolstered by its strong cast members, including Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange), Rachel McAdams (Christine Palmer), Chiwetel Ejiofor (Mordo), Tilda Swinton (The Ancient One), Mads Mikkelson (Kaecilius), and Benedict Wong (Wong). It reintroduces the concept of the multiverse, or multiple universes, with the character Dormammu, a consumer of universes. The multiverse is significant in the Marvel Comics Universe as it allows a fluency between films and shows how each film is connected and why some films are in ""parallel"" universes.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange has been praised for its introduction of Eastern concepts and mysticism and its outstanding visuals. It draws a parallel with Inception's dreamscapes and the complex, rotating landscape, but in a larger scale. The reality manipulation by the Ancient One and Kaecilius is mind-boggling yet eye-opening, setting a new bar for the capabilities of computer-generated imaging (CGI). The film has been described as ""mind-tripping"" and an ""eye spectacle"" for its wondrous CGI. In addition, the film draws strength in its originality; moviegoers are not used to the superhero of spiritual practice. On the other hand, critics draw a negative with the CGI, calling the film overly-convoluted and its lack of originality in its main story. Doctor Strange is an artistic and entertaining film, with its confusing CGI and impressive actors. It successfully continues the high standard for the line of new Marvel characters after Ant-Man and Deadpool and before the films with Black Panther. With the casting of Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Marvel Comics may continue a new trend of allowing women to take up male roles and give them new opportunities to take part in the action and change the image of the powerful superhero. Today, characters such as Black Widow and Scarlet Witch show that women can play superheroes, yet Marvel doesn't do much justice giving characters such as Captain America and Iron Man most of the spotlight, making the women a step lower from the male superheroes. In addition, in Marvel's plan to release movies centered around individual superheroes, women have never played the title role (besides Electra, which turned out a flop); the first one with a female lead, Captain Marvel, will be released in 2018. Swinton's portrayal as the Ancient One, while changing the standard for comic-book films, is also a negative in its use of a white actor for an Asian character, revealing the intents of the film industry. To prevent losing the Chinese audience, Derrickson hired a white actor, Swinton, to play the Ancient One as a white character rather than a Tibetan one. In other words, the Ancient One was changed to be a Western character studying Eastern mysticism, instead of its originally Tibetan character. For Asian actors, this becomes a missed opportunity in a field where Asians have difficulty finding roles in entertainment."
"Screen_Blitz","9","1","3","8 November 2016"," Gleaming with astounding visuals and storytelling, Doctor Strange makes for a swell Marvel outing
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been boosting its numbers at the box office and fandom for almost a decade, and simply because it has made a landmark home for adventurous superhero action-packed spectacles for die-hard comic book fans; even when the cinematic world introduces them to a lesser-known superhero like Ant Man. This cinematic translation of the mystical superhero Doctor Strange is nothing special in terms of storytelling as a follows a usual origin story of it's titular hero, but it manages to paint a fun, action-filled spectacle with a surprising appealing story along with some of the most eye-popping visual effects of this year (bound for Oscar awards). The film tells the story of Dr. Stephen Strange (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), an arrogant neurosurgeon who is involved in a horrible car accident that causes severe nerve damage in his hands, rendering them completely useless. With his job in the medical field, he travels to a mysterious world overseas known as Kamar-Taj in hopes of finding a treatment to restore his usage in his hands. He instead encounters a bald sorcerer known as the Ancient One (played by Tilda Swinton) and her wizardly accomplices Mordo (played by Chiwetel Eijiofor) and Wong (played by Benedict Wong). With the help of their teachings, he must master the mystical powers and skills to help conquer the threat between the real world and the darkness that lies beyond.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, this is an origin story of the titular hero which has become a common trope throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or for the most of the superhero for that matter. But with the origins of the hero playing the central in the film, director Scott Derrickson manages to cook up a fresh one so compelling, it almost feels original. Doctor Stephen Strange is introduced as a rather unlikable doctor who viewers himself as the sharpest tool in the shed, and is shown to be very arrogant towards his colleagues as well as his former lover Christine (played by Rachel McAdams). Over time, his character develops into a selfless, charismatic hero is willing to set aside his cocky persona to master his mystical skills and destroy the evil force that threatens the world as we know it. This all comes down to a plethora of adrenaline-fueled action sequences where we witness intoxicating, abstract visual imagery and environments folded and manipulated into complex, mandala-like figures in a fashion that owes physics to Christopher Nolan's 'Inception'. The visuals may triumph over the storytelling, but it's not to say the plot doesn't deliver nor does Benedict Cumberbatch in the role as the titular hero; though his attempts at comic relief come off a bit dull more than not. The same can said for his co-stars Tilda Swinton, Benedict Wong, and Chiwetel Eijiofor who do nothing short of a worthy job.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is a gleaming superhero spectacle that gracefully introduces a new hero to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and pumps sheer anticipation for fans everywhere see him make an appearance in upcoming Marvel outings including a hopeful spot in the Avengers franchise. This film is no groundbreaker in the superhero genre nor in the MCU, but it sure his one that proves worthy."
"griffolyon12","9","1","3","8 November 2016"," Another Success for Marvel
","Marvel continues its hit streak with Doctor Strange, the most peculiar movie to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Guardians of the Galaxy. As far as superheroes go, Doctor Strange is easily one of the more obscure. While many die-hard comic book fans know who Doctor Strange is, the average person doesn't and that was clearly going to be the biggest hurdle for this movie to overcome. As a fanboy who never really read much Doctor Strange, I went into this movie without any preconceived notions of what to expect and was more than satisfied. I believe others who know nothing about Doctor Strange will be as well.<br/><br/>The titular Doctor Strange is a world famous neurosurgeon named Stephen Strange. He is arrogant and exceptionally good at what he does, however when he injures his hands in a car wreck, he can no longer do his job. Strange starts searching the world for a cure, eventually meeting the Ancient One, a sorcerer who trains him in the mystic arts. Throughout the course of Strange's training, he discovers a new purpose for his life and realizes that there are larger things at play in the universe than just himself, placing him upon a path to safeguard Earth from supernatural threats.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about Doctor Strange is how mindblowingly original it is. The action in this movie is not merely two super powered dudes slugging it out, it's not even two wizards casting spells at one another, this is sorcerers warping the realities of time and space with magic. Streets fold in on themselves, portals to other dimensions are opened, and time is manipulated routinely throughout the movie. Then there is arguably the coolest fight sequence of the year when Doctor Strange's astral form does ghost battle with a bad guy's astral form.<br/><br/>Director Scott Derrickson and his screen writing partners, Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, deserve huge kudos for being able to think outside the box. Doctor Strange goes beyond most of the action movie norms to craft action that occasionally has shades of other movies, but cranks it all up to eleven. Of course the biggest kudos should go to Marvel Studios' president and Doctor Strange producer, Kevin Feige. Doctor Strange has long been a passion project for Feige. He saw something in the comic book adventures that many others throughout the years didn't and his determination pays off for the audience.<br/><br/>When you really get right down to it, Doctor Strange is another base hit for Marvel Studios, if not completely a home run due to the usual trappings of superhero origin stories and being part of an interconnected universe of movies. If Sherlock didn't already make Benedict Cumberbatch a mega star, his work as Doctor Strange will. In a great many ways, Cumberbatch almost brings more cheek than Tony Stark, with a little more likability to boot. Then there is Rachel McAdams who is likable as the obligatory love interest, Dr. Christine Palmer. While McAdams essentially plays a role we've seen her do many times over in other movies, she helps further ground Strange's humanity. Rounding out the cast are the likes of Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Baron Mordo, Benedict Wong as Wong, and Madds Mikkelsen as the bad guy, Kaecilius. All play their parts well and further ground the absurdity through their acting. <br/><br/>All in all, Doctor Strange is a fun time at the movies. The movie takes itself seriously enough to make it seem like the stakes matter, and yet it has the good, winking sense of humor of the first two Iron Man movies or Ant-Man to keep the movie feeling light.<br/><br/>I give Doctor Strange a 9 out of 10!"

","I want to start by saying that if you have the chance to see it in IMAX, I would highly recommend it. The visual effects alone are absolutely stunning. A film that I can closely relate it to (visually) is Inception with the effects that look so real that you can't look away. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor Strange to a T. He got the character and physical attributes to near perfection (similar to Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man). The supporting cast of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, and Tilda Swinton are absolutely phenomenal as well. The one thing I can complain about the antagonist of the film, Kaecilius (played by Mads Mikkelsen). He did a decent job playing the character, but he didn't have nearly enough screen time or character development. His portion of the film felt rushed and that he was just there for filler, because ""every hero needs a villain"" type aspect. Overall, I really enjoyed this film and I would recommend it to everyone!"

","First off, Doctor Strange, I believe, is not a regular movie that can be watched in 2D. It must be seen in 3D, preferably in IMAX format. The content and theme of the movie is nothing without its extravagant visual effect that are to be experienced in big screen equipped with 3D/IMAX only.<br/><br/>I would not say such brilliant vfx are done in a Hollywood movie for the first time as Avatar and Avengers movies have already done so. However, the theme itself is like an introduction to movie-goers and it needs such kind of effects to make it understandable to the audiences.<br/><br/>Coming to the main theme of the movie (no spoilers ahead), it's not that nobody is aware of the astronomical theories and philosophies, but it's dramatized visually on screen for the very first time through a fictional character called Doctor Strange via Marvel comics written by Stan Lee (I like his his Cameo describing a mind-bending graphic scene as hilarious) years ago.<br/><br/>Astrophysics is filled with all kinds of marvelous content and theories. If anyone watched these documentaries in Discovery Channel/Netflix would get a good introduction on it. If needed to get realistic (not Sci-Fi) knowledge into this field one can dig-deep into this field by reading the books like A brief history of time by Prof.Hawking.<br/><br/>The famous of all is the Multi-verse theory which explains that parallel to our infinitely expanding universe (consisting of billions of galaxies and nebulae) there are infinitely many other universes. Of course, they are not visible to us as they exist in different dimensions. In all these multiple universes, there are beings exactly like us which do other things which are not done by us in this universe but are left out in the process of choice-making. That's just a theory :)<br/><br/>The main protagonist Dr.Strange (as he calls himself but others weirdly call him Mr.Strange, Dr.Mister), a neurosurgeon, meets with a ghastly road accident and left bed-ridden for several weeks before heading to Nepal for seeking real cure only to find more that what he expected. Apparently, a secret society formed by multi-race individuals in Nepal who call themselves mystical protectors (as opposed to Avengers who protect earth from physical threats) guarding the three nodes (Geometrically formed in a triangular manner in London, New York, and Hong Kong) shielding earth from mystical threats coming from deep- universe in the form of cosmic radiation (appearing in human form) etc. They apparently have metaphysical abilities to maneuver time in terms of freezing, going back-and-forth in it, and bending space-time (as Einstein proposed in his famous general theory of relativity that the all astronomical bodies in universe bend spacetime fabric causing a curvature or dent in it which is nothing but gravity that Newton earlier defined it simply as a force between two bodies of mass) jumping to anywhere in the universe instantaneously (unlike Superman flying), and astro-projecting themselves. Ultimately, how Dr.Strange takes on the evil forces to save our world forms the crux of the story.<br/><br/>Philosophically speaking, there was so much scope to it but apparently is lacking in the story-line. It's said that if the trainee in question surrenders himself completely, then he could project his astro-self into different dimensions and can have infinite perception (that a normal being cannot perceive with his five senses) not to mention the instantaneous spacetime-travel by free-will. This would support the myth of reincarnation that any living being continually lives on even after death but in other dimensions of this multiverse.<br/><br/>Mostly, some mythical and relativity theories with some fiction added to it are dramatized in this fantastic movie.<br/><br/>It's a must-watch for all ages. I am looking forward to its sequels including Avengers -Infinity War in which Dr.Strange will be pitted against Iron Man.<br/><br/>All in all it's a mind-bending experience and the best Marvel movie yet. I would rate it 9.5 out of 10."

","His comics were lifted straight from the page and onto the screen.Will Marvel ever fail?After pulling such weird concepts like this movie,Ant-Man,and Guardians of the Galaxy,I'm not sure.First,the good,the characters,they are entertaining,and well acted.The score is great and the cinematography is fantastic.The humor,while it may be a little cheesy,it works,the characters know that the world they're in is slightly stupid,and they except that.The villain,I've heard people say he was generic,but he is better than most villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I like the fact that it is more violent than the previous films,after all they have to try new things.The best part though,the action,it is very creative,and visually stunning,my jaw dropped at least once in the theater.Even if most are just simple fist fights with magic,they are expertly choreographed.But the movie isn't perfect,now,the cons.I thought that their should've been a little bit less exposition,and the villain could've been fleshed out a bit more.And although it didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie,the tonal shifts were pretty noticeable,just when their's a dark scene,the next one is lighthearted.Doctor Strange is another home run for Marvel,though it has a few flaws."
"mr-sudhanshushekhar","9","1","3","6 November 2016"," Surely It Is Future Of Marvel Movies But Actress' Talents Feel Wasted
","The MCU's gender problems linger in Strangeâ€”Rachel McAdams' talents feel wasted playing Strange's love interest, and the movie fails the Bechdel Test in spectacular fashion. But the dominant fear for the universe's Borg-like expansion is how it will continue to add more characters to an already crowded stable. Doctor Strange has memorable, complex characters and action sequences, along with a visual style that sets it apart from the previous 13 Marvel films. If its many team-up movies start to sag under the weight of gratuitous crossovers, at least the studio knows it can do origin stories right. While it's not the action adventure debut some may have been hoping for, Rachel McAdams' role in Doctor Strange does sound like it's fully within her wheelhouse. Presumably, McAdams' professional colleague to Cumberbatch's cocky surgeon would serve as an emotional counterbalance to the awesome powers that Stephen Strange will be dealing with the consequences of in his initial outing. In terms of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, if Doctor Strange is an analogue to Iron Man, then McAdams could be the Pepper Potts in the equation. Of course, seeing as Ant-Man kind of felt like a little bit of an Iron Man retread, those in charge are probably avoiding sharing too many story beats with the already established MCU canon at all costs."

"DTHCinema","9","1","3","5 November 2016"," Imaginative and Unique
","Before I start this review, let me just say I'm sorry if I don't call everything it's proper name because I'm usually terrible at remembering stuff like that.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange was a movie that I had no idea what to think going in. The trailer was interesting but nothing spectacular and I knew virtually nothing about the character. By the end, I was astounded by how great this movie was and it may be one of my favorite MCU movies to date. <br/><br/>The movie's plot goes as such, Steven Strange, a very wealthy esteemed doctor, gets into a car crash which makes his hands basically unusable. After long amounts of time of trying to find a way to fix them, he finds a temple of sorts filled with sorcerers who tell him that they can fix his hands by teaching him there magical powers. He spends a very long time there training until a bigger threat comes that he and the rest of them have to stop. <br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch does a great job playing Doctor Strange and does an excellent job at progressively being less of jerk throughout the movie and is great considering you spend 90% of the movie with him. The rest of the cast does a good job for what they need to do such as The Ancient One and Wong. While the villain isn't very memorable like most Marvel villains (heck I don't even remember his name), it doesn't hurt this film nearly as much as a lot of other Marvel movies because the movie doesn't rely on the villain too much. Although I will say the final threat in the movie does look kind of stupid<br/><br/>The action and effects in this movie are phenomenal. All the action scenes are great and never overstay there welcome. As many have mentioned, seeing the buildings collide and the sorcerer's using there weird orange portals and weapons is always a treat to see. Also a lot of the spells they use are really cool such as the time bending backwards, the moving cape, and much more.<br/><br/>The pacing of this movie is also done very well, it wastes no time getting to his origin story and although the movie is 2 hours and 10 minutes, I didn't feel like it was overly long (unlike Civil War). I also like how they went about how Strange learns the magic over time and it isn't just done in one quick montage.<br/><br/>The tone and style of this movie is also one big reason why I love this movie so much. The problem I have with a lot of the Marvel movies is the sameness in how they go about (such as Ant-Man and the Thor movies). I honestly appreciate that they didn't overuse the humor in this movie. While there are still a decent amount of jokes which are well timed, such as the ending fight, the cape gag, and the Beyonce joke, it's mostly done pretty seriously which is nice change of pace. While I know some people may not appreciate the learning of spells and all the sorcerer talk, it's personally something I fondly enjoy and if your like me I highly recommend this movie.<br/><br/>I would like to talk about the dark world and how and the Ancient One had been using it. I really did like how they handled it as Strange kid of agreed with the villain at first that it is bad but then realizes she used it too help more people. I also think it is cool to see how Mordo deeply hated what she decided and goes of to do something bad (which is shown in the ending credits). Side note I think the other ending credits scene, the one showing that Doctor Strange will be in Thor: Ragnarok, which I think is cool because I think Doctor Strange's style compliments Thor's style (ya know with the different worlds and all).<br/><br/>In the end, While Doctor Strange isn't perfect I still loved this movie's style, pacing, action, and characters. It's my third favorite MCU movie (only behind Iron Man 1 and Guardians of the Galaxy) and I honestly enjoyed it much more than Civil War. <br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Fantastic!"
"ahmad-zia","9","1","3","5 November 2016"," Strange
","This is one of those movies of the year which I had been looking forward to for a long time. Marvel's Doctor Strange was strange yet unique on many levels. Cumberbatch's performance as strange was everything we could have expected from him. The movie is visually captivating in all ways. I can easily see it winning the Oscar award for Best Visual Effects this year. It could have a shot on the cinematography category too. This multi-realm fantasy film sits comfortably in the top echelon of MCU movies thanks to its ambitious concept and dazzling set pieces, the mind- bending parallel dimensions.the multiple plains of existence with jaw-dropping splendor, the Inception-esque world-shifting of the dark dimension is awe inspiring and the action sequences have been well-written! Something no one would love to miss."
"christhomas-09512","7","1","3","5 November 2016"," The Doctor Is In...
","The MCU's 14th film is quite a marvel...see what I did there? In what is undoubtedly their most visually engrossing film to date, Doctor Strange is a most welcome entry into Marvel's well established superhero stable. <br/><br/>The Pros:<br/><br/>The visual effects, while not perfect, are definitely the movie's strongest selling point. I've seen a lot of comparisons to Inception and yes, there are a few shots and moments that are reminiscent of that particular film's mind bending effects. However, trust me when I say this movie has enough visual flair to stand on its own. It's bright, colorful and overestimulating...but not in a bad way. The acting is pretty strong all around. Cumberbatch's American accent is solid enough and everyone else plays their roles earnestly. The action set pieces are mostly interesting. While some of the fight choreography leaves a bit to be desired, their overall execution definitely departs from the usual superhero beatdowns we're offered. There's a scene near the end that flips the climax on its ear and I think it was a great use of the film's main Macguffin. <br/><br/>The Cons:<br/><br/>While I can't fault Doctor Strange too much for following a tried and true hero formula, the movie does become a bit generic as it goes on. We've seen this story a million times. Granted, the visual storytelling in between the human moments is refreshing, but it isn't compelling enough to elevate the plot. The MCU's signature humor falls a bit flat this time around. There are a few genuine laughs, but the rest seems forced. There's also a problem here that's been consistent throughout the MCU's existence...weak villains. There's a big deal made about both Mads Mikkelsen's character and the real big bad in the movie and by the end, it's child's play. Granted, Mads gets to look cool and do some awesome things, but he's essentially reduced to a henchmen when the climax rolls around and doesn't pose much of a challenge. I will give kudos to the fact the main villain gets defeated in a clever manner, but it's a bit anticlimactic. <br/><br/>So, what's the overall consensus? Definitely go see the movie. While it's nothing new and the effects aren't truly groundbreaking or breathtaking, it plays its cards well enough. There's enough cinematic magic to keep viewers interested and with a few tricks up its sleeve, it sprinkles in just enough flavor to separate itself from some of the pack."
"RLTerry1","9","1","3","4 November 2016"," Doctor Strange, a Truly Multidimensional Experience!
","A perfect blend of stunning visual effects, character development, and even a hint the avant-garde in this strange superhero film of East-meets-West. Unpredictable. That is definitely not a word typically associated with superhero genre movies. Not that the plot was entirely unpredictable, but Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a very Patrick Stewart-esque performance as the neurosurgeon turned mystic Dr. Strange in the film that bares his name. This is a superhero film that strikes a strategic balance between traditional superhero storytelling and social commentary. Not without the trademark explosions and dynamic action sequences, Doctor Strange is clearly concerned with and focuses on the character development of Dr. Strange. In a film that could have so easily rested its laurels upon the innovative, intriguing, and exquisite visual effects, it chose to place more emphasis on the drama between characters. Ordinarily, if you follow my blog, you know that I do not typically write positively about superhero films, with some exceptions such as: Batman Returns, Deadpool, X-Men: Days of Future Past, or Guardians of the Galaxy; however, Marvel/Disney's Doctor Strange was incredibly enjoyable as both a movie AND film (and yes, there is a difference). For those in the audience who perhaps struggle with being self-centered, the plot and character development in Doctor Strange will likely ring true and act as a mirror of how you may actually come across to people; and furthermore, how to break the cycle. Although this is clearly a typical blockbuster movie, there are trace-amounts of many elements often found in art house films in the stylistic way some of the sequences are shot. Doctor Strange, a truly multidimensional experience.<br/><br/>No slow wind up here. Doctor Strange's prologue is a breathtaking array of choreography and a dizzying spectacle of Inception-like folding of matter and energy visual effects. Instead of wondering why or who, the audience will be in sheer amazement at the beauty of it all. Opening with a prologue like this was critically important for this comic book icon that many had not heard of prior to the announcement of the movie ('many' as in those who are unfamiliar with the comics). Director Scott Derrickson (Exorcism of Emily Rose and Sinister) has clearly approached the Marvel universe from a different direction that most others, and it shows just how perfect a decision it was of Marvel/Disney to select him for the job. Although I was greatly impressed with the visual effects and fight choreography, I was worried that I was going to need to take a dramamine to make it through the majority of the movie. But then, it happened. A veritable bait-and-switch. From an action-packed Matrix-y sequence through a view of Manhattan as seen through a kaleidoscope of shapes and distortions to an operating table, I did not know the direction this film was going. Perfect. So often superhero movies are basic--fun--but basic. I also appreciated the humorous juxtaposition between the seriousness of surgery against the backdrop of late 1970's rock music. Just within the first few minutes of this film, I was convince that this movie was going to be unconventional but strangely enjoyable.<br/><br/>Such a great cast! Part of the success of any movie is the cast and the respective roles they deliver. Not merely selected for their respective appearances, the main cast of Doctor Strange each brings a unique blend of talent into the mix. Cumberbatch plays an eccentric ego-maniacal self-centered high on himself doctor extremely well. So well that his development was quite convincing on his journey from selfishness to selflessness. Playing opposite him most of the movie is Tilda Swinton (Wes Anderson veteran actress seen in movies such as The Grand Budapest Hotel, Moonrise Kingdom, and more recently in the Cohen brothers' Hail, Caesar!) as the Ancient One. She provides the ideal counterbalance to Strange's over-inflated ego. Difficult to read, I was never quite sure which team she was on, and you'll have to watch the movie to find out. Her performance was dynamic and convincing. Cast in the role of spurned lover Dr. Christine Palmer, Rachel McAdams does her McAdams thing so incredibly well. I also greatly appreciate how even when dressed in hospital scrubs she still graces the screen with her beauty. She may have bet spurned by Strange, but she gives it right back to him. Each and every member of the principle and supporting cast truly contributed to the success of the storytelling in this film.<br/><br/>At the core of this film is solid writing. The characters are multidimensional and the writing contains a bountiful buffet of bright, brisk entertainment that typically seems to do justice to the feel of the comics. Not saying the all the Marvel Movies (whether Disney or Fox) are better comic book adaptations than D.C. (Warner Bros), but they operate on a tried and true method of delivering a visually driven story that appeals to general audiences. Due to the fact that Doctor Strange and other Marvel movies DO rely up on tried and true methods of cinematic storytelling, there is little to no risk for the production and distribution companies. On that note, the D.C. movies are typically more edgy and riskier. Despite the rather dark plot of Doctor Strange, there is sufficient humor here and there to keep the audience from entering into a stagnate emotional state.<br/><br/>Whether you are familiar with the comic book series Doctor Strange or not, this is definitely a movie and film worth watching. Even if you have not seen the other Marvel movies (which is doubtful but possible), you can watch this one and not feel lost at all. That is likely due to the fact that Disney/Marvel knew that most people were unfamiliar with this character and needed to be introduced to him and his universe. If you're into innovative visual effects, then you will be in awe at the effects and editing of Doctor Strange as well."
"Jerghal","9","1","3","2 November 2016"," The best Marvel movie since The Avengers and Guardians!
","I'd never heard of Doctor Strange, but neither did I know Ant-man or even Thor before they made movies of these comic book characters. Now Marvel has become such a household name and quality label that at this point people will just about watch any Marvel film thats released... ...and they won't be disappointed coz it's REALLY good. The casting of Cumberbatch was brilliant. He has the perfect combination of wittiness, arrogance, charisma and is incredibly likable and has a great sense of comedic timing. They also considered other actors (Keanu Reeves, Jake Gyllenhaal, Joaquin Phoenix, etc) for this role (and Cumberbatch almost had to skip because of his Hamlet play) but the film would not have been the same without Benedict. The film's story takes a bit of time to build Strange's character before it gets to the meat but I found it very well done and didn't feel like it slowed down the movie. Once the action starts we get amazing VFX scenes, I mean it has been a long time (could be since The Matrix came out in 1999) since I've been wowed by VFX, but this film does it! A-level flawless effects work. Made me feel a bit sorry I'd went and saw it in 2D coz those VFX scenes will probably work wondrously well in 3D or IMAX (reviews seem to confirm that). Talking about the Matrix, this film reminded me of it at times. It also has elements from Inception and probably some other films but it never felt like it ripped them off (The Matrix itself 'ripped off' many other classics). At 115 mins Dr. Strange is one of the shorter ones in the MCU but it didn't feel like it needed to be longer. I had a great time with Doctor Strange and I consider it the best since The Avengers film and Guardians of the Galaxy. It has the same light humorous tone and a great cast and awesome visuals. As you might have guessed: HIGHLY recommended!"
"Ingrouille181","7","1","3","1 November 2016"," 7 out of 10 for the Strange Doctor Strange
","Carrying on Marvel Phase 3 we have Doctor Strange, headed by the brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role. Having never read a comic book myself (and I think Doctor Strange would be at the bottom of that list) I was surprised how interesting this movie was in terms of magic and sorcery than the recently released Minecraft movie.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch stars as Dr. Steven Strange who after suffering permanent damage to his hands following a car accident, travels to Nepal to find the Ancient One in hopes of healing himself and getting his life back, eventually discovering that his knowledge and skills can help others in more ways than one against a powerful enemy. When you make a story like that, it may seem by the numbers for a superhero story, but it interested me the same way the first Iron Man film did; a man who loses something deer in his life and finds a new purpose when faced with dangerous odds. I like characters like Tony Stark and now Steven Strange because they start off as arrogant and egotistical but learn to hold that back and become selfless for the greater good, and Cumberback excels in that kind of role, and I've seen other films and shows he's been in so this point I can forgive his accent being off in a few points.<br/><br/>I thought the dialogue was mostly believable (especially for the MCU of all places), but I still like the effort Marvel takes to make their films fit into the real world (and that's funny coming from what goes on in Doctor Strange). Some of the sequences in this film, such as when the Ancient One and Strange first meet can be drawn out and distracting, especially if you plan on taking it seriously. The costumes and set design look very good, and Strange's progression from simple robe to full Doctor Strange costume is very impressive; like it came of the page into real life.<br/><br/>But now I want to lay out the problems I had with the film. Doctor Strange was an interesting take on the magical side of Marvel, and even though in Thor we get the message that magic is simply science we don't understand yet, in this film it came off as literal magic, so I was definitely wondering how the other parts of the movie would work out; namely, the structure and story. I understand that most movies follow the same three act structure (the original Star Wars Trilogy being a films length version of that three act structure), and for me, I didn't appreciate it that much having the same structure as a lot of movies these days. I though that, like the magic twists reality, the movie would twist the story, but it all ended up following the same structure; another wash, rinse, repeat.<br/><br/>I want to talk about the main antagonist Kaecilius, played by Mads Mikkelsen. I wont protest any role Mikkelsen is in, the film The Hunt is probably in my top 100 films of all time, but to me, he was a villain wedged between Ultron and the head dark elf from Thor:the dark world; threatening, but forgettable. I'm not sure why he's forgettable, he has enough character development, but some of his scenes I wished he had spent talking to some of the other characters than just jumping into battle with them. There's also Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One. I don't know exactly what it is about her portrayal that didn't click with me, but I don't think she was the right choice for the Ancient One.<br/><br/>I was also looking forward to what Chiwetel Ejiofor would bring to his role, and unfortunately I need to see the next Doctor Strange film to get the full picture. I like all of the serious roles Ejiofor has been in, but I don't think he fit his role either; he just seemed like an actor playing the character rather than the character on screen, and that's a huge disappointment seeing as Cumberbatch gets completely lost inside his character.<br/><br/>So overall, I would still recommend Doctor Strange; it brings a new element to the MCU we haven't seen before. I wanted a film like ""Doctor Strange"" to give me the same experience that films like Scott Pilgrim and Stardust gave me, but it is definitely still worth your time.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","While I am generally tired of Benedict Cumberbabe (as I like to call him), whom plays as the protagonist (Doctor Strange) I was willing to give this movie a try. I liked the beginning meditative part in the mountains where he is beginning to recognize his powers. But then, like all superhero movies these days it became a big battle scene. It gets so complex I have no idea what is happening (I felt the same about the 2013 film Star Trek Into Darkness), who is firing what weapon and what I am watching. For that reason this movie fails big-time.<br/><br/>There's more to justify a rating of 3 out of 10 is needed. For one, it is interesting that Strange studies to learn more knowledge, including from ancient books within a library and the bending of nature's rules. But again, it is like a battle of elite superwarriors, like is the case for every superhero movie. What is the case for the masses? Are they supposed to be saved by these superwarriors? Perhaps they should pay for the damage they caused, like was suggested in one of the superhero movies (I can't remember which one). As one site, tvropes, notes, heroes never get in trouble for destruction or crimes ""as long as they're being heroic.""<br/><br/>With that, I don't have anything else to say about this film, and this movie review has come to a close."

","Doctor Strange began at a slow pace as if it was going to be a medical documentary, which is more or less what the world expected coming into this film.

This was very disappointing due to false advertising. Due to the sudden change of pace from a pleasing medical film into a confusing and intense action film. A positive to take from this movie is a strong meaning of life which Stephen obviously has no concept about due to giving up being a neurosurgeon (27722899.47 Jamaican Dollar Annually) to a superhero (0 Jamaican Dollar Annually)<br/><br/>Overall a promising start with a poor ending"

","What's really great about Doctor Strange is that it allows itself to go into some mind-boggling territory, like the trippy visuals when The Ancient One shows Doctor Strange the vastness of the cosmos. It's a really well- made and engaging film but they could have dared to go a bit further instead of relying too much on the standard Marvel plot devices.<br/><br/>The cloak was pretty cringe worthy and some of the dialogue was hamfisted. Another critique that I have for recent Marvel films is that its characters aren't really that human, they are more or less a foil for the movie's themes. The themes do move along very fine though and Doctor Strange is great entertainment."

","The fabled MCU world is an interesting creation for cinema, and I think the only thing we have it compare to are the Bond films for consistency. Star Trek and Wars are so fragmented now that once around the curve from one series or film to the next, the roads tends to fade away. Marvel, wisely, connects at least this part of the universe together quite well, binding all the titles into one plot. (Fox owns the X-Men of course and the two studios have never been able to craft a co-agreement. They should, that film would be epic, probably 3 hours plus too). So here we have a new entry that opens up new worlds, literally, of reality and being. No specifics here and acting kudos go to one and all. The film is tight and constantly entertaining, action here and humor there. Some of the finest jokes are the smallest of them. It is amazing the laugh you can get out of a collar. Visuals are, of course, the world of computers year again, but so well executed that one is amazed at the complexity of the software behind these fellows burning the midnight oil. There should be a credit for gallons of coffee consumed. This is a beautiful film. Some shots are paintings and more are Escher prints. Small stuff - the new Marvel logo is very impressive, two scenes at the end are keepers and as one reviewer noted, the quiet conversion in the snow at night is memorable. Have a fine evening at the movies my friends. Dr. Strange will return. (Oh, was that Bond?)"
"d-carlyle","9","1","4","11 November 2016"," Top quality Marvel
","Right up with Iron Man as Marvel's best individual origin story and probably just outside their top 5 films in all, beaten out by Guardians, Avengers 1, Civil War, Winter Soldier and the aforementioned Iron Man (not necessarily in that order). Cumberbatch is superb as Strange, fantastically arrogant at the start, then excellently portraying his despair in his brutal fall to rock bottom, then his usual charm and wit as he gains confidence again as he begins to master his new found abilities. He is ably supported by a quality cast. Ejiofor and McAdams make the most of slightly underused roles, Wong is great as Wong, Mikkelsen gives Kaecilius a great sense of menace but also humanity and not a little charm of his own and is in my opinion one of Marvels better villains, though again underused a bit (an extra half an hour could have made this right up there with the best comic book movies of all). But the MVP is Swinton as the Ancient One, which considering the controversy of the so called white washing of the roll is a good thing (but what did they want, the Fu Man Chu type portrayed in the comics). She gives her character a sense of mischievousness and an impish charm instead of the staid wise person you may have expected, and her final scene with strange is both heartbreaking and one of the stand out scenes of the whole film. But of course as everyone who sees this will say, the thing that really raises this film are the visuals. I can't believe how some can dismiss them as having seen similar before in Inception. That is like comparing a toddlers drawing to a Rembrandt. Its not just the way the cityscapes are twisted and transformed, but the way the characters interact with them. And as for the scene where the Ancient One casts Strange through the different dimensions to open his mind, it must be one of the most original, inventive and visually stunning scenes ever projected to a screen. Also the inventiveness of the climactic scenes are something that sets this apart from all of the recent Superhero movies, both in the stunning visuals of having our heroes moving forward through a rewinding world, but also in the way Strange uses his ingenuity and not brute power to overcome his foe."

","Great Movie though.....a little bit boring to my taste cause Benedict Cumberbatch is British after all and he doesn't have fire, he's got British spirit which made the movie pretty serious but not as entertaining as let's say Iron Man movies....I miss that American not give a s*** fire, this movie was all goody goody......not much transformation of his spirit was covered.....no transition was shown in the movie.....they just jumped into his role of Doctor Strange and that's fine but to cover such a transition from an arrogant surgeon to a magical sorcerer requires a bit longer than 1:47. When you add special effects, the movie is great but special effects are an addition like a desert to a great main course and I feel like the main course wasn't served properly in this movie, maybe an extended edition or director's cut of the movie will fill in the blanks for the movie cause this was just too short for my taste and I would love to see extended scenes if there are any..."

Epic spell effects though,every spell rocked on the screen, I even got dizzy for some moment. Funny ""marvel style"" jokes.This could have been a new dark knight like series with actually good dialogues. Still waiting for that! Why can't we have any real emotions dear Marvel?

"aharmas","9","1","4","7 November 2016"," Time Again, Again, and Again.
","Finally a Marvel movie that relies more on character and solid acting than what we have been overexposed to lately. I've enjoyed a lot of the other super heroes, but unlike the Indiana Jones movies, the special effects overpowered the spirit of these stories, the one that made reading those comic books so much fun. Story lines got too complex, heroes were always celebrities more than super stars. We didn't see Ironman; we saw Downey. Yes, the sets, effects, and costumes got more and more impressive, but something was beginning to fade. ""Doctor Strange"" rekindles some of it with the help of some very good talent.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch, who has done with wonders with ""Sherlock"" and Swinton, whose special look makes everything she takes, carry an extra dimension are both perfect as the heart and ""mind"" of the story. Here's a superhero who has plenty of ego to pursue his quest and conquer others. What's more, what happens when he realizes he has the means to manipulate space and time, and propel a very impressive mind to even more powerful levels. It would seem as if this is the one superhero that can solve just about any problem, but there are dangerous forces lurking both inside and outside his immediate surroundings.<br/><br/>Knowledge can be dangerous when coupled with a powerful ego or a misguided dream. Strange soon discovers that there is more to his ability to learn than his photographic mind. Apparently, he has the gift to connect with other mythical forces and at times, defeat them. His adversaries are strong, too, and like him, they have learned to manipulate powers in order to get what they need or want. One thing that is clear from the beginning of the story is that this superhero might not even know what he is supposed to be. His mind pulls him one way while his conscience dictates other paths.<br/><br/>There are key moments and lines in the film that foreshadow his being quite special. He attempts to learn the tools of his new ""career"", and he's told that the tools will choose him when the time is ready, and in one of the best scenes in the film, Strange discovers that he will develop a codependency with his cape. It's one magical moment as he makes it part of his outfit, his uniform, himself. It's Batman and his mask, Superman and that ""S"" on his chest. We're seeing a very strong personality arrive, and we want more and more of him in future films.<br/><br/>In order to captivate us is a pretty impressive display of visual effects. The visuals of cities turning themselves inside out is impressive, but underwhelming since we really don't see much of a purpose there, but there is potential in the ability to combine dimensions and worlds within worlds. There is of course, much pleasure and possibilities when trying to play with the natural laws of time. ""Strange"" doesn't quite miss any steps, playing with this angle. It's quite a moment when ""Strange"" takes the concept of time loops to bargain a deal near the end.<br/><br/>Of course, making use of the dark forces, or simply using it to become more and more powerful will have repercussions. These are not clear, barely hinted at, and at the end of the film, we get hints of what's coming. The rather nebulous exposition in another superhero movie becomes more fascinating, as we see a new alliance being forged, one that could turn the universe upside down if ""Strange"" eventually meets that other dark lord. There's also another preview of what would happen if ""Strange"" faces another of the masters in the future. Both possibilities are quite exciting and make us feel that the Marvel universe will be a more entertaining and imaginative one again. It's time to get away plots that fit more in other genres. We read comics because it's a matter of good versus evil. We're not here to ponder, philosophize or work on a dissertation on the time continuum.<br/><br/>""Strange"" keeps it simple, though the visuals are mind blowing, and the possibilities hints that the game can become more and more challenging. Let is come, as long as its heart beats strong (even if it needs a little jump starting once in a while). ""Strange"" combines both the brain, the mind, and the imagination in magical ways. Just remember magic is not necessarily a good thing."
"sternlicht","9","1","4","7 November 2016"," A mostly excellent film with just one or two flaws
","(Note: I'm trying to go spoiler-free with this review, and have clicked ""spoilers"" just to hedge my bets in case I fail.)<br/><br/>I went into this movie with *very* high expectations; not since 2013's""Pacific Rim"" have I been this excited about a movie. Maybe it's my own fault that I left the theater with a faintly bittersweet feeling. There's nothing *wrong* with the movie at all (save one detail which I'll mention toward the end of this writing); I found it enjoyable on nearly all possible levels. But something very small seemed to be missing. Maybe I'm just spoiled, demanding the impossible and then complaining when the merely extraordinary is delivered. Maybe the film is a slightly more cerebral experience than I'm used to, and failed to deliver as visceral a thrill as I'm used to getting (meaning that it didn't fail, it simply wasn't trying to do the same thing as most movies, and should be lauded for that originality). Maybe the film's remarkably exciting trailer, by showing nearly every one of the most dazzling scenes in the film (with just two major exceptions that I can think of; again, I'll address them shortly), used up so much of my potential ""wow factor"" that I was left with little sense of discovery. Or maybe this flick is a fine illustration of a puzzling phenomenon proposed by YouTube's Nostalgia Critic: the ""So Good It's Bad"" film, whose very perfection dooms it to elude true greatness. Whatever the reason, I was slightly underwhelmed as the eye-popping title card sequence, and the first of the film's two post-credits scenes (a highly amusing exchange which clearly exists to set up the MCU's next entry), were replaced with the utterly prosaic full credits. I spent the time these were rolling largely ""checked out"", reflecting on all that I had just seen. As I mentioned above, if you've seen the trailer, you missed very little of consequence from the actual movie; the opening sets up Doctor Stephen Strange's initial characterization quite ably, and the process of getting him turned into a mystical superhero takes a bit long, but is by no means boring in the process - there's a workmanlike competence to these scenes which isn't exciting, but gets its job done well. A highly unusual fight scene in the middle is one of the signs that this isn't just another superhero flick; one of the few things about the movie which isn't hinted at by the trailer at all, this scene stands out as one of the movie's absolute highlights, lending further credence to my theory that the trailer may have revealed a few too many of the film's mysteries, and thus be partly responsible for my slightly lukewarm feeling as it ended. The other big, impressive scene (which actually did manage to blow my mind a little, while most of the rest left me feeling sadly jaded) is the final confrontation, and you can probably guess who is involved; I won't name the character, just in case you'd prefer to try and be surprised by their eminently predictable inclusion, but I will say that they were *much* better done than I expected, diverging from the relatively underwhelming comic book version into something truly inspired. Without revealing too much, I can say that this moment really tells us who Doc Strange is as a character (""It's *Doctor*"", he would himself insist); the way he deals with his foe is classically fitting for this character, and makes the difference between him and typical superhero fisticuffs eminently clear. (The rest of the movie hedges its bets a little in this regard, but at least they did it right in the place where it really counts.) So like I said, everything was looking great as the credits wrapped up, even manage to amuse me more than a little with something that certainly wasn't meant as a joke. (It's the last line of text on the screen, you can't miss it.) And then came our final glimpse of the film's universe, up until its inevitable sequel. This has the distinction of being, to the best of my recollection, the first time that an end-credits sequence has actually significantly changed my opinion of the movie it's attached to. Without revealing exactly what happens, I can say that it takes something which was very well done earlier in the film, and sours it in a way I found extremely unsatisfying. Given that I suspect my ""less-than-perfect"" verdict, as mentioned above, is largely my own fault and not the movie's, I'd probably have felt comfortable ranking the film as a 10 (since IMDb doesn't allow ""9.5"" as an option). This one scene outright costs the film its tenth star (or 8.6th and up, to be more accurate); I feel that the entire Dr. Strange franchise would have been better off without it. Bottom line, very good movie; perfection eludes it, possibly from a lack of restraint among the marketing team, but more likely because of one poor decision in the vein of ""twist endings"" (which, many of my favorite pop-culture commentators have observed, often were not well thought out, causing problems with the movie as a whole). Absolutely worth your time to see at least once; I advise that you not make the mistake I did, of saving a few bucks on the ticket and watching the normal film. While I cannot comment on the technical quality of the 3D, it would at least have shown me a more impressive version of the scenes I'd already seen in the trailer, so that I'd have spent less time partially tuned out by their familiarity. Given that I was already paying a high ticket price (this was not a cheap theater), $3 would certainly be worth it, for what could be a far more memorable experience."
"nicolechan916","9","1","4","7 November 2016"," Mind-bending
","Benedict Cumberbatch is a great casting choice for Dr. Strange. While I had my doubts as to Cumberbatch's ability to play a 'superhero', his personality and character portrayal fits well into this persona. I do think this isn't a totally accurate representation of the Dr. Strange in the comics, but it is still a good one. McAdams does well in her supporting role, and I am glad they did not give her character a useless role. As well, Swinton is kick-ass as the Ancient One, and her calm demeanor completes her character.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with the casting, is that it tries and fails to be diverse. There's Ejiofor, and Benedict Wong (who plays a character named Wong), and while it is great that these two are in the film, the 'organization' was in Nepal, and I saw no Nepalese characters with a role in the film. Swinton herself is a very white contrast to the supposedly Asian setting. Apart from that, the whole cast did their parts well, and helped to sell this fantasy world. <br/><br/>A major aspect of this film are the creative and mind-bending visuals, producing such complex and intricate designs that are simply baffling. Before watching the film, I read some comments which encouraged watching the 3D/IMAX version of this film, and I gave in. I watched this in ordinary 3D, and while I can't be completely sure, I think it did add to the effect of visuals. There are many manipulations and distortions of reality that are better seen in 3D. Of course, I would have to watch this again in 2D to see if there really was much of a difference. <br/><br/>I would not be at all surprised if Doctor Strange won awards for its visuals and design. The intricate details with vivid colors are really magnificent, and must have taken the visual team ages to complete. Not only that, but the film is heavily invested in visual effects (with the sorcery and what not), and this too is impressive. <br/><br/>The story is presented well, and I liked how it started with the fantasy world, and then transitioned into Strange's 'ordinary' world. The action scenes between the 'real' and the 'fantasy' world complement each other nicely. I've noticed some of the supporting casts (who had no dialogue) are trained in martial arts, and so pretty much make up the stunt team. That's a good way to get fights in...to just have characters acting as muscle. <br/><br/>Anyway, it was a fantastic watch, certain to bring you on a ride to fantasy land. The only complaints I have with the film is the not so diverse cast, and the fact that the almighty dark under-lord did not seem very scary. It was more comical, which I felt could have been made in a darker tone with a more serious ending. This ending was almost childlike - which would fit well in the cartoons like Justice League.<br/><br/>Also, there are two end credits, so make sure you stay till the end if you want to catch it."
"NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954","9","1","4","7 November 2016"," Everything is Getting Magical in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","The Sorcerer Supreme Makes His Big Screen Debut For Marvel!<br/><br/>Can you believe it folks? We have truly come a long way. Can you believe that Doctor Strange is the 14th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? At this point, you would think that some of these Marvel Studio films would get a little predictable, feel a little stale, and seem like there are no other areas to explore. On the other hand, Marvel has been doing a very well job of introducing lesser-known heroes, mixing up the genre, and finding a way to change up there formatting and still stay fresh. Doctor Strange is the 14th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and with films like this, I want to say cheers to another 14. This film is the freshest thing Marvel has done since Guardians of the Galaxy!<br/><br/>Dr. Stephen Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game, Star Trek Into Darkness), is a successful yet arrogant doctor. One night, life changes after a car accident robs him of the use of his hands. When traditional medicine fails him, he looks for healing, and hope, in a mysterious enclave. He quickly learns that the enclave is at the front line of a battle against unseen dark forces bent on destroying reality. Before long, Strange is forced to choose between his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence.<br/><br/>Get Spellbound With Doctor Strange!<br/><br/>For those who may not know who Doctor Strange is, let me drop some quick nerd knowledge on yah. Dr. Strange first popped out of the glorious head of legendary comic book artist Steve Ditko, and comic book legend Stan Lee (a pairing best known for Spider-Man). Dr. Strange appeared in 1963, around the time Harvard fired Timothy Leary and a colleague for conducting experiments with hallucinogens. In interviews, early comic book writer for Dr. Strange Roy Thomas has mentioned that it was trippy visuals, the drugs of the 60s, high on shrooms, hallucinations, Chandu the Magician, Egyptian myths, cosmology, acid, and more that has inspired such a legendary character, that we still love to this day.<br/><br/>Now Doctor Strange may be Marvel's best looking movie, however it is not Marvel's best film. The first thing we have to talk about are the visuals, because this film has some really spectacular visuals. The buildings gnarl and twist like segments of a Rubik's Cube. Balconies become playgrounds, they buckle over and start spinning, threatening to smash down on various characters like a maniacal rolling pin. Gravity flips and shifts with each camera angle as the goons look like inebriated hamsters on a wheel. The basic physics concepts you are used to no longer work in the way you have been taught. It is like watching reality tear itself apart. <br/><br/>The director, Scott Derrickson (Sinister, The Day The Earth Stood Still) has crafted a beautiful world. Filled with color, snazzy visuals, and style. The cinematography is literally some of the best work I have seen out of Marvel. I truly believe that this film could be nominated for visual effects! Similarly, I know many people are comparing the visuals to The Matrix and Inception. Even though it takes inspiration from those films, it is not completely ripping them off. The magic and sorcery are just so enchanting to look at whenever it shows up on screen. I usually like to watch regular 2D movies. On the other hand, I usually would not recommend this but if you can see this movie in 3D you should. This is the type of film you want to see in your face! <br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch is literally a perfect Doctor Strange. He looks just like the character in the comics. He is funny (Doctor Strange likes Beyonce), confused, has intellect, arrogant, and passionate. This character is extremely relatable to a majority of people, and that is why we feel something for the character. Before this film started shooting the rumor going around was Jared Leto, Adrien Brody, and Joaquin Phoenix were all considered for the role. In addition, even though all those actors are extremely talented. I am glad they went with Mr. Cumberbatch. Also, in my opinion Chiwetel Ejiofor (Triple 9, 12 Years A Slave) always performs as if he is wanting to win an Oscar. Every time he is on screen, he gives a spectacular performance. <br/><br/>If You Have Seen Other Superhero Films (Especially Marvel) Doctor Strange Will Come Off Familiar <br/><br/>Once again, my only complaint with Marvel is they rush the origin story and have a somewhat forgettable villain. The villains are getting a little bit more well rounded, however, the villain in this movie played by Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale, Hannibal), and for someone named Mads he comes off a little easy going for a villain. <br/><br/>So these are my final B*tchin' Buddha thoughts on Doctor Strange. It has a very cool character, it is another great adaption in the M.C.U., it has wonderful visuals, and I think most people will enjoy it. I am more than proud to give Doctor Strange a<br/><br/>9 out of 10!<br/><br/>Thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always, and remember don't just get down, but get Boogie. :)"
"ayoreinf","9","1","4","7 November 2016"," Deeper than I expected
","I stated just a short while ago that one doesn't go to see movies in order to learn deep philosophical truth. I still think its true, but that doesn't mean that a good movie, every now and again, can't say something deep and meaningful. You just have to be there watch and listen, it doesn't even have to spoil the fun.<br/><br/>And this movie is fun. It's a visual spectacle, with CG pushed to its limits. With fine acting from the entire cast, having great characters written down for them, and I said more than once - you give good actors well written characters and they can do wonders with it. And here we got Benedict Cumberbatch excelling as the egotistical Dr. Strange, because he was given the best tools to do it. Same is true of Chiwetel Ejiofor who was given in one short film more depth than I ever saw in the comics book, though I must admit I'm not very well versed with this specific comics - I read only two or three Dr Strange issues and most of what I know of the sorcerer supreme stems from his many team ups and from the Defenders. I still appreciate the subtle way in which the script gave depth to all the leading characters.<br/><br/>But most of all I enjoyed the fact that beyond the platitudes that come with the territory of every eastern mystical tale, there was some real depth here, and it was delivered with subtlety, the way it should be delivered. Namely, always remember that most of the time its not about you. Or me for all that matter."

This one was different however, because the character has more dept than the usual Marvel superhero characters. <br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by the little jokes Marvel has in the movie. They are both obvious and less obvious. They toy with previous roles of the actors and even with their own past. Very cool. <br/><br/>The special effects were breath taking. I watched it in 3d and this is definitely recommended. I heard there is even an Imax version out and I figure that is well worth it. <br/><br/>All in all I definitely recommend this movie."

","Dr. Strange is so refreshing for a superhero movie. I'm not saying the superhero genre is getting boring, but it makes the MCU even more interesting. This is a must watch in 3D. Usually I would never go to a film in 3D but its visuals complement 3D so well. Speaking of the visuals, the visuals are breathtaking. It reminds me very much of Inception or The Matrix. Benedict Cumberbatch is great as Stephen Strange, I can't see anyone else playing the sorcerers supreme. Benedict Wong, Tilda Swinton,Rachel McAdams,and Chiwetel Ejiofor give great performances as well. Like all Marvel films, there is a lot of comedy, but in my opinion this is one the funniest Marvel films yet. Mads Mikkelson's Kaecilius is the villain of the film and like every Marvel villain,they do their usual job of a villain and that's about it. The film felt a bit short. I feel like they could've spent more time fleshing the character of Stephen Strange out in the beginning. Other than those, I have no gripes with the movie. This is easily one of the better films in the MCU so far and I cannot wait to see more of this character."

Chiwetel Ejiofor was very strong and mastered his character. What I did not like about it was it was too funny. Some jokes were very unnecessary.

"CANpatbuck3664","9","1","4","6 November 2016"," Doctor Strange Pairs Some Inventive and Visually Stunning Action With Some Excellent Work From Benedict Cumberbatch
","Doctor Strange wasn't as obscure as the Guardians of the Galaxy but the movie remained a risk for Marvel Studios. They brought in a different kind of director, Scott Derrickson has done some good work (Sinister is one of my all time favourite horror movies) but he's an outside-the-box pick for a big budget superhero movie. He's paired up with his writing partner from Sinister C. Robert Cargill and even though the trailer looked good, I didn't really know what to expect from Doctor Strange. What we ended up with was a solidly written origin story with some excellent action and the impeccably well cast Benedict Cumberbatch nailing it as Dr. Stephen Strange.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We join Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) as he's wrapping up surgery. He's in his element, he jokes around with the nurses and strokes his own ego. He bumps into his colleague Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) and she shows him a case from that day. Together they make a unique discovery and rush to stop the doctor attending to his case Dr. Nicodemus West (Michael Stuhlbarg) who was looking to harvest the guy's organs (its assumed the patient is dead). They pull the patient back into the ER and remove a fully formed bullet from his brain. They are able to save his life, which leads to more bragging from Stephen. Christine is willing to play along but backs off when Stephen tries to ask her to accompany him to his speaking engagement that night.<br/><br/>We get a quick look into Stephen's life and he appears to have everything you could ever want. He's got the fancy apartment, the expensive clothes and the beautiful sports car. He's driving to the engagement and turning jobs down left and right over the phone because they aren't hard enough or there isn't enough publicity in it. He's distracted and he gets into an accident in which his car careens down a cliff. He spends many hours in surgery and awakes with Christine at his bedside. She tells him that due to them taking so long to find him, their ability to fix the damaged nerves was compromised. He can no longer operate his hands in the finely tuned way that he needs to do his job. Instead of feeling grateful to be alive, Dr. Strange can't deal with the fact that he's recovering fast enough and has to turn to more extreme means to try and fix his hands and regain control of his gift.<br/><br/>Pretty much every review you're going to read for Doctor Strange is going to begin by talking about the action and the visuals. I'll change it up a little bit and start with the plot. The most popular criticism of the movie is that it's still your typical origin story. I would partially concede this point. Much like another awesome superhero movie that came out this year (Deadpool), the overall arc of the plot isn't revolutionary. But also like Deadpool, how they choose to show it to you is different and this movie has more than enough style and energy to make it it's own thing. They bring in nice little touches like how Dr. Strange is a pretty big @$$^&(#. He's awful to Christine during his recovery and can't set aside his own ego. They give the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) a lot of depth and I really liked the development of the characters. Even Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelson) is relatively understandable, even though the movie continues the Marvel trend of their heroes completely overshadowing their villains. A small criticism is that while the movie has a sense of humour, it's hit or miss and the movie seems to be trying a little too hard at points to be funny. It's a minor misstep, it works well at times but it doesn't 100%.<br/><br/>One of the other things that they do so well at Marvel Studios is that they have a knack for finding the right actors for the right parts. Benedict Cumberbatch knocks it out of the park as Dr. Stephen Strange. Sure, the character is suited to his strengths but he carries this movie effortlessly. There was some controversy around the casting of Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One but I thought she was great. Despite the fact that she's more of an indie star, she stepped into this part with a lot of grace and she was excellent. Rachel McAdams and Chiwetel Ejiofor are great actors and while they both turn in solid performances, I was surprised that they signed up for this. I don't know if their characters matched two actors of their calibre. Benedict Wong was good in his supporting part. I liked Mads Mikkelsen too, he brings a lot of presence to his character and helps to get his motivations across.<br/><br/>I don't want to forget about the biggest reason to go watch this movie. The visuals and the action scenes are really impressive. While some movies can bring new things to the table visually but don't know how to use them to enhance the story, Doctor Strange does that in spades. The action set pieces take place in locations that are constantly changing and introducing new concepts like travelling across parallel universes instantly or teleporting to different locations. The farther out concepts of the source material are harnessed brilliantly and from playing with time to fighting outside characters' physical bodies to creating weapons out of thin air, I was fascinated throughout.<br/><br/>I can't say that Doctor Strange is perfect or is the best Marvel standalone movie (it would be in my top 5), but I felt it lived up to the hype. It works because it tries different things and shows that Marvel Studios isn't about to coast on its previous successes. I hope we get to see Dr. Strange cross over into other movies and get to see a sequel before too long."
"FelipeCarrillo","9","1","4","6 November 2016"," ""Doctor Strange"" Is The Beginning Of The Marvel Cinematic Multiverse
","Stephen Strange performs a spotless debut within giant Marvel Universe, likewise, phase 3 of MCU ventures to new and unknown territories with ""Doctor Strange"". After a provoking ""Civil War"" at the beginning of the year, it was unimaginable to think that another comic from Stan Lee could surpass such strength, unexpectedly, the last spell of 'House of ideas' plunges it fully into new dimensions. Open your mind because ""Doctor Strange"" is the best and most original comic book movie of this year.<br/><br/>He is considered by many as an arrogant and vain Croesus, and by many others as a perfectionist, elitist and talented neurosurgeon in New York; Vincent Strange earns his livelihood based on a transcendental plan: Save lives. However, his strict purpose is distorted by the metaphysical. He is suffocated by his own avarice, opulence and arrogance; a flamboyant car accident brings him to the foothills of the Nepal, in Kathmandu. There, he will have to discern what considered ""real"" in order to carry out a drastic metamorphosis. For this to happen, he has to open his eye, mind and power. His professional purpose still possesses its essence, nonetheless, now he must save the earthly and parallel universe.<br/><br/>The narrative follows the comic-book lines to the letter, originating an origin story devoted to the emblematic style of Steve Ditko, decidedly, omitting the controversial alterations of sex and ethnicity in some characters. Marvel is in charge to design vigorous foundations and motivations for its heroes, and this is no exception. Affinities with Tony Stark are fleeting and overvalued analogies, each character has its unique properties, so the mind of Strange is energetically dissimilar to the Stark.<br/><br/>We have an unusual team behind scenes. Who sits in the director's chair is Scott Derrickson, experienced in horror genre of the decade, with films to his credit as ""Deliver Us from Evil"", ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" or his best film to date, ""Sinister"". This skilled American director, screenwriter and producer demonstrates his extravagant talent within an unspoiled genre; nevertheless, with his qualities in horror movies, it was axiomatic that the psychedelic ""Doctor Strange"" would obtain this excellent result, which has imposed instinctively some touches of horror, either in visual, narrative or musical part.<br/><br/>As for those who took paper and pencil to write the story based on the comics by Lee, are the selfsame Derrickson, C. Robert Cargill and Jon Spaihts, all of them are newcomers into the wonderful world of Marvel. Their unexpected assertiveness and originality with the magic film was a great surprise, considering that it is unachievable to surpass to the incessant and chameleon-like Marvel's winning streak, even more for a group of novices in action movies, however, this reality is one of many and it seems that they came out from one still unknown.<br/><br/>Alliance between Ben Davis' work and Industrial Light & Magic (""Star Wars"") is the main protagonist. Cinematographer Davis dominates the way and tone of Marvel: He shot ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"". But even he outdoes himself peremptorily with the kaleidoscopic revolution of images and colors that spins from a corner to another. The movie rests its potential in the many dimensions that has the concept of one 'reality' and very devoted to the style impregnated in Ditko's comics, Davis and ILM created the impossible, a step beyond in visual effects, of course, supported by a visionary technology by IMAX. Although it possesses similitude with the dream world of Christopher Nolan and complexes and reflexive paintings of M. C. Escher, enjoys of enough innovation and originality on the idea that wants to project; still it must take borrowed elements from other arts, the important is that they have designed their own masterpiece.<br/><br/>If Marvel needs to change the sexuality and ethnicity of its heroes to get impeccable performances like these, they do it. Astral and tangible world of the film revolves around the main role of story, a round of applause to the nominated for one Oscar award, Benedict Cumberbatch. The British actor has stolen the heart of million people with ""Sherlock"" of BBC, and arrives again with intentions of repeat his trick. Capturing esotericism and complexity of Strange's life, this experienced theater actor enchants the screen with a role full of assertive decisions: funny, strong, but primarily, all a sorcerer. Cumberbatch could be the replacement to Downey Jr in the near future. Swinton, Mikkelsen, McAdams and Ejiofor are a legion of actors that go beyond loyal and outstanding interpretations, and it was no wonder, the best film must have the more professional actors, it should be noted that we appreciate their performances, not their characters (villain).<br/><br/>It has not reminiscences with ""Iron Man"" or ""Guardians"" at all, ""Doctor Strange"" enjoys to be the most elegant and sophisticated origin story of Marvel. It is the first film with the flamboyant and perfect opening credits, takes advantage of its potential in cinematography, is an evident breakthrough in the soundtracks of superhero movies with Michael Giacchino, has a splendid introduction of the cloak of levitation, a surprising direction, and a magical performances and seductive action sequences in the hands of the actors of more popularity of the modern Hollywood. Marvel ends its phase 3 of 2016 at the top, leaving doors open to a universe that is ready to be explored."
"balyan-rahul","9","1","4","6 November 2016"," Eastern mysticism wrapped in a spectacular super-hero story
","Highly entertaining, and has many layers to the story. There is a spiritual depth to it, and the visualization of eastern mysticism is extraordinary. It has just the right amount of humour and cynicism to make it palatable to the uninitiated without losing the core message.<br/><br/>The weakest link is the forced fitment of the other marvel heroes. Even though it is a small integration, it takes away from the core story-line. It felt like the film makers were themselves taken over by the dark side giving-in to their fears and greed, not something Dr strange would recommend himself.<br/><br/>Barring that, go for it... two thumbs up."
"Micah-js22","Null","1","4","5 November 2016"," Engaging origin story with good visuals and Benedict Cumberbatch's charisma.
","Bottom Line: This movie has a ton of things going for it! Its take on the genre is pretty fresh and it goes deeper in to personal struggle than most superhero movies do. There are parts where the narrative gets rocky, but Benedict Cumberbatch has charisma in spades to get the movie through the rough spots. The movie also goes all out on visual effects which can be the its strongest and weakest asset. The visual splendor creates some mind bending action scenes and add vivid detail to the mystic world of spell-casters that Strange inhabits. But sometimes it feels like the movie is more concerned with stunning visuals than it is with developing some key supporting characters (like Mads Mikkelsen's Kaecilus and Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo) that would have made it great. <br/><br/>Notes<br/><br/>-Although Benedict Cumberbatch has played plenty of genius characters in the past this still feels like new ground for him because no previous role has required him to be as emotionally vulnerable as this one. The movie does not hesitate to frequently knock Strange off of the pedestal of his genius, which gives him more depth then you would expect. This movie makes Cumberbatch more vulnerable in its first 30 minutes than BBC's Sherlock has dared to make him in three seasons of television. <br/><br/>-Although some of Strange's one-liners occasionally got a chuckle out of me, I could have done without them. Part of my hesitation to score Marvel movies highly comes from the fact that they all sort of feel the same. This movie is one of the few that's able to separate itself with its own unique vibe, and the only thing that breaks that immersion is the witty- but-disposable sense of humor so common in the Marvel cannon. (I know this a huge nitpick and 99.9% of people who will watch the movie won't care about this, but it took me out of the movie a bit in some parts so I thought it was worth noting)<br/><br/>-I think more would have been less in the case of the subplot with Rachel McAdams. It all resonated fine and it wasn't corny or anything, but I think putting the time spent on that into other areas would have more immediately benefited the movie. <br/><br/>-Most of the time dealing with supernatural or mystical can make a movie feel slightly derivative at best, and painfully preachy at worst. Not the case here! Doctor Strange is able to use its remarkable visuals and well timed jabs at clichés of movies that deal with these themes to give the movie a fresh take on people with magical powers. Possibly the first to do that on the big screen since the Harry Potter series. <br/><br/>-This movie is able to shake off a lot of problems common in superhero origin movies, but the unremarkable villain is not one of them. Mads Mikkelson struggles to find anything to do in the utterly generic character he is given. His backstory is one that's a cliché at this point, his dialog doesn't sparkle with any with or personality, and he isn't even particularly interesting in fight scenes. <br/><br/>-I would be remiss not to mention the action scenes which make full use of the movie's massive special effect budget. I can't compare them to Inception (apperently the most obvious influence to the visual style) because I haven't seen Inception. But to me it was a welcome inventive approach to comic book action. The way the scene twist and bends around provides unique perspectives and open up a lot of opportunity to make inventive use of character's mystical powers. Again I thought the effects were somewhat overused. At times it felt like the were using them just to make a spectacle and not to help the story. But after the movie I felt like doing improvised fake fights in the backyard with my brother so suffice it to say it did its job pretty well. <br/><br/>-Here's a moment that I thought was really clever and well-executed. Shortly after Strange gains the cloak of levitation and finally seems to fully realize his powers. He makes a mistake in battle that causes him and his partner to straight up run for their lives for the next five minutes. Following a scene where we see how much Strange has grown as a character, followed directly by a reminder of how far he has to go still was very impactful for me. <br/><br/>-Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo got short changed in terms of development. Which I wouldn't mind much if it weren't for the fact that the movie relies on him and Strange's relationship a lot in the last act and it sort of falls flat because they simply don't have enough screen time together to develop the necessary chemistry to make it work. Cumberbatch and Ejiofor are both great actors though so they sort of make it work in spite of all that. <br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW<br/><br/>-Usually deaths of mentor figures in origin movies fall flat for me. I always see them coming from a stones throw away and it's been done so many times before that it's a cliché. But the death of The Aincent One really took me by surprise with how impactful it was. The mystique surrounding her character made her feel immortal, so it actually kind of caught me off guard. The way it happens is fairly unique and the character is able to wistfully reflect on her life, unlike most death scenes where the character is gasping for the breath to give there last words. Tilda Swinton acts the part very well and her words to Strange are some of the most resonant in the movie."
"Mickey089","9","1","4","5 November 2016"," Visually the best, acting by a mile the best in a marvel movie
","Visually wise easily the best marvel movie so far. Breathtaking effects. Actually one might wonder what they were smoking to come up with such weird fab pictures ;-) Loved it. From action point-of-view,well that is what you get with such great actors. Cumberbatch, Swinton, Ejiofor and Wong were all fantastic and believable. Haven't seen much from Rachel Adams before, but she did a great job. Mads Mikkelsen as always superb to get the villain both ruthless but misguided across within his limits. Story: here we have to deduct 0.5 as it could have been a bit more unique, instead of the more or less usual origin story with slight twists. Still interesting enough to suit the movie. Another 0.5 I deduct for something the marvel mostly got wrong. The villain. A backstory that is hardly touched and too few scenes to shine, particular with Mads as the actor it could have been awesome. Unfortunately Mavel seems to forget the saying ""the hero is only as good as the baddie"". Overall, a superb movie with great acting and stunning visuals. You only need to look aside with a few flaws and forgive some changes to the original comics the you are up for a ride."
"delimaedvin","1","1","5","9 April 2017"," Dismal Origin Story with Dismal Actors
","Doctor Strange had great potential but failed in doing so. Cumberyawn was not perfectly casted for this role & did not suit the part.The origin story was very meh which is common with origin films, but this one made it obvious it was ""meh"". Villains are the true villain of the Marvel Universe & it seems once again the villain failed to actually behave as a villain."
"thomaseheal-27555","8","1","5","20 November 2016"," A Refreshing and Mind-Bending Picture from Marvel Studios
","I saw ""Doctor Strange"" during it's opening weekend and I was surprised at what followed. I went in knowing almost nothing about this character and the stories around him. I left feeling like I had known this character for years, as Marvel gives the best characterization for the Sorceror Supreme since Tony Stark in the first ""Iron Man"". After a new and awesome ""Marvel Studios"" title card, the mystical adventure starts. This picture is the most unique and fun Marvel property since ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". Just like GotG reinvented the blueprint for superhero movies, ""Doctor Strange"" will reinvent how you look at superhero movies. At least it will make you think twice about future Marvel projects.<br/><br/>Recently, I think it's fair to state that Marvel has been going a little overboard with their unique but incredibly enjoyable humor. ""Captain America: Civil War"" brought this back a little and delivered a serious script with welcomed humor as the plot advanced. ""Doctor Strange"" refines this approach even further and every attempt at humor lands with out- loud laughs from the audience. I was actually quite surprised at how serious this movie was right from the get-go, only delivering funny moments thanks to Bennedict Cumberbatch's witty dialogue. That brings me to my next topic: Bennedict Cumberbatch's portrayal.<br/><br/>Bennedict Cumberpatch's portrayal as Stephen Strange will do for his character what Robert Downey Jr. did for his. No one will ever think of anyone but Cumberbatch when they think of Doctor Strange. Before his accident (which was seen in the trailer, no spoilers!), you get a good understanding about who Stephen Strange really is. He's the type of surgeon we all wish would actually exist: A cool, sarcastically funny, and retro- music loving doctor. After the accident however, Stephen completely changes and this is where Cumberpatch's performance really shines. He perfectly captures the desperation of this character that the script was going for.<br/><br/>The villain of the movie, Kaecilius, was quite the conundrum. The audience is introduced to him in the perfect way, with him coming off as a strictly-business type of guy. I had high hopes that this villain would be the best from Marvel since the Winter Soldier in the second Captain America movie, but I ended up disappointed. He's cool and all, but his character lacks the depth that would make him really intriguing and someone the audience would want to see more of.<br/><br/>As far as the other performances go, they are all fine. Nobody really stands out. Rachel McAdams is used sparingly, which actually makes the audience appreciate her screen time. Chiwetel Ejiofor's character, who is more like the sidekick/best friend of Stephen that I wouldn't mind seeing again in a future Marvel project.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Doctor Strange"" is an incredibly enjoyable Marvel Studios Picture that questions how you look at superhero movies and will definitely change how you appreciate them."

","Doctor Strange debuted in Marvel comics Tales of Suspense sharing the magazine with Nick Fury Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. The First few stories were clichéd and uninspiring Then Steve Ditko and Stan Lee expanded the worlds of Doctor Strange. Ditko didn't like Lee and when Lee just handed the story /plots off to Ditko he encouraged Ditko to get inspiration and to do what he did best design strange new worlds that no body could imagine and Ditko did just that. Afterwards Gene Colan took over and expanded it further. Lee was trying to create a world within worlds and that magic was real. Dr.Strange was often described as the acid trip comic of the 60's and That's saying a lot for the 60's <br/><br/>Doctor Strange the movie picks up and expands and improves the comic in areas that were never made clear .<br/><br/>The Basic Story is Doctor Stephen Strange is perhaps the greatest neurosurgeon in the World and he only takes the most challenging cases. Cases that'll bring him glory or money. Then one night Strange is in a car accident and his hands are damaged. he cannot operate ever again and loses his one reason for living.until he learns of the Ancient one and travels to Tibet. He begs and pleads for her to heal him. and then he gets a rude awakening into a bigger universe. Strange learns and studies to be the best and soon he becomes good enough to stumble on a threat to our world. A former student of The Ancient one and his followers are determined to hand this world over to the master of the dark dimension The Dreaded Dormmanu. The problem is they believe Dormmanu will grant them immortality where he just wants to conquer and destroy Earth. Doctor Strange is pulled into the fight and learns there is things that are not about him. And he becomes a hero and eventual Guardian.<br/><br/>The Story isn't bad it could have been better but its still good enough. The Effects are stunning. And the story's pacing is good and steady. The director knows what he's doing and he does it smartly. You feel the movie is progressing in its own time its not rushed and its payoff is a movie that feels natural and its a treat for the eyes.. Maybe the best Marvel has to offer and hopefully a good omen for Marvel's next phase of movies"

"AlexD-412-407746","9","1","5","16 November 2016"," Dr. Strange New Age Power Pails to Power of Christ
","I have now seen the movie. The spirituality of the movie has a Gnostic premise. While it nay help the young see beyond the scientifically arrogant, it falls right in the lap of the New Agers who will probably love the movie. Regrettably, they have no discernment between demons and angels, since demons are angels that appear good and wise.<br/><br/>I grew up on the Dr. Strange comic books and was fascinated by them. Having no religious training, being raised in a scientific/atheist/perverse broken home it did make me aware that some people believed that there was more to creation than meets the eye. The casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange was a good match to the character drawn by Steve Ditko. Likewise the special effects reminded me of both his artwork and several LSD trips I had before I became a Christian.<br/><br/>I also had out of body experiences both as a non-Christian, and as a believer in Christ. After my 1st year of being born again, I had an out of body experience where my body lay in bed, my soul sat up and my spirit was across the room. I was in sin at the time, sleeping with my girlfriend who was asleep next to me. Satan came to me and tried to tell me a prophecy that will never come to pass.<br/><br/>My first year as a believer I was also baptized in the Holy Ghost and had miraculous experiences. At one time I was teleported from one hotel floor to another. I had my arms and legs grow out and adjust to even lengths. But these experiences were either because of a crisis I was in (trapped in a stalled elevator) or because of a need for healing.<br/><br/>Jesus Christ holds the universe together by the power of his faith and word. Demons need people because God made us in His own image, that is being able to believe and speak. In the natural we believe for some project, then speak about how to accomplish that project. In the supernatural we believe the Word of God and we speak into our lives. This is the basis of God moving miraculously in our lives. These miracles occur only according to the will of God, not for our personal pleasure. But it is the medium of faith in God, without doubt, that enables miracles to happen. Miracles are not for everyday use. They are for emergencies. God expects us to live by the natural laws of creation that we already know. This was one good point in the movie. Dr. Strange was told by Mordo that they were to protect and live by the natural laws, even though they were guardians of the multiverse to keep the evil forces out of the earth.<br/><br/>All through history demons have sought people who would help them accomplish their will by getting people to believe their lies and speak those lies. This is the essence of all magic. This movie, as much as I enjoyed it, will most likely be a cult following for New Agers who do not understand that they are willingly yielding their God given ability to believe and speak things into existence to demons. As a word of caution, I say it is a movie that needs a strong Christian world view to watch to avoid the seduction of deception."

Look up the Seven Basic Plots. Arrogant successful man does foolish thing and destroys his health and career. All mainstream treatments fail. Logic, science fail. Man desperate, hears of mystical cure, and pursues it to to exotic foreign country where he meets spiritual gurus who takes him on a magical trip. Then he finds out it's part of an age old struggle of good an evil. Finally he struggles and fights till he finds a new home and a new life. Sounds familiar huh? So what? <br/><br/>It's well done, good acting, good writing, good story. Astounding visuals. See it in 3d for the full experience. The glorious visuals are not tacked on, they are there for a purpose, and serve the story. They trace right back to the comic book as well. They even copied the artistic style. Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect and it's different role for him. All the actors are good, and there are many characters you care about. Marvel continues to blend in humor as well, right in the midst of the action and what could be done dark and gritty. Thank god they don't go there. It's still a very serious and even tragic story, but it celebrates life as well. It's definitely a MCU film but even so has a very fresh feel to it."

","Meet neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange. He is as egocentric as any politician, yet as clever at his job as any detective. The well- acclaimed British actor Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game, Sherlock) takes the stage in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to depict one of the cleverest caped crusaders within the franchise. He is certainly a delight as always, but it's the unusual approach to Doctor Strange that may either paralyze you with amazement or scare you away.<br/><br/>His life at this point is pretty normal: go to work, save a life, have a fight with his nagging coworker/girlfriend played by Academy Award nominee Rachel McAdams (Midnight in Paris, Spotlight), cherry pick the patients he wishes to save, and gloat about the spectacular perfection that is his life. That is, until an uncalled for car crash leaves his hands paralyzed with severe nerve damage.<br/><br/>Which leads him to Nepal, where an Ancient One is said to be there with knowledge of spiritual healing. It's not in his comfort zone but hey? What has he got to lose?<br/><br/>So he goes under spiritual training by a cult, receiving far more than he bargained for. Next thing he knows, he is dawned with the abilities to remove his spirit from his material body, create portals in midair, and fly with the powers of a levitating cape, and all in an effort to save the world from an outer demon.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this highly entertaining (and funny) addition to the MCU is its swaying away from the familiar gadgets and aliens of the previous films and more into an out-of-place exploration of man's relationship with the occult. It's not odd to say, especially considering that they do not do a very good job at portraying it.<br/><br/>Normally, if there was a cult such as this one who depend on old spiritual tradition, why are they of all different races around the world? We have one White woman, one Black man, and one Asian, and several others who are from places I cannot possibly pinpoint. It may not matter to you, but this really hurts the film's believability.<br/><br/>Although I do give director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) credit for telling the story as if it were a real Buddhist or Hindu legend, while at the same time a part of our own modern culture. He does this best through the most obvious yet brilliantly executed way of combining the two: colorful trips through the spiritual universe that wows you off guard, especially when viewed behind 3-D glasses. While not in the infinite realms of the non-materialistic universe, Dr. Strange and his comrades fight against the assassins of time and space through showcases of city environments spinning and losing form within itself, as if you're watching Inception though a kaleidoscope.<br/><br/>Older traditions of Hindu training are also exploited here in the same fashion done by The Matrix: Dr. Strange is thrown to the top of Mt. Everest to test how quickly he can form a portal back to base. It would generate shrieks of joy from all anime fans, but it later turns out to be a missed chance of character development, which leads into this film's biggest problem<br/><br/>With something as controversial and delicate as occult practices driving the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I doubt there could be a reasonable way to do something like this under Marvel's wing perfectly. I do appreciate the risks that they have been taking to be different with each of their films (just compare and contrast Guardians of the Galaxy with Captain America: Civil War for a minute). But frankly, some risks are not worth taking. It was worth it to create the mind- bending kaleidoscopic fight sequences, but when Marvel's name is attached, I do not believe that it would help with their branding."

","It was a great movie. I loved the 3-D, the direction,acting. The way of building up the character of Dr. Strange was brilliant. <br/><br/>I have one major detailing issue with the film which was the casting for the masters in the temple. The temple is situated in Kathmandu, Nepal. The scriptures are in the Sanskrit language, they called in Vedic Sanskrit. And yet none of the masters were of Indian or Nepal origins. Their accent was western and the masters were all of the foreign origins. This detail of the movie was stupid according to me. Even if it is true to the comics, it is not true to the story. If one is fluent in Sanskrit mantra pronunciation, they won't be pronouncing chakra or other Sanskrit words, the way they were. <br/><br/>Another part I did not like is how easily the masters are killed when Dr. Strange is shown putting a good fight. Lastly, the enemy was not explained or created properly, we do not know about the enemies character. <br/><br/>Overall, I loved the movie. The 3-D and effects are worth your time."

","Doctor Strange is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. I was a bit skeptical about this movie at first, as it was another origin story, something I feel I have seen plenty of that could never escape being formulaic, but Strange actually did. The character forms in to his superhero persona in ways completely different from the likes of Batman or Spider-Man, leading to some visually stunning sequences, thus creating a character that really does stand out from other heroes.<br/><br/>The film did, however, seem to go out of its way to be complex. I understand that it is deeper, more layered material than some of Marvel's previous comic adaptations, but I felt the mystic arts, multiverses, time paradoxes, etc. could have been dumbed down for the audience more. As well as that, they probably could have left certain elements of what Strange can control out of this movie, so that they could dive deeper in to some and save the others for future sequels. <br/><br/>The cast is what brings any movie together and that is no exception here. Benedict Cumberbatch shines in the title role, he truly transforms himself in this character, using his classically trained acting to bring class in to the Marvel universe. He is joined by a stellar supporting cast that includes a strong Chiwetel Ejiofor, a vulnerable Rachel McAdams, a sinister Mads Mikkelsen, an encapsulating Benedict Wong and an intriguing Tilda Swinton, each performance is dedicated and the chemistry between each individual pair is pure. <br/><br/>It manages to take a typical set up, a regular man gains superhuman abilities, and makes it its own thing, not feeling like its borrowing from any previous superhero film, and stands on its own, you really would not have to have seen any other Marvel film to enjoy this. Action packed, well acted and intense, Doctor Strange is yet another hit for the studio, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure or fantasy film. <br/><br/>After losing function of his arms, a successful surgeon becomes a trainee in the mystic arts. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Benedict Cumberbatch"

","This is definitely another great adaptation of a Marvel Comics hero. Doctor Strange is indeed the Sorcerer Supreme. Although I have never read any Doctor Strange comics, I've done some research on him and I'm still a Marvel fan. This movie also has very funny and amusing moments like when Strange's magic cape held that servant of Dormammu and when Doctor Strange used the Eye of Agamotto to get Dormammu stuck in a time loop to stop him from destroying the world as well as the multiverse and keep him in the Dark Dimension, along with his servants. Also the Ancient One was also an interesting character and in the comics the Ancient One was a man, but in this the Ancient One is a woman. We also get to see Thor during the ending credits of this film talking to Doctor Strange about them working together to protect Asgard from Loki. After all Asgard is also a dimension like the Mirror Dimension and the Dark Dimension. This movie is indeed filled with plenty of action and great special effects. 10 out of 10 for this."
"PeterJasonQuill","10","1","6","20 November 2016"," Marvel's best yet
","I had been looking forward to this movie for about over a year, and I finally got round to seeing this yesterday, and after seeing, I have to admit, this film is literally, as the title of the review says, marvel's best yet. Benedict Cumberbatch is great as Doctor Strange, he literally doesn't need to fake anything about his character, he just is the character. One really funny thing that I noticed is that despite his character being American, his character has a very British sense of humour, which always leads to the funniest situations in the movie, like the scene where Wong was listening to BeyoncÃ© music and strange takes some books while he isn't looking. Hilarious. Tilda Swinton is great as the ancient one, seriously, how does marvel make such good casting choices? Same goes for Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo, ignore those whitewashing and balckwashing complaints, they are great casting choices. Another flaw people had found was Mads Mikkelsen's villain Kaecillius, who stole pages from a book from the ancient one's library. And using these pages, he masters the dark arts. He is great in his role, because he is in his comfort zone, playing a villain. So honestly, as I mentioned earlier, this is marvel's best film yet, and as well as that, it's Cumberbatch's best yet too. Definitely a must see film. You won't regret it."

","Following the recent success of lesser known hero films- Doctor Strange hits all the high notes without resorting to comedy like Ant Man and Guardians of the Galaxy or hard-core sex, violence and swearing like Deadpool and Suicide Squad.<br/><br/>It's cleverly written with sharp dialogue and rock solid performances from several 'A list' actors and outshone other first episode solo movies of more famous characters like Hulk, Thor, Green Lantern and Captain America. <br/><br/>I've never been more thankful not to miss a movie on the big screen and especially in 3D, as Dr. S's visual effects are frequently trippy as hell and gave me easily the best 3D experience I have had since Avatar first blew my mind and changed the way we all watch movies. <br/><br/>There is plenty of fun and comedy while keeping the general tone quite intense, though Sherlock fans will be shocked at how well and convincingly Benedict plays the American superhero.<br/><br/>For a- 'B list' (possibly a 'C list') hero, who has rarely had an ongoing series in the comics, and no cartoons or toys, I was surprised that Dr. S. got his own movie, let alone how good it is.<br/><br/>I feel this film and title character is really going to tie the MU and the other characters together well, and has me on the edge of my seat to see the next Avengers movies with more Dr. S., and I would be stoked to see him in other movies and TV shows etc. <br/><br/>I guarantee (spoiler alert), in the next movie, someone is going to be holding the bloody limp body of someone and screams- ""get me a doctor!"" At which time our hero floats down and says- ""I may be of some assistance!""<br/><br/>Wouldn't change a thing- one of the best origin and first appearance of a character by far to date."

","Great all around production. The characters were clear and engaging. The story was well thought out considering the time. The filming was very good, despite losing the characters in some of the low-lit fight scenes. Loved Stan Lee's appearance referencing his co-creator Ditko and the movie's Pink Floyd connection was a nice touch. But this movie screamed for a quick appearance of Dr Who, who could have popped in at any point when Strange insisted on the ""Dr"" part of his title. Plus, this story is all about time and who better to show up than the immortal Timelord. Maybe he can be included in the next Dr. Strange movie. Marvel, BBC please talk about this, it's simple character crossover promotion, it'll put an entire community Sci-Fi, comic geeks into a frenzy, it can only translate to higher visibility for both and higher dollar return."
"ztigr","6","1","6","7 November 2016"," Just okay
","If you simply must see the amazing special effects on the big screen, than by all means go. Otherwise wait till you can watch on Amazon etc. Problem 1: The film fails to make Dr. S a big enough ass prior to his epiphany. I mean the character is supposed to be really selfish and self absorbed. I thought the film was afraid to totally go all in on this character build despite some admittedly crucial scenes. Problem 2: Film fails to connect Dr. Strange and Mordo in a meaningful way. This will cause problems in the future I think. Problem 3: Humorous moments are there, but the film fails to land them with a good enough punch. Other Marvel films are really good at mixing in the humor, but this movie seems timid a bit of going landing a good joke. Problem 4: The main reason I went to see this movie is because of Cumberbatch, but his performance is really run of the mill. I could picture many actors performing the role in the way he does, its underwhelming if not convincing...<br/><br/>THat's about it, just another okay Marvel movie, certainly not my favorite at all."

","Oftentimes, people identify themselves with their profession. Being able to do the job that one is good at makes them feel good. Dealing with the pain of loosing ones professional career can be traumatic. It happens because of this profound obsession with ones own job. It can also be related to an obsession with activity. What would one do if there was nothing to do? This is the question that Stephen Strange is faced with in the beginning of the story. Later on he discovers the esoteric and ancient wisdom. Dealing with multiverses and time travel. Psychologists relates these non existent phenomena to Schizophrenia and delusional beliefs in unreal. One interesting thing about the movie is the part where the protagonist dies several times but comes back and defies a great inner demon that is obsessed with power. Another question that the movie throws at the audience is whether time travel or time manipulation can be good/bad or right/wrong. But this is as easy as answering the question of whether traveling by bus is good/bad or pausing the movie that one is watching has any ethical questions attached to it. A thought provoking movie. Sometimes I felt the action was just too much. There could have been a better and peaceful way of presenting the same ideas. Benedict did an awesome job, I'm a big fan."

","This was amazing!!!! I went into this movie knowing nothing about the character. I kept myself completely in the dark. No comics, no animated movies, staying off Thursday night. Glad I did. There were tons of moments that wowed and surprised me, that I don't think would have had as big of an impact if I had read the source material beforehand. It was like putting Jedi in the movie ""The Matrix."" The visuals are so mind-bending that this is one of the very few times I would say go see it in 3D. (Unless you get headaches easily or suffer from motion sickness. Then stick with the standard version). The 3D is more than worth the extra price. The opening seen alone already feels like it was worth every penny. The movie is also very deep and thought provoking. ""Civil War"" was thought-provoking in a political way, and this is thought provoking in a science/psychological way. Benedict Cumberbaych does amazingly as always, but I do feel like he was typecast. He seems to be playing the ""I'm smarter than you and I'm going to let you know I'm smarter than you every chance I get"" character over and over. I'm worried he'll become like Johnny Depp and end up eventually becoming a parody of himself. I don't want to spoil anything, because like I said before, it's better to go in knowing nothing. I will say that I hope Marvel takes more risks with more obscure characters and that Fox finally stops being selfish and just gives them the rights to ""X-Men"" and ""Fantastic Four"" already! I want to see Tony Stark, Stephen Strange, Bruce Banner, Hank Pym, and Reed Richards have a science debate. Just make one big banter-fest movie of these characters. Just witty back and forth dialogue between them. That would be awesome! I'm excited to see how this movie ties in to ""Infinity War."" Definitely looking forward to seeing Doctor Strange appear in future movies.

","I'll just say what is on my mind after watching the movie for maybe the fifth time. I'm tired of Hollywood hiring foreigners to do an American accent. It's just a lot of hard R's. Either base him in London and let him keep his natural voice or hire a real American.<br/><br/>The biggest thing that nagged me was the writing that dated the movie. When he starts listing off one-named musicians (that a 45 year old British guy wouldn't/shouldn't listen to) it sounds weird. It also wasn't a funny bit. It was just weird. I'd rather him stick with liking music for his age -like a normal person would. Besides, 50 years from now grandkids will ask if that was a joke and no one will know. ""Well, at the time he was a British guy (pretending to be American) a decade older than me talking about musicians American kids 20 years younger than me would listen to. It was a dad joke I guess?""<br/><br/>The whole time bending, multiverse thing is blah.<br/><br/>I couldn't see kids get behind this as a superhero and I, as an adult, think it's good for making me sleepy."

He's an old Asian man, not some young looking white woman who just so happens to be bald and Celtic to boot. I did like this movie, and still do like a lot of parts of it, but honestly dormammu is one of the most boring, dull and stupid villains that Marvel has ever made, and, and I think this is the funniest part out of this entire film, there's the fact that they recycled thanos's face and used that as the basis for dormammu.

","While Doctor Strange is mainly an action film with great action scenes and visual effects, it also has powerful dialogues and strong performances that add to the quality of storytelling.<br/><br/>The visual effects are the first thing one would remember this film for. I mean, I still can't understand how could one imagine something as creatively complex as this. As the viewer sits and experiences the action sequences filled with mind-bending effects and creativity, one can't help but feel it's one of the greatest visual spectacles of all time.<br/><br/>But as said before, there's a heart to the storytelling apart from all the non-stop action. Ancient One's dialogues are sharp and deep at the same time. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as an arrogant doctor who goes on to become one of the most powerful superheroes, or the ""Master of the Mystic Arts"" as he is called, is nothing but outstanding. Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One is really impressive. Other actors are also impressive, including Rachel McAdams who plays more than just the hero's love interest, and Benedict Wong who just like his name lives up to the character of Wong.<br/><br/>The film depicts what a superhero should be, without even mentioning it verbally even once. It's extremely impressive to see Strange bond with the Cloak and fight the bad guys. It's almost like a martial arts film, where a lost man seeks knowledge and becomes a protector, but it's really different from what any viewer would have seen in any other superhero blockbuster. The irreverent humor also works well wherever placed.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange is one of the best action movies ever made, and with its outstanding visual effects along with the action sequences, is purely an experience of a lifetime. I really wish I had seen this on the big screen."

","Much like my exposure to Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Strange was always a character in Marvel's lineup that I never was familiar with as I never read any of his comic stories so when Marvel Studios announced a movie about the Sorcerer Supreme, I was mildly interested just because of how big of a fan I am of the MCU and the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch was going to be playing the lead so I went into the film with medium expectations and I came out stunned and amazed by what I watched. From it's mind-blowing visual effects and dazzling action set-pieces to its brilliant humor and acting, Dr. Strange is easily the trippiest and most interesting MCU movie I've ever watched.<br/><br/>The movie opens in a secret complex where an evil sorcerer named Kaecilius and his followers sneak into the complex's library and steal a couple pages from a mystic book only to be chased out by the head sorcerer known as the Ancient One. We then cut to Dr. Steven Strange, a rich, admired and vain neurosurgeon who is injured in a car wreck which therefore costs him the usage of his hands, leaving him incapable of performing any kind of surgery. After nearly bleeding himself dry financially while trying to find a cure for his damaged hands, Steven hears about a mystic place in Nepal know as Kamar-Taj from a man who was able to regain the use of his legs. Desperate, Strange travels to Kamar-Taj only to be rejected at first but is taken in by Baron Mordo. The Ancient One displays her powers to Steven, showing him various other dimensions as well as the astral plane. Upon seeing this power, Strange begs to taught in the ways of mysticism but The Ancient One is hesitant to train him due to his ego and aspiration but eventually agrees to mentor him. Meanwhile, Kaecilius uses the stolen text pages to contract Dormammu from the Dark Dimension in order to aid him in his mission. Now, Strange along with Baron Mordo and The Ancient One must do battle with Kaecilius and Dormammu and pervert Earth from falling into chaos.<br/><br/>Over the course of ten years, the MCU has gone from strength to strength in the matter of storytelling prowess, providing the directors and writers an opportunity to push against the typical and formulaic approach to movie-making in Hollywood by nurturing a resounding and exceptional creative and storytelling insights coupled with the guiding hand of a studio president whose vision for a shared universe is carefully planned out over the course of several decades which has lead to some of the greatest comic book movies of our time like The Avengers, Black Panther and Guardians of the Galaxy, movies that have been indisputably influenced not only by the filmmaking sentiments of their directors but also from what Kevin Feigie has done for the MCU and while some of these movie may not stack up to the comic book movies made by Richard Donner or Christopher Nolan, almost all of the MCU movies stand out from some of the other comic book movies of recent memory for their readiness to tell a familiar story from a different angle while some movies made in the Marvel camp like The Amazing Spiderman 2, X-Men 3, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Spiderman 3 and Fant4sic fail due to their faithfulness to the studio's band of style and micromanagement no matter how hard the directors and writers try to make their vision stand out. Pretty much everything great about Thor: The Dark World was snuffed out and felt like it was being written and revised by a set of rules that were created to increase what made the first movie so great and implant them into a recognizable format. However, most of the MCU films have accomplished this through their grasp on Marvel Studio's distinct designs and awareness by working strongly within the confines and limits of what Fergie has sent up with the MCU but also accept the expectations dictated to them and thus play close to them. By doing so, the films adopt a certain balance and flexibility so much so that such a proven strategy when it comes to filmmaking has paid off time and again for these movies and allows the filmmakers to work their magic in creating a film that not only provides us with an escape from reality but also can give us a great story with characters we can be invested in along with giving us a movie that is fun to watch without feeling the need to be too artsy or snobbish and Dr. Strange is one such movie.<br/><br/>Much like what the first Thor movie did with its emphasis on science and magic, Dr. Strange smartly decides to go a similar way with its story. There are never too many unexpected twists and turns that find their way into the story or the arrangement of the movie. The film unfurls precisely as the viewer would expect it to but this isn't always a bad thing. All the parts are there ready to be assembled and are ready to be added with the authenticity of a watch that Strange carries around with him as a relic and all the character archetypes are presented to the viewer even before we have a chance to get to know them and yet the movie never feels the need to bring down or curve these characters but rather it concentrates on improving them to a fine point and feeling the need to realize those points with the aid of a talented cast, glorious visual effects and a slight smirk on the movie's face. More so than that, the relevant directness of the movie's plot allows director Scott Derrickson to attach some rather mind-blowing action set-pieces and as well as some nifty visual composition and while some have whined that all the MCU look the same when it comes to their visual look and color palettes, I personally have never seen anything wrong as it always seems that every movie Marvel Studios makes always has a distinctive look that differentiates from the previous movies and Dr. Strange certainly has a unique look that makes it stand out from previous comic book films and feels like a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Unlike some more recent comic book films that feel the need to take themselves much more seriously then they should, Dr. Strange actually seems like it's eager to embrace it's outlandish source material rather than run away from it and nowhere does that become more apparent then a scene where Strange does battle with some of Kaecilius's minions with some help from The Cloak of Levitation. A cape is an iconic piece of superhero iconography as both Superman and Thor have shown us and Dr. Strange turns the Cloak of Levitation into a character itself. Every time the cloak in onscreen, director Scott Derrickson can't get enough of it and rightfully so as the cloak is honestly fantastic even if it's just a prop much like the Magic Carpet in Aladdin. Some of the film's most enduring shots are centered around the cloak practically the final shot in the trailer where Strange is climbing the steps to the Sanctum Santorum is truly breath-taking. Despite how the cloak may feel like an inanimate object, it still has a personality all it's own. The instant that Stephan dons the cloak, he starts to become a more useful superhero. The movie makes the point obvious to the viewer that a lot of this is happening directly tied to the cloak itself. To add to that, the humor in Dr. Strange is some of the best in the MCU as every single joke in the movie is timed just right and never feels forced or unwanted but makes the viewer bust out laughing when the humor does come. The scene of Strange confining Kaecilius is particularly gut-busting as Strange grads a bizarre medieval-looking device that results in Kaecilius being caught in a compliant position as the gadget locks itself into place. The scene is a true testament to great humor as well as the power of great writing and comic timing.<br/><br/>Like Thor before it, Dr. Strange can be revised as an insightfully quintessential superhero movie built from ideas floating through the artistic subconsciousness. The film feels very recognizable and not just because of its story arraignment but also because it feels very much like a Marvel movie from top to bottom. Steven Strange is pretty much characterized in the same way as Tony Stark was as he starts off as a vain and full-of-himself billionaire but though a life-threating accident and its aftermath, he vows to change and as a result becomes a better person and uses his newfound powers to protect the world and while this trend may seem clichéd and worn out to some, I felt that it fit the tone of the film perfectly and didn't dwell on the origin for too long as opposed to Frant4sic. Apart from drawing a lot of influence from Thor and Iron Man, the film adds in elements of the TV show House to its portrayal, a British actor speaking with an American accent playing a self-centered doctor who is aloof when it comes to people as well as a few touches of Dr. Who thrown in due to the movie's frequent captivation with time as well as a few tiny callbacks to Inception due to the exploitation of space and time. While the movie may not do any better than the movies it's referencing, it still is able to throw all these elements into a blender and mix them in a way that feels appealing and breathtaking in and of itself.<br/><br/>As for the visual effects in Dr. Strange, they are just as spectacular as one might expect. With CGI improving all the time, certain shots and action set-pieces that would have been nigh to impractical a decade ago are now the standards for big-budget Hollywood movies and there's something that can be said about being able to see all these memorable comic book ideas being brought to life onscreen in an aspect that clearly delights in and holds fast to the more bizarre images and ideas of the world of Dr. Strange. When Stephan takes a journey through the multiverse, every area he passes through is realized to such a high degree of perfection that it's almost sensory overload just watch the entire scene but nonetheless, it's all so glorious that you simply can't take your eyes off of it and soak it all in for what it has to offer.

This movie is drop dead gorgeous. Everything, EVERYTHING, in this movie, is absolutely beautiful.

","It mostly bored me with unemotional characters and too much talk. It had a few cool fights, but I don't understand the logic in Doctor Strange needing to be a superhero.

Usually superheroes discover their alter ego on their own."

","It was directed by Scott Derrickson. It's the story about one neurosurgeon who got into a difficult life situation. The main actors are Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton, Mads Mikkelsen and Chiwetel Ejiofor.
Dr. Strange is talented neurosurgeon. No one can surpass him in skill. But one day he had a car accident. He lost his ability to treat, but he found a talent for magic. After much thought Dr. Strange decides to go to the center of magic - Tibet. Here he develops his magic abilities. Strange finds the meaning of life in the fight with evil.

","I went to see Doctor Strange on my 17th birthday since I had an option for what I wanted to do and.....(continue to next paragraph)<br/><br/>==Warning I have taken two paragraphs from another persons review==<br/><br/>Watching this in theaters with the sometimes too-loud sound, seeing the buildings and streets give way and rotate and otherwise bend themselves completely to a person's whim, immediately made me think of Inception. But this was even more hectic. This wasn't imaginary, this was real. However it was if you watch it in 4D you would enjoy it.<br/><br/>Another thing. Finally in the MCU we have some sorcery, direct utilization of magical energy for combat. Discussion of other dimensions; even traveling between them at will. Doctor Strange's final outfit is just wicked cool. If you know the character from the Marvel comics, then you'll know that he's pretty damn powerful. Unfortunately this is an origins film, that is, it reveals how Doctor Strange became Doctor Strange the Sorcerer Supreme; the real deal will come in the third Avengers film hopefully.<br/><br/>Bennadict Combabatch was an excellent choice for the sources supreme and also as the voice of Dormammu.<br/><br/>However the race/gender change for Baron Mordo and The Ancient One was weird but still good.
The best scenes are when Dr Strange goes up against Dormammu and says ""Dormammu I have come to bargain"" But Dormammu replies ""YOU HAVE COME TO DIE!!"" <br/><br/>There is more to this I could talk about but I am going to let you watch it for you self."
"invisibleunicornninja","10","0","2","13 March 2018"," Cliche but fun.
","Plot - This is a pretty cliche and formulaic story with mostly unoriginal characters. That being said, there are many elements of the story that are actually pretty interesting. Not everything is as throughly explored as it could be, but some of the plot twists and devices are interesting enough. If this movie focused on different things then what they did, it would've been fantastic. They rushed Doctor Strange's training, and if they'd spent a bit more stuff on that it would've made the movie much more interesting. <br/><br/>Action - The action is amazing. Incredible effects are used to aid the incredible fight scenes, which are easily the best part of this movie. <br/><br/>Characters - Though not all of these characters are very original, the acting is incredible. The cast brings these cliche characters to life, sucking you into this nonsense. <br/><br/>Humor - This movie is pretty funny. Enough said. <br/><br/>Cinematography - The effects are all amazing. The cinematography is great. The sets are awesome. This is a movie which is best enjoyed on the big screen - which I was lucky enough to see it on.

","The Marvel Cinematic Universe can easily be divided into two categories - the Sci-Fi/fantasy movies (like Guardians and Thor), and the more earth-based/thrillers (like Iron Man and Captain America). It seems like everyone has one side of it that they prefer. Personally, I'm into the Sci-Fi/fantasy movies, which is one of the main reasons why Doctor Strange is my favorite MCU movie. I know it's not one of the more popular Marvel movies, and my love of it is very personal. I'm fascinated by magic, mysticism, out of body experiences, alternate dimensions, all that good stuff. So it's hard for me to judge this movie in all fairness. It's still a great movie.<br/><br/>The movies' strongest aspect is easily, as I said, the fascinating powers and abilities of Doctor Strange and those who use the Mystic Arts. Watching them harness the mystic energy and use it is such a cool thing. The multiverse scene was probably the best moment in terms of visual effects, possibly ever. Some of the coolest moments are the ones that involve bending reality, and the difference between the real world and the Mirror Dimension. The best scenes are the multiverse scene, the astral projection scenes, and the scene with New York in the Mirror Dimension. The fact that this movie didn't win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects is appalling. The environment of Kamar-Taj is also interesting. It has people learning the Mystic Arts, a library of ancient books, and has doors to the three Sanctums in London, New York, and Hong Kong, which defend the world from evil forces. It feels like an Asian Hogwarts, but it's one of those movie places that you wish were real. Dr. Strange himself is very similar to Iron Man, with the whole cocky rich guy attitude, but Benedict Cumberbatch does such a great job at playing him that you still end up liking the character. The most interesting character, however, is the Ancient One. She brings a degree of moral ambiguity to the movie, and the truth about her is a great twist, and one that's very fun to think about. Mordo was an OK character. He wasn't dislikable or anything like that, but he was far from Marvel's best sidekick. Wong is a boss. That's all there is to it. Kaecilius also isn't Marvel's best villain, but his backstory does make it seem like he knows what he's doing may be right, even if he clearly (as the running joke says) didn't read the warnings. Needless to say, the scene with Dormammu was absolutely fantastic. And despite being one of Marvel's darker movies, it still has some very funny moments in it. I know from a storytelling and character perspective, it really isn't the best, but the fascinating environments, ideas, and visuals make it a personal favorite. I've watched it a dozen times, and I'll probably watch it a dozen more."

","What a dung heap.<br/><br/>Usually I love Mr. Cumberbatch, and even think his Bostonian accent in Black Mass was passable. Lord, this movie, though...<br/><br/>Bad American accent, bad lines, dodgy acting by the entire cast (McAdams was the only thing I liked about True Detective II), lame villains, kindergarten costumes, unoriginal special effects (which may've been the one redeemable aspect), poor plot exposition, and at no time did it encourage me to suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>At times, when fighting out-of-body in a hospital, they inexplicably bump into something things while passing right through others. Sitting with a friend, we both finished several predictable lines of dialogue prior to the character parroting it out.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this movie is that it ends."

I don't think anyone would not enjoy the movie! One of the other things they got right was that the movie wasn't too long. It probably would have been tempting to include as much of his origin story from the comics to please fans as possible but they managed to do it all in 1 hour and 55 minutes, which is about average length for a movie nowadays.<br/><br/>Enjoy amazing performances also from Rachel McAdams, Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen!<br/><br/>It is a must see you would be mad to miss it!"

"MovieSoup","4","0","2","26 September 2017"," No originality. Style over substance
","Doctor Strange is boring and has some of the worst acting I have seen in a Marvel movie. The best thing about the MCU is that it makes consistently fun films, but Doctor strange just falls completely flat. Don't get me wrong this film is no Suicide Squad but it is such a cookie cutter movie that has bad acting and terrible dialogue by the main character that I found it very hard to enjoy.<br/><br/>Let's look at the bad things first and then lead with some good things the film does right. The reason I hated Doctor Strange himself was partly due to the fact that Cumberbatch played him terribly. The US accent he uses when he is playing Strange is inconsistent at best. Honestly it sounds like a guy from Hammersmith doing an American accent. At no point in the film was I sitting there thinking he's not English. It took me out of the film so many times that I dreaded the bits with him in.<br/><br/>Stephen Strange is very poorly written in this film. He starts off as an arrogant a**hole and doesn't change at all throughout the film. His demeanour would be fine if he was charismatic or a little funny but all of the jokes he has written for him are painfully unfunny and fall flat. The Beyoncé joke he has with Wong is just BLEH and a classic example of terrible dialogue that is throw into this film. <br/><br/>With superhero films you have to make them relatable and at least funny in some scenes. Iron man does this very well as Tony Stark is an a**hole, like Strange, however Stark has charisma and was written with funny lines that made him relatable as a character. Stark is good and tries to put others first which most audience members share and this is how the audience relates. <br/><br/>Strange cares for himself and no one else, making him hard to relate too and making him unlikeable. He doesn't change at the end of the film; he just comes to the realisation that it is okay to loose sometimes. He doesn't even stop being a selfish di*k head so there is little character development for our MAIN CHARACTER!<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton plays the ancient one. I will not go into whether I think Swinton's character should have been played by an elderly Asian man like in the comics, I will let the SJWs get hard over that one.I personally don't care that much; as I have not read the comics so I'm not that attached to the character. Swinton is okay and does know how to portray a wise woman well I guess. Her character can sometimes be a boring wooden character sometimes but not to the point where it ruins the film. That's all I have to say on her.<br/><br/>The plot is a simple cookie cutter plot that Marvel likes to use again and again. Honestly the plots in some marvel films are so samey that you really have to wonder about the originality here. Doctor Strange follows the same conventions of most superhero movies like a big fight at the end with a powerful bad guy, sidekicks turning evil and a treasured mentor dying. While there is nothing wrong with conventions it would be nice for marvel to break this chain and deviate from the norm. <br/><br/>The CGI was good in this film. The scene where Strange is first shown the mystic arts and the ""dream sequences"" where the worlds are turned upside down are great visually. CGI is great and can really help a story along when a character is explaining the magic used. This film is a good example of that and when Tilda Swinton is explaining these principles to Strange it is at least fun to watch.<br/><br/>The other technical parts of the film are barely noticeable. I have no opinion on the music because I wasn't really paying attention to it at all. That is a shame as it shows that it was not used to the effect that music can be used in film. The cinematography, as well, fell short and went practically unnoticed by me. In fact the CGI is the only thing worth note in this film from a technical point of view which is sad. This film is a Marvel ""filler movie"" that, on its own, is easily forgettable and does nothing to advance the MCU in any way. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the MCU loves to play it safe with these ""filler movies"" like Ant man, Incredible Hulk, Iron man 2 and Doctor Strange these movies are just there to keep us interested so everyone will go and see the new Avengers film or another Thor film.<br/><br/>This film could be better if they had just made Strange a likable hero instead of an as*hole and Benedict worked on his accent. It is sad but it is true and it is the main reason why this film is bad. The other characters are fine but hardly anything to write home about and the whole movie is a bit on the mediocre side of things. The CGI is good, well done effects team, but it is that classic case of style over substance."

Rachel McAdams' portrayal as Christine Palmer was amazing and a great love interest to Doctor Stephen Strange and amazing Doctor. Benedict Wong's acting of Wong is funny, mind- blowing and amazing! with his looks and stuff Wong will be a big entry into the MCU as he is coming in Infinity War with Doctor Strange. Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One was interesting as her teaching to Strange was understanding and her death was what completed her life as she agreed for her death. The Astral Plane fight between Lucian portrayed by Scott Adkins and Doctor Strange was an amazing look from the comics and a great prestige from Scott Derrickson, now the amazing visuals of the film were amazing and was 150 times greater than Inception, and what was surprising was that Doctor Strange actor: Benedict Cumberbatch played the motion capture which is amazing that Benedict is playing a hero and a villain in the same film which is interesting. Marvel Studios' 2016 Doctor Strange Stars: Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Scott Adkins, Benjamin Bratt and with Mads Mikkelsen and Tilda Swinton and also with an surprising cameo with Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Doctor Strange is Directed by: Scott Derrickson and is now on Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital HD."

","I'd like to preface this by saying thanks to the folks at Netflix for making this available to me at no additional cost or effort. This convenience made the experience less painful as I'd originally planned to rent this title. <br/><br/>Also on the topic of Netflix, they also has their productions of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, etc, that lift the genre back up with great stories and characters, while not having to rely on computer effects (and the obligatory 3D IMAX gimmicks that accompany) to grip the viewer. So again, respect.<br/><br/>The movies are just getting progressively more disappointing. Dr Strange, with its uncomplicated views on plot, characters, and science, will satisfy most people (10 out of 10!!) but I'm getting bored and annoyed by the formula. The plot here was exceptionally thin: really, it could be spoiled here in a sentence. It's all been done. <br/><br/>Chris Nolan and Netflix set the bar for me on the superhero genre.

"Wizard-8","Null","0","1","11 June 2017"," Not awful... but feels by the numbers
","I must confess that before watching this movie, I had next to no prior knowledge of the comic book character Doctor Strange. So I don't know how closely this cinematic adaptation is to the source material. But I can confidently report that much of the movie plays out in a way that has elements that I have seen in many other movies before, superhero oriented or not. For example, the characters seem very familiar for the most part, such as a central protagonist who starts off selfish and arrogant but ultimately redeems himself. The villains are stereotypically flat, with no complex attributes or deep looks into their minds. And the central story's twists and turns will not be very surprising for most viewers. Oh, there are some good things here and there. The special effects are good at times, the action a few times is eye-catching, and the movie is never downright boring. But all the same, the movie feels kind of tired and lacks serious ability to give the audience something new and fresh. It's certainly better than watching a blank wall for two hourse, but not that much more. All this may explain why the movie, while definitely a worldwide box office success, wasn't a hit at the magnitude of some other Marvel superhero movies."

","A few years ago when I found out that Benedict Cumberbatch was being cast as the title character in this movie I was totally against that choice because I felt that he didn't really look like Dr. Strange, but when I first saw the theatrical posters for this movie I immediately changed my mind. As the movie opens we see Strange and his girlfriend Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) who also happens to be a nurse at the same hospital where Strange works, and not to much later we see Strange get into a very dangerous car accident and suffers from severe nerve damage as a result of the accident. After Strange recovers he goes to a basketball court and talks to a man named Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) who was paralyzed and tells Strange about this place in Turkey that allowed him to walk again. So Strange goes there and seeks help to heal his nerves meeting a man named Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and a monk called ""The Ancient One"" (Tilda Swinton) who teach him about the mystic arts. Strange is also required to read books on specific topics of sorcery and meets the librarian there named Wong (Benedict Wong).Then trouble arises and Strange has to fight a sorcerer who was taught by ""The Ancient One"" named Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and his minions in order to save the world from ""The Dark Dimension"". The film was directed by Scott Derrickson who also co-wrote the screenplay with C. Robert Cargill and Jon Spaihts which all three of them did an effective job of focusing on the characters rather than on the fight scenes and special effects, and also at times the dialogue is completely hilarious. The performances are very good especially from Cumberbatch, McAdams, Ejiofor, Swinton, and Mikkelsen. The special effects are reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" (2010), and Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), but the only difference is that this movie didn't win its well deserved Oscar in the visual effects category even though Jon Favreau's ""The Jungle Book"" was a good choice but the special effects weren't as good as this movie. Though this isn't in my top ten movies of last year it is pretty close to making that list but this movie won't evade my memory anytime soon thanks to its greatness."
"paul_haakonsen","5","0","1","15 April 2017"," Strange where the storyline went off to...
","This was definitely a comic book story long in the waiting for a transition to the big screen, and I am sure that many fans of the comic book and the Marvel universe were thrilled with this movie. I, however, am not a fan of superheroes in any shape or form, and just watched this movie because I had a chance to do so with my wife.<br/><br/>Once the movie ended and the sparks and flashing effects left my eyes with a proper sight again, I can in all honesty say that this was a shallow and pointless movie, and there were so many plot holes that even a Swizz cheese would be jealous. But luckily enough there was so many grand and amazing effects on the screen to divert your attention from all the plot holes and the lack of a proper thought-through storyline.<br/><br/>Personally I am not overly much a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, and I don't really get the hype around him. He is not all that impressive. And one would think that I would be thrilled about seeing Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen in this movie, but I wasn't. He was just browsing through this as if he had seen through all the flaws and shortcomings that the script had.<br/><br/>And with my lack of interest in superhero movies, then ""Dr. Strange"" is a movie that just came and went without leaving any impression or lasting mark, unlike ""Logan"" for example. And it is definitely not a movie that I will pick up again and sit down to watch. Why? Because the story just barely had enough contents to support the first viewing.<br/><br/>Instead of just spewing out superhero movies by the dozen, Marvel Studios should take the time to get some proper script writers to pen out the stories for the movies they want to put on the big screen.<br/><br/>Even though ""Dr. Strange"" was heavily loaded with special effects, it was just a shallow experience of a movie all in all. As such, my rating of this 2016 addition to the Marvel movie universe is a mere mediocre 5 out of 10 stars, based mostly on the special effects."

"Evan_Wheatley","Null","0","1","7 April 2017"," My review of ""Doctor Strange,"" which is, in my opinion, Marvel's first true step into the uncharted.
","""Doctor Strange,"" in my opinion, is Marvel's first step into the uncharted. Sure, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was a bold undertaking, but the concept of gods and aliens had already been explored in ""Thor"" and ""The Avengers."" ""Ant Man"" may have given us a glimpse into the Quantum Realm, but at the end of the day, it was little more than a comedic heist film with a taste of ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids.""<br/><br/>Helmed by horror director Scott Derrickson, ""Doctor Strange"" invites us into Marvel's world of magic and mysticism. Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Doctor Stephen Strange, an arrogant neurosurgeon acclaimed worldwide for his medical achievements. After losing the use of his hands in a car accident, Strange desperately searches the globe for anything that will give him back what made him great. Strange's search leads him to the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), a sorcerer who introduces him to the mystic arts and sets him on the path to becoming the ""Sorcerer Supreme.""<br/><br/>While magic itself is a new element in the Marvel cinematic universe, ""Doctor Strange"" is still, at its core, a superhero origin story, meaning that all of Marvel's tropes are ever present. There are several attempts at humor. Some of them work; some of them don't, and the villain, albeit portrayed very well by Mads Mikkelsen, is once again underdeveloped.<br/><br/>In spite of this, Marvel made an ambitious move with this film, one that I believe paid off in dividends.<br/><br/>The bizarre visuals, dialogue and character interactions of ""Doctor Strange"" would not work without strong performances, and for this film, Marvel was able to enlist a plethora of quality talent. Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo – an experienced, collected, yet damaged sorcerer studying under the Ancient One – compliments the sarcastic and ambitious nature of Strange well. Benedict Wong and Rachel McAdams as Master Wong and Nurse Christine Palmer, respectively, also have some nice character moments and provide a few laughs along the way.<br/><br/>The ""white-washing"" controversy surrounding Swinton's casting as the Ancient One (who, in the comics, was a man of Asian descent), left my mind the minute she stepped into the room with Strange. Swinton's acting choices bring her character to life, and her expert delivery adds dramatic weight to certain lines of dialogue that may have otherwise come across as poorly written.<br/><br/>Cumberbatch's performance is already being compared to Robert Downey Jr.'s in ""Iron Man"" because of the similarities between the origin stories of Stephen Strange and Tony Stark. However, what separates Strange and Stark from the beginning is the charisma and humanity that shine through Stark's arrogance before becoming Iron Man. He was a likable jerk. The same cannot be said for Strange.<br/><br/>In one scene, Strange tests his music knowledge with other hospital staff while performing surgery. He chooses his operations based on their level of difficulty, discarding ones that he deems unworthy of his time. Even after his accident, he pushes Nurse Palmer, the one person who truly cares for him, away as a result of his pride. The fact that Strange is so unlikeable at the beginning of the film makes it all the more satisfying to watch his transformation unfold on screen, and, as always, Cumberbatch brings his A-game to develop this character.<br/><br/>Scott Derrickson's background in the horror genre benefits his direction immensely. From the villain's makeup design to certain visual imagery in the final act, Derrickson's touch is evident throughout ""Doctor Strange,"" and the work that he and his team put into the film's special effects is impeccable, visually and conceptually.<br/><br/>""This doesn't make any sense,"" Doctor Strange says to the Ancient One.<br/><br/>""Not everything does. Not everything has to.""<br/><br/>""Doctor Strange"" could easily be viewed as typical Marvel fanfare. It takes a hotheaded protagonist and sends him to the darkest depths, only to have him rise from the ashes to claim his destiny. It sacrifices the villain's character development to ensure a shorter run time and throws away potentially impactful moments for the sake of comedy. Overshadowing the film's shortcomings for me, however, are excellent performances, visual flair and a bit of magic."

"bob the moo","Null","0","2","29 March 2017"," Distracting, with impressive effects; but no more than just an okay film
","Another Marvel film. It doesn't matter how many well regarded subtitled films I have in my queue, or how much I suspect that any given Marvel movie will have the same strengthens and weaknesses as the others I've seen, I will watch these quite quickly when they are available to watch at home. That includes characters I have never heard of before, such as Ant-Man, and this one. The plot here sees a talented surgeon get in an accident, lose full control of his once talented hands, and seek out some power that may be able to cure him. That power turns out to be much more than this, and soon he is fighting pan dimensional forces to protect Earth from destruction.<br/><br/>There is plenty here that reminds you that you are part of a massive franchise of films, although to be fair Doctor Strange bares that weight pretty well, and mostly it just focuses on what it is doing and not so much on having a lot of connections to these other characters. Watching it as its own film, there is quite a lot to enjoy. The high-profile cast for instance; they bring a lot of quality even if some of them have little to do, and/or caused controversy by their casting. The special effects are probably the big thing though. Not only are they technically impressive (like almost all big blockbusters) but the nature of them is quite pleasing in the way it twists the world around. They are not enough to carry the film, but they do make a mark. Finally, the light humor works well, and helps it not take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>Sadly, outside of the cast and effects, what we have is an origin story for a character I have no reason to be interested in. The effects may be impressive, but they also limit how I could connect to the action. It all plays out with noise and movement, but the familiarity of the content meant I never really got into it. On one hand this is what I come to the marvel films for – so on that front the effects, humor, and noisy action all were present; however, as a total package Strange was only an 'okay' film that could have been much more."

","Another CGI infected movie. Story is plausible but predictable. Heavy on philosophy which is kinda cool, but a bit overdone.

","Caught this one last evening On-Demand. I was hooked from the beginning until the end! The opening scene will definitely catch your attention, too. <br/><br/>Dr. Strange tells a story of Dr. Stephen Strange, considered to be the best neurosurgeon in the world. Well, at least that's what HE thinks. Arrogant, aloof, and overbearing as all get out, it is safe to say Dr. Strange is just about void of friends and/or relationships. This is where the movie gets a little ""tricky"" because Strange's character comes off as such an a-hole, I thought I might not finish the movie. That can be attributed to Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Dr. Strange. He is simply wonderful. However, as the Fates usually have it, Dr. Strange is involved in a horrible auto accident and both his hands--and his world--are shattered. <br/><br/>It is during his convalescence when he stumbles upon what he thinks is an urban legend regarding a man involved in an accident who had severe (and untreatable) injuries to his spine, yet was seen walking in New York. When Dr. Strange listens to this man's story about his ""spiritual"" healing, he then sets out to see if he can help himself. He travels to Nepal (Kathmandu) and encounters ""The Ancient One,"" expertly played by Tilda Swinson, and his ""journey"" begins.<br/><br/>""Dr. Strange"" is one of the best movies I've seen this year. Expertly cast and directed, the movie tells a very engaging story-- something most ""Marvel"" movies do not.

"awaldinger9","9","0","1","23 February 2017"," Doctor Strange: The Marvel Universe on Acid
","Doctor Strange is a refreshing movie in the marvel cinematic universe, by breaking the stereotypical hero cycle and creating a truly unique hero story. The movie keeps the viewer truly entertained from start to finish with amazing graphics, action set pieces, and stunning plot twists. The truly reinvigorating aspect of this movie is how different this movie than other superhero movies, Marvel studios ditched the guns and explosions and instead to a more mystical approach. While this is a mostly stand- alone movie it definitely builds upon the notions of the fabulously crafted marvel universe with references to the movies that have come before it. Throughout the movie Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is skeptical of the of the world around him as well as his journey and the paths he chooses to overcome not only his paralysis but his ego. After he is unable to operate due to a car accident, Steven desperately turns to a magical sorcerer to help find his meaning in life. Benedict Cumberbatch did a fantastic job of embodying the iconic comic book character Dr. Strange. Although his American accent took time to get used to it did not impede his performance. Benedicts performance allowed the view to feel the sheer pain and struggle as well as triumph that Steven Strange exudes throughout the movie. The makeup and costume design team did a fantastic job at making Benedict have a truly uncanny resemblance to Steven strange in the comics. Tilda Swinton's take on the ancient one was original yet true to the comics, her performance was captivating. The major criticism I have for the movie is the lack of character development of the villains Dormammu and Kaecilius, the movie doesn't explore enough of characters' background to make them truly horrifying. Marvel studios showed off the full potential of their graphics team with truly mind- bending visuals throughout the movie. Dr. Strange has also been nominated for an Oscar in best achievement in visual effects. The visual effects of this movie are best describe as combination of Inception and Rick and Morty. They had a healthy balance of practical and digital effects. The director used the visual effects to continue the story, for instance in one scene Steven is having a vision of hands grabbing drowning him, showing if he continues to worry about what he can't do with his hand paralysis it will be his downfall. The costume and set design was fantastic with many Easter eggs and winks at the comics throughout the movie.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed any of the other marvel movies, or are a fan of martial arts movies, this film will thoroughly entertain and captivate you. I would give this movie an 8.5/10, the special/visual effects in this are like nothing you have ever seen on the silver screen before."

I feel like because the acting was so well done, and the visual effects were so incredible, I'm supposed to like it but I just can't get there. Now, I have never been a big fan of comic book movies. There are very few comic book films that I find enjoyable enough to sit through. However, I really did want to like this one.

Then it is probably deserved a high ranking, as for an 8 or so. If you are looking for another type of movie, for your own good, turn around and face another motion picture.

"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","5 January 2017"," Doesn't quite reach that Marvel brilliance
","The fourteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the one where they most unambiguously try to bring magic into their existing universe. In this movie Benedict Cumberbatch plays Dr. Stephen Strange, a renowned neurosurgeon who must set out on a journey after a car crash ruins his hands. This will eventually end up with him discovering the existence of the mystic arts, or magic if you prefer.<br/><br/>The movie contains pretty much everything we've come to expect from Marvel films. Absolutely, phenomenally gorgeous visuals, which in this particular case are especially noteworthy, because they take the reality bending aspect of magic and really play with it. Think Inception, only even more kaleidoscopic. Granted, sometimes the visuals are a tad busy, but most of the time they're simply gorgeous.<br/><br/>We also get great actors, good humour and a villain that could have been better. Exactly what most of the Marvel movies have been all about. But in this case I found myself noticing the story formula a bit too much. It felt like the movie was simply going through motions, giving us the old, trusted, tested and patented Marvel story. I felt myself missing something new, something exciting, a twist on the old pattern. But it never came.<br/><br/>The second big problem I have with the movie is that the magic is actually pretty boring. What I mean by that, is that it makes sense that Stephen Strange only has a few tricks and spells in his repertoire. He's only starting out. But the villain, one of the most powerful magic users on Earth, uses the exact same tricks, with very little variation. Sure there's the dark power he's drawing, and some of the magic users have different magical artefacts, but it still felt stale, unimaginative. Elemental attacks, summoning creatures, mind control, invisibility, transmuting the terrain to your advantage, the list goes on. None of this is seen in the film. It's just blasting coloured lights and teleporting most of the time. Allows for some good kung fu fighting, certainly, but does not come close to being what it should be.<br/><br/>That being said, the ending is a huge exception to the issue above. It's creative, set up well in advance, makes sense for Strange's character and is simply entertaining as well as visually interesting.<br/><br/>All in all, for me Doctor Strange falls on the lower end of the scale when it comes to MCU movies. It is certainly a good film in its own right, but doesn't quite match the splendour of its predecessors."
"zain-nov","5","0","4","9 December 2016"," was Dr. Strange rip off, of Christopher Nolan's movies""
","About Dr.Strange, I would like to quote what my late (Imaginary) mentor said about Angelina Jolie's Salt back in 2010 ""This movie has holes in it big enough to drive the whole movie through. The laws of physics seem to be suspended here the same way as in a Road Runner cartoon"".<br/><br/>But is it a good film, we will establish that first we need to look into the matter if ""Dr. Strange was rip off, of Christopher Nolan's movies"" Throughout the movie, characters, special effects and plot was shouting Nolan's name because it was strikingly very much similar to at least 3 of his movies. 1. Batman Begins A rich guy goes to Himalayas then comes back enriched with new deathly set of skills/arts with a new persona, does that rings a bell? And the whole texture of the screen, clouds, darker colors, soul shaking crush on a friend who is taking her job very seriously. There is another tiny bit resemblance, which might the homage to longer twist in batman. Initially Ras'ul Akh's identity is mistaken by Bruce. So is done by Strange with ancient one. 2. Inception Now that's what everyone is talking about the physics defying scenes of inception have been stretched out. Also worth mentioning are those Hallway/Lobby scenes from Inception where no CGI was used and in Dr. Strange it's all about CGI with excessive artwork and too much goes on too quick that it loses it's charm. Apart from the visual similarities, the ending of Dr. Strange has huge influence from Inception where characters might get trap in the deepest of the memories for ever. In Dr. Strange it also takes inspiration for ending from another of Nolan's movie. 3. Interstellar We travel in alternate dimensions many times in Dr. Strange but do we remember our travels through wormholes? Of course there had been worm holes in movies since decades but we got familiar to the term after Interstellar but the design of wormholes and the fact that it takes you inside a black hole instead of future or past is impact of Interstellar. Dormammu (as funny as it sounds, especially from Bennedict's mouth) is a fantasized version of a black hole trying to take over the earth. As explained earlier, ending is also inspired by Interstellar where key to save the world lies within a black hole and Hero has to go into it. Ancient One's character is hugely inspired by Professor Brand from Interstellar as they both introduce the lead character to the object of the plot near the end shown to have kept secret to themselves. Beside Nolan's massive impact on the movie, there are other influences which are quite visible. Kaecilius sidekicks were much like characters from Thor, I would not be much surprised to know that they were using same costume, considering the fact that they will share the Marvel universe soon will make it cost effective for producers. It seems like Bennedict is the guy to play role of photographic memory as it's his 3rd role after Sherlock Holmes in Sherlock and Alan Turning in The Imitation Games. Although Bennedict is brilliant actor but if you are playing similar role again and again it might not be that much entertaining. His role of Alan Turning was different but playing Dr. Strange is very much similar to Playing Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness. Tilda Swinton is brilliant and the only person who fits into the role and does justification to it. Swinton brings charisma with her personality, mild British accent and ability to look stunning with bald head. It's a shame her character met its destiny, as it could have brought interesting background in upcoming movies. Rest of the cast were not given much chance to prove anything. Story is not that different from any action or superhero movie ever made. With lose ends like the death of Ancient One (who only has aliases and not funny name), accident of Strange over shoreline, the object to control time was just laid around and the fact how strange manage to successfully maneuver the feat at first attempt, how skull of ancient one was still intact after falling from height of hundreds of feet. And the strategic scheduling of the movie right after Captain America Civil War, where it introduces mirror reality concept. So now all the dirty fight can take place in mirror universe while real one remains intact saving Avengers from future lawsuits. Overall Dr. Strange is enjoyable, especially for its opening sequence and special effects. But again it's more of form over no substance."
"sesht","Null","0","1","6 December 2016"," Chosen by a thinking relic
","Cumber-fans rejoice! Holmes, nee, Strange, is finally here. <br/><br/>Pulling double duty as both the titular superhero (of sorts) and the baddie (unfortunately, they do world-eaters again, notwithstanding the sequel the F4 a few years previously)'s voice, Cumberbatch is perfect in every frame in this huge foray of his, into mainstream cinema (notwithstanding 'The 5th estate' or 'The imitation game', not counting his supporting turns in flicks like 'Tinker tailor soldier spy'). <br/><br/>Enough about the actors though. Suffice to know that Mads Mikkelsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg (apt, but under-utilized, just like he was in 'Arrival') and the ever-fantastic Tilda Swinton (almost walks away with the entire movie), & even Scott Adkins, refreshingly being seen in something that's not gonna go direct-to- TV) are all perfectly cast in their respective roles, & acquit themselves admirably. <br/><br/>Now, from a Marvel stable standpoint, this is supposed to be the beginning, of a sort, being the 2nd movie in their slate of Phase 2 flicks, which is supposed to have begun with Ant-Man last year. The new crop is supposed to include the titular character here, Ant-Man (of course), Black panther (see in Civil war), the 2nd-time rebooted Spiderman, Captain Marvel, while phasing out, subtle/explicitly the older crop of heroes (Iron Man, Cap, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, et al). <br/><br/>This one does things most mainstream superhero movies haven't done, including those of the Marvel crop, in spite of Thor, haven't done. Mystical realms, timeloops, multiverses, planet/world gobblers et al. While staying true to the genre, within the confines of being an origin story of a new-age superhero, albeit with a whole chunk of mysticism and sorcery thrown in. <br/><br/>Scott Derrickson, who's made unconventional (still mainstream) horror/thriller work including 'Sinister' and the underrated/under- viewed 'Deliver us from evil' (not the documentary), in spite of the flat/underwhelming remake of 'The day the Earth stood still', proves he's more than just apt, or even adept, at playing with all the moving parts he's been handed by the marvel that's team Marvel (mainly the writers). Marvel seems to be hell-bent to better every movie they've made with their next work, including hiring unconventional directors to helm them, beginning with Joss Whedon's selection for the 1st 'Avengers' flick, to SD here, and James Gunn on the GotG flicks (which remain the best Marvel works to date, in my book). <br/><br/>There are, of course, the mandated/necessary nods to the other heroes present in this world, that still revolves around NYC, though it makes more than just 1 non-Sokovia like stop across countries, increasing scope to a level hitherto unseen. <br/><br/>The converted 3D is terrific, and this needs to be fully appreciated on large format 3D screens alone. <br/><br/>Michael Giacchino outdoes himself on the scoring front, though it is not comparable to other great, original works he's done. Apt. <br/><br/>The technical team excels, as they're wont to do, in movies of this scale and size, and all their efforts are available for everyone to enjoy. <br/><br/>The movie also dumbs down its high-concept storytelling, so that noobs to both Marvel and Inception-like imagery, or timeloops, can also have a good time at the movies. A few chase sequences are simply spectacular, though, for me, the conclusion (not including the 2 post end-title sequences) underwhelmed, and brought back bad memories of F4:Silver surfer.<br/><br/>There's a heady mix of humor inherent in almost every serious sequence in the flick, which kind of enhances the entertainment quotient in the overall viewing experience, though not all the jokes land as they should (Wong's response to a quip at the end, which was intended to be ironic, I'm sure, is an example). There are quite a few clichés, and this movie might just have been a notch or two higher without them. <br/><br/>I did wish they'd spent more time exploring exactly how the mystic realms connect to one another, the actual history behind how Dormammu became Dormammu (his true/initial identity, a la, something similar in the 'Deathstalker' books by Simon Green), more characters within, more explanations for why certain minions appear at will and disappear when convenient, but one cannot have it all. <br/><br/>A few of the digital effects harkened back to the much-reviled 'Green lantern' movie, so I was pleasantly surprised that they conceptualized/executed most of it nevertheless.<br/><br/>Having said that, I do think this is an absolutely fantastic effort, and hope to enjoy the sequel better, along with observing Strange's interactions with other heroes in the Marvel multiverse."

","After a brutal collision on a mountainous road, likened a Mulholland Drive or those in Turnbull Canyon, mangles the brain surgeon hands of Dr. Stephen Strange, he embarks upon a desperate search to find some unconventional, breakthrough method that can repair them to their former dexterity, which leads him from New York to Nepal, where he eventually meets a mysterious clan of veritable Sorcerers operating within a secret school inside a temple. Upon their eventual acceptance, he learns the spells and incantations, meditations and gesticulations contained within a plethora of grimoires.<br/><br/>His evilution includes the discovery and development of his own latent powers, extensive knowledge of the occult, and the formulation of his own sigil medallion and personal style. A progression of very familiar qualities naturally ascribed.<br/><br/>There is ""The Ancient One"" {Sorceress who holds more secrets than it seems}, Mordo {a consummate Martial Artist & fellow mystic, akin to a Ninja}, and Wong {unassuming but very capable mystic warrior}. But there is also one to contend against who strayed from the recommended path, so named Kaecilius, who is a Master of The Black Arts.<br/><br/>Much of the practices displayed are based on actual principles of Astral travel, lucid dreaming, visualization and Chi energy projection, as well as extensive sigilization. The overall manipulation of energy and the very matter which comprises multiversal dimensional realities, including teleportation and malleable 'time' fluctuation. Of course, the special effects highly dramatize these more subtle applications, yet it is pleasing to see them addressed nonetheless with the entertaining spectaculars, making it fun as well as recognizable. Realizing from whence these ideas stem adds layers to their appreciation. Also remarkable are the darkly opalescent colorations utilized throughout.<br/><br/>Indeed, among the Dracling's choice comics material, Dr. Strange ranks high among them, so to see him granted his own film is gratifying, and remains a relative psychodramatic, imaginative, and aesthetic inspiration."

","Amazing! As I have pointed out in more than one occasions, I am really a sucker for Marvel movies. I am. But this one was brilliant as well. Filled with action, a nice plot, cool superpowers (or more like human powers) and quite some sense of humor that didn't hurt the story line. <br/><br/>This was an amazing addition to the Marvel universe. A really amazing one. Enjoyed the movie from beginning to end (stay for the last shot a while after the ending titles, as always). Benedict Cumberbatch was a worthy Dr. Strange, indeed, and I can't wait to see him in the next movie that his character will be involved. <br/><br/>Mads Mikkelsen was also brilliant as was Tilda Swinton who was the ideal candidate for the role she had.

"kunalkhandwala","9","0","1","4 December 2016"," Marvel opens the mystic world
","Marvel's superheroes prepare for the eventual onslaught by Thanos in the upcoming Infinity Wars but while their powers can defend Earth from most dangers, they stand little chance from mystical threats. The little known world of sorcerers has its guardians who are tasked with the protection of our world, led by the Ancient One; the sorcerer supreme. When a past apprentice goes rogue and opens gates for the dark power to obliterate Earth, an unlikely wanderer knocks on the door of Kamar-Taj seeking supernatural healing for his irreparable hands. Simply based on his filmography, director Scott Derrickson must have employed some sorcery to convince Marvel and Disney to let him work on such an important character in the Marvel Universe but he delivers a totally unique, spectacular and almost transcendent take on Doctor Strange.<br/><br/>Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a highly accomplished neurosurgeon whose successful career brought with it a burden of arrogance that is deeply knitted into his character. A distracting phone call sends him flying off the side of a mountain in his Lamborghini, resulting in severe injuries especially to his hands. The accident rendered him incapable of performing surgeries and after several futile attempts to revive them, he had lost all hope until he was directed to Kathmandu by a paraplegic who miraculously walked again. Strange arrives at Kamar-Taj. Little known to him are the mystic wonders and powers that lie within and once he is forced to shed his disbelief and inhibitions about things beyond his understanding, he quickly learns directly from the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and Mordo (Chiwetel Eljiofor). As he grasps the possibilities of the mirror dimension, astral planes and the power of spells, the real threat of Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) strikes the 4 sanctums that protect the Earth from the dark dimension. No sooner has Strange barely learned to harness his newfound powers, does he have to wield them to protect the falling sanctums. Meanwhile, his fellow surgeon, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) is perplexed by the stranger things around his mystical appearance whenever he brings in an injured sorcerer or himself to her. Stephen's curiosity also draws him to a secret book owned by the Ancient One from which, Kaecilius had stolen some pages containing powerful time bending spells. Using the closely guarded Eye of Agamotto, Strange views the stolen pages and unleashes a forbidden power that breaks the laws of nature. Strictly warned against such uses of the Eye by Mordo and by the sanctum's guardian, Wong (Benedict Wong), Strange quickly realizes that his trip to Nepal for curing his broken hands now gets him involved in stakes far greater than a revival of his medical career. Kaecilius plans to overcome all the sanctums and break the mystic spell to open the portal for the dark dimension and its sinister lord, Dormammu who will trounce Earth completely. <br/><br/>The showdown of sorcerers occurs at the Hong Kong sanctum with Strange and Mordo's late arrival. The sanctum has already fallen and the dark dimension is entering Earth. Strange's audacious attempt to reverse the effects of Kaecilius' attack involves some persistent negotiation with Dormammu with the help of the time bending powers of an Infinity gem. This is also when Benedict Cumberbatch delivers his his trademark act of a renewed, wise and in-command hero that saves the day. Being an arrogant surgeon with gifted hands wasn't out of his comfort zone at all (Sherlock) but sorcery was a first and he depicted his character's coping with the mystical themes, characters and superhero powers with likable credibility. Cumberbatch will shine brighter among Marvel's other heroes and will certainly maintain his commanding presence as was evident in the mid-credits scene with Thor. Rachel McAdams is sincere with her character and is a welcome addition to the supporting ladies in the Marvelverse. Chiwetel Ejiofor denounces rule-breakers and his dedication to the Ancient One makes him a powerful sorcerer. His role might dramatically change though. Benedict Wong breaks away from the Asian stereotype in Hollywood and rather than being a warrior, he simply remains the guardian of mystical books in an imposing manner that seconds his performance as Kublai Khan on Netflix. Tilda Swinton showcases the wisdom and apprehensions of the Ancient One who has been around long enough. As a mentor to a struggling doctor, she approaches him with sternness, humor and wisdom that makes the mystic world more approachable for Strange. <br/><br/>Scott Derrickson does not compromise with the film's visual appeal. Each magical trick, mystical action and execution of a spell is portrayed with eye popping effects that show us dimensions never seen before. Were it not for Swinton's gradual explanation of the world of sorcery, the visuals were rapid and unabating. Apart from the creative efforts behind making the film, its engaging storyline, the introduction of one of the most interesting Marvel heroes and a superlative performance by Benedict Cumberbatch make 'Doctor Strange' a must watch for comic book fans on IMAX. The sorcerer's growth in mystic abilities and his involvement with the Avengers will only make the upcoming wars more exciting.<br/><br/><ul><li>8.412 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"alinfatu","9","0","1","3 December 2016"," Favorite Marvel Movie Ever
","I will begin this by saying I was hyped about this film since it was announced because I was always attracted to magic and the supernatural and Doctor Strange is one of my favorite Marvel superheroes. PLOT:A simple enough story,a brilliant surgeon's journey from the peak of his career to a ruined man,incapacitated due to an accident.Losing all his money in an attempt to heal his hands,he finds out about a mysterious healer in a place called Kamar-Taj.With his last dollars, he gets a one-way ticket to Nepal to find this place and is introduced like so into a whole new world.He has an affinity for what he discovers to be called ""The Mystic Arts"".He learns and develops quickly but is thrown into a fight with the one who would become his first nemesis,Kaelcilius,too soon.He is almost killed but with the help of his ex-fiancÃ©e,Dr. Christine Palmer(who operates on him) he is saved and returns to the Sanctum Sanctorum.He tries to stop Kaelcilius but needs to be rescued again by his teacher,who is killed and leaves him with a valuable lesson.To finally defeated the Zealots he bargains with their boss,catching him into a time loop for all eternity if he does not call his servants off and sets everything right.In the end his ex-friend and mentor,Mordo goes on a quest of finding himself and ends up becoming a sorcerer murderer. Characters: 1)Dr.Stephen Strange:Benedict portrays him amazingly and is always on point with the character.I liked his journey and how he changed and grew to see that he is just a tiny bit of an infinite multiverse.He was pretty good using magic and I hope he will develop quicker to the Sorcerer Supreme. 2)The Ancient One:My favorite character in the movie.She is a wise teacher,has the best quotes,best battle scenes,best entrances and an amazing battle costume.I loved how even she was aware that for higher goals she needed to cross the line and do things she teaches against and also isn't proud of. 3)Kaelcilius:A tragedy of love brought him to Kamar-Taj where he ascended to the rank of master.Tired of following The Ancient One and still haunted by the death of his loved he seeks to stop time,to give his new teacher,Dormammu our world.Mads was amazing in the role,his whole ideology of time as the enemy of humans and them longing for eternity is interesting and really on point.He briefly achieved his goal,a shame he became a mindless one. 4)Karl Mordo:Another prominent student,who doesn't ask questions,doesn't contradict and is pretty adamant about trust and has lots of issues with bending the rules.He was very disappointing and boring and his only interesting feat was that he became a villain. 5)Wong:Decent but underused character,he will surely be seen a lot in the later movies as Strange's right hand. Magic:We are introduced to magic as an energy harnessed from various dimensions to create things of need,to conjure spells.An interesting take on such a vague but intriguing subject. Post-Credit Scenes: 1)Thor scene:takes place in 2017 with Thor asking our Doctor(has gloves,seems more powerful,informed) for help to find his father,trapped on Earth.He accepts with the condition that they would leave our realm as soon as they are reunited. 2)Mordo scene:He went on a quest of getting rid of all the sorcerers of Earth. Overall:A very decent movie with amazing special effects and super acting.A mus see."

The movie was absolutely hysterical and the non-verbal faces etc were on point. His cape was one of my favorite characters, reminded me a lot of the carpet from Aladdin. I'm not sure if the graphics and CGI would've been capable 10 years ago but in this film it was amazing. I will tell you if you don't like hospital scenes, this movie may not be for you.

"ElPresidenteObamame","9","0","1","23 November 2016"," Visual splendor!
","I was slightly worried heading into the movie, but I ended up really enjoying it. <br/><br/>The main takeaway is that it actually feels like it is worth the price of admission. It isn't perfect but it never dips too low in quality, and when it soars, it really flies high. The visuals were fantastic and the characters were great. For a first movie it avoided being overly expository in general by weaving the explanations into the plot... So many Marvel movies just dump ""how it all works"" on you straight up, it was nice to have things shown more incidentally as part of the story.<br/><br/>For me this is one of the best Marvel films that has been made. It's definitely better than the latest Avengers or X-Men movies.<br/><br/>Even when it threatens to get boring with overdone and overlong action sequences, it manages to create some new wrinkles in the story to develop some interest. <br/><br/>I feel like this is one of the best treatments of a Marvel superhero yet done in film. Unlike 90% of their universe Dr. Strange actually bears hallmarks of being a real person. The only other character with this level of personality development would be Deadpool in my view. The other characters like Wolverine for example, I hate to say, just seem so one dimensional by comparison.<br/><br/>Hopefully this is a sign of things to come for the Marvel Universe!"

","This film has everything! The character development at first does seem very rushed even for an origin story but by the end of the film you will find that the recipe was just right. The movie is extremely heavy on the special effects but it is well balanced with a story-line that involves the teaching of selflessness and the pain of betrayal. I suggest this film for all types of viewers though I do caution that at times the special effects do feel a bit overbearing. This is a must see for any fan of the Marvel films and as for the fans of the comic book character I do strongly believe this is one of the few movie adaptions of a comic book that strays very little from the original story."

The visual effects were outstanding and at a high complexity with highly creative visuals. The also action sequences were also mind-bending. I did not watch it in 3D as the cinema I went to no longer showed it in 3D, but if you can, I believe watching in 3D would have been a great choice for this film.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend watching this film, especially if you are into visual effects.

","The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is one of the biggest franchises and sits right in the league of franchises like James Bond, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Harry Potter and Pirates of the Caribbean. The thing that unites these universes is that people will never get tired of watching these movies. Doctor Strange is the 14th movie in the MCU continuity, and is the 6th origin story. It has all the elements of an origin story; an arrogant genius/talented man, a pretty dame, a skeptical trainer, a bad guy who isn't a bad guy, and a CGI character.<br/><br/>But one of the winning factors for Doctor Strange is its innovative camera work and its mind-boggling visual effects. The comic elements are well placed and the seriousness of the situation is well emphasized. Benedict Cumberbatch returns as Doctor Stephen Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme, whose character flaws are very similar to the iconic Sherlock Holmes that Benedict is best known for. Despite this gaping flaw, Dr. Strange manages to widen the gaze of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>From flying mutants to Super soldiers, Geniuses to monsters, androids to Gods, The MCU has given us a fantasy world that we have made our own. Among these heavy weights, Doctor Strange seems like the new kid who brought his own football to the field.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw in this story is that of the casting of Tilda Swinton. Though for the normal Marvel fan this may be okay, but for those fans who breathe comics, making the Ancient One a forty something, pale and bald lady is not right. No offense to Tilda, she is a fine actress. But this role would have suited an Asian or Indian man better, since they have based Kamar-Taj in Kathmandu.<br/><br/>This movie is a must watch, and there are a hundred Easter eggs dropped your way. PS. look out for Chris Hemsworth in the Mid-Credits scene (the man really loves beer, and Ben being the Brit offers him Tea)."

Benedict Cumberbatch as always deliverers an exceptional performance. I couldn't conjure a better actor for the part of Dr. Stephen Strange. He not only naturally projects the image of intellect but also innate good. The only comparison to Tilda Swifton's performance is that to her remarkable performance in Constantine, in which I was truly investor in her character. Like in this movie she projects a strong presence. Chiwetel Ejiofor whom is magnificent in 12 years a Slave, American Gangster, Children of Men and the Martian, of which I wouldn't put a comparison to his persona in this movie. I would more liken his character to that of which he played in Serenity, which to me encompassed him as an actor for more than the latter. In short, a great movie for both the Marvel comic book fan and Marvel movie fan alike."

","Doctor Strange is a very mystical and ""strange"" movie. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), an arrogant neurosurgeon, gets into a car accident. The accident disables his hands which effects his reputation. When doctors and science fail him he goes to get help from the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) who practices complex eastern medicine. From there he practices the ""magic"" and learns that there are other dimensions of existence, and some nonviolent, others waiting to attack. On his journey he gets curious in the library and opens one of the Ancient One's books to find pages missing. Stephen Strange can't resist his curiosity and uses the Eye of Agamotto, a necklace that contains the infinity time stone in it; the wearer is given the ability to manipulate time, to look at the missing pages. Dr. Strange gets interrupted by the libraries protector, Wong (Benedict Wong), who tells him about the pages and the only way to protect the world from the dark dimension is the three sanctum's, New York, London, and Hong Kong. Behind the attacks is Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), a former student of the Ancient One that gave into the darkness. This movie was well-directed by Scott Derrickson and was left open for a sequel. The special effects were realistic, and it felt like you were a part of the movie. Marvel fans have set their standards high and this movie met this fan's expectations. If there will be any sequels in the future, I would go see them."

","I now officially have more disliked reviews than liked reviews on this website. I'm going to keep on making these reviews because I still love film. I mean no ill will towards anyone and only wish to speak my opinion. Anyway, this was one of the best Marvel movies ever made! Yeah, you can expect every Marvel movie now to be in the Cinematic Universe. I am not that familiar with Doctor Strange but certainly recognize the character and his powers. Is a sorcerer the same as a wizard? I'm pretty sure it's similar. You could compare it to Harry Potter, I suppose.<br/><br/>Except that this was for me, better than any Harry Potter movie! Honestly, this had some of the most wonderful visuals I have ever seen in a film. There's seriously not a moment where it looks like a special effect. I don't know if most of the effects were practical. What matters is that it looks amazing no matter what it was made with. Was I getting some ""Inception"" vibe from this movie? You know, with all the buildings being curled around and everything. There's just so much creativity and they use this crazy world to its fullest potential. I love it when films create amazing places and do so much with them. I recognized most of the characters or at least by their names.<br/><br/>This story is pretty basic with a surgeon literally named Doctor Strange becoming a sorcerer while trying to heal his hands. I've seen some movies based on the character. In fact, I think the 1978 TV movie version may have been the first Marvel movie ever made. I saw that and this was kind of like it, only it was actually good. Yes, I admit some of the story doesn't make that much sense like how he suddenly gets these powers so quickly. It doesn't matter, because it looks so awesome. As with other Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, it has a great sense of humor. Some of the jokes are a bit expected, but always entertaining. Be sure to watch during the credits and then after the credits. We get most of the characters we want to see here. A treat for everyone! ****"

It is hard to figure out the list of other actors who were being considered for the role of Doctor Strange (Colin Farrell, Jake Gyllenhaal, Tom Hardy, Ethan Hawke Jack Huston, Oscar Isaac, Jared Leto, Matthew McConaughey, Ewan McGregor, Keanu Reeves, Justin Theroux, Jon Hamm, Johnny Depp, & Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Benedict nails it, with a nice American accent I might add. <br/><br/>There are a few references to other Marvel movies throughout the film as well as some during the end credits scenes, but other than that, it is very easy to forget that this film is yet another film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film does not rely on any of the past successes of Marvel movies to build momentum for this film to be successful as well. It is a standalone from the rest. <br/><br/>Doctor Strange is not a normal superhero and this allows the movie to stay away from being a normal superhero movie. So if the genre of ""Superhero Movies"" is something that you are not into, I would encourage you to see this movie as its own thing."

","After capturing fans' fascination in several movies and TV series, Benedict Cumberbatch is the star of Marvel Comics' new movie, Doctor Strange. In this latest Marvel production, Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch), a renowned neurosurgeon, suffers from severe nerve damage to his hands, leaving them permanently shaking. When none of the experimental surgeries work to fix his hands' instability, Strange discovers a man named Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt), who somehow healed himself, after experiencing similar injuries. <br/><br/>Following Pangborn's instructions, Strange travels to a place called Karmar-Taj, where he meets the mysterious Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). All of sudden, Strange finds himself being thrown into a world of wizards and sorcerers, where he learns to create portals and weapons of energy, and even how to eventually heal himself. <br/><br/>Along Strange's journey to learn the mystic arts, he meets several other sorcerers, such as the skilled warrior, Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the blunt librarian, Wong (Benedict Wong), and the Sorcerer Supreme who teaches the wizards of Karmar-Taj, the Ancient One (Swinton). While there, Strange discovers the powerful Eye of Agamotto, which he uses to fight the former student of Karmar-Taj, Kaecilius, and the dreaded lord of the Dark World, Dormammu. <br/><br/>Directed by Scott Derrickson, Doctor Strange brings a whole new aspect to the Marvel world that fans have never seen before. Whereas other superheroes use technology as their power, Dr. Strange's power comes directly from magic and the magical relics which he discovers in Karmar-Taj. The relics are mentioned as magical objects that choose sorcerers, and enhance their power. The Cloak of Levitation, a red cloak with a mind of its own, chose Dr. Strange as its sorcerer.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange lives up to fans expectations in both visual effects and in the actors' performances. Much of movie is set in a different dimension, such as the Mirror Dimension, and has many scenes where the physical world is being bent into different patterns. One of the fascinating aspects of the movie is how much of the action happens while the characters are in their astral form, floating above their physical body. <br/><br/>Several times in the movie, the Infinity Stones are alluded to, and much the movie leads up to the next Avengers movie, Avengers: Infinity War.<br/><br/>The movie has several scenes with medical/surgical procedures, but they're not overly graphic. While there are multiple scenes with fighting and violence, they are more emotional, rather than bloody. Doctor Strange is rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and action throughout the movie, and an intense crash scene. The movie runs 1 hour and 55 minutes."

I knew very little about the mysterious Doctor Strange but, the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch had me very very intrigued. Superheroes don't always leap off the page and rarely do they leap off the screen. My favorites happen to be Ironman, Thor and now Doctor Strange! Everyone said that they could see no one else play Ironman except Robert Downey, Jr....I happen to think Chris Hemsworths Thor is pretty damn awesome and now I find that I really love Doctor Strange! Of course the great storytelling and the brilliant cast didn't hurt! The special effects were, as usual totally mind blowing but, the actors were so compelling. Some of the best scenes were with Wong the librarian and Strange. If you want to bring a super hero to the big screen the number one thing you need to do is get TOP NOTCH actors in the roles and this one did. I am really looking forward to seeing Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange for many movies to come.....he may not get Oscar nods for this portrayal but I hope he makes a of of money and plays Doctor Strange for a very long time!"

You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>First, we have Doctor Strange, an immediately interesting character even without foreknowledge of his coming Sorcerer Supremeness. They wrote in character moments, but it's the brilliant Cumberbatch who brings every bit as much of his extraordinary talent to a comic book hero as he does to Richard the Third. In his exchange with fellow doctor and former lover Christine Palmer, he shows us the arrogance (well-earned by his skill) and narcissism (a result of too many admirers) but he also gives us the subtle edge of vulnerability, and the director has the very good sense to stay on the face of this most eloquent without dialogue actor.<br/><br/>The journey to find his teacher, the relationships he forges, the character arc that the film wisely takes time to establish, all draw us further and further into our own relationship with this character.<br/><br/>For the non-tent-pole-action-flick-fan, the movie is beautiful, the action not mindless or overweening, and the final solution to the problem unique. Here at the end, when Doctor Strange chooses self-sacrifice and the writers choose to honor the deeper mysticism behind the magic, we find a new solution to defeating evil that does not involve a bigger better form of blowing stuff up.<br/><br/>You can take kids ten and over if you want. But mostly, just go. Eat a bunch of popcorn, have a great time and be swept up in a the story of a new hero."

","Oh how it's such a brilliant idea to have Cumberbatch as the ""Dr Strange"". He honestly should've been the original in the first place, he has the looks, the wittiness, the personality and the accent to be acted as the original Dr Strange. I loved the interesting effects in this like the buildings were moving on different directions.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams and Cumberbatch are just such a cute couple, I felt sorry for his character in the beginning like, it's not easy coming out of a car crash and trying to find the best help he gets. I also thought the cape was quite hilarious when it was bashing the bejaysus out of one of the bad guys! I so want that cape if it was real, it's just awesome to have a useful cape who would help ya along the way!<br/><br/>I honestly thought Tilda Swinton was awesome too and boy, her stunts were absolutely incredible. She even looks good with a bald head! It's too bad her character was killed off in the end because like, she helped Dr Strange come out of his shell. That's unfortunately what Marvel movies do, kill off good characters! <br/><br/>It was even good to see Stan Lee in the bus laughing at himself. God he really isn't tired of his work and that's one of the greatest things he's ever done, appear on all the Marvel movies that at new and old! <br/><br/>What can I say about this movie, great acting, great visual effects, great cast and most of all, the story line was just really clever. I give this a 9/10 rating!"

","Doctor Strange makes his big screen debut in this 2nd MCU film release for this year. Was it worth the wait and hype? I can indeed admit it was as it showcases incredible talent in visual effects, character development and expanding the universe of Mavel that we know from the previous phrases of the MCU.<br/><br/>This origin story of Steven Strange, follows from his career as a successful surgeon to Master Sorcerer is indeed a worthy watch. It has the key elements that made Iron Man, Captain America and Ant Man all worthy origin stories.<br/><br/>What really makes the film an enjoyable viewing is several factors, firstly the visual effects are taken to incredible levels of detail and imagine since CGI has been a heavily used factor in film. With effects consisting of revolving buildings, rotating mechanics, supernatural powers and great dimensions of beyond, this is the best showcase of how CGI can make a film believable Secondly, in terms of casting this was an impressive showcase of actors and actresses that make their roles so great and developed. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the lead hero that suits him perfectly, with touches of Sherlock while maintaining the traits of any Marvel origin hero, he gives a perfectly balanced performance. His character starts off as a bit of a fool who is only concerned for himself and his talent but as his journey progresses he is turned into a character that we can cheer and care for. Tilda Sweaton is a great casting choice too, giving us a character that seems to be a strong minded figure for Strange while we learn of her purpose in the film, setting further development on a secondary character that leads to the possibility of a villain to appear in the sequel.<br/><br/>Mads Mikkelsen is known for his villainous roles in film and here he shines again giving us a villain that definitely fits on the list of best villains in the MCU. Rachel McAdams plays as the love interest to Strange, giving her best as usual and the film doesn't heavily rely on the love sector but it does show a connection and purpose to the leading hero. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays as the aiding ally Modor, who is given a great dose of character establishment and development who helps Strange on his journey and further establish his future in the later sequel to be confirmed.<br/><br/>The script itself was great, with plenty of supernatural themes, character development, exciting set pieces and a pace that is not rushed throughout though it may be slow for some but the CD and unexpected humour may make it redeemable entertainment value. The direction overall is on point, with Scott Dereckson's eye on the supernatural elements, story and character taken to great detail based on the source material it is based upon. Music as well is great, with touches of epic tones, psychedelic 60's vibes and character themes.<br/><br/>Doctor Strange overall is a technically visual accomplishment that will indeed win the fans respect and connection to the source material, with a cast that seem so perfect and set pieces that go beyond our minds, it's worth seeing and will not disappoint Marvel fans.<br/><br/>4.5/5 - Nick"
