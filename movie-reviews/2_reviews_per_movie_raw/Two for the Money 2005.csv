"christian123","6","55","66","2 April 2006"," Al Pacino is always worth betting on.
","Mathew McConaughey is Brandon Lane, a former football star recruited by Walter Abraham (Al Pacino), the head of a sports consulting firm to help them set the line for their sports betting business. Lane's ability to predict the outcome of games quickly turns him into a golden boy, but it soon becomes apparent that he's bitten off more than he can chew when his abilities start to falter.<br/><br/>Two for the Money is a forgettable, generic thriller that doesn't really offer anything new. The film does have some entertaining moments and the first half of the movie is actually pretty exciting to watch. But, the second half is really slow and very tedious. It just drags on and on and for no reason either. It could have been a nice 90 minute movie but the story is stretched out into a two hour film. Luckily, Al Pacino is in the movie and he keeps the film exciting. He gives a good, over the top performance and he pretty much raises the film up to mediocrity. Personally, sports betting isn't that interesting to me but Al Pacino makes it interesting. He can turn a bad script into an okay movie which is what he does with the film. Let's be honest, the script is not very good and the direction is weak. It's so obvious where things are going which is not surprising because this is the same guy that made Taking Lives.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is playing mentor to Matthew McConaughey and their chemistry together isn't very strong. McConaughey is a pretty weak actor and he can't keep up with Pacino. The lead role should have gone to someone else. Rene Russo is okay as Pacino's wife. She gives a decent performance but she was a little too bland to truly stand out. Another thing about the film that people may not like is that every character is unlikable. It's hard to care for these characters because they are either pretty mean or bland. It didn't really bother me because I watched the film to be entertained and I did get some entertainment value from the movie. In the end, if you like Al Pacino then you should give the film a shot, if you don't then just skip it. Rating 6/10"
"TOMASBBloodhound","7","37","44","2 April 2006"," Worth betting on, for the most part.
","Two for the Money is a decent, diverting picture. The material at times seems a little beneath these fine actors, but the film ends up hitting enough of the right notes to make it worth seeing.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey would seem a little out of his league on the same screen with Al Pacino and Rene Russo. By the end of the film, you will most likely feel that he's more than held his own, however. McConaughey plays a former college football star who sees his chances of a professional career destroyed by a serious injury. He quickly finds himself picking college football games for a low-rent betting line. With all of his past experience as a player, he does quite well with it. Well enough to attract the attention of Al Pacino, who runs a more up-scale operation in New York. By the end of the first half hour, McConaughey is picking all kinds of football winners, and making Pacino a ton of money. As you would expect, this success does not last very long as various egos spiral out of control and the betting gods turn on our heroes as they eventually do to all of us. The film is more of a character study about the minds of gamblers and lost identity than it is about the workings of an actual betting organization. Overall, it works on a couple different levels.<br/><br/>Pacino is fine, but not as out of control as you might hope. His character has a bad heart, so any typical Pacino tantrums are not really in order for him. He brings as much dignity as one could to the role of an addicted gambler, though. Rene Russo is terrific as his long-suffering wife and a former junkie. Pacino at some points seems to be trying to lose her to McConaughey. He being one of those terribly afflicted gamblers who only feels alive when he's just lost everything he wagered. The supporting cast is pretty good, too. Jeremy Piven is always appreciated, and so is the appearance by Armand Assante.<br/><br/>The best scene in the film takes place at a betting support group meeting that Pacino and his new protégé walk in on. Pacino, being a hopeless gambler himself shows empathy toward these degenerates, then has the nerve to pass out his business card to them!!! The logic I guess being that if you people have to lose, you might as well do it through a fellow degenerate gambler.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw I noticed was too many shots of McConaughey without his shirt on. Yes, the guy has great abs, but we don't need to see so much of them!! Overall this is a good film with some interesting things to say about people who bet. Notice how in the end, the ""experts"" are really just like the guys they take calls from. During the big games, we're all just sitting there with a beer in our hand, hanging by every first down or dropped ball.<br/><br/>7 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","In Vegas, after breaking the knee in a game, the former promising football player Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey) has to work in a phone service foreseeing the results of the games due to the lack of professional options. After many successful predictions, he is invited by Walter Abrams (Al Pacino) to move to Manhattan and work with him in his gambling advising business. Brandon changes his name and personality, becomes famous advising clients and close to Walter's family, and a good friend of his wife, the owner of a hairdresser saloon Toni Morrow (Rene Russo). When the predictions of Brandon fail, he feels that it is time to return home.<br/><br/>""Two for the Money"" is a good entertainment, mainly because it is based on a true story, inclusive in the DVD there is an interview of the screenplay writer with the real Brandon. The story partially discloses an illegal business that deals with billions of dollars, and keeps the interest until the end, without being exceptional or unforgettable. Al Pacino, Matthew McConaughey and Rene Russo make this film worth. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Tudo Por Dinheiro"" (""All for Money"")"
"jotix100","7","71","102","28 October 2005"," The odds
","There is a scene at the beginning of the film that seems to set the tone of ""Two for the Money"". We watch as Walter Abrams is talking on the phone with someone who will not be able to provide an elephant for his daughter's birthday party. Walter barks to his assistant, ""Get me Ringling"". When the call finally comes through, he demands to know whether he is talking to Barnum or Bailey, which is a funny line. Wasn't P.T. Barnum himself the man famous for that quotation about a sucker being born every minute? <br/><br/>Walter Abrams is a man who is in the sports betting business. He and his associates stand to make millions out of the jerks they pursue to do their betting with his firm. Having found a new rising star, Brandon Lang, a man that knows a lot about the intricacies of point spreads and picking winners. Walter wants to transforms him into a man who can bring more money into his outfit.<br/><br/>In order to do that, Walter must groom him to ""look"" the part. As such, Brandon becomes John Anthony, the man who can produce fabulous results every week end during the football series. Brandon gets to meet the insiders, but little does he know who he is dealing with, or much less, what is expected of him. After all, he is just as good as the winners he can produce.<br/><br/>The film, directed by D. J. Caruso, a man who has worked extensively in television, has a glossy look. The screen play by Dan Gilroy could have used some tighter editing, because at two hours it feels a bit long.<br/><br/>Al Pacino, as Walter, has some good moments; we have seen him in better roles, and this one is a composite of other things he has done before. Mr. Pacino compensates when the screen play is not going anywhere by applying an intensity that doesn't go well with the others playing opposite him. Matthew McConaughey is a light weight actor who, aside from his good looks, doesn't bring anything to this story. Rene Russo is obviously a tall woman who towers over Mr. Pacino in most of their scenes together. Their relationship doesn't come across as being a real thing. Jeremy Piven and Armand Assante make good contributions in supporting the principals.<br/><br/>While ""Two for the Money"" is by no means a horrible film, it just doesn't have anything new to say."
"matthew-910","7","37","51","25 March 2006"," Al Pacino IS this film
","Al Pacino carries this film all by himself.<br/><br/>I can't think of a way that this could have been made without Pacino. Sure, Matthew McConaughey and Rene Russo gave convincing performances, but Pacino makes you feel sorry for the miserable, empty shell of a man he is.<br/><br/>The plot was amazingly intricate and well carried, but (once again) without Pacino it would not have been delivered nearly as well. I think that they should have found a way to include a small explanation as to how sports betting works, so the fans who came in just to see Pacino would be able to understand how it works. Also, at times the movie just dragged on and on and on...<br/><br/>I still think that Al Pacino is that movie. Pacino really extends himself the way he always does to keep the movie alive and moving. His character was one of the most miserable men I have ever seen, and while i hated him, I still identified a small part of myself with him, and that is the sign of a truly great actor.<br/><br/>7/10"
"gradyharp","8","44","64","18 January 2006"," For the Actors
","TWO FOR THE MONEY takes on the topic of Sports Gambling and makes a serious attempt to turn it into a movie. The story is apparently based on a true one (as per the opening screen statement) but it is from the pen of Dan Gilroy that the well-drawn characters are realized. DJ Caruso (Smallville, The Salton Sea, The Shield) knows his way around matters such as these and his pacing is fine, allowing for the isolated 'arias' in the film to work well. The problem, for this viewer, is the topic: how interesting can bilking chronic gamblers over football game wagers possibly be? The story is related by Brandon Long (Matthew McConaughey) who begins life as a sports hero and just at the moment when he is ready to break in to the Pro Football domain, he fractures his leg in a winning touchdown. Six years later, and still dreaming of making it as a player of football, finds him in the numbers game with a talent for picking winning teams and calling 900 numbers to urge gullible people t place bets according to his predictions. Enter Alter Abrams (Al Pacino), a recovering Gambler who is making it big in the sports gambling arena. He coerces Brandon to join him in New York, wines him, dines him with the aid of his smart and beautiful wife Toni (Rene Russo), and in no time Brandon Long takes on the persona of John Anthony and makes it big as a TV personality who successfully bilks willing gambling people out of their money. Long as Anthony takes on a life of his own and it is the conflagration between the creator Abrams and the protégé Anthony that fleshes out the film.<br/><br/>Interesting to a point, the story loses steam in the last half and we soon lose interest in the outcome or the characters. And not that that is the fault of the actors! Al Pacino is very effective as the reformed gambler still fighting demons and Rene Russo is as beautiful as ever, acting her role with complete conviction and holding what is left of the story, once started, together. Matthew McConaughey spends much of the movie without his shirt on which is a major contribution to the visuals of the film! Buff and beautiful he manages to keep the heart of Brandon Long beating inside the persona of John Anthony.<br/><br/>Not a great movie by any means, but some truly fine acting from the trio of stars. The supporting cast also gives solid roles despite the skimpy script. If gambling of any sort, and sports gambling in particular, is of interest to you, then this is a movie to recommend. Otherwise see it for the actors, not the story. Grady Harp"

","* Spoiler alert *<br/><br/>As astounding waste of time, talent and yes, money, ""Two for the Money"" varies from predictable to preposterous to unpleasant without pausing for entertainment.<br/><br/>A top-flight cast, plus Matthew McConaughey, tries to put a palatable spin on the saga of a sports betting firm preying on gullible customers who should instead be in Gamblers Anonymous.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter Dan Gilroy has a strong facility for finding old clichés in new settings, crafting a tale of boy-meets-boy, boy-makes-boy-money, boy-loses-boy-money, oh-who-cares.<br/><br/>McConaughey is a washed-up football player trying to rehabilitate an injury and making ends meet through a betting tips show. There's a surface plausibility that he has some insights into college football as a former player, which gets him customers.<br/><br/>In swoops Al Pacino as the owner of a high-flying betting service. He brings Matthew to New York to pick pro games, setting him up with a posh apartment and work-out room to offer beefcake shots of McConaughey for his fans of various lifestyles.<br/><br/>Gedde Watanabe stands in for all the hapless betters relying on the service. When McConaughey hits big with his initial picks, Watanabe gets gulled into anteing up more. Unfortunately, the power goes to Matt's pretty head. Immediately. He has one good week, and then is off to play golf instead of researching games.<br/><br/>Pacino is fine with this. Infatuated with his new boy toy, he fires long-time associate Jeremy Piven. Rene Russo plays Al's very tolerant wife _ you see, she knows that he's a gambling addict himself. There's no difference between Al and his customers, except that he's taking their money to enable his own bets. Always watchable, Piven gets out of the movie with his dignity intact, and Russo is her usual reliable self.<br/><br/>But Pacino is in full ""hoo-ha"" mode as he tries to inject some life into his empty character. At that, Gilroy gives him more to work with then the rest of the cast. As one of Al's employees, super-skinny Carly Pope stands around in the background of multiple scenes while getting perhaps 10 words of dialogue. Her big scene is sliding into McConaughey's lap to kiss him for his good work. One can't help thinking of Susan St. James snuggling up with Rock Hudson in ""McMillan and Wife.""<br/><br/>Gilroy's script is so inept that he can't even realistically portray the ebb-and-flow of games. After things go wrong and McConaughey tries to get back on track, there's a scene where the football team he's picked goes up over the spread with two minutes to play. It's just the sort of situation in a real game where the other team would push for a quick score. But in Gilroy's world, Matt's colleagues immediately start celebrating their success, and then are stunned when the other team scores. (And of course, the teams playing are always ""New York,"" never Houston or Tampa Bay.)<br/><br/>By the end, after ruining Watanabe, getting threatened by mobster types, and (attention guys!) showing off more of his physique, McConaughey decides to return to oblivion, but not without leaving Al his very special Super Bowl pick. Will Pacino use it and keep his shell game afloat? Never has a big game seemed so small."

","Matthew McConaughey is Brandon Lang, a former college football star who devastated his knee and was never able to play professionally. Six years later he's recording ""sports predictions"" for a 1-900 number in Las Vegas and living with his mom and younger brother, still dreaming of playing professional football one day. He never hears from the Cowboys, but he does get a call from Walter Abrams (the Godfather himself, Al Pacino), an entrepreneur who runs his own sports betting business, inviting him to move to New York and work for him.<br/><br/>Though Brandon Lang is the hero of the story, Walter Abrams is the beating heart of Two For The Money. He's a recovered gambling addict who runs his own empire of ""sports betting advisers."" No other film has ever explored the psyche of the gambling addict so precisely and intimately. Abrams describes what it feels like to win, but even more fascinatingly, he discusses the addict's subconscious desire to loose it all. Gambling addicts don't bury themselves in debt because they're sure they can win. They do it because they need to loose everything to feel alive.<br/><br/>Two For The Money is better than I expected. The characters are rich and complex and the story is never dull. Hell, this movie is worth seeing for the topless McConaughey shots alone."
"TheMovieMark","7","30","50","6 October 2005"," A sampling of the ugliness of the sports gambling life ensues...
","Networks can't talk about it. The government can't tax it. Yet sports betting is a $200 billion a year business. A business that strives to exploit every vulnerability, manipulate every gullibility, and convince the client that it can provide them certainty in an uncertain world.<br/><br/>Two for the Money is the story of one man's journey into the sports gambling world. Matthew McConaughey delivers one of his more impressive performances as he transforms from Brandon Lang, the smooth-talking golden boy, into John Anthony - ""The Million Dollar Man with the Billion Dollar Plan."" A transformation that comes complete with a new suit, a new car, a new attitude, and slicked back hair - a sure-fire movie sign that corruption or a loss of innocence is imminent.<br/><br/>Portraying a character that must deal with this corruption of innocence, McConaughey demonstrates that he can act with more than just his dimples and down-home Southern charm. Lang is a machine. He knows the teams, the leagues, the players, the game. All he does is work out and pick winners, two facts made abundantly clear by McConaughey's propensity to walk around shirtless just as often as he makes football picks. I may have rolled my eyes once or twice, but I heard nary a complaint from the ladies in the audience. Except for that one that looked a little like my Uncle Larry.<br/><br/>Lang's corruption rests solely on the fragile shoulders of Walter Abrams, a sleazy character played so effortlessly by Al Pacino that you can't help but feel slightly disturbed by the ease with which he seems capable of tainting ambitious young men. Screaming less than usual, Pacino's portrayal is nothing short of an indictment of those sports advisors who feed on the weak. Sports gambling may be illegal in 46 states, but Abrams is well aware that ""sports advising"" (the politically correct preference, no doubt) is not. Despite the false promise of certainty, sports advising is presented as more used car salesmanship than mathematical study. Figure out your client's needs, and get his money. That's the name of the game. As for actually picking a winner? It's 50-50. A flip of the coin.<br/><br/>Sure, Lang is able to compile a pretty impressive hot streak, but what happens when it comes to a crashing halt? The peaks are indeed very high when the fun and money are flowing, but is it worth the lesson learned when your family is threatened and you're hit with the realization of what losing $380,000 can do to a family? <br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie would have proved more effective if there had been a greater emphasis on the devastation of the lows of losing. Consequences are touched but never fully realized. I would have also liked less predictability in a movie about a very unpredictable lifestyle, but Two for the Money still succeeds in giving the audience a glimpse of what gets in the minds of those willing to gamble. Is it about the game? Is it about the money? Or, as Abrams believes, is it about the risk some people are willing to take to feel what they perceive as being alive?<br/><br/>The dialogue and character interaction happen at a quick enough pace to grab and seal your attention, and while the last act is somewhat weighed down by the two-hour runtime and the semi-sappy melodrama of plans gone awry, Money still manages to convince the audience to care about whether or not Brandon can get back to where he began - the purity of the game.<br/><br/>You want certainty in an uncertain world? Then put your money on obligatory shirtless Matthew McConaughey scenes and Pacino's incisors getting a nice scene-chewing workout. It's a safer bet than trusting your money with the decision-making of those who care more about the profit than they do about you.<br/><br/>THE GIST <br/><br/>Two for the Money will prove to be most enjoyable to those with some familiarity or interest with sports and the gambling side of the business. But McConaughey and Pacino deliver enough laughs and energy to make this more accessible to those with little knowledge of the subject matter. If you have your doubts about this one then don't worry about spending the big bucks to see it on the big screen - it'll make for a good rental."
"PersianPlaya408","7","27","46","21 January 2006"," A mediocre film, far from reality
","This film is not as bad as many say, its a decent film about sports betting. I give the director credit for keeping it interesting as this film could have potentially been a bore. However there were some problems with the script, mainly the last act which was not logical. The acting and smart direction from Caruso save this project. Although it isn't a terribly convincing film, Pacinos performance allows is to not be a total disappointment. McConaughey was good as well, casted well in his role. Jeremy Piven was great in his supporting role, but Armand Assante was bad, boy does he not know how to perform lines and be convincing while doing it. Most of my problems with this film was Dan Gilroys screenplay which although at times smart, and entertaining, all in all not concise and consistent. 7/10"
"punkin_flats","8","11","17","20 February 2006"," Funny dialogue, had me laughing out loud
","I went into watching ""Two For The Money"" cold- had not read anything about. I enjoyed it! Pacino had some hilarious dialogue. I kept on laughing throughout the movie at his witticisms. I read some other postings, yes, Russo was towering over Pacino as his wife. I would take this that Pacino was secure in his life and could handle having a tall woman walk with him. We all know Russo was a fashion model in real life. Many short, powerful men want a woman like that. As to another posting, yes Matt M. was a light-weight, but boy did he give beefcake appeal! I liked his shirtless scenes. Who cares if the boy can act?? Then shock of shocks, one of my 70's favorite actors popped up- -Armand Assante! I was so happy to see him! I wish he had more screen time. Seeing three of the four actors/actresses as big names, I was happy overall with the movie. The running time flew by for me."

","I saw a preview in Hollyweird last week at the Mann's Chinese. This film rocks. Reminded me of Oliver Stone's Wall Street, except it is set in the sports gambling world. A world I knew nothing about, until now. Pacino has two classic moments. The first is in a Gambler's Anonymous meeting and the second is in an airport in Puerto Rico. Matthew McConhaughy has never ever been better. His character Brandon provides him a stellar challenge and he rises to the task. I imagine going toe to toe with Al Pacino had a lot to do with that. Rene Russo is solid and in a surprising way, her character ends up providing the glue that holds the entire film together. Check it out, if you liked Wall Street, The Gambler and even Devils Advocate, this movie is for you. Pacino...Pacino...Pacino."
"Howlin Wolf","5","4","5","25 May 2008"," A tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing much...
","I know that Pacino is a big fan of Shakespeare, so I thought I'd paraphrase old Will there to encapsulate how I felt about this warmed-over assembly of things that any alert audience has seen Al do before.<br/><br/>He's one of my favourite actors, but it's hard not to say that some of his choices of late have been extremely lazy. I thought Walter Abrams was exactly like Walter Burke in The Recruit, except - ironically for a movie linked to gambling - the stakes weren't as high by the time he came around to doing it all again in Two for the Money. Unlike many people, I also enjoy the frequent 'shouty' aspects of his method - but come on, just because you're good at being loud doesn't mean you have to play a demagogue over and over again. Vincent Hanna in ""Heat"" was often loud, for instance, but he wasn't an overtly controlling, manipulative master of his universe like we see in ""The Devil's Advocate""; ""Any Given Sunday""; ""The Recruit"", or indeed here...<br/><br/>Not to mention that this movie doesn't even do a very good job of showing an infrequent gambler like myself how the true expert ""has to lose it all just to feel like they're alive"". I don't buy this kind of talk that the movie peddles, at all. It feels too much like conventional wisdom that's been perverted and inverted, to me. I've heard of gamblers being in it for the 'highs and lows', but never for the 'lows and lows'. If that psychology were true, then a punter who loses a ton of money and soon finds themselves living in a cardboard box and eating from a dumpster still wouldn't have a problem. Why?! Because they'd be happy! Yet I've heard tales of lots of gamblers who are desperately unhappy with their lot, find it a miserable experience to lose an amount they can't afford, and would like desperately to rid themselves of this destructive compulsion. If I like something, then I don't want to give it up. It's impossible to feel elated by something and yet want to get rid of it. Contradictory. People who are tempted to take the leap are enslaved by the lure of a big win, which certainly does feel good, but the catch is that something like that comes around all too rarely to have any hope of exerting a positive influence in the long run.<br/><br/>That's my logic anyway, and if I'm wrong then the movie doesn't explain its glib philosophies adequately enough to teach me otherwise. All this product trades on is a hypothetical synthetic adrenaline rush delivered by two stars on autopilot, with not a scrap of substance to be found beneath its shiny surface. In short, ""Two for the Money"" heralds a payoff that's not worth laying down cold hard cash for."

","I can't say that I enjoyed this film, but it was not so terrible that I was pained by watching it. It's mindless fluff at best. I'd call it a simple morality play, with the thesis that sports-gambling can ruin you no matter how you are involved. There are definitely better options at the DVD rental store. Of course, if you have seen ""everything"" in the shop already, it will pass the time. My girlfriend had the same general opinion.<br/><br/>The actors performed capably (Pacino still shouts his lines) and the production was fine, but the limited story-line brings the whole film down. I was initially a bit confused by the ending, but I didn't care enough to rewind and watch it again. I would never watch this film a second time.<br/><br/>As for the topic: I don't gamble, but love football, and have seen my share of sports gambling. Thus, it was somewhat interesting to see how a gambling-picks hot-line might operate, how evil anything associated with sports betting can be, and how quickly one can lose everything. Obviously the film did not encourage me to start betting on sports. It might also discourage those who think they have a ""system"" and are contemplating starting. However, the films mediocrity probably means the story's moral will be ignored. There are many better gambling related films..."

If it has an ""anonymous"" after its name, he goes to it."" A former compulsive gambler, he now runs a sports betting business. He becomes interested in a former football player, retired due to a knee injury, named Brandon Lang (McConaughey). Lang gives out accurate predictions and point spreads on a 900 line, and Abrams invites Lang to work for him.<br/><br/>Lang moves to New York, where Abrams changes his name to John Anthony, dresses him professionally, and ultimately puts him on television. Anthony is very successful - the business gets a percentage of every win, and Anthony does very well by his clients.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as Abrams himself says, Anthony is not a psychic - which Anthony seems to forget, becoming too interested in golf games with his clients instead of research, and the inevitable happens. ""John Anthony"" then must come to terms with the complex man he's working for and how and if he's going to get back in the game.<br/><br/>This is a good-looking film with Pacino sucking out all the air in the room, overpowering both McConaughey and Russo with his take no prisoners acting. McConaughey is one hot number, and there was a time, when he first started acting, that he wanted to be another Paul Newman. Then he was pulled into chick flicks. The result is a successful career but not necessarily a successful acting career. Therefore he's not really a good match for Pacino.<br/><br/>Jeremy Piven plays another analyst who works for Abrams, and he does an effective job, as does Armand Assante, a bettor who doesn't like to lose - he's really excellent in a short role.<br/><br/>But Pacino rules - you can sense this man's volatility and you have no idea what he's going to pull next.

Their relationship is more ""father/son"" than romantic, however; and, Pacino is married to skinny ex-junkie Rene Russo (as Toni).<br/><br/>In New York, McConaughey and Pacino proceed to handle the ups and downs in the business of football gambling advice. Jeremy Piven (as Jerry) is good, in a woefully underwritten role. The weirdest scene has wealthy Armand Assante (as Novian) straddling and urinating on McConaughey; you would think he would aim at Matthew's face, but maybe he was saving something for a possible second encounter? Also watch for the very arousing blonde Jamie King (as Alexandria) to appear in a restaurant, peddling her wares; later topless, she has brief and darkly lighted boudoir scene.<br/><br/>***** Two for the Money (10/7/05) D.J. Caruso ~ Al Pacino, Matthew McConaughey, Rene Russo, Jeremy Piven"
"Sherazade","6","2","2","3 July 2006"," Two for the swearing!
","As a Newyorker, I refuse to believe that there are people in this city who swear so much that you absolutely can hardly understand a word of what they are saying. That was the case with this film in which Al Pacino (in another shout-fest villainous role) plays a betting chief who one day rescues a former NFL champion (played by Mattew McConaughey) who was abandoned by his father, from the eternal damnation known as working in a cubicle, by flying him out to Newyork and offering him a job as sports betting main protégé. It all seems too good to be true for Brandon Lang (McConaughey) who is suspicious of everything going on around him but allows himself to be recruited anyway. He starts well and climbs up the ladder with such lightening speed that in infuriates a former protégé played by Jeremy Piven whom Brandon eventually replaces. Everything about Al Pacino's sinister Walter Abrams is a test, he tests to the point of no return and eventually does himself in when Brandon (whom Walter makes over to be this alter ego character of John something...) walks away at the top of his game. Jamie King (ever the typecast slut) makes a cameo as a, yeah, you guessed it, slut. Rene Russo, who seems to get only better and more beautiful with age co-stars as Mrs. Abrams, a woman whom Brandon can hardly resist much to the dismay of her husband. And Armand Asante makes a special appearance as a weirdo mob type dude who relieves himself on McConaughey's character! Poor Matthew, here's hoping your payday was very shiny and green! As I said before, the swearing was a little bit much for me, and I'm a Newyorker, so there you go. The film was based on true life events that occurred in the life of the real Brandon Lang, a body building former pro-gambler whom you can see in the special features section of the DVD."
"bgoulding2","2","2","2","24 October 2005"," loads of male attraction, no love interest and near zero reality
","Great if you like the sound of Pacino's voice (I do a bit) and the sight of Matthew's torso. But Resso is as much a fizzle as is the story line... Gambling can be a great high just, more often it is a home wrecker. But this story line captures neither... might just have been about the triads making money in back streets of Hong Kong, it was all foreign to me. The cheesy ending was recognizable enough... a desperate effort to get back to minimum Hollywood standards of what is expected of good guys. There are other problems with the story but there is little point in going through these in light of larger issues.<br/><br/>Overall, fans of Pachino will go see this movie just as surely as fans of the Rolling Stones will buy an album ""sight unseen"". I just wish he would find better projects to work on... he's not going to live forever and every maestro wishes to have had one last masterpiece which gets left undone. In that sense, this movie is less a waste of viewers time or producers' cash, but of Pacino's talent.<br/><br/>BG"
"guyfromjerzee","9","17","34","17 October 2005"," Two for the Money, two powerhouse performances!
","This is probably one of the better films I've seen recently. After watching a series of horribly disappointing summer movies, it was refreshing to see a compelling film that kept me at the edge of my seat and allowed me to enjoy the presence of two fine actors. I think Al Pacino and Matthew McCoughnahey work well together because of their difference in acting styles. Pacino's is more overstated, while McCoughnahey's is more understated. Pacino seems to have tons of fun with his character and gives a tour-de-force. Yet at the same time, he gives a subtle bit of humanity to his slimy character. I've liked McCoughnahey ever since I've seen him in ""Ed TV,"" and contrary to what some reviewers say, I think he's a lot more than just a handsome stud for the female viewers to swoon over, unlike someone like Vin Diesel. Jeremy Piven also gives a fine performance in a nice little supporting role. Plain and simple, if you're in the mood to see some great acting, ""Two for the Money"" is the movie to see."
"bozyeux","9","18","37","5 October 2005"," What a surprise! Very good movie!
","I just saw a preview of this film 3 days before its premiere, and I was not prepared for such a good movie. This movie is labeled ""drama"" and ""thriller"", it is NOT! I would say it is a comic drama or a dramatic comedy. Whatever you like. We laughed at many many places, the script is very intelligent, and the 3 main actors are so wonderful (by the way, I usually don't like Pacino!). The only complaint is a slow down in the pace of the movie around two third, but after 10 minutes it picks up again. I recommend it for the acting and the script specially. Very unpredictable, even 15 minutes before the end I could not predict how it would end. No I won't give any spoiler. The end is very simple and I must say touching!"

","In 'Two for the Money' Matthew McConaughey plays Brandon Lang, former star quarterback turned sports adviser. Walter Abrams (Al Pacino) runs one of the largest sports adviser networks and gets Brandon to come work for him. Brandon seems to have 80% accuracy in his football picks. It seems a match made in Heaven, but is it.<br/><br/>I was really disappointed in this film. Al Pacino was great in this, a little over the top, but that is Al Pacino. Rene Russo was very disappointing in it; you almost thought she wasn't there. Matthew McConaughey was pretty good; a lot of women will like the eye candy. However, the plot really stinks. Brandon Lang rise to greatness and his subsequent fall from greatness is not at all inspiring. No one cares about these characters and why should they. You see a number of spoiled people who get what they probably deserve. That's it."
"terryfoods","1","14","28","31 March 2006"," A stinker
","I am usually a big fan of Pacino (Scarface, Serpico, Devils advocate) but since Scent of a woman he pretty much plays the same role and shouts a lot. This movie had no endearing characters to warm to. Brandon played by Bongo McConnahey is the least likable of the bunch. He nowhere even approached a real human being. Pacino was hopelessly unlikeable and my goodness how old is Renee Russo? The only high light of this wretched mess was the hot hooker with the perfect lipstick and she has like 10 lines total. Even the usually reliable Jeremy Piven was utterly unlikeable.<br/><br/>Note to writers of movies, they do not usually work unless one of the main characters is at least a bit likable (noteable exception Scarface). As the movie closes and old Brandon is at the airport my only thought was, please let a plane crash into the airport and kill Brandon."
"Sarmad","1","7","13","2 August 2006"," Very poor
","Very poor script and acting. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. All is in the cliché of the ""mentor"" and the ""talented immature pupil"". The characters aren't' even interesting nor sympathetic. Artistically it is as empty and insignificant. The colours are very impersonal and light. Only the poster may be appealing. Al Pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success. Too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate. But I can't have a complete comment on this movie any way as i got out from the theatre 20 minutes before ending. Everything was so predictable that it was a waist of time..."
"ferguson-6","5","16","37","8 September 2005"," Chaucer's flip of the coin
","Greetings again from the darkness. Was very happy to catch an early screening of this after seeing the trailer. The one definite that the film (and filmmaker) knows is that the camera loves Matthew McConaughey. His dimples, blinding white teethy smile and beefcake body are all on full display here. MM does have a southern silkiness and charm on screen, but we just never believe the river runs very deep.<br/><br/>Director D.J. Caruso (""Taking Lives"" and a bunch of TV stuff) never quite captures the pure sleaze of behind the scenes sports betting. There are so many stereotypical moments, characters and scenes that this viewer experienced more than a couple of eye rolls, not the least of which was the ridiculously sappy ending. Al Pacino is at his over-the-top usual. Somewhere along the way, Pacino stopped acting and just started yelling his lines. He is no longer the brooding, cool guy of ""Bobby Deerfield"" or ""The Godfather"", but now seems eternally stuck in his ""Scarface"" and ""The Insider"" roles as a screaming madman. Rene Russo provides steady duty as Pacino's muse and wife, as does the wonderful Jeremy Piven. Armand Assante also shines as a very scary rich client whom I would not want upset at me.<br/><br/>The treatment of addiction - alcohol, betting, drugs, etc. is touched upon, but we are not given any real insight into the struggles these individuals face on a daily basis. The film is watchable purely as a star vehicle for McConaughey and Pacino and just a sampling of the sleaze that compiles this huge industry."
"rainking_es","5","6","11","11 October 2006"," Why AL?
","Al Pacino is the only bait of this product. If it wasn't for him I wouldn't even watched a movie just like this one, with all its American Dream speech, the winners, the losers, the 5 thousand $ prostitutes, the big cars, and all that crap from the Big Apple. Of course, at the end they give us some moral... yeah, right.<br/><br/>It's nothing but a blockbuster, barely entertaining and with a good incentive for ladies: there they have Matthew McCounaghey with his ""I'm your man, baby"" look.<br/><br/>Why, Al, WHY????

","This movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible. The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end I wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen.<br/><br/>Normally I don't write reviews, but I was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got. While I admit that the acting was okay at some parts, the script's deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting. The only reason I watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it, introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made, judging by the trailer. We were not disappointed in the least. Its only saving grace is that it contained my new favorite pickup line:<br/><br/>BRANDON: I just want to get to know you.<br/><br/>GIRL: You just want to get into my pants.<br/><br/>BRANDON: I want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul. I don't see you wearing any pants in this equation.<br/><br/>Overall, I would rate this movie as the worst movie I ever saw that took itself seriously."
"dfw_txs","2","6","11","27 October 2005"," Pacino needs to work on his script selection
","I went into this movie determined to like it. I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc...I went into this movie thinking I would be on the edge of my seat. Plus, I am a big Pacino fan.<br/><br/>What a piece of garbage. Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen in five years. This makes Pacino's debacle in Any Given Sunday actually look good. First, half the movie is watching Matthew McConaughey lift weights. OK, we get it. You are in shape Matt. We don't need to see every other scene with you pumping iron, shirtless.<br/><br/>Secondly, how many plot holes are in this movie? Why introduce the phone call from Brandon's long lost Dad and never address it again? What was the point of his Mom hanging up on him - why even have her call to say he is sending her too much money - what was the point of that? The guy from Puerto Rico who lost 30 million? Also, since sports betting is illegal in NY, and its acknowledged its illegal, how can they possibly guarantee everyone's bet at the end? <br/><br/>This was simply a very poorly written script. It had potential, but it was devoid of a coherent plot. I thought Pacino learned his lesson about script selection after Any Given Sunday, but apparently not. My Gosh, this is the same actor that starred in the Godfather! <br/><br/>Don't waste your money."
"Arthur21743","5","6","11","23 October 2005"," We left with questions....
","My son and I went to see this movie recently. We are both admirers of Pacino for his intense portrayals of whomever he is being at the moment, so we felt that we had a safe bet (pun intended) with this movie. The last movie of Al's that we saw together was Devil's Advocate, and that sparked some lively discussion after viewing it.<br/><br/>This time as we left the theater we were groping for something to talk about. All I could do was ask, ""What was this movie trying to say? Do you know?""<br/><br/>He didn't.<br/><br/>I said, ""In the case of Devil's Advocate, at least there was a message--that ego, vanity, materialism, and self serving ultimately resulted in failure in life, and that if you sell out your principles you flounder on life's reef mentally and emotionally, and perhaps physically as well.<br/><br/>""This was Devil's Advocate without any message, at least as far as I could tell. With maybe a little Simone thrown in...."" He hadn't seen that one so I had to explain that Simone was a creation of the main character that ended up running amok, or at least at cross purposes with the motives of her creator.<br/><br/>Then we both wondered if Pacino and company were as bankrupt as the main character in this movie. Even at his best, Pacino's character (Walter Abrams) was a parasite. He performed no useful function in society, only lived off the baser interests of low-level humanity who want to get something for free in life. In other words he capitalized on human greed to make his living. So was this movie a behind-the-scenes look into the lives of Pacino and company? Have they hit the bottom of the creativity well and did they just grind out a movie because they needed the money? Does their money slip through their fingers like it did for Walter? I really can't think of any reason to make this movie other than somebody needed some quick cash.<br/><br/>Another question we had was what happened in the case of Walter's protégé? OK, so if you ride a false wave of success you eventually crash, but what was it that caused the crash in this case? I just KNEW he was going to blow it, but when it happened I knew not why. I mean, all of a sudden he lost his gift for picking winners. Why? Had he quit doing his homework thinking he had become some sort of god with a permanent gift? Was he too caught up in the New York materialistic lifestyle to bother studying the teams any more? He had time to work on his body, why not time to study the teams and their players? <br/><br/>Did he just become cocky and arrogant and was that supposed to be his fatal flaw?<br/><br/>In the end, we wondered, did the main character improve any? His protégé left him and went back to his home and took on a serving-humanity lifestyle. He had had it with the Big Apple and its hustling ways. But what about Walter? Did he quit committing slow suicide (smoking)? We gave him the benefit of the doubt in that he probably learned to appreciate his wife who stood by him through it all, loser that he was. (And speaking of his wife, what was her motivation anyway? Why did she love him still when she deserved so much better in a man? What was his appeal?) <br/><br/>The movie ended giving us little (if any) hope that Walter wasn't going to continue to be a loser until he gasped his last. Did he go on to turn his life around, get an honest job, and become a caring family man and a credit to the human race? <br/><br/>We both didn't want to put any money on it. <br/><br/>(Five stars for the intense acting which carried this movie--but which maybe had no business being made in the first place.)"

","I love Al. I adore him and his movies. to me he's the best actor of all time. I adore his so much that i have an A4-Size Serpico poster hanging on my bed. And when I saw this film on DVD, i couldn't wait for it to be over.<br/><br/>The story's boring and the acting's nothing special from all the actors. I personally can't stand matthew mc, it was obviously Al Pacino's performance I was looking out for. But I was truly disappointed this time. The story drags on and on and drags Pacino with it. I quickly grew tired of his speeches and of matthew flexing his muscles at every opportunity. The only moment I found interesting was when the millionaire pisses on matthew's face. that was the only part. I was especially horrified to see Al do his 'fit and spastic' routine again, the one he did in his first movie, panic in needle park, when his character OD'd and in godfather 3. now he does it again - as a joke! he admits that he's acting! That scene put down this movie along with all his previous classics.<br/><br/>If you want to see the true magical legendary Al Pacino - serpico, dog day afternoon, godfather trilogy, scarface, devils advocate, glengarry glen ross.....even S1m0ne. forget about this, it'll just make you mad."

Because it fails to be honest about the real world of gamblers. I sure had high hopes for this flick considering the mega cast.

","Those were the words spoken by Walter at the gambling meeting which I found to be really funny .I decided to check out to for the money because I thought it would be a welcome change to my normal genre of movies and what I can say is that the film starts of good and you as the person who is watching kind of develop some sort of attachment to Brandon Lang after his hopes of becoming a high flyer are put to the side when he becomes injured and like the rest of us works a nine-to-five . Something that I could feel for him was that he was young,well to do and has plenty of ambition and still dreams of making it big but is stuck in a very dead end place where he feels he won't get anywhere . Que the rather wild , wacky ,and some what flamboyant Walter Abramhs played in style by Al Pacino who then goes onto promise the Brandon the world if he comes works for him. And thusly you see a star in the making as you see Lang's speeding rise to the top from his desk job days to the point where he starts using the alias Jhon Anthony - the million dollar man with a billion dollar plan!! He also gets to drive the Merc-Benz SL 500 which coincidently my boss drives at well and says that one day it will be but I don't really believe that people . So far so good but then during the second half of the film when things turn sour and Lang's world starts crashing down before him the film then gets a little sloppy and thusly loses what direction it wants to go in , from this it tends to drag on a little longer than it should do which I didn't mind as long as it was given time to recover but instead it started developing plot holes . Al Pacino performance was great , I found my-self laughing with his witty ability to turn things around . Matt McConghay was also gave solid performance portrait a person who got him-self in a little to deep but was enjoying the part. Rene Russo performance was also pretty solid . All in all Two for the Money was on its way to earning an 8 or 8.5 but because of the sloppy , dis-organised , some what unrealistic second half it started losing marks . However the first half was brilliant the way it showed us a gritty , realistic portrayal of the cut-throat business which is known as sports gambling . Definaltly worth a rental .<br/><br/>TWO FOR THE MONEY - A RATHER WEAK 7.5 OUT OF 10 .<br/><br/>THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN SIGNING OFF WISHING YOU A GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK."

","Walter Abraham (Pacino) hires Brandon Lane (McConaughey) who has a talent for picking winners in Pro Football.<br/><br/>We get to see a little bit of pro sports gambling in picking teams to win in pro football, and we get to see some of the emotions that go along with it. Walter has the most successful sports advising company in the nation, and becomes a father figure to Brandon and hangs his star on him because Brandon has the gift. Walter, Brandon and Tony (Ruso) all had terrible childhoods and now must stick together to make this work.<br/><br/>I know Pacino is a good actor, but it seems to me that he likes to hear himself talk a little too much. In this movie, he never quits being ""up."" We needed a break from this from time to time, and it rarely came. He plays the part a little too flip for my money. Oh, yes, we still get his obligatory harrang when he visits a Gamblers Anonymous meeting and harasses the participants. That is his schtick and we must be prepared for it somewhere in the movie. Still, he is a good actor, but I think he needs to tone it down a notch. You see, he not only yelled in Brandon's ears, he yelled in ours too.<br/><br/>There is a lot of language in here and the movie applauds it, encourages it, and displays it at every turn. That is annoying in the beginning, but after you hear it so often it seems to go away and you don't hear it so much, but it's still there, but not as annoying. Does this make sense? <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is fine, and the story does move along pretty good, but does have its slow moments. We get the idea that a lot of people depend on the ""pics"" from a company like Walter has. Walter's company has a policy of pushing the client to the limit to get him to wager more money with their bookie (Walter's company get a percentage of what is wagered). When things are good, they are very good, but when things go bad people get hurt. Maybe this is the warning of this movie: don't depend too much on other people's advice, learn to depend more on yourself."

","The acting was good, the cast was good, but I don't think that world really exists. I mean, there are touts who sell picks for the season and touts who sell games, but do they care whether their picks win? They have their money. They don't sell their picks; they sell their ability to make picks. With most of them, they lie about their percentage anyway. The real gamblers tell you if you're hitting 60%, your doing as well as anyone can. I don't think any tout would go ""12 to 2"" like in the movie; they select two or three key games. No one can hit a good percentage if he chooses every game. The Armand Assante character is good in theory, but whales like to control the action--baccarat, roulette, blackjack--even if they lose. Sports betting is too much about winning. And where to you place a bet of a million a side? Who's going to take that action? The top casinos in Las Vegas might take a $55,000 side. I would have liked to have seen a movie about Las Vegas and sports bettors--the guys who bet their own money, go from casino to casino to make sure they have enough down, who can go from a hundred bucks to a hundred grand and back in a week or two.amber3056@netzero.com"
"benihana83","5","8","17","8 October 2005"," Horrible direction and writing ruin what could have been a decent film
","Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors in film today. Let's start with that, because it's all down hill from here. Pacino should be commended for his efforts to resurrect the doomed-from-the-start ""Two For The Money,"" but even he can't save the movie from falling flat on its face due to a horrendous screenplay and amateur direction.<br/><br/>""Two For The Money"" is the story of Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey), an ex-football player with a penchant for picking winners. His journey starts in Las Vegas, where he works at a small-time sports betting hot-line, providing tips to America's gambling population. Shortly after the movie's opening, Lang is recruited to work for Walter Abrams (Pacino), the big shot owner of the largest sports betting agency in the nation.<br/><br/>At first, the partnership between Lang and Abrams is flawless. Lang takes on a new name, John Anthony, and a new sense of confidence. He is consistent with his picks and the two rake in millions in cash. But when things start to go wrong  horribly, predictably wrong in fact  both men are pushed to the limit.<br/><br/>Pacino has been nominated for eight Oscars and took home the award in 1993 for ""Scent of a Woman."" Unfortunately, after dozens of hits spanning almost four decades, he still makes a mistake now and then when choosing a role. His co-star McConaughey has made a habit out of it. If you don't believe me, check out ""Sahara"" or ""Reign of Fire."" D.J. Caruso directed ""Two For The Money,"" which was written by Dan Gilroy. Caruso only recently made the transition from directing television to directing film. His only other mainstream project was the ridiculous 2004 thriller ""Taking Lives,"" and his inexperience shows here again. The film is constantly teetering on the edge of being decent, but never really finds itself. It is billed as a drama, yet the laughs are aplenty in the early stages, combined with unnecessary voice-overs from McConaughey, music that just doesn't fit and editing sloppy enough to give you a migraine headache.<br/><br/>About mid-way through there is a dramatic shift in tone. The second half of the film is certainly the better portion, but at that point the viewer has been pulled in one direction for so long that the sudden change comes off as too abrupt. Had the dramatic element been evident from the beginning, ""Two For The Money"" might have had a better fate.<br/><br/>While Caruso's direction deserves a lot of the blame, the screenplay is equally awful. Gilroy hasn't produced a script since 1994's ""The Chasers,"" directed by Dennis Hopper. He phones it in here, churning out work that could have been crafted by a C-level college student. The characters are campy and underdeveloped, despite a running time just over two hours, and Gilroy never realistically deals with the genuine negatives of the gambling world.<br/><br/>At the end, we are rewarded with a manipulative, contrived final scene, which attempts to tug at our emotions by interlacing sports action with a dramatic confrontation between Abrams and his wife, Toni (Rene Russo). Simply put, it doesn't work. None of it does, despite the best efforts of the actors.<br/><br/>Pacino will recover from his momentary lapse in judgment. He always does. After all, this is the guy who starred in ""The Godfather,"" ""Scarface,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" and ""Heat."" Needless to say, he deserves a few free passes."
"FilmSnobby","1","6","12","12 October 2005"," Don't bet on it.
","Another entry in the Pacino-As-Mentor sub-genre. You know the drill: young hotshot with hubristic flaw (in this case, Matthew McConaughey, trying to jump-start a flagging career by latching onto Pacino's coattails -- hey, it worked for Keanu and Colin, didn't it?) is discovered by glamorous and delightfully corrupt father figure (Pacino, natch). Young Hotshot learns from Father Figure all the ins-and-outs of a lucrative yet degrading career (this time, it's football handicapping). Father Figure plies Young Hotshot with money and hookers and power, but we all know that this decadent state of affairs is on a collision course with dissolution and despair . . . that is, until the Young Hotshot finds his moral center by rejecting the Father Figure and all, or almost all, that he stands for. (Clearly, Stone's *Wall Street* pretty much set the ground rules for the Pacino-As-Mentor sub-genre.)<br/><br/>We are also meant to take these latter-day Pacino films as a parallel to reality. Again, you know the drill: Living-Legend Actor demonstrates his unquestioned superiority as compared to an Inferior Young Actor. The latter may bear and grin through the process, but he must recognize that he isn't going to get any of the good lines, much less get a chance to chew major scenery before the denouement. Now it must be said that there are actually two good movies in the Pacino-As-Mentor canon: *Scent of a Woman* and *Donnie Brasco*. In the former case, it was a one-man show, anyway; in the latter case, Pacino had met his match as a scene-stealer in the person of Johnny Depp. However, those two movies were serious-minded, not merely an exercise in showboating for showboating's sake. Pacino has made damn certain that his younger co-stars in the films since *Brasco* are nowhere near as charismatic as Depp. By the way, none of this speaks very well about the Living-Legend Actor. Like his contemporary De Niro, Pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels. *Two for the Money* is the worst example yet, worse even than *Devil's Advocate*, which at least had the virtues of featuring a naked Connie Nielsen and being chronologically prior to this movie. Well, this is what happens when you're crowned King too damn early -- just ask Marlon Brando. Frankly, I've seen one too many Al Pacino films with the same plot -- and the same overacting from the star -- to be charitable any longer. Did I say ""none of this speaks well""? Actually, it's humiliating for everyone involved, including the paying audience. No one's going to accuse Matthew McConaughey of being a Shakespearean actor, but even he doesn't deserve the role of second-fiddle to this intolerable old show-off, with the added implication that he, McConaughey, will never measure up to the Greatness That Is Al.<br/><br/>I've not wasted space on the plot particulars. If you want a synopsis, IMDb provides a no-nonsense summary, though I think I laid out a fairly comprehensive summary in my opening paragraph. Basically, you've seen this movie before. Many times. The particular milieu in *Two for the Money* is the seedy world (underworld, really) of sports handicapping. Pacino runs an office of ""bet advisers"" -- that is, middlemen between you and your bookie -- and even has a cable TV handicapping show, co-hosted with several of his top guys. One thing the movie got right was the sleaziness of these type of shows . . . but one detail they got dead wrong was the constant use of the words ""gamble"" and ""gambling"". If you've ever seen ProLine or other shows of similar ilk, you'll NEVER, NEVER hear Jim Feist and his cohorts say the word ""gamble"". They ask you to call their 1-900 number to get their picks . . . but if you were from, say, Mars, you'd have no idea what you were supposed to do with those picks. ""Gamble"" is the F-word on sports-handicapping TV shows -- strictly verboten.<br/><br/>Gambling is against the law, you know.<br/><br/>1 star out of 10."

","TWO FOR THE MONEY (2005) ** Al Pacino, Matthew McConaughey, Rene Russo, Armand Assante, Jeremy Piven, Jaime King. (Dir: DJ Caruso)<br/><br/>""Jerry Maguire"" meets ""Wall Street"" by way of ""Boiler Room""<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey usually plays against his good ol' Texas country boy with aplomb and charisma but in his latest leading-man turn downplays that with deploying his cornpone good naturedess to the stressing point of credibility in this cross of ""Jerry Maguire"" meeting ""Wall Street"" by way of ""Boiler Room"" in this drama centering on sports betting cum morality play.<br/><br/>Cast as a former football hopeful whose dreams were crushed by a nasty on field injury, Brandon Lang settles for cold-calling telemarketing scams that lead to brighter days when his knack for picking wins for professional sports, namely football (both college AND pro) catches the eye of hugely successful Brooklyn based numbers runner Walter Abrams (Pacino chomping at the bit in a juicy, bombastic turn) who woos the young turk to turn to the dark side by joining his team of bettors which leads Lang to become a hot shot with the unlikely sobriquet of ""John Anthony"", an alias Abrams creates for his golden goose.<br/><br/>Abrams is an alleged Gambling Anonymous survivor who claims he hasn't made a professional bet in 18 years (yet is running an on the cusp of illegal gambling business) promise to his skeptical gorgeous wife Toni Morrow (the always welcome beauty Russo) who is wise to her loving husband and father to their little girl yet is wary about the corruption of his latest conquest in the form of the highly naïve Lang who claims he doesn't even bet on his picks (yet has no qualms in basking in the quick ascending glory of his new pricey digs and fast lifestyle).<br/><br/>The film's main fallacy is that it is very predictable and that Lang cannot be that believable in being so gullible to the surrounding he's found himself trapped in and Abrams' true colors come out about the half-way mark where most films would have the protagonist questioning his morality when Lang instead continues to literally gamble his good senses for a huge fall to come: it's all in the matter of timing. The jerry-rigged script by scribe Dan Gilroy (whose last known credit was the god awful ""Chasers"" in 1994) allegedly based on a true story is marred by Caruso's ham fisted direction (he's responsible for the ludicrous Angelina Jolie serial killer junk flick ""Taking Lives"" last year) that has no grace or subtlety despite the fine acting by his leads. McConaughey effortlessly allows his IQ to take a beating for his not-too-swift character that finally grows a brain in the ridiculously paced final act (the trite edit of a on-the-line football game's last play with a face off between Pacino and Russo's marriage-on-the-brink confrontation is head-shakingly bad). Pacino meanwhile shifts from his garrulous full-of-vigor shark in lamb's clothing to Mamet echoes of his ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" Rick Roma in a show-stopping soliloquy at a Gamblers Anonymous meeting about the nature of losing is fun in its grandiosity; intensity like his should be bottled. Russo acquits herself nicely as she usually does by making her former addict survivor a resolve of understanding to a fault.<br/><br/>What is unremarkable is just how familiar and easy to figure-down-the-line as to what will eventually happen ultimately is the biggest gambit and cheat for the audience. One only wishes the filmmakers had paid closer attention to the snappy chemistry between its leads that could've made this a ""Hustler"" type of fable."

","This movie is strictly for Pacino fans. There are few redeeming features other than that, unless you enjoy watching low-lifes squeezing obscene amounts of money out of other low-lifes. I disagree with some of the others here. I found the first half of the movie more exciting than the last. Watching the young Brandon Lang/John Anthony rise up to the top of his sleazy field, was more exciting than watching him fall back down to reality. Some of the scenes were as unbelievable as the story line. I would like to see where in lower Manhattan can you drive 90 MPH during the day and not hit a bus, cab, kill someone, or have the cops chase you. Also I don't believe a sports gambling show would ever be aired on a commercial TV station - WPIX in N.Y. Also, I don't know of too many bosses who would throw so much money and perks at a young guy with a very short track record. And as far as Rene Russo is concerned, she's not nearly as sexy as the movie tried to portray her. The lightly covered love story, with the twist at the end, had as much drama and sensitivity as last month's newspaper.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors and one of America's greatest over the past 30 years, but he has done this role so many times in movies like ""Scent of a Woman"", ""Donnie Brasco"", and ""The Devil's Advocate"", that it's getting boring and clichéd. How many times can I see him as the older and wiser guy taking in a young, inexperienced protégée and trying to mold him into a younger version of himself? Enough already! Next time Al, try comedy, like DiNiro."

","How it works is my boyfriend gets invites to screenings, and if he doesn't know about the film he asks me, and we decide if we are free, interested or not, depending on buzz or our availability, all the same reasons anyone chooses to see a film or not. We usually get the invite weeks ahead of time, and have to RSVP. If I don't know anything about the film, I check IMDb of course.. and this time I did so. I hadn't heard about this gem, but the moment I saw the cast, I was sold.<br/><br/>For starters Al Pacino and Rene Russo - these actors don't bother with bad films, can't go wrong, I'm thinking... and the script was written by Dan Gilroy who has not been prolific (yet) but wrote one of my favorite-ever future romps = 1992's Freejack.<br/><br/>YES! RSVP, definitely, I am so there. Tonight was our screening, and I'm here to say it was SO worth it. Excellent story, excellent script (I could see this one getting an Oscar nomination for best screenplay), tight performance from Matthew McConaughey who is truly at his peak.<br/><br/>When Brandon Lang (McConaughey) is swept into the top tier of the sports betting industry, his life accelerates from 0-60 so fast your head spins. Walter Abrams (Pacino) and his wife Toni (Russo) have a masterfully complex relationship, and Brandon sweeps into a thoroughly complex (and amazingly believable) association with them.<br/><br/>The film propels forward with unbelievable tensions, a script in which nothing was stereotypical predictable, or absurd. I bought every moment -- each executed with razor sharp dialog. I don't believe it's a spoiler just to say (in and of itself) that there is an elephant, and one line regarding the elephant jumps out as the best line in any movie since ""Frankly Scarlet, I don't give a damn"". I think the film is *that* good. This is a classic, a new classic, a powerful film that hits all the right notes. The right blend of humor, pathos, tension, drama, exposure, morality, and fairytale. The whole magilla. <br/><br/>I have to tell you, I've never been a sports person, and don't like sports movies. I had a ""little"" trepidation going into this, thinking that I don't really care for sports or sports movies. I grew up in a house where my brother was completely into sports, and I remember my Dad and brother and others gathered around watching ""The Game"", I've seen people in bars hanging on the edge of the TV screen, I've watched grown men jump and yell ""SCORE"" during hockey games, about to blow a gasket... and sorry, I never really got it. Until now.<br/><br/>Tonight, watching Two For The Money - I had an epiphany. I was so drawn into these characters and their fate, that when everyone was watching a big game, suddenly I was on the edge of my seat in anticipation of the score, I was so drawn in to this world, through the power with which the portrayals and story carry, that I GOT it, I was right there. Everything these people were feeling, I was right there.<br/><br/>I'll be honest, I *thought* I knew how this one was gonna end, and if it had ended that way, it would have been a cheesy way out, I was SO wrong. Thinking about the film all night after, I conclude the writer was dead right, the ending is the only logical conclusion.<br/><br/>This is a great powerful story about great powerful characters portrayed by a trio of great powerful actors - and indeed a brilliant supporting cast - no disrespect to Jeremy Piven - in fact I apologize for not talking about him more - but Pacino, McConaughey, and Rene Russo (never more sure-footed) kind of eclipse his supporting role - which (sorry to say) he plays like a slightly watered down Ari (Entourage) I did not vote this a ten, because of a single weak location choice. It was so unmistakably 'where it really was' rather than 'where they were saying it was'. And you may not even notice, although it was glaring to me, so you go see this and then come back here and vote 10. You will!"

Brandon starts out working for 1-900 number company in Las Vegas and soon discovers his ability to predict the results of College and Pro football games at 80% accuracy. This draws the attention of Walter Abrams (Al Pacino) the owner of a large sports advisory service in NY, who hires Brandon and introduces him to the world of big-time sports betting. And that's when the action starts.<br/><br/>Although the story takes place in a sports betting company, and has some great scenes about sports betting, the movie is really about the three main characters -- Walter, his wife Toni (Rene Russo), and Brandon -- and the relationships between them. Each character has their own history and motives, and watching the events unfold is the core of this movie. The performances are great, you get what you have come to expect from Pacino and Russo, and McConaughey also does nice work with his character.

It's a fast talking adrenaline junkie's business and Walter's wife Toni (Rene Russo) tries to keep ever present dangers in check.<br/><br/>The story isn't that exciting. The characters are questionable. The big takeaway is the acting. Matthew McConaughey is a master of this brash young guy. He works well with the master Al Pacino. Al has more intensity than the rest of the cast. And Rene Russo has that superior regal airs about her. The movie starts well, but it does slow down around the middle.

"jdesando","Null","9","23","5 October 2005"," An unusually rich and realistic film.
","""There are two great pleasures in gambling: that of winning and that of losing."" French proverb <br/><br/>That all gamblers are losers we learn among other insights about betting in Two for the Money.<br/><br/>If you want to see Al Pacino go over the top as Walter, the head of powerful football game ""pick"" empire, who hires former quarterback and 1-900 small-time betting success Brandon (Matthew Matthew McConaughey) to join him in big-time picking for clients who are serious losers, you won't see it. But you will see three accomplished actors, Pacino. McConaughey, and Rene Russo (as Walter's wife) live in their roles the way Burt Lancaster, Paul Newman, and Betty Davis, to name only three of the old timers, inhabited their roles and threw them in your face.<br/><br/>If you wonder why rich people risk their fortunes on betting, this is the film to see; if you wonder about Hollywood's ability to depict a real marriage of two people who love each other despite the cataclysmic atmosphere of his profession, then become a believer by seeing an unusually rich and realistic film.<br/><br/>The artistic unity is unusual. The notion of truthfully saying you're sorry is introduced in a tough guy scene, and then re-prised with Walter and his wife. Truth seems endangered in one scene then uncovered to be authentic in another (this pattern happens several times). Family values override money and ambition for the three major players; in Brandon's case, it becomes a matter of figuratively ""Who's your father"" while in Walter's it's ""Who'll be your son?"" (Chinese proverb: ""At the gambling table, there are no fathers and sons."") The extreme fitness of Brandon counterpoints the weak heart of Walter, whose exercise is only making money. The heart is figurative as well as it becomes the final arbiter of happiness.<br/><br/>The film is good enough to recall other successful works of art: For instance, the camera tracks through the ""pick parlor"" with its banks of computers recalling ""Wall Street"" and Michael Douglas's similar role to Pacino's; the shouting, manipulating sales operatives recall the real estate agents in ""Glengary Glen Ross."" The supercharged sports atmosphere is reminiscent of ""Jerry Maguire"" as is Cruise's vulnerable hotshot a template for McConaughey's.<br/><br/>McConaughey fulfills his promise as a major star in a role seemingly made for him. Pacino dares you to want him to go over the top but shows you how he can control himself. This is Pacino at his best since Scent of a Woman. You can bet on it."

Of course if I wasn't a film major I would give it a 9 b/c I would be able to just watch it as entertainment, but damn this major that I love so much for making it impossible to just watch a movie even if it is Wayne's World 2. During the whole film I was reminded of Wall Street through Al and Matthew's relationship along with the greed and all things must fall down sometime theory. Later I read an article in the paper that said this film didn't match up to Wall Street which made me feel better since all my friends thought my comments about the two films were too uptight, while at the same time making me want to kick myself in the face for thinking like some critic whom in general I find full of themselves which to me is almost as bad as realizing you have turned into your mother. The film is good, but it could have been much better. I'm sure when I see it on DVD I will be able to have a better insight on to where it fell short, but with just the one time I've seen it I can't help but question the editor and his choice in cuts, which is really what can make or break most films. Matthew is hot, and being from the south I love his accent, the man could say he just took a dump in his pants and I would still be all over him. But I don't think he was ready to star with Al in this genre, of course this isn't easy for anybody to do b/c Al Pacino is one of the best actors out there, I would say the best period, but I'm sure somebody would say I was out of line and too young to know what I was talking about.

He sure has left DeNiro in the dust and is now America's premier senior actor.<br/><br/>TFTM is a love story, oh yes it is, because all stories are love stories, every single one. The presence of love or the absence of it is at the heart of all stories, and this one is no exception as there are no exceptions. But this one is so special due to Pacino and his magnificent talent in making us believe this fairy tale was real and magical. Renee Russo was very good as his checkered-past wife and chief backsliding preventer(gambling), and Matthew McConaughy was terrific cast as the hunky, can't miss, football score prognosticator who made it big in Pacino's sports line empire and then......well, see the film. Ever see Wall Street? Nuff said. Armand Assante was also good in a small but easy role....the bad guy who hated losing, as opposed to a real addict who loves it as it reinforces his self hate. Al spewed lots of spot-on 12 step program self-help philosophy and personal insights throughout, and as we are all in our own personal 12 step program of some type or another, it kept my attention glued to him as his brilliance alone was worth the ticket price.<br/><br/>Pacino's character had all the good/great lines, as he should have had. Especially great was his stunning address to a 12 step program group about addiction. Believe me, he was right on the money. But, how his really bad heart stood up to all his manic shenanigans, drinking, and smoking, I'll never know. Perhaps he needed them to really feel alive. Hey, it's a movie.<br/><br/>Whether you agree or disagree with gambling, this film is sure to entertain you greatly with its NYC rich slickness and deep look inside the huge sports line ""business"".

","At the end of the day, after we have already discussed the story, the morality, the flirt-with-the-wife arc, the ending .... at the end of the day this movie will be remembered for Matthew McConaughey's willingness to go up against Pacino. No easy feat, that. Pacino is an actor's actor, he has been stealing scenes with aplomb since his Godfather days (where, no coincidence, they based an entire segment on his character). When he is not in a film stealing scenes, he is on Broadway, or off-Broadway, honing his craft (ie, honing his ability to steal scenes.) And nature has been kind to Pacino, on top of everything else, in the last 20 years his voice has turned into a natural growl that is not only unique on the screen but helps him (you guessed it) steal even more scenes. So, into the ring walks Matthew McConaughey, an actor of wildly uneven skills, sometimes brilliant, sometimes lost (see his forays into horror) and the real issue here -- plot aside -- is, does McConaughey hold his own, or does he get chewed up with the rest of the furniture? Answer: Matthew pulls it off. Gifted with an odd sort of physicality, he does indeed hold his own in this film against the pro, and THAT is what makes this film likely to stand the test of time."

Rene Russo does what she does best, or at least does the only thing she ever does and plays a typical wife. I guess she does a good job, but she better considering that's the only character she ever plays. McConaghey is decent, even charming, but there is no common thread between his characters ""real"" personality, and his alter ego.

It doesn't really follow a sport per se, but goes more into the intricacies of sports betting. Yes, you do see football being played and people watching it and cheering the teams on, but as an important part of a much deeper plot.<br/><br/>Al Pacino's performance alone makes this movie worth seeing; his character probably has more twists and turns than even the plot itself, and that's saying a lot. Matthew and Rene are also great in their roles as the people who love him and want to do the right thing by him, even when it means being ""cruel to be kind."" It's a movie I've enjoyed watching over and over again, which makes you laugh, makes you cry, and, if you've ever bet on sports or called the betting hot lines, will have you cracking jokes about certain well-known personalities in the racket.<br/><br/>A very solid 9 out of 10."

","I feel I should put my two cents in and comment about this movie. My two cents can be worth its weight in gold if you, especially if you are a person who may wager a bet or two on sports. I will not mention my name, or the name of my business, but Ihave been handicapping sports professionally since 1989. Yes, I am a sports handicapper. After you see this movie, some of you will be tempted to someday in the near future , call a handicapping service to provide you with winners. I am going to tell you what I know about handicappers. The ruthlessness that you see Pacino demonstrate in the movie is unfortunately VERY REAL. I am not talking about 1 or 2 bad apples in a profession, I am here to tell you that what you see out of Pacino is th norm. Just prior to opening up my service in 89, I decided to call several services , just to get an idea of how others conducted their way of doing business. I would call, and give the impression that I was just thinking about maybe joining with a service and wanted to hear what they offered. One service that I called, after telling the salesman that I wasn't interested called my house to pressure sales me 30 out of th next 35 days ! He would not stop, till finally I told him who I was , and where he could find MY adds. I use to advertise on a cable sports network that is no longer around. The add was shown coast to coast. I have heard from people from every state in this beloved country, and I have heard a bad experience story from each state. Its unfortunate. The majority of handicappers are either nothing but telemarketers who are playing a numbers scam, or they are like Pacino, 60 minutes material! hey, There's a DAYS BEST BET, you can bet sixty minutes within the next two weeks, will to a spot on sports handicappers . By the way, there is a handful of legitimate sports handicappers. ONLY A Handful. The people ho would see my adds then call me , found out after talking with me for bout 5 minutes that i was like the ""ABE LINCOLN"" of handicappers. I would not take anyones money up front, they paid me my commission based on what profit i made them , when the week is up. This of coarse makes all the sense in the world but 99% of handicappers demand their money up front. You will never talk first hand with a handicapper, only high pressure salesman who no longer sell used cars. The only handicapper I have heard of that actually gives his advise to his client first hand, is writing this post. But I am rare. I wanted to be the next Jimmy ""the Greek"" Synder. Today I still handicap sports, my job is too make money for the guys who bet BIG . In fact, my smallest player wagers 500 a game. Most of my clients , 1,000 and up. I recently built a site on he www that allows me to post my BESTBET on site 20 minutes after the play kickoff so visitors to my site can monitor the success of the strongest percentage play on the board. You see, this is what a REAL prognosticator should be able too do. Why don't most of them go to these measures like I do to prove hey can produce winners? They are not handicappers! If they get your money, they could care less if you win or loose, someone else will send them money today, its a numbers game. So when you see this movie, enjoy it for what its worth, but always be extremely careful about handicappers"

Here, the main character is a gambler who is so consumed by his obsession that he hosts his own cable TV show which offers, for a substantial fee, ""expert"" advice on which football games to pick. And to conduct this business he hires football handicappers who, like stock brokers, advise their clients on which teams to pick. Now one of these handicappers is an ex-college football player who has an uncanny knack for making the right picks most of the time. Now the gambler/businessman/hustler believes that this handicapper has a special gift, when in fact IT'S PURE DUMB LUCK! But the gambler/businessman/hustler does not accept that, even when his star handicapper starts losing and losing BIG. Although the gambler/businessman/hustler projects the image of a successful businessman and TV impresario, he is nothing more than just another loser/gambler who is willing to gamble everything on a handicapper who is just another guy.

No one's ever done that and Walter Abrams' (Al Pacino, THE GODFATHER, 1972) bookie team grabs hold of Brandon and inducts him into their company. He quickly leads them to unparalleled success, money and fame but, as fickle as luck/fate can be, it just as quickly gets snatched away.<br/><br/>Although it's interesting to get an insider's look into this little-known world, it's also (as stated earlier) of little concern to most mainstream Americans (I know of no one who has sports gambling problems but maybe that's just me).<br/><br/>The other big failing was that the movie brought up problems related to these two men, but then summarily dropped them with no rhyme or reason. For instance, we're told early on that Walter Abrams has a heart condition, then ¾ of the way through the flick it's never mentioned again. We're also shown how upset some of the rich and famous become when they lose, and one of these wealthy men sends ""a warning"" to Brandon. It happens once, and then we never hear of it again, as if they (the movie makers) just wanted to show us this side of the issue. You know what I said when I saw that: ""Who cares?"" All in all a poorly done film. The script was seriously lacking (and littered with holes) and the acting was nothing special. Pacino is just Pacino. But I'm sure the ladies will love seeing McConaughey with his shirt off. Uh-boy..."

","In D.J. Caruso's ""Two for the Money,"" you can see Al Pacino doing something he's done a lot lately: Having a terrific time being an actor. At 65, he's on a hot streak in one well-written role after another. In ""Insomnia,"" ""People I Know,"" ""Angels in America"" and ""The Merchant of Venice,"" he has given performances vibrating with tension and need, and now here he comes again. George C. Scott used to say when a good actor was in the right role, you could sense the joy of performance. Pacino has moments here when he doesn't quite click his heels.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey and Rene Russo are wonderful, too, in a movie with three well-written and fully functional roles, but their characters are by nature more contained than Pacino's. He plays Walter, who runs a sports betting hotline. McConaughey plays Brandon, the Vegas oddsmaker he imports to New York, renames and turns into a star. Walter is a mesmerizer who assaults him with confidence and exuberance. Russo is Toni, his wife, who loves him and despairs of him. He dazzles Brandon and he worries Toni, a recovering junkie. He's recovering from everything: ""If it says 'anonymous' at the end, he goes,"" she tells Brandon.<br/><br/>The nature of Walter's operation is a little hard to grasp, maybe even to Walter. It appears that his offices and home are in the same building, all paneled Prairie-style in dark woods and window partitions. On the ground floor, he has guys manning hot lines where you pay $25 and get the early line for your weekend bets. On the second floor, it's bigger business: For the best advice, gamblers are expected to pay a percentage of what they win from their bookies. That way Walter is technically not breaking the law: He's not taking bets, he's taking a percentage at arm's length.<br/><br/>""Two for the Money"" is not about the mechanics of this business, but about its emotions. Walter is a promoter who at one point admits his operation is made of smoke and mirrors. He imports Brandon after the kid startles Vegas with the accuracy of his predictions. He gives him a haircut, a wardrobe, a sports car and a new name, and puts him on TV, and Brandon obliges one weekend by correctly calling 12 games out of 12.<br/><br/>That's all the plot you need from me. The rest will be observation. Look at the monologue Pacino delivers at a Gamblers' Anonymous meeting. It's got the passion, if not quite the language, of his soliloquies in ""The Merchant of Venice."" He tells his fellow degenerate gamblers that their problem isn't gambling, it's themselves: ""We're all lemons. We need to lose."" When they lose everything -- the job, the house, the family -- they are most fully alive, he says. When they win, they keep gambling until they lose again.<br/><br/>Walter knows this so well he hasn't gambled in years. Brandon has never gambled. Toni has gambled: She gambled when she married Walter. They have a young daughter. The way Walter grabs for the nitroglycerin pills when his angina hits, he shouldn't be in a business that depends on point spreads. But Walter is an optimist: ""It was only a small one,"" he says after one attack.<br/><br/>I won't tell you what happens involving these three people in this movie, but I want you to watch for the way all three change. The screenplay by Dan Gilroy isn't one of those deals where one guy acts out and everybody else watches him. It's about three people who are transformed in relation to one another, as a situation develops that is equally dangerous all the way around. It takes us a while to understand what Brandon is doing, and then we realize that Walter knows what he's doing -- and is seeing him, and raising him. There are moments here, including one moment before a live TV broadcast, where Walter is pushing his whole stake into the pot, and the game isn't poker, it's life.<br/><br/>Is the movie a realistic portrait of these kinds of people in this kind of business? I'm not an expert, but I doubt it. What I don't understand is how Walter finds out how much his clients bet, so he can collect his percentage. Bookies aren't real good at sharing information, especially for the benefit of an operation devoted to out-handicapping them. And besides, there are a lot of bookies. Why can't I get the tips from Walter's company, bet a grand with a bookie he knows about, and 10 grand with some guy he doesn't know about?<br/><br/>This is a problem, but it is not a problem that bothers me. It's a classic MacGuffin. The point is that something happens on the second floor that means Walter and Brandon and the telephone guys make a pile of money when Brandon correctly predicts the weekend games, and they do it without placing bets or taking bets. That's what we need to know.<br/><br/>Everything else is dialogue, direction, acting and energy. I've been watching Pacino a long time. I saw him at the beginning, in 1971, in ""Panic in Needle Park."" Already a great actor. His next movie was ""The Godfather."" I could mention ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" ""Scarface,"" ""Carlito's Way,"" ""Heat,"" ""Donnie Brasco."" I could keep going.<br/><br/>But good as he already was, I think something rotated inside and clicked as he was directing his documentary ""Looking for Richard"" (1996), which was about how Shakespeare should be acted, and how an actor should play Richard III. Here was an actor in his mid-50s, asking undergraduate questions, reinventing how he approaches a role, asking what acting is. He chose ""Richard III,"" a character who looks in a mirror and asks himself how he should play himself. In his movies since then, Pacino seems to have found something in the mirror."

","Having been involved in the odds business for the last 15 years, watching these movies is always a struggle. The directors seem adamant on stuffing as many cliches and late winners as humanly possible.<br/><br/>Problem is at 30 minutes of watching it, couldn't remember if I had already seen this before, it was that generic. In the end this movie actually had some heart and character, but a smarter punter than me would have left well before it showed.<br/><br/>So allow me to offer a simple tip to the next director of this same story portrayed in ""let it ride"", ""21"" ""the gambler"" and countless similar movies:<br/><br/>-If your movie needs the final result of a lucky coinflip to work in your protagonist favor, your movie doesn't work.<br/><br/>Same goes for any story about a luck based game, whether it be sports betting, poker or the financial markets. It's the about the process, the strive for excellence, not the result. In the movies the process means character development and the plot. This movie did offer that, but left it too late for my sportsbook.<br/><br/>Unless you enjoy the intellectual pursuit of figuring how to win, the win in itself is meaningless. Then you are better of just quitting, which is always a safe bet. Can't lose what you don't risk.<br/><br/>With movies just as well as degenerate gamblers, the need for excitement overrides everything though, even art. So directors feel compelled to show the final result. Even if the correct play would be to leave it open. If you cant do that, you shouldn't be gambling with a movie like this anyway."

","Two for the Money is a 2005 release that dives head first into the volatile world of sports gambling. Our tour guides: Walter Abrams (played by Al Pacino, who chews a lot of scenery here) as an owner of a sports consulting operation and Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey), a former college football star turned sports handicapper, who acts as Walter's innocent protégé. What starts off as a high energy romp turns dark and restless. Granted, this is not your ordinary sports flick. Its non-linear storytelling works because of the performances (Rene Russo is also effective in a supporting role as Pacino's character's wife). If you revel in the idea of Pacino playing himself, this is a must see. D. J. Caruso (The Salton Sea) directs. Dan Gilroy (Freejack) penned the script."

","This movie is basically a gambling movie on football taken seriously. This is a okay film but also forgetful, even if it had some amusing moments which started from the beginning. But it starts to get a bit tedious and really starts to drag. I thought Al Pacino was the highlight of this movie, not that Matthew McConaughey but he just made the film more exciting than it really is. The characters in this film just doesn't stand out that much and you just don't really care for them, the outcome at the end was sort of intense but besides that it was a average film about gambling on football where people invest in there wisdom. There was just too many scenes in this film with Matthew McConaughey having his shirt off and working out which I thought was pointless, although some girls might enjoy those scenes even if it slowed down the movie even more. They tried to give to much sympathy to the characters as well, but it just doesn't really work cause it just show there greed throughout most of the movie. Al Pacino basically carried this film without him it would be below average on the emotions of gambling with some drama thrown in.<br/><br/>7.1/10"

","Money, money, money. If you don't any...you want some. And thanks to unhappy people wanting money fast, other people get richer. Matthew McConaughey plays Brandon Lang, a former outstanding college football star that suffers a career ending injury. His life isn't in the crapper just yet, because he has the uncanny talent of predicting winners and losers on the gridiron. He gets the attention of Walter Abrams(Al Pacino), one of the biggest sports consulting moguls in the business. Abrams takes the hunky Lang under his wing and with a leg up soon both are pulling in an ugly amount of money. When things start to turn sour for Brandon, Abrams puts on the pressure and that leads to a duel of con against con. Stakes escalate and the high rolling lifestyle is in danger of petering out. The bigger they come, the harder they fall.<br/><br/>D.J. Caruso directs and Dan Gilroy writes. The only drawback I can find is maybe the running time of 2 hours and a bit.

"mdp214","6","0","0","28 October 2007"," Entertaining with some problems...
","I found this movie to be very entertaining and the idea does come at a good time as sports gambling is bigger than ever. It portrays the pros and cons and dangers of betting on sports and with several big names, the movie is worth while for someone who hasn't seen it yet. I think some of the acting was overdone and I thought the movie was just too ""fake"" at times. I know they cannot show real NFL games but some of the sports highlights and broadcasts were just blatantly not real and sometimes over the top. I think the acting was over the top as well, especially when everyone is sitting around watching the big games towards the end.<br/><br/>One specific scene where it is too ""fake"" for me is when they go 14-0 in the big weekend. In the final game they are watching Pacino says ""if they score we win."" There was several seconds left on the clock and the team that scored had the lead. In any football game, the team with the ball would have downed the ball and ran the clock out. 100% this would happen every single time, especially in the NFL (and with a 1 possession lead). I just personally think the games and plays were thrown together so carelessly that it's almost offensive to any sports knowledged person viewing the movie.<br/><br/>Personally, I do not find McConaughey's character believable. His characters turns a complete 180 and he is way too over the top at moments. He becomes too arrogant and non-likable. While I know that people change, I just think the acting wasn't as well portrayed as it could be.<br/><br/>One problem I do have with the bad reviews and some of my comments is that this movie is actually based off of a true story, so while people complain about certain scenes and certain plots, the movie is supposedly following the life of the real Brandon Lang, as he told it and explained the events that had occurred.<br/><br/>One personal comment about one thing the movie portrays. In the scene where Amir lost everything and calls McConaughey's character and is yelling at him, following with Lang's character reflecting on how he just ruined someone's life, I personally hate this stereotype. I do not like this scene at all as it is a terrible portrayal of how people's lives are ruined with sports gambling. Amir's character obviously won several hundred thousand dollars, minimum. Then he lost everything in a couple weekends. It shows how some betters will bet everything they have and lose. The movie portrays Lang's character as being at fault here, and trying to have the audience understand that while sympathizing with Amir. I find this to be ridiculous as there is no one at fault but Amir, and the movie does not show enough that it's the better's fault. Amir had a family and took several hundred thousand dollars and lost it all. Yet the movie tries to show that it is completely Lang's fault, and because of this, he has to get out of the business because he can't handle ruining people's lives. This scene just really bothered me as I think Amir's complete collapse just shows his addiction for gambling and his desire not to stop."

I like to see Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey on screen, they play a great back and forth role together and it is the rising of a new kid on the block in the company. I don't really understand the dynamic between Rene Russo and Pacino, it seems that they have much bigger issues than the ones that are present with McConaughey and his character. The guy is just trying to get what is coming to him. I would like to see a more in depth documentary on the subject matter of sports gambling and how it starts and how real life sports bookies get to where they are, this was an entertaining, fast paced film that I recommend to anyone surfing through cable wondering what to watch.

","Thank the Lord for Mr. Al Pacino and Mr. Matthew McConaughey who single handedly save this film from monotony, perhaps even sheer boredom. Two For The Money does take a new twist on the typical sports/football film by looking at from the perspective of the sports bettor and the people that advise the bettors. The film is a little long (as I've been finding with many films lately...maybe I'm getting old) and there are some rather slow points but because of the performances of the two main stars the film is worth watching 100%!! <br/><br/>Pacino plays Walter Abrams, a rather high strung, former everything-a-holic, who is building an empire around sports betting advisory. I really honestly believe this is one of Pacino's best characters. I think his performance as Abrams is Oscar worthy. He's mean and deceitful but human and flawed and you feel sorry for him. He's almost pathetic. Nobody could have done that role more justice, Pacino is brilliant. Matthew McConaughey plays Brandon Lang, a former pro-footballer whose brutal knee injury takes him out of the game. But his love for the game remains and his instinctive ability to know all the teams inside out and backwards makes him a prime candidate for sports betting advisory although he NEVER bets himself. Abrams takes Lange under his wing and immediately begins to build the empire around him. McConaughey plays Lange and his character arc is interesting and he does a great job in an equally award worthy performance (although neither has received any.) The chemistry between the two is spot-on and brilliant and they both do amazingly!! Their scenes together keep the film interesting and watchable. Rene Russo plays Pacino's wife Toni Morrow and although she does an okay job, she's rather disappointing in her role considering the caliber of actress I believe she is. She has no real chemistry with Pacino or McConaughey and she doesn't add much to the cast besides the name.<br/><br/>I think Sports fanatics might really enjoy this film but for me I thought it was alright. It certainly showed a side of the sports world you don't usually see in films but TV director D.J. Caruso should thank his lucky stars for the stars in the film because they make an otherwise average movie into a very interesting and watchable film. Sports fans will love the story, and movie lovers will love Pacino and McConaughey. 7/10"

","""Two for the Money"" stars Al Pacino in a textbook Pacino performance as Walter Abrams, a mid-level New York City sports book ""tout"" and gambling maven with a gambling addiction. Married to Toni Morrow Abrams (played with finesse and depth by Rene Russo), Walter finds an amazing picker of winners of sports games (specifically football) in Brandon Lang, played by Matthew McConaughey, a former college football star injured in his final college game. Lang's ability to pick winners is based on his deep, nearly mystical understanding of football and its players. Offered a job in NYC, Lang moves into Abrams sprawling townhouse and quickly establishes himself as a superstar picker, and Abrams, quick to see the profit, builds an empire around Lang. What happens after that should be left unwritten, as this 2005 film is well worth seeing for its edgey, yet touching portrayal of characters caught up in gambling, greed, but with a family dynamic that can only be called love.<br/><br/>Abrams views Lang as more that just his best employee. We get a sense that Abrams honestly takes Lang under his wing, grooming him to become ""John Anthony"", superstar sports picker. In this sense, a little like ""Pretty Woman"", Abrams changes Lang into Anthony. Along the way, we find out that Abrams has a bad heart, an ailing ""ticker"" that causes him to worry that he'll live another year even as he lights up another cigarette behind the caring, and disapproving eye of Toni. This fear, for his wife and his family's future, leads him to introduce Lang/Anthony to Toni, and we get a very real sense that Lang falls in love with Toni even as he accepts Walter's tutelage. We are left to wonder, ""if Walter dies, does Brandon marry the much-older Toni?"" And yet, like a real father-son relationship, there is overt and subtle competition between the wiley, cunning, yet fatherly (if being crazy can be considered ""fatherly"") Walter and Brandon. Is Brandon conning Walter? Walter certainly decides to test Brandon, with Toni as part of this extremely complicated love triangle.<br/><br/>The film isn't specifically sexual, but it deals with polyamorous themes where the ""amorous"" aspect is more important, perhaps, then simple sexual escapades. Along the way, we learn the true meaning of these individual's lives, where they come from, and most importantly - where they are going. Highly recommended for outstanding performances by Oscar winners (and likely candidates for this film) Al Pacino and Rene Russo, and McConaughey, in one of his best roles yet, delivers his laconic Austin-tinged acting with a new, harder edge. This film is not appropriate for children or teenagers, not because it is violent or too sexual (its not), but because the complicated story and in-depth character studies are likely to go over the heads of most, but certainly not all, teenagers. This film is about addictions, love, a man's drive to provide for his family, a woman's unconditional love for her man, a father-son relationship (albeit off-beat and at times dysfunctional), and much more. With themes as old as Shakespeare and, at times, as basic as Pygmalion, ""Two for the Money"" is one of the year's best commercial films."

","'Two for the money' is based on the story of Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey), a promising football player who suffers a serious injury, and while recovering and trying to make a living discovers he has a big talent in guessing how the matches turn out. He's hired by Walter Abrams (Al Pacino), the owner of a big betting agency, who helps turning him into a personality and earning loads of money. But as he gets more and more successful, things get out of control and he doesn't know who he is anymore.<br/><br/>Well, for me the whole thing just didn't work at all. The plot is absolutely shallow and predictable and there are just too many clichés. I can't believe anyone still bases a movie on the 'how-far-will-I-go-before-I-lose-myself' routine. The pace of the film is awful, being exciting only in the beginning; the viewer will quickly lose his interest in the continuity of things. There's also what for me seems to be an unrealistic fact in the film  how come a beginner in the betting business gets to rise so fast and gets so much investment out of nowhere?  it's either an incoherence or more time should've been spent in explaining Brandon's career beginning.<br/><br/>To add up to the terrible script there's the fact that Matthew McConaughey is absolutely untalented and just doesn't have what it takes to lead a film that isn't a chick flick. Perhaps that is even more transparent when you're acting beside Al Pacino. His entire character is a cliché. On the other hand there's Al's part which he plays as well as usual. It's not a special or unforgettable performance, but in my opinion he was prejudiced by his character. Both his and McConaughey's parts are poorly built; Al's the most, and I got completely confused on what I was suppose to think about Walter Abrams. Is he a nice guy with a gambling problem and some psychological issues or is he a greedy, lying bastard who will do anything for his benefit? I didn't know whether to root for the leading man or the supporting actor though I'll always pick Al, that's for sure.<br/><br/>The only good couple of moments in this film in my opinion were the ones that focused on Al and Rene Russo, who although barely appears in the film, works well. Their relationship is one of the few convincing facts in this movie. Other than that there is actually a nice message at the end of the film regarding self-destruction.<br/><br/>Al can't perform miracles !"

Al, stop shouting and whooping all the time. It used to work, it doesn't any more. He's precariously close to being stereotyped.<br/><br/>The plot was thin. I knew exactly what was going to happen in the first fifteen minutes of the movie. The moment I saw Al Pacino I was like 'Please don't to another Scent of a Woman.

","Don't get me wrong, ""Two For The Money"" had all the potential to be a great sports classic, but sadly, this film doesn't meet that potential. ""Money"" is great for about 45 minutes to an hour, but, like so many other films this year (Lords of Dogtown), it falls short, unable to contain us as an audience, like the real great films of 2005 (Batman Begins, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Crash).<br/><br/>Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey) was the man in college football, the best quarterback in college, until he suffered a career ending injury. Since then, Brandon has been living as a sort of aid to a sports better, giving them advice on who to bet for in the coming games or events (since I'm 17, please forgive my lack of knowledge on the subject). In this profession, like football, Brandon has become one of the best...except no one knows it...except Walter Abrams (film legend Al Pacino), who has made millions upon millions of dollars because of his betting hot-line. He invites Brandon to come work for him, where he sees the dough come in at an astonishing rate, an unlimited supply of women and cigars, and a lifestyle that one would kill for. Basically, he's become a playboy because of his ability to predict the outcomes of sports events. But, just when he's getting good, Brandon begins to slack off at work, resulting in wrong predictions and uneasy situations, not to mention a few explosions from Walter. The film also stars Rene Russo as Walter's wife.<br/><br/>When Brandon starts to slack, the film loses it's edge. During the first half, you can't help but grin at how cool Brandon is, and McConaughey does a great job showing this. Don't get me wrong, this is one of the most well-acted movies of the year, but not even one of film's greatest stars and People Magazine's Man of the Year 2005 can save this film from nearly falling flat on its face. The film just isn't fun after Brandon's tumble begins, and that is the main fault. The film strays away from the theme, and goes on into dramatic extra-marital affairs and personal struggles, which is not the point of the movie. One thing the second half does do better than the first half is showing how serious and potentially catastrophic the world of organized gambling can be. Unfortunately, since the movie is rated 'R', and intended for that demographic, the lesson it is trying to teach is pointless, because 90% of the film's audience is people who remember Scarface and the Godfather movies, along with fans of Rene Russo's work. These people are old enough to know how dangerous gambling can be. This film probably would have gotten better reviews and would have expressed it's message better had it been rated 'PG-13'.<br/><br/>""Two For The Money"" is a film that will please the fans of the genre of sports, but will not truly satisfy dedicated fans of Al Pacino's work, like myself. This is one of Matthew McConaughey's best performances to date, showing that he can get away from the romantic comedy genre a little more than before (he was only average in ""Reign of Fire""). Rene Russo is also a nice addition for what screen time she has. While the actors succeed, the direction and writing fall for half of this picture, and it's a rent at best.<br/><br/>6/10 --spy"

I just wanted to say that so you would know.

"jdrobin13","1","2","5","11 October 2005"," Struggles to do everything; The loser is the audience
","To start, this movie had potential. A cast of popular actors including the likes of the talented Jeremy Piven in a completely underutilized role. However, by the first half hour, this film falls apart. Struggling to gain the feel of the movie ""The Firm"", you sometimes catch the wave of emotion rise only to be let down with no climax.<br/><br/>No character development. Giant plot holes. No explanations.<br/><br/>To a certain extent some of these losses can be compensated for with other elements of film making, but this comes off as more confusing than anything. Additions of nonsensical back stories with only single sentence mentions only to completely move onto other plot lines only add to the movie's problems. The story would do well to lessen its plot elements and rely on a smaller cast that has carried films in the past.<br/><br/>Al Pacino playing a caricature of himself in ""The Devil's Advocate"" substituting McConaughey for Keanu Reeves. It is a complete retread of the role exactly. Your are only left to imagine his character 20 years later. <br/><br/>Sending Matthew McConaughey in a plot of ""Showgirls"" without the skin never fits. Adding to the pain is Matthew McConaughey spending most of the film sounding the role of ""Wooderson"" in the film ""Dazed and Confused"", including similar delivery and even specific lines. This movie plays like a two hour love session with McConauhey flirting with....himself. Thus, there is only something for those interested in many angles of MM with his shirt off,working out....and his less than adequate pick up lines every five minutes.<br/><br/>The saving grace of the film is Renee Russo who preforms admirably. Unfortunately, she is left to struggle with a script that begs for more screen time. Instead we are left spending time with unnecessary storyline additions such as that of Armande Assante. Assante's performance, while good, only leads to more questions and requires Pacino to wither in stature for the sake of the Assante's villainous role.<br/><br/>What a mess. In the end the movie struggles to try and be all things to all people.<br/><br/>What does it become? It's a sports movie without sports. A love story without love. A drama that is unintentionally funny."

I like drama and tension. This movie is slow, but it is real. It has a genuine crisp feeling to it, as if every part of the movie belongs, regardless of how useless the scene may be. It is ultimately up to the director to entertain, and I believe that everything here belongs and fits nicely. I loved this movie. Compared to other movies of this era, it is off the scale.

The meeting and the airport. Other than that, well, what a waste of time. Utterly. Pacino is just doing the same thing over and over and over, he would have been better served by taking the performance down about five notches at about the level of his protégé.

It has some sport, lots of competitive male hormones, a bit of touching romance, and drama.<br/><br/>Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey play the intense roles of a sport gambling businessman and his protégé. Rene Russo bring in a touch of the feminine flair and sensibility to try to balance things out, even though, this could never be presented as a chick flick. None of the cast lets us down, so it's an overall solid performance.<br/><br/>The score, the script, and the editing are all wound tight to give a ride that comes close to a suspense, especially near the end.

","There are two types of very good movies: The masterpieces, the ones that going to claim for the academy awards, and the others, that do not deserve major honors, but they are extremely entertaining. This film, belongs to the second category.<br/><br/>First of all, Al Pacino gives a commanding performance. Some people say that he ""saves the lot"" for this movie, and although I don't agree with them cause i really enjoyed the film, one way or another, Pacino's acting is spectacular. McConaughey, on the other hand, follοws up closely being, to me, better than ever in this movie. He really fits in the role, is very confident and shows excellent chemistry with Pacino, who is his on-screen mentor. The dialogues between them are entertaining as hell, they share the same passion, the same winning spirit. Furthermore, Rene Russo does not go off the scene, having a soundless but very important backstage-role, influencing a lot Walther (Pacino) in his decisions, and being the only person who tries to keep up with the normal reality.<br/><br/>The script is good and inspired in part by a true story, the directing also did not have serious matters. Definitely there are some questionable parts in the movie, such as the meaningless ending and the non-sense concluding conversation between Rene Russo and Al Pacino, but in the end of the day, you will not regret watching this movie.In my opinion 7,5 out of 10 would be the case for this one."
"jpschapira","7","1","2","1 October 2006"," In search of inspiration
","""Two for the money"" is a film with a plot line with seen lots of times: a hot shot gets a big chance for doing what he does best; he meets a mentor that could play him or not; things could go incredibly right or terribly wrong...However, it's set in a different environment; and one we're not used to be around: the sports gambling business.<br/><br/>Mathew McConaughey gets inside the skin of a man who, in real life, got the opportunity of a lifetime and then had to deal with a world he didn't rule. Brandon Link is the name of the real man and the last name was changed to Lang for the movie. McConaughey seems very comfortable with his role as he goes from one place and one accent to another and controls the various emotions the film presents with confidence.<br/><br/>The picture has its ups and downs; its heavy and full of adrenaline moments, its quiet and well constructed parts and its dramatic instants where everything appears to be falling apart. I'm talking about the story anyway, which, for a movie of this type, exceeds the expectations. Screenwriter Dan Gilroy met McConaughey's character in real life and heard his tale and decided to write a screenplay about it. With a lot of knowledge of the business and the language, Gilroy's script is an element in favor of the film's consistency.<br/><br/>An entertainment picture like ""Two for the money"" can loose its rhythm inevitably, but for more than two hours it keeps up, mostly because of the screenplay and the performances of the main cast (Renne Russo is formidable in her best portrayal since ""The Thomas Crown Affair""), but also because D.J. Carusso's intelligence in the decision of not showing a lot of groove with his camera and keeping it neat (editor Glen Scantlebury deserves credit for the latter one).<br/><br/>Whoever brought Al Pacino for the ride also has to be congratulated. I have a thing with Pacino I can't quite explain. The man is a theater actor; he comes from the stage. I've seen a lot of his work: some of it has left me speechless (""Carlito's Way"", ""Scent of a Woman"", ""The Insider"", ""Heat""), some of it has been just fine (""The Devil's Advocate"", ""Frankie and Johnny""); but during this decade it has appeared to me as very similar.<br/><br/>With a bit of screaming, long beards and a position of experience, Pacino's characters seem to express a desire of his to portray people at the top of their game but at the bottom of their life. His detective in ""Insomnia"", his press agent in ""People I Know"", his director in ""Sim0ne""; they are all the best at what they do but show some important weakness as persons and look tired and, even more noticeable, near the end of their existence.<br/><br/>Although, as I watched ""Two for the money"", I found (during specific frames) some unique expressions coming from Pacino: challenging looks and glimpses that are inspiring and make me wonderHow inspired must have Mathew McConaughey felt having Pacino by his side as his mentor during this film, or Colin Farrell for that matter, having him in the same position during ""The Recruit""?"

At first Brandon, goes on a long winning streak and makes a lot of money. He starts picking losers and the pressure gets to him. He even is threatened by a mobster type of guy who has lost a lot of money with his picks. And to top things off, Brandon gets a little too chummy with Walter's wife. Also Walter confesses he's back to betting with Brandon's picks and is in the red also. Brandon comes to a realization and must decide what type of life he wants to lead.<br/><br/>There was nothing great about the acting. And the film at 2 hours was too long. I agree with other reviews that the last hour was to slow. The first hour was much better with Brandon getting to the top.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I would not pay to see this.

Yet if you watch the older Brandon he is very obviously right handed.<br/><br/>Re the film itself its stance in terms of the problems gambling has on the lives of those who both gamble or are affected by gambling is glossed over.

So amazing that he lures top of the line sports betters. but then all of a sudden, inexplicably, Lang goes into a crazy slump. now, sure, they say all streaks must come to an end, but this one was just too hard to believe. can you really go 80% plus winning streak and then all of a sudden turn to an abysmal below 10% win streak? maybe the 80% to 10% did actually happen, and i'm just a harsh critic, but the fact is, the director does a horrible job in depicting the situation. the fact is, the movie lacked the reconstruction of sports betting and it seemed as though sports betting was just two dimensional, winning a whole lot, and losing a buck load, and clearly, that's not the case.<br/><br/>the acting i thought was great, except for the guy who played Brandon, whose real name i have trouble spelling, maybe because he's not an actor to start with and i have never heard of him? nonetheless, it felt as if the movie was more about lifting weights than gambling itself.<br/><br/>the end seemed all too fairy. miraculously, Lang's bad slump comes to an end, just when he decides to quit his job, and Abraham amends and betters his relationship with Toni, and everybody lives happily ever after.

The rest of the film around Pacino is horrible, the other performances particularly in Rene Russo as his wife are just cringe inducing. The script is heavy handed with completely flat characters and dialogue, and completely pointless scenes and characters. The direction is also heavy handed.

Al Pacino chews the scenery the way he does in recent years, and it would be hard to avoid being entertained by that. Rene Russo was very good, and quite beautiful, as usual.

","""Two for the Money"" is a story about a man whose football career as a quarterback ended early because of a vicious leg injury. He goes to work for a small time sports betting 900 number in Las Vegas, after discovering he has the uncanny ability to pick winners of football games. When he was there, he used the callers' money to bet on his picks for the games, and received a small percentage of the pay out if they won. He is soon offered a job in New York working for a larger company doing the same. He accepts this job and moves to New York dreaming of a better life for himself.<br/><br/>In ""Two for the Money"" director D.J. Caruso tries to show us the shady world of sports betting and the screwed up people involved in it. Caruso uses well known actors like Al Pacino and Mathew McConaughey, and places them in an office setting where people are frantically answering phones.<br/><br/>The hero of the movie Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey) playing the role of a sports betting guru, does the best performance of his career. Due to the advice of Walter Abrams (Al Pacino), Brandon takes on the persona of John Anthony, a slick talking, high rolling, city slicker. Walter, who is fighting with his addictions to alcohol and gambling, has a love hate relationship with Brandon. As most of us expect from Pacino, his on the money performance really makes me believe he is this deeply conflicted person willing to do anything to make his business successful. Including things like, going to meetings with recovering gamblers and giving them his business card. Toni (Rene Russo) does a fantastic job playing Walters' wife, an ex-drug addict who was abused as a child. <br/><br/>Due to the efforts of the cast and director, I cannot say anything bad about acting in this film. This usually would mean I would say ""hey this is a great movie you should definitely see it."" But because of the terrible story written by Dan Gilroy, this film is just plain boring. Unless you are an avid sports better, I really do not see how anyone would find this film entertaining. Still there are a few scenes that stood out, such as when Brandon's leg was broken. My favorite scene though, had to be when he was urinated on by Novian (Armand Assante) for loosing a lot of his money. Unfortunately the few entertaining scenes in the film cannot make up for the total boredom of it all. If you really do not like McConaughey, and would like to see these horrible things happen to him, watch the movie. Otherwise, I would say you should pass on watching this film. Because when it was over, I felt much like Brandon after his encounter with Novian-- broken and humiliated."

","Sorry, but this movie SUCKED. I don't usually use that word (though I do tend to rate lower than others) but this one earned the term. I'm a huge Al Pacino fan, and I go into all his movies expecting to like them. Rarely am I disappointed.<br/><br/>Two for the Money is an exception. The only saving grace this movie has is that it sucks from the very beginning, so you can cut your losses if you understand that the film won't get any better; it actually gets worse. The dialog is absolutely abysmal. McConaughey spews forth some of the most overworked vernacular I've heard in years. ""My man, my man, that's what I'm talking' about"", he gushes to his clients while convincing them to part with huge sums of money based on his pseudo-clairvoyant sports gambling picks. The other characters don't do any better.<br/><br/>McConaughey's character (Brandon Lang, aka John Anthony) is some washed up football star with a bum knee who is doing 900 number answering in Vegas, when the cable star Walter Abrams (Pacino - he looks EXACTLY the same as he did in ""Insomnia"") calls him from New York to come and work for him for an obscene amount of money to make football gambling ""picks"" for him (didn't I see this movie already? Only the last time I saw it, Keanu Reeves, Charlize Theron, and Connie Nielson were in it, and it was good. ) After a few weeks of stellar performance, Lang/Anthony's performance sags, and in between heart attacks (remember those ""Super Fans"" (da Bears) skits from SNL?), and cigarettes, Abrams shows a psycho side that bears watching, only it basically disappears without a trace and only once or twice comes back, and not very convincingly. It isn't that Walter can't decide. The screenwriters can't decide, and you wonder if they missed the editing phase of the work.<br/><br/>Except that nothing is consistent. We don't know if Abrams is psychotic or kind, and there is no effort to help us make this decision. And before anyone says, ""he is a contrast of characters"", let me assure you that the screen writers just don't know how to adapt characters. There's nothing deep about this guy; it's just sloppy work. (Can you imagine what was left on the cutting room floor if this stuff made it to the screen?) Did I mention Rene Russo? Another fine actress whose talent went for naught in this bomb. I still want to know how all these folks got tangled up with D.J. Caruso (director: ""The Shield"", ""Smallville""), and Dan Gilroy (screenwriter: uh, ""Freejack""?) is hard to say. Someone must owe someone big time.<br/><br/>Russo, as Abrams's long suffering wife Toni, does the best she can with the dialog, but she's no magician. And I wish I was a fly on the wall when she was being directed during one particular scene in which she throws a temper tantrum during a spat between her and Walter. Must have been something like, ""Ok, Rene, now scream . . louder, stomp your feet . . . overact, damn it!! Look like you just got out of acting school!"" Well, I guess we'll never really know, but I know I've never seen her in anything as bad as this. (Is it my imagination, or is her chin getting bigger? She's starting to look a lot like Jay Leno.) So, save the money, get something good - ""Salton Sea"", also directed by Caruso, wasn't half bad - and wait for Pacino to start picking his roles like Brandon Lang picks point spreads."

The muddle comes from the filmmakers' fuzzy notion of what exactly is the point to their movie.<br/><br/>I don't think I've seen either Pacino or McConaughey looking that under the weather when it comes to their looks. They both looked like they were out all night partying up a storm and then coming in to shoot their scenes wired up.

","I would rate this film 5,5/10. Just above the average. In order to draw a conclusion and take a decision about where this 0,5 should go (to 5 or to 6), I decided to take into consideration the first feeling I had just after watching it. Yet, it became more confusing! Because the first feeling was like ""ok, it was a decent movie, Al Pacino did his best to lift it, but still..."" it lacked something or it had some unnecessary things to watch, it was not that kind of movie that you would recommend to your friends the next morning... and I think that's all a movie production would ask for, isn't it? So, thanks to the fact that I am a positive person by nature(!) and maybe 'cause a movie featuring Al Pacino is too much to...be bad I decided to give this 0,5 to 6. If I was forced (!) to recommend it to my friends, I would definitely mention Pacino's engaging and delectable acting (especially when he talks to the group meeting), the similarity of the movie style with that of ""devil's advocate"" and the fact that it's a relatively fast movie so that makes it an easy to watch one(not tiring). Now, for those who don't like watching a movie and knowing ALL THE TIME what's going to happen next, please stay away from it and watch it only if there is nothing else to do. You can even guess the scores of the matches being on bet!! (ok kidding...almost!) Apart from that, I think that there were some scenes that elicited question marks such as ""What's the point of that??"" and this feeling came to its summit in the end of the movie. Finally, there were some parts that they were too good to be true and I felt like my intelligence (if any) was underrated. In conclusion, after watching a movie, I tend to classify it according to a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to 2 very simple questions: ""Would I miss anything if I didn't watch it?"" & ""Was it worth seeing that?"" and I'm not talking about money... Spending 2 hours of my life watching a completely useless and pointless movie (while there are many other great ones out there), I think is far more critical than spending 8 E/$ (or nothing, it depends... :) At the end of the day, I'm afraid that my answer to both of the above two questions would be ""No""."

This movie could have easily been 90 minutes and the emotional impact the ending was supposed to have fell flat. It seems like there was meant to be a huge twist but it ends in somewhat confusion (not with the plot but why it ever happened to begin with).<br/><br/>After watching the movie I came out of it with nothing, the story and direction made it seem like a waste of time, not really an enjoyable experience.

Although McCaunaghy is a good actor, Pacino carries this movie on his back with his one liners, quick wit and random thoughts that prove not so random. I enjoyed him in this movie and believe that even though he is 64, this man is far from retiring. I just saw him at the taping of ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" and he is one of the most together people I have ever met. He came from living on the stage of his first show in the Bronx, to earning high figures for his work on legendary movies such as Scarface and Scent of A Woman. This movie really showcases his ""tough guy"" abilities but also gives you a sneak peak into a more humane side using his movie family as an example. He is a legend and I can't wait to see him in more movies in the future!"

","Please do not go see this. I did have several laughs throughout this movie, but they were all due to unintentional comedy.<br/><br/>There were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the character development was. Pacino played Pacino again and was aggravating most of the time. The scenes in this movie seem like they were put together from 20 other bad movies by a really poor editor. There is no continuity and I found myself wondering why I didn't leave 15 minutes into this.<br/><br/>I would suggest never seeing a movie directed by D.J. Caruso. This really was awful."
"gwbush909","4","1","3","10 August 2006"," Movie making by the numbers!
","Motion picture excitement! Watch Al Pacino pick up a paycheck! Watch Matthew Mahogany try to act! Watch Rene Russo ..... well, stand around and look nice!<br/><br/>A lot of noise, no substance. This is simply movie making by the numbers. I just felt I had seen all this in other movies, only done much better. Unlikable characters, holes in the plot, people doing things they would never do in real life. I know this was based on a true story, but I'm sure it was drastically changed in the writing process. The film tries to get the viewer to sympathize with two very unlikable characters. Why would I feel sorry for two professional gamblers who were helping people to ruin their lives? What's next, a sympathetic look at drug dealers who help people overdose? I was hoping Pacino and Mahogany's characters would go bust and get hurt by the people they were ripping off.<br/><br/>One thing you can always bet on. Mahogany could not act his way out of a wet paper sack!"
"RCeditor","7","1","3","8 October 2005"," Liked the story, but not enough character development
","Loved the performances. Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors. I am not familiar with sports betting, and found the story informative. However, I was disappointed with the formation of the characters. I would say it was more due to the writing than the acting. I could tell from the beginning that Renee Russo's character was 'supposed' to be an enabler. I felt that it was not, however, subtle enough; she was saying and doing things that she was 'supposed' to do, and practically shouting that she was a codependent. I wish it hadn't been so spelled-out. Same with John (Matthew McConaughey's character). The character went from small town to big shot so quickly. The rest of the story itself was very good."
"SvenShameless","7","2","11","5 October 2005"," A Surprise for the Money
","I couldn't believe when I sat down and watched an early preview of this movie. Quick editing and a fast paced presented us with Brandon Lang and his motivation in life and sports and how he bet it all and became injured and no longer could play sports. Then, he's whisked away by Al Pacino's character.<br/><br/>This is probably the most interesting and unusual aspect of the film the brotherhood/fatherhood between Brandon and Pacino's character. Often times, it was almost as if one was watching a love affair happen between the two. There's definitely some homo erotic overtones so much so that in one scene in which Armand Assante's character gets revenge on Brandon for losing him money, the viewer will ask themselves, wait what is up with this movie? It doesn't stop there and with the introduction of Rene Russo comes the some good old Oedipus Complex. Not that it really goes far and really makes the ending come together, but at times unnerving seeing just how far Pacino's character put his wife played by Russo out on a plate for Brandon. After all, Pacino even says ""well if I'm your dad that would make you his mother"". Just what is going on with Pacino's character and how wonderfully played warrants a viewing, homo erotic and Oedipus undertones and all."
"Musafir","10","1","4","10 February 2006"," A masterpiece (contains Spoilers)
","For starters, this is one of the better movies to have released in 2005. The storyline, the characters, and the performances make this movie a must see. The story is about Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey), a pro footballer whose career is cut short by an injury. Brandon takes up predicting winners for football games as an alternate career path. His prediction success rate is high. Walter Abrams (Al Pacino in a splendid role) businessman who runs a betting syndicate, asks Brandon to join him, and soon the duo start making some big money. The story moves around the relationships between Brandon, Walter, and Walter's wife, Toni (Rene Russo), and also how Brandon scales heights and then crashes into the dumps. Other characters just support the good work the lead actors have done. Credit goes to the director for handling the subject well and not dragging the story. The climax is the best part of the movie. Al Pacino just walks through his role, and Matthew McConaughey lives and breathes Brandon Lang. Rene Russo is dignified in her role, and looks gorgeous. This movie cannot be missed. So grab some popcorn, rush to your nearest cinema, and watch this masterpiece."
"jesperpadmos","5","1","4","3 January 2006"," The Devil's Bookie
","This flick is the bad version of The Devil's Advocate; making lots of money and success in The Big Apple for some man doing dubious business (Pacino; great of course).<br/><br/>The story makes no sense at all: if this guy is so good in predicting sports results: than do it your self and make a lot more money. That was what it was all about, wasn't it? No... They let people pay a lot of money to give them the predictions by phone.<br/><br/>Acting was'n bad though; neither sound, camera etc. It lacks originality; we've all seen the dark side of gambling and success stories. Some kissing with the Bosses wife.. et voila!"
"GraebeRob","1","1","4","6 November 2005"," Disgusting language and behavior
","This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. There is no coherent plot and the actors dialogue is a constant stream of profanity that adds nothing to this already weak story. Matthew M. proves once again that he can't act and Pacino is a over the top in being obnoxious. Ms. Russo was the only bright spot in a terrible film. I hate to think that I actually paid full price to see this piece of filth. I watched the trailer again after seeing the movie and was surprised at how they portrayed the movie versus the reality of the movie. If you listen carefully, you can hear the stutters in the trailer where they had to splice out every other word which was so profane that it wouldn't have been viewable on any public website."
"tdevereauxbell3","8","1","4","10 October 2005"," A Good Movie with a Very Heavy Side
","This is a good film. The depth of feeling is wonderful. And, though I think it might have been slightly miscast, the acting is terrific. As a whole the film is entirely enjoyable. <br/><br/>It's hard to put my finger on any casting flaws with such strong actors, but I had to justify taking points off, and I figured I'd get my quasi-criticism out of the way. One of the clearer casting flaws is Piven, who, though wonderful as always, plays a character who is entirely loathsome - as opposed to his usual partially-loathsome-but-still-entirely-endearing. It's hard to hate him in general, but impossible not to hate him in this particular role. I hate hating Jeremy Piven. <br/><br/>Like I said, everyone is good; but Russo is the only one whose dead-on; she's perfectly cast, and her role was flawlessly acted. The few tidbits regarding her character's past fit perfectly with the look and feel Russo provides for film. <br/><br/>McConaughey is solid; and is entirely believable as an athlete turned sleezy-salesman. The three demands on his character - namely his need to be 'a winner', his slight gullibility, and his ascetic drive slash moral foundation - are well met by his acting. <br/><br/>Finally Pacino  who's always good, of course. I know I'll get criticism for this, but this might be his most challenging role. I think it's the most complex. He's essentially playing the main character, who is at the same time not the main character  which is interesting and difficult in itself. If you love Pacino, and you love movies - a common tandem -; but moreover if you enjoy and actors effort as much as his/her success, you will love Pacino's here. <br/><br/>His role is not really about gambling; nor is it about making money; or satisfying his ego, at least not on a wholly personal level. Its about facing all the demons that come with being a 'family man'  a father, a husband, an aging provider  I.e., facing one's own adequacy reflected back; controlling one's vices for the sake of other people; the inevitable confrontation with mortality, and whether you will respond selfishly or altruistically to this confrontation; its about the need to secure a good life for you wife and child; to create for them what you never had; to leave them in safety at the end. <br/><br/>Pacino is not a man bent on monetary success here. He's a sick, sick man who knows he won't live much longer  a fact which almost seems like a dead end in the film. He needs tp pick someone to replace him. He picks winners for a living, and he is hoping that by picking McConaughey's character he is picking a winner for his family - someone he can, as he says, 'build an empire around'. The big question that haunts the final years of every great emperor is, 'Who will take my place and carry on my work?'. And to pick a winner - an heir - he applies the only method he knows: the gamble. He literally calls a 1-900 number to find the guy he wants to place his bet on. <br/><br/>Pacino in a role with this much depth is all a movie-lover can ask for. Even though I'm not sure Pacino, or the movie as a whole, succeeds 100 percent, the courageous and well considered attempt is just as enjoyable. I'll have to - and want to - see the movie again; and if nothing else, that alone qualifies it as a success.<br/><br/>Plus Armand Assante is just cool."

","There are myriad movies about a young man who has an amateur's gift for something. Then he enters the big leagues, the enterprise becomes demystified, he faces inner or outer demons, overcomes them, achieves momentous success, and returns to his roots, a man in full.<br/><br/>That's pretty much the tale of McConaughey, an amiable naif giving comments and advice on a backwoods radio program who's talent is for figuring out who's going to win football games.<br/><br/>He gets a call from Al Pacino, who runs -- well, I don't know what the enterprise can be called. It's a large room full of experts on football who sell betting odds over the phone, rather like stockbrokers, only this is serious money. Pacino is expansive and seductive, almost a reprise of his role in ""The Devil's Advocate."" <br/><br/>He takes over McConaughey's life, buys him expensive suits, advertises him, and puts him on a TV show. Pacino's wife, Rene Russo, takes a shine to McConaughey too, but nothing untoward happens. McConaughey's a likable guy -- until he gets cocky, superior, and begins to take time off to play golf. A series of failures bring down both him and Pacino, until the climactic Big Win.<br/><br/>The characters are superbly written by Dan Gilroy, and the dialog sounds like the Fourth of July parade in Disneyland. The violent language sparkles with a hilarious profanity. Pacino's metaphors rise to the heights of poetry. I can't reproduce any here.<br/><br/>The score is unobtrusive, the location shooting evocative without showing off, and Conrad Hall's seasoned photography catches it all nicely on celluloid.<br/><br/>All the performances, major and minor, are fine but there are times when it's hard to discern a character's motivation. Pacino and McConaughey have a complex relationship, switching back and forth between deep affection and creeping suspicion. The switches sometimes come too quickly and for reasons that remain murky. I don't know why Pacino embraces McConaughey instead of just kicking his ass out, when McConaughey comes up with a string of losers, and I don't know the significance of making big bets on the flip of a coin (twice). <br/><br/>Last scene: a refurbished and renewed McConaughey in old clothes, a pack slung over his shoulder, a smile on his face, boarding the airplane that will take him back to San Placebo where life is simpler and he can become a middle-school coach with perspective.<br/><br/>The story doesn't link its episodes together very well but the pieces on occasion become works of art. Not majestic works of art, but not Grandma Moses either."

His motto is to turn his collaborators into money vacuum by all means. In a great scene of collective therapy, you understand that he is really ill.<br/><br/>Beyond Al, the cast isn't really interesting (McConaughey is a masculine Playmate, never missing an occasion to show his body, Russo not much convincing) and the story a bit obscure: if sports bets are illegal, how can they advise freely? Why do they say it is tax-free?"
"ray-280","10","0","2","15 September 2007"," The lock of the year for the sports betting fan
","We all know the sales pitches: some guy with a 900 number tells you he's hitting 82 percent on the year, and you can have his picks for this weekend for one ""low"" price (compared to what you win!). He'll even give you a free game to get you started, and if that game doesn't win, he'll call the guy he gave the other side to and sign him up instead.<br/><br/>Two For The Money sanitized the sports **touting** industry (what this film is really about), and it glorified, by portraying as successful, what is at best a guy who had a winning year or two, something bound to happen when your phone banks have fifty guys.<br/><br/>This film is based on a very true story, with the names and backstories only slightly changed. The ""quarterback"" Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughy) is based on someone certainly never known much as one, but who may have played the game. Not that this matters, as your tout customers don't care about your life story, only if you can win for them, and Lang delivers through his Vegas-based 900 number.<br/><br/>New York tout king Walter Abrams, played in deliciously over-the-top fashion by Al Pacino, brings the over-the-top nature of the industry to life, not only the touts who make misleading claims (13-2 the last 15 means nothing and they don't tell you about the 2-13), but also the customers who demand the moon of guaranteed riches for a small fee. Renee Russo (Toni) gives her usually lame performance, like a double-digit NFL favorite mailing in a last-minute field goal to win.<br/><br/>As a ""public handicapper"" (I do horses and I make no guarantees), I quickly found the film engaging, particularly its correct focus on how Lang handles the pressure of risking other people's money through his picks. Scam artist or not, any tout always wants his clients to win, because they will gladly pay him well and he'll know he's earned it. It's when the bad times come that the tout's world becomes a living hell, knowing he just sent his followers into the poorhouse, even though that's because they were risking too much to begin with.<br/><br/>The other theme in the film is how Walter Abrams is always looking ahead to next Sunday as if he were just dropped out of the womb and nothing bad had ever happened to him. He knows that even the guys who curse him out will send him money again, and he will win again, sometimes, someday, hopefully, and at 1;00 every Sunday in the fall, the circus will start anew with him front and center, his business acumen saving him from his darker and more expensive urges. Sure, he's living on the edge, but he wouldn't have it any other way, because more than anything else, Walter Abrams was addicted to the thrills, while Brandon Lang was just looking for a job. The contrast is phenomenal and striking."

This movie is a very entertaining, yet sad story, when people our at there all time lows and are caught in the middle of one of the most vicious cycles in the world, gambling. Matthew Mchoungahey plays Brandon Lang, a former college football star who's career is prematurely ended after a gruesome knee injury.

As Brandon is being groomed as the next big thing in walters growing industry, he learns that this is more than a game, this is people's lives. After a string of successful weekends picking games, there comes a cold streak at the end of the regular season. As brandon realizes what is happening to the lives of the people that are bettin on his picks, he wants out of the game. But it will not be that easy as walter has bankrolled him to be his successors, and now brandon realizes he is not just gambling on sports, he is gambling with his life.

We had the slight clue when Brandon says quietly ""I'm going to kiss you now..."". And it didn't quite fit with Brandon did it?<br/><br/>Finally, the key scene at the end - Hank accuses Toni. And then she explains what happened and suddenly the game becomes crystal clear :<br/><br/>Brandon has set Hank up TWICE -<br/><br/>Firstly, Hank gets the high he ""wants"" out of losing Toni completely, remember Hank was in such a good mood next morning? He was in his zone - in that brief period when he is ABOUT to lose Toni, see?<br/><br/>But, THEN we see the brilliance of Brandon's game - the 2nd play.<br/><br/>Secondly, Hank thinks he has lost Toni - he has got his sick little ""hit"", but suddenly we realise Toni was not unfaithful, that Hank can get Toni ""back"".<br/><br/>Now, unlike Brandon who was hurt when he found out he was set up in love - Hank now finds he too has been set up, but in contrast the result for him is the climactic moment of his life - to regain his lovely wife, by seeing his flaw laid out openly.<br/><br/>It was a masterful game and a masterpiece of a film. 9/10"

","The performances of Al Pacino, Rene Russo and Matthew McConaughey are what elevates this movie to a higher level than just another morality tale about sports gambling.<br/><br/>Pacino stars as Walter Abrams, a passionate and driven (but broken in so many ways) man who is looking for a protégé, someone he can pass his sports gambling empire to. He finds it in Matthew McConaughey, in perfect form as Brandon Link, a swaggering hotshot who can predict the winning football teams before they play. Walter puts all of his eggs in Brandon's basket, despite the reservations of his wife Toni (the luminous and always wonderful Rene Russo). She is a recovering heroin addict, and she knows that her husband can slip back at any time into one of his addictions. Walter is vulnerable, and she knows it. She is fighting for him to stay afloat, and for the survival of their marriage.<br/><br/>Like any tale of a mentor-protégé, when things are going well, the world is theirs for the taking. But when things come apart (and they always do)-the mighty fall hard. This film however, is more complex-it examines the world of sports gambling and the nature of addiction all the while operating around the father-son-like relationship of Walter and Brandon which at times is harmonious and at other times fractious. Toni at times seems like the third wheel, although Walter's paranoia leads him to betray her and he nearly derails them. The final showdown between Russo and Pacino is both powerful and moving. Kudos to Dan Gilroy, who wrote the role specifically for Rene. Exciting and thought-provoking, this is a terrific movie all around."

Sigh. <br/><br/>Its difficult not to compare this film to Devils Advocate, as Pacino is basically handed and relives the exact same role complete with generous helpings of blasphemy-rich, meant to make you squirm F dialog. An idiotic sequence where Pacino coaches goody 2 shoes McCon on incorporating the F word into his vocabulary, ends up with the latter using it in a telephone conversation later with his mother...she was calling him about some major family crisis that believe it or not, is never fully revealed to us and is in no way resolved. Shall I talk of the Gamblers Anonymous meeting where Pacino hands out business cards looking for new customers for his 1 900 operation? The situations, arcs and overall template are near carbon copy of Devils Adv., but as you can see nowhere near as plausible, which is a laugh considering Devils Advocate deals with the supernatural. (alas no naked Charlize this time either.) <br/><br/>To be fair, major shortcomings and annoyances thrust aside, I grudgingly admit this movie somehow manages to entertain. I credit that more, however, to the subject matter. If you have any sort of interest in gambling, and who doesn't, there is a decided thrill in watching someone ride the roller coaster vicariously. Silly and banal though it may be, 2 For The Money still manages to scratch that gambler euphoria itch."

","Al Pacino's performance is simply marvelous, but this isn't a surprise and the movie would be worth watching only for it. Plus has a strong impact and it's engaging in its understanding what gambling is, how it works and how pervasive it is in America. Apart from the first class cast the plot is fascinating for the stylish way it tells about this damned world where people lose everything counting on illusions. Atmospeheres and circumstances the plot develops in are extremely realistic,a long with the terrible waking-up. Believe Hollywood's idea of making ""Two for the money"" was good since the audience felt the need of being told about this interesting, though terrible world."

","A movie about winning and loosing, not only in gambling but also in life! My personal feelings about the movie are rather good! The plot was OK, tempo also OK and overall GOOD.<br/><br/>My expectation was only to view a mediocre film and knowing what was going to happen as the movie went on, meaning that these type of films are quite easy to anticipate. Well, I can say both yes and no. Not wanting to unveil anything for you guys that have not seen the movie I won't go any further in this matter! <br/><br/>The flick should be great when looking at the cast right? We have Al Pacino(greatest of all time), Matthew McConaughey and Rene Russo as lead actors. I have no real complains about the acting, actually the acting was radiant if you ask me. Surely Al Pacino has been seen better and more convincing but Matthew in my opinion steals the show. <br/><br/>Pacino plays a famous sports-gambler-business-owner, who is very intense and has a recognized gambling problem. Although he hasn't gambling himself the past 15 years or so. The treatment and meetings he's attending seems to work out just fine. Moving on to Matthew then, his character is more soft spoken and much humbler. Growing up and becoming one of the States most promising quarterbacks ended up in a nightmare. A leg injury was so bad that it forced him to give up football at a very young age. Still having the love for the game and God blessed talent at predicting games makes him a wanted sport-games-expert. Pacino convinces him to work for him and quickly he does..<br/><br/>Rene Russo plays Pacinos wife incidentally.<br/><br/>You should really give this movie a shot, maybe it's a helping hand to people with an actual gambling problem :)..You might even get surprised, don't want hand out spoilers what so ever but in closure I must say; Gambling is a beautiful lady in a red dress, naahh mean?<br/><br/>Watch this movie!"

","I watched this movie not expecting much at all... I was 'really' surprised - this movie is actually 'very' good, and well worth seeing in the cinema.<br/><br/>I normally hate sports movies (they are all normally cheesy, predictable and quite frankly boring) - This one however, is a whole different kettle of fish - Don't prejudge it and put it in the same basket as those other films. <br/><br/>It is a completely refreshing, original and watchable film. There is not actually much sport in the movie (so don't worry if you don't like sports movies - You will still enjoy this - I hate sports movies, but I liked this one). Instead the film shows the complex relationship between the various characters and the highs and lows that sports gambling can bring.<br/><br/>The only negative for me was that the film didn't explain sports gambling at all - which perhaps it needed to, given that it is about Sports gambling. It was also a little too long...<br/><br/>On the whole it was a very clever movie, with some brilliant acting performances - If you are a proper film fan - you will really appreciate this film. I think the film owes a lot to the main actors though - without their uplifting performances, this film probably wouldn't have been anywhere near as good or convincing.<br/><br/>Pacino in this is at his all time best - Superb performance...<br/><br/>McConaughey and Russo also don't disappoint, and all characters work well together and play off each other.<br/><br/>The film will definitely keep you engaged, and has a few interesting twists and turns too...<br/><br/>Surprising how a film based on Sports gambling can be so entertaining and interesting.<br/><br/>The average user rating on this website for this film doesn't do this film justice. It is a very good film - You should go and see it. I would give it 8/10."

I am talking about the quality movie that you wished you had supported so Hollywood would make more of these movies. This movie was like Quiz Show, in that I wished I had seen it in the theater. While Quiz Show is one of the better movies I have ever seen, this is one of the better movies I did not see last year. This movie is heartfelt because in large part it is true. It is well acted in most parts because it has one of the greatest actors ever to grace the screen, who is acting rather than over-reacting. For instance, there is a moment where Al Pacino is in his house with Rene Russo and Matthew McConoughy(spelling?) and Al Pacino's daughter in the movie, and Pacino carries this difficult scene off with such a range of emotion that you can see all of his love of Shakespeare coming through because he is going through all the ranges of emotion that a character goes through in one of the Bard's plays. He is jealous. He is happy. He is proud. He is hurt. He is upset. He is uncertain how to react so he is calculating how to act. Watching Pacino's face go through these emotions made me appreciate him more as an actor, and this movie more for allowing such a range of emotion in what I thought would be some Fluffy Sports Gambling Movie that was banking on a few well-named actors to sell itself. All in all, I thought this movie ran the gamut of emotions for me and that's what I want from a movie. A solid 7 out of 10, and if I could give it a 1/2 mark, I would have actually given it a 7.5 out of 10."

The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (to me) is that we are watching an extremely talented actor, Pacino, seemingly playing a parody of himself. That's what remained with me as a total mystery. I can fully understand the need for movie industry people to work and thus make a living. What I fail to comprehend is an artist of Al Pacino's talent prostituting and embarrassing himself with this level of mindless junk.

At first the team (Pacino and McConaughey) make money, but as everybody knows if you gamble, you can lost money just as easy as making it, and that's what happens.

McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he became a promoter of the ""F"" word also. This might be the kind of society that they actually live in, but most of us have the common decency to watch what we say in mixed company. I don't recall the exact words that a professor used in explaining the constant use of profanity, but it was something like this. ""It shows a lack of intelligence, poor language skills and disrespect for all those that have to listen."" Maybe it is time that Al takes some acting courses again to sharpen his talent.

","This is by far probably the worst film Al Pacino could have starred in. The movie had no real plot. It kind of careens into 24 different directions. It seems that the target audience for this film are people from gambler's anonymous.Mat Mcconaughey's character is not believable enough to be Pacino's protégé'. So he won a few bets for some degenerate clients as a sideline to a shitty job recording on a 900 service. Does that automatically supposed to convince an audience of his skills? It was just plain stupid to think of. The trailer did promise to show us how he makes his sure-shot picks but after going through the whole film I have yet to see what skill if any he ever had. If you want skill try looking at Robert de Niro's character in Casino now that is showmanship. At some point in the film, Mat's character picks his winning bets at a flip of a coin. Anybody could do that. Al Pacino seems to talk a lot and I mean blabber mouth in your face dialog. I think that style started with Scent of a Woman and worked for him because he finally won an Oscar but now I think its just irritating. He seems to be always sermonizing. He does do a mean act of portraying a man having unstable angina (that's an impending heart attack) its typically reminiscent of his acting in Godather part 3 which he plays the aging,diabetic mafia don corleone but other than that Pacino's talent is wasted on this film. Rene Russo is just plain eye candy for this film. She's kept in shape and shows it off in the tight clothes she wears throughout. This film is plain crap. Do not waste your money on it. It is much worse than the gambling picks of Mats character in the film."

","We have all seen films where certain actor's just seem to shamelessly chew up their scenes with gusto but let's face it, it would be hard to imagine other films if they didn't. I think this is one of those films because without Al Pacino doing what he does best this would probably come off as tedious at best. Story is about an ex-football player named Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey) who has suffered a career ending injury and ends up working for $10 an hour at a 1-900 telephone service where he gives football picks to listeners.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** Brandon is so good at this that eventually he gets a phone call from Walter Abrams (Pacino) who runs a sports betting service in New York City where clients spend thousands and even millions of dollars. Walter is very successful and married to Toni (Rene Russo) and together they raise their young daughter but he's also a recovering gambling addict with a serious heart condition. Walter brings Brandon to the East Coast and shows him how to be a ruthless prognosticator and when Brandon proves to be a complete success with his football picks he actually gets a co-anchor position on Walter's cable access show. Things eventually start to go downhill when Brandon's picks start going sour and clients start losing all of their money but things really get bad when Walter starts gambling again and also suspects that Brandon and his wife are having an affair.<br/><br/>This is directed by D.J. Caruso (Taking Lives) who has shown to be a competent filmmaker and here he's made a pretty good looking film that makes good use of it's New York City locations. The film's story doesn't offer anything revolutionary in terms of surprises but the main theme of people betting large amounts of cash is something that I have always found intriguing. McConaughey is a capable actor and here he's well cast as an ex-jock who is easily drawn into the gambling circles and from the perspective of the audience it's believable to watch his character get so taken in. Pacino is the key to this film not only because of his star power but for the simple fact that he's the real life force that makes this effort so entertaining to watch. His character has been described by many as reminiscent of his role in ""The Devil's Advocate"" and it would be hard to argue it but being one of the best actors in the world he still gives this character enough unique tics to make sure it is clearly different. Sure, Pacino is over the top but can anyone really imagine this film without him? Dan Gilroy's script doesn't offer anything that hasn't been done better before (1974's The Gambler is a good example) but the cast is good and Pacino once again shows audiences that he's still a force to be reckoned with."

","Just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it get screwed up. I really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and Matthew McConaughey. First off I am not a MM hater, I thought he was awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 times. Yes we all get it that he a good-looking guy with a nice body, but I think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in A Time to Kill. Showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman 3-4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary. I think one time would have been sufficient. It wouldn't surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other, no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling, unless......Enough about that, let's get into his role. I feel his acting was very forced and he didn't seem very comfortable. I know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner, but his lines were corny and cheesy. It was almost like he was referencing Days and Confused lines a few times! In short, I didn't like his character even though I was supposed to. The accent, his shirt off, corny pick up lines, weak sales pitches. His character was just too much of a tool, as Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but that' no surprise. Piven is fun to watch as Arie....oooops I mean Jerry. I just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly. It's insulting that they could take a great story, and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success. 1. Cool story that appeals to the male man 2. Hunky Hollywood actor for female women (make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights) 3. Al Pacino with 4 great speech scenes, and 25 great one liners 3. Every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan 4. Jeremy Piven to play the same character he did in Entourage and Old School 4. Throw in Armand Assante to seal the deal 5. Plot, good writing, character development, and intelligent casting are unnecessary<br/><br/>This will be good enough for most people, but not me! Anybody who disagrees with me, ask your self this. Would this movie be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM<br/><br/>I will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks. I realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of Pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing Russo. The financial success of this movie will ensure one thing. The movie going public gets what the movie going public wants, big budget crapola."
