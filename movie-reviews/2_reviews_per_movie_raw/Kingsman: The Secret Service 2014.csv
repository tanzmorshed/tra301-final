","I'm going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action films. I'm 42 years old, I'm from Texas and I can take it. Growing up with films like 'Rambo', 'Die Hard', 'The Terminator' and 'Robocop', I can't stand that watered-down ""no-blood-no-swearing"" gutless kiddie fare that is being served as ""action"" these days. I know the real thing when I see it - we used to see it all the time back in the day - and I hardly ever see it anymore.<br/><br/>Which brings me to this movie. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was being shown just around the corner from where I live, and because I loved two of director Matthew Vaughn's previous films, 'Layer Cake' and 'Kick-Ass', I naturally took the chance to see it. I had already read some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally bad-ass, and I can now say that's actually putting it mildly. This film is nothing short of bat-shît crazy.<br/><br/>Years ago Tarantino said in an interview that he had written a James Bond script and that he would love to direct a Bond film. Sadly, that never happened, but ever since I read that I wondered what an R-rated Bond might be like. I don't know, maybe Matthew Vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential, because 'Kingsman' is pretty much that: An ultra violent, funny, crazy, foul-mouthed James Bond film (with a little bit of 'Men in Black' and 'Mission Impossible' thrown in). You could say that this is to Bond what 'Game of Thrones' is to 'Lord of the Rings': Where the former can't and dare not go (for marketing and box office reasons), the latter joyfully and gloriously ventures. Dirty and (very black) humor - check. Bad language - check. Gratuitous violence - check. Needless to say, I was thrilled.<br/><br/>But it's also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark Hamill) and spectacular, over-the-top fight-scenes that in some instances even rival films like 'The Raid' for their sheer visceral intensity. In short, if you're as fed up with lame wannabe Die-Hards and Terminators as I am, go watch this film. Apart from the rare 'John Wick' or 'Equalizer', 'Kingsman' seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did. Average = a perfect 10.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>P.S. I recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of R rated movies. If you're a film fan (especially of films that don't cater to teenagers), you might find it as enlightening as I have:<br/><br/>www.the-fanboy-perspective.com/the-importance-of-the-r-rating.html"
"CalRhys","Null","303","447","24 February 2015"," Quintessentially British, Hilariously Funny, Brutally Violent
","Stylish, brutal and hilarious. 'Kingsman' is an extremely quintessentially British flick full of over-the-top yet hilarious comedy, brutal violence and a quirky image of England. Since James Bond's debut in 1962, a number of films have attempted to reinvent the genre, with films like 'Johnny English', 'Get Smart', 'This Means War' and many more, however, none have come close to displaying the perfect blend like 'Kingsman' has. Matthew Vaughn has become renowned for taking on action-comedy projects, for instance 'Kick-Ass' (which is still stronger than this but only just), and along the way has kept that feel-good British aspect to it that makes our greatest secret agent (James Bond) such an icon. All-in-all 'Kingsman' is a brilliant, well-executed film."
"funwithflags1992","10","387","592","22 December 2014"," Crazy, over-the-top ultra violent fun!!!
","I just came back from a pre-screening of 'Kingsman' and let me tell you: if you liked the first Kick-Ass, you are going to LOOOVE this film! I would never have thought that a stiff Brit like Colin Firth could pull off action - but boy, does he whoop ass in this one. I thought the story was rather original (don't know the Comic), it's a bit like an ultra violent James Bond parody. Or better: a crossbreed of Bond and Kick-Ass. Finally an action movie that doesn't use kiddie-gloves. The kid who plays the recruit is also worth mentioning. I've never seen him before but he really nails it. There's a lot of humor in this film, it really doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not overdone. And Sam Jackson finally found something he hasn't done yet. I guess his role was already spoiled a bit in the trailer, but believe me: you haven't seen Jackson in this kind of part before. This is an excellent, over-the-top bloody and sexy film for fans of old-school action films. I give it 10 stars. Highly recommended!"
"Quint1965","8","429","665","27 December 2014"," Hilarious! This could be the surprise hit of 2015
","Well folks, that's how it's done. Ever thought MI-6 (note: that's what the British call their secret service) is a club for snobbish, upper class dudes who like to watch paint dry all they long? OK, Bond is kind of cool (I hated the last two, though), but now we finally got a film that takes spy movies to the next level. Not since 'District 9' have I had that feeling during the watching of a film like ""this movie just does everything right"" (by which I mean of course: it plays exactly to MY taste). <br/><br/>Compared to this film, every James Bond movie released after 'Licence to Kill' looks like a snore-fest. This is such a kick-ass, ""balls against the wall"" crazy ride that I had to shake my head several times in disbelief during the screening I was invited to. And I actually knew what I was in for. I've seen every film by Matthew Vaughn, but I was not prepared how far he was willing to go with this one. Thought 'Kick-Ass' was pretty crazy? Wait till you see this.<br/><br/>One of the key ingredients is the casting of the actors. The well known stars all play against type, which makes this even more unreal. Remember that lame dude who mainly played lame dudes in girlie movies like 'Bridget Jones'? He just won an Oscar for playing the stuttering King of England, and as you will see in 'Kingsman', that Oscar was well deserved: that dude (Colin Firth) can play anything! He's more bad-ass in this than Bond ever was!<br/><br/>A word to the wise, though, this film is not for the easily offended or the squeamish. It is a comedy but a very, very violent kind of comedy. And the language alone will shock the MPAA out of their pants. Watch this if you're into films like 'Lock, Stock', 'Kick-Ass', or 'In Bruges' and you'll probably love it - don't bother if you're more into serious films or family friendly comedies. As for me, I had a (bloody) good time."

","#Kingsman: The Secret Service is a gentlemen secret spy-society that saves the world from a villain with the help of new recruits ... Don't let this summary fool you, the movie fantastic! It got applause at the end of the preview; for me first time ever in a cinema. <br/><br/>Great lines, never laughed this much: Bond with a wink and fresh edge. Plus super shot ""martial art"" action that should make the Matrix jealous. The action has its true Shakespearian/GoTh moments and all supported by cool tech-stuff. Great aspect in this movie is the music, an extra comic dimension. When you see the movie you'll know what I mean. Next too all the clever fun and furious action, it touches on petty crime poverty and home violence. Matthew Vaugh captures the grimness yet doesn't loose it's lightness ... and I like the message: ""a gentlemen is not born, a gentle(wo)men is someone who chooses to be one."" <br/><br/>The young gang, like Sophie Cookson, held up well and Taron Egerton established his position in the gang of giants. Colin Firth's aloofness was crowned with a kick-ass bite, Samuel Jackson brings his role back to old fashion comedy, strongly supported by Mark Strong and Michael Caine. It is a big 9,5 - this movie just nailed it."
"CharlieGreenCG","10","216","368","15 January 2015"," 007 meets Kick-Ass
","Kingsman: The Secret Service marks the third film in a row that director Matthew Vaughn has adapted from a comic book background. His two predeceasing being Kick-Ass (2010) and X-Men: First Class (2011) - which, by all means, were pretty damn good!<br/><br/>Over the last few decades, both comic and superhero movies, mostly fall into the easy trap of taking themselves too seriously. Where Vaughn's vision lies, and so-far proved by his former comic adapted films is that they draw a clean balance to where drama and serious character development ends, and cartoonish humour meets, leaving a unique entertainment that stands out.<br/><br/>Based on the comic by Mark Millar (who also created Kick-Ass), the film sees a young – no better way to put it – chav, called Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), taken under the wing of Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a spy for her majesty's secret service. With the aid of Michael Caine and Mark Strong, they soon come face-to-face with the villainous Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson); an ego- centric - Steve Jobs-type - billionaire madman (with a lisp), who hates the sight of blood – yet holds a vision of mass biological warfare.<br/><br/>Licenced to thrill, Kingsman' is almost a love-letter to the James Bond films – but not too far as a parody, like Austin Powers - but more a homage to the franchise - a 007 meets Kick-Ass, of sorts. At a point, Colin Firth's character, Harry, even mocks the thought by saying 'give me a far-fetched, theoretical plot any day'<br/><br/>Fans of Bond and Kick-Ass are certain to love it, as through rollercoasters of action, comedy and espionage, comes a bucket of winks, references and nods to the world of spy movies. Just like the colourful, gadget ridden Bond films of the 1960's, Kingsman is very fun to watch, with 'wham, bam, thank-you ma'am' style of mayhem, one- liners and bonkers soundtrack crazed all over it.<br/><br/>The comic the film was based on was already hugely entertaining – in fact, probably the best we have read. Littered with Millar's creative quirkiness and with Vaughn's auteur film-making, has left a stylized-spectacle of ultra-violence.<br/><br/>Portraying the lead character of 'Eggsy', Taron Egerton (also in this month's Testament of Youth), proves to be an outstanding newcomer as he brings the character to life with an energizing vibe of a comparing ethic of chav lifestyle vs. gentleman's class.<br/><br/>Alongside, and tackling the mentor, come father type role, is Colin Firth, who based on previous filmography alone could easily be classed as Britain's most boring and typecast actor. Until now, the mold romantic films is broken as he picks up a gun and finds an encyclopedia of wit and enters openly new territory. It's Colin Firth like you have never seen before! – and it is bad-ass.<br/><br/>Squeezing in with a 15 rating (somehow), Kingsman is never short of violence and its guts and guns galore, when kneecapping; slicing off body parts and explosions become all too familiar. Given the calibre of talent involved, Kingsman' does not fall stereotype and gimmicky like other YA spy adventures like Stormbreaker, or Spy Kids, but instead, a well-deserved mash-up of espionage and true cinematic excitement."
"film316-125-427677","10","208","365","2 February 2015"," The Vaughn Supremacy
","It's strange when you consider it, how much the Spy thriller genre has changed and grown because of James Bond, there is not a single Spy movie that is made that isn't and won't be compared to double 'O' seven himself. So I suppose it's no surprise that a film like Kingsman had to be made eventually, so I suppose the reel question is will this make the Sky fall or just be a quantum of nonsense? <br/><br/>Say what you like about Mathew Vaughn the man likes his comics. So far out of the 5 films he has directed, 3 were graphic novels first. Kingsman is one of them. The man's like the anti-Zack Snyder, he directs films based off of comics and brings out real issues in them, as opposed to Snyder who directs films based off of graphic novels and ignores any merit or comment on the wider world the books make and just makes HIS movies. I'm happy to say that Kingsman is probably the most fun I will have in a cinema screen this year.<br/><br/>As I've already said Spy films get compared to James Bond, so let's begin with that shall we? Kingsman is a film that is both totally unique and its own movie whilst fully embracing its British heritage, the films marketing campaign drew strong comparisons to For Your Eyes Only artwork. The film acknowledges all of those stupid spy clichés in a way which is both knowing and clever, and then it ditches them all. The best example of this I can give is in the opening sequence of the film, there is a glass of whisky, a lot of people die and there isn't a drop of said whiskey spilt, and at that moment Kingsman sticks two fingers up at the past and says ""we're the future"" and from that second onwards Kingsman is its own movie. The film successfully reinvents just about every stereotype imaginable in a spy film. <br/><br/>The villain, who is always central in a spy movie, is Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson). Valentine is a megalomaniac who wants world domination, all standard stuff so far, he also has a lisp and is terrified of blood. That's the kind of thing Kingsman does really well, it sets us up with the standard and transforms it to be unique.<br/><br/>The film is of course preposterous in the extreme, but I don't care. It was funny, clever, brilliant and unique. Kingsman has so many pro's to it that you can easily overlook the minor short comings, because in the end the film has a baddie who has blades for legs, I mean who doesn't love that?<br/><br/>What I like most about Kingsman is that even with all its madness it still manages to have some kind of heart; the entire movie is kind of a think piece on class war and the importance of legacy. The movie has a brain and a soul and it has no problem expressing either, the finale to the parachute problem proves this most for me. <br/><br/>I would be remised if I didn't mention something about the cast, let get over the whole ""the obvious people are amazing thing"" and look forward to the new comers Taron Egerton (playing ""Eggsy"") and Sophie Cookson (playing Roxy). These two talents have come from nowhere and broken through the glass ceiling, Cookson and Egerton are stars with one film to their names, and they deserve every single piece of praise that comes to them. Taron is such an unbelievably versatile young man, he can be funny, clever, cool, cocky, brash, physical, confident and insecure all without saying a word or moving a muscle. Also, I loved seeing Jack Davenport on screen again.<br/><br/>Kingsman is the film this country needed; it's confident and fun, without being disrespectful or full of nasty. In short, Sic."
"RealDuality","9","169","294","27 January 2015"," Vaughn is Let Loose
","People will have interesting reactions to this film. All of Matthew Vaughn's movies have been good, and he was able to push it further with this one. I would call it an action comedy, but there is more of an emphasis on the action than the genre usually has. <br/><br/>There are cool POV shots, and it gets you right into the thick of it. It mixes it up with some short moments where it doesn't cut so quickly, as well as a few long takes that are particular nice. The violence and comedy has a guttural component, which a person like me really enjoys, but it will throw some off. <br/><br/>The film is a throwback to old spy flicks, while at the same time being a sort of parody. It is humorous throughout. Samuel L. Jackson plays an odd megalomaniac who makes you laugh more than shiver, which goes with the tone of the movie. It is nice to see Samuel L. in the role of a bad guy. I have no doubt that many will enjoy the henchwoman, who has a different element to her. Colin Firth fits in with the particularly suave spying; and, the newcomer playing the protagonist, Taron Egerton, handles both the action and comedy well. Mark Strong is always a good actor for movies with dark humor. It is fun, however those who are sensitive may have trouble enjoying it. It is not a film for everyone, but that makes it better for others. I personally think it is Vaughn's best work.<br/><br/>8.75"

"YohjiArmstrong","Null","277","503","29 January 2015"," Kingsman: The Secret Service
","KINGSMAN is yet another comic book mess, this time about a South London petty criminal who is given the chance to join a private intelligence agency only to find himself fighting against both class prejudice and a mad dotcom genius with an aversion to blood who wants to murder most of the population to save the world from global warming. It's amusing to see a film be disrespectful about Obama and AGW but the film is morally repulsive and stupid. It wants to be a silly but fun globe-trotting adventure like old James Bond films but those films had wit, exotic travel, high living and great stunts whilst this film is crude, stuffed with fake-looking CGI, charmless and has stupid jeopardy-free action scenes; I lost count of just how many times the bad guy's goons had the hero in their sights but missed him. The promised chav to gentleman transformation never occurs - apparently being comfortable with who you are is what makes a gentleman - with the hero starting as a lout and ending up as a lout in a bespoke suit. What really sinks the film though is its lack of a moral compass. I could complain about the crudity of having a Swedish princess offer anal sex to the hero but the real culprit is the way the film mixes comic book sensibilities with hyper-realistic violence. People are tortured and cut in half without a qualm. Worst of all is a sequence in the middle where a (hate) church full of people are driven mad and kill each other in an orgy of improvised and graphic violence which is shot like an action scene as if it is entertainment and goes on forever. If you want to see Colin Firth brutally and repeatedly stabbing a woman in the stomach then this is the film for you."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","21","31","11 June 2016"," Surprisingly brilliant
","Having really enjoyed/loved 'X Men: First Class' and 'Kick Ass' and being someone who likes a lot of the actors, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' did seem really intriguing.<br/><br/>There was the intrepidation of whether it would balance the violence and humour well, whether the violence would feel too much or whether the humour would leave a bad taste in the mouth. Finally watching it, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was surprisingly brilliant. It sends up the spy genre (primarily James Bond), very like 'Kick Ass did with comic books, and does so brilliantly.<br/><br/>'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes that gives the film an almost operatic grandeur (like in the fight scene in the church), very cool gadgets, richly coloured lighting and audacious production design. The soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.<br/><br/>Vaughn does a fine job directing here. Not just achieving the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing and the characters interesting, but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things like with the opening credits.<br/><br/>The film's script is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar and very witty, with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny to hilarious moments. While the action is grim and unflinching (some of it is not for the faintest of hearts) but nail-biting and surprisingly dynamic, the fight scene in the church especially standing out. The story is very clever and absorbing, with incredibly energetic pacing without being too hectic or rushed. The film does deal with the twist well, it could easily have been out-of-place, clichéd or overly silly but it's actually a lot of fun with a touch of humanity injected.<br/><br/>'Kingsman: The Secret Service' contains some very memorable characters, including a hench-woman with legs that can kill. It's very well acted too, three of the standouts being Colin Firth, cast against type but doing a phenomenal job (also doing incredibly well in the action), Taron Egerton as an immensely likable main lead and Samuel L. Jackson (though his performance has divided reviewers it seems and understandably), who is clearly having the time of his life as lisping megalomaniac villain Valentine. That is not to dispute Michael Caine, who is more than dependable as a somewhat ambiguous sort of character, and Mark Strong who has a knack of making even weak material interesting, or Sophie Cookson, very fetching though in a slightly underwritten role, and Sofia Boutella who nobody wants to mess with.<br/><br/>If there is something that lets 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' down it is the ending with the anal sex. This was the one part of the film that to me came over as really unnecessary and tasteless, also seeming very out of place compared to the rest of the material and it is introduced randomly. The infamous Princess line is pretty offensively perverse as well.<br/><br/>All in all, though, a surprisingly brilliant send up that does nearly everything right. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"dcobbimdb","3","184","334","26 February 2015"," Didn't work for me on any level
","I went into this movie with decent hopes given the high rating it had, but it's not like I was over expecting or anything. In the end I found this thing a total a mess. I think for me it tried to ride too many lines and as a result failed in most aspects. It tried to take itself serious as a spy movie, yet it also tried to be this weird comedy, and while I think movies are capable of doing both, this one just didn't do it well or right to the point where it just bounced me out of the movie completely. Far as it taking itself seriously I found it to be way over the top unbelievable and unrealistic to the point of being stupid. Far as the comedy, I just didn't think the nuclear head explosions or the McDonalds being served on a silver platter was funny at all.<br/><br/>Granted I'm American and I get that English humor is a bit different, but I love Monty Python, Snatch, Mr. Bean, even most of the Bond films. Yet most of the funny moments in this movie I just found remarkably unfunny to the point where rather than it being a quick laugh it just completely bounced me out of the movie. And the few comical moments that were actually funny were already covered in the trailers, so for me this movie totally fell flat on the comedy scale to the point of actually hurting the movie.<br/><br/>Now on the taking itself seriously aspect, the whole spy gig, the young recruit, it just failed on that level for me as well. Certain aspects of the action scenes were done well and some of the bullet time action was good, but I thought the editing needed a lot of work. The massacre in the church I just thought was way over done and too long. I find it amazing in movies like this how fight scenes go on for many minutes and when it's all done, people are barely winded, breathing normally. Give me a break, go watch professional boxers or MMA fighters and see how they look after just one round, and they are real athletes who train vigorously. So while some of the action was okay, it was so over the top that again it bounced me out of the movie. So between the bad comedy and overcooked action I was constantly being reminded that I was watching a movie rather than be swept up into one.<br/><br/>My last beef is with the main kid and the whole ""recruitment / training camp"". Probably what bounced me out of the movie the most was here we have some reckless rebellious kid who's training to this point has been gymnastics, so okay he's flexible, has good balance, etc... Yet with little to no further training at all he's the biggest bad ass? The recruitment / initiation program was a joke. It wasn't a training program of any kind, it was basically ""lets throw these kids in a no win situation and see how the fend and who comes out on top."" I get the idea was they were trying to weed through all the recruits to get the best one, but the whole while I kept thinking ""So this kid is just a natural born bad ass because he did gymnastics and has daddy issues?"" Then once he's out and starts real life spy work he's untouchable and better than all the worlds master assassins. It's like her Mom's bf who bullies him early in the movie, who he confronts in the end, and I'm thinking ""So other than being this super spy what has he done to actually improve his skills as a fighter?""<br/><br/>Overall I thought the action was decent, but very over the edge of what you'd consider to be believable ""movie believability I mean."" The black comedy was pretty flat and did very little in making me laugh or enjoy myself. Finally the believability of this kid taking over for his dad and his quasi predecessor was just absurd. I give it a 3 / 10. One point on principle and because I liked the main spy girl, a 2nd point because some of the action was decent, and a 3rd point for the best part of the movie which was the bare ass scene at the end, which shocked me enough to yell out ""HELLO!"""

","I had the privilege of seeing this at an advanced screening and I was already looking forward to seeing this film and it exceeded all my expectations.

If you love fast-paced, stylish, humorous, and all around awesome flicks, then this is a definite must see! The action was amazing and I really loved watching Colin Firth kick some ass! Samuel L. Jackson was very fun to watch as a villain as well. I don't think I've had that much fun watching a film in a really long time. The way the creators put a different spin on the superhero genre in Kick-Ass, was very much how they put a spin on the Spy movie genre in Kingsman: The Secret Service.

","I was lucky enough to go to an advanced screening of Kingsman: The Secret Service. Watching the trailer a month ago made me interested to watch this movie since I'm a fan of spy movies especially the 007 movies. The movie is about a young teenager from London called ""Eggsy"" who is chosen by a professional agent from a super secret organisation who call themselves the ""Kingsmen"" to go through the deadliest ""job interview"" to be the next Kingsman spy.<br/><br/>That said I must say I was not disappointed. The action is fast-paced and there's a lot of comedy.The movie is sort of like 007 meets Men in Black. The movie obviously parodies the old traditional 007 formula especially of the Roger Moore era but this is done in a good way. Kingsman; The Secret Service reminded me how great the old 007 formula was until it was changed until Daniel Craig's portrayal of the agent. After watching this movie Daniel Craig better take notes because there is a new agent on the block and that is ""Eggsy'.<br/><br/>That being said Kingsman: The Secret Service is the best movie of 2015 so far. Don't miss it!!!"
"mdreser44","3","119","215","17 February 2015"," Not all that great!

Very crass and off-putting. Vaughn and Goldman seem to have social issues with sick humor. <br/><br/>The storyline is fun, clever, whimsical, unexpected, and very 'James Bond' as intended. It was a delightful--except for the ""comic touches"" that ruin it and are distasteful. The actors were very appealing -- and elegant. It was not Oscar/BAFTA-worthy, but was fun. Except for the parts that kick you in the gut. And if my review makes you feel like a yo-yo going upper, downer, upper, downer...that is the way the movie feels."

Yes, you read that right. Not only are the physics involved in this ludicrous action simply impossible, there is NO blood--nothing. Just an insipidly-dumb, ill-conceived effect designed to make sadistic killing ""funny"" and elicit a cheap ""ooh!"" from the audience. <br/><br/>But wait--there's more. In another disturbing scene, a church full of ""Westboro Baptist""-style fundamentalist bigots beat, claw, and slash each other to death to the musical accompaniment of the ""Free Bird"" ending guitar solo. I guess mass murder is cool and fun if it's scored to some popular music and if the victims are just ignorant bigots; hey, no foul, no crime. Are we supposed to cheer this? There are other nauseating violent scenarios, all shot in the latest hi-tech digital slow-motion, freeze-frame camera work that makes rednecks and ""real men"" squeal in ecstasy.

"brandonjdick","1","214","410","17 February 2015"," Terribly Misleading Trailer
","Hard to sit through, and terribly misleading. It's a shame that such content can be shown in our theaters, commemorating death, advocating women as sex symbols or damsels in distress, and portraying mass murder as a 'cool action scene'. The first third of the movie has great action scenes that one would expect from a spy film. Easy to compare to the Bond films, however, as the movie progressed, the entire validity of the characters' morals were flushed down the drain. I and my two other adult friends had to cover our eyes and grimace at many scenes and we left all agreeing that we did not sign up for that sort of film. The trailer did an awesome job at capturing my excitement, then the movie did an equally great job of shattering that excitement. I stress, please watch at your own discretion."

","I can't understand how so many people loved this movie. I was really looking forward to a funny, over the top action film, but Kingsman left a lot to be desired. For starters the women in this movie are all portrayed as being completely helpless. (Eggsy's useless mother, his friend in the Kingsman who can't seem to get anything done without reassurance from Eggsy and obviously the very dignified princess who happily offers Eggsy anal in exchange for him saving the world...fml). I was actually freaked out by the number of teenagers who thought the multiple scenes of mass murder of innocent people for absolutely no reason were hilarious. Of course the fact that those people's heads exploded into colorful fireworks probably helped. Lastly, what's a comedy without a little vomit humor and mocking individuals with speech impediments. I lost a lot of respect for Colin Firth for this one."

They are using young people to tell a story that has no moral and is totally unrealistic. It seems like a celebration of violence, with countless bloody scenes that make you sick. They are not offering any interesting points of view but telling a cheap story through violence, sexism and clichés, including a blond princess. I don't see why anyone would want to watch this film and I don't recommend it to anyone. I also feel pretty bad about the cast who have supported such a bad film, even worst on them. They should have never accepted this film."

","It's outrageously stupid. I have read all of the bad reviews currently posted for the Kingsman, and none of them hit the right mark. The movie is violent, raunchy, campy, sexist, racist, and vulgar. And that's all OK! But does it have to be so incredibly stupid? Honestly, does it? And why is the CGI so incredibly terrible. Last time I checked this is 2015, not 1985. I usually don't care too much for special effects, but there is a given level of competence which I expect a film to achieve, before it just becomes distracting. Kingsman has CGI on the level of a cheep SyFy channel special feature.<br/><br/>The acting on the part of the star, Taron Egerton, is terrible. Every time he is on the screen it makes you want to punch him in the face, especially every time he opens his mouth. Same is true about Samuel L. Jackson, who played Valentine. That entire performance felt like Samuel L. Jackson asked him self, ""self, how would SNL pay this part, if they were trying to make fun of me?"" Then he used his fertile imaginations, imagined it, and played it exactly like that. It's Samuel L. Jackson acting out a caricature of Samuel L. Jackson playing the role of Valentine. I think the man seriously is just screwing with us at this point.<br/><br/>Truly a terrible movie, not unlike the The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, only with UK hoodlum playing the main role."

"leegato","10","20","32","27 January 2016"," Best Action Film I've Seen Yet
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is such a silly film, but it embraces that and, out of that, creates one of the most fun and entertaining action films yet.<br/><br/>Part of the reason why I'm giving this film 10 stars is that it contains perhaps the greatest action sequence I've ever seen in any film. I'm still absolutely stunned by how the scene was executed, and I saw the film more than three months ago; I assure anyone that the action sequences are unlike anything they've ever seen before. The careful camera-work, the choreography, the high-octane music, EVERYTHING fits so well to create the ultimate violent action sequence. I mustn't spoil it.<br/><br/>The other reasons I enjoyed the film follows: Colin Firth takes on the role as Harry Hart, a member of an international spy organization dedicated to protecting peace in the world. Firth takes on the role with enough seriousness and heart (Hart) to make the film engaging and fun. He steals every scene he is in, and his action sequences are the best ones in the film, but I'll get to that later.<br/><br/>Newcomer Taron Egerton plays the new recruit Eggsy, a rebel with a lot of heart and dedication to his family and friends. Egerton makes him instantly likable as the lead and spawns the right emotions to help the audience almost instantly know his feelings and the tone of the film.<br/><br/>The story overall is a typical formulaic spy plot, though Vaughn adds some more contemporary and ideological elements and twists (that have taken popularity with superhero films lately) into it to make the film more different and exciting from the stereotype James Bond films.<br/><br/>Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a roller coaster of a film, that seems to pick up and slow down at the perfect moments. The story is fun and dynamic, and the action is impeccable."

But because of the main actor, I thought this would be some British comedy. I was not prepared for this hilarious, crazy action film. It's really, really funny, and it's very violent. I don't know whether many women are going to like it (I do, but I prefer South Park over Sex and the City and I usually hate chick flicks). It is a comedy but not what you'd expect.

If you like spy movies and if you're not offended by gory violence and very dirty language, go watch this film. The last 30 minutes or so are like the craziest I've ever seen in an action film and I have seen a lot of action films, believe me.

","I really really wanted to like this movie. And, while it does have a few positive points, on the whole it was stunningly underwhelming. Don't waste your money on this stinkeroo.<br/><br/>Parents note: This is NOT the movie you want to take your children to see. It is one of the most graphically violent movies I can ever remember seeing. ""Comic decapitations"" are still decapitations. There is also a scene where a mother tries to murder her innocent toddler with a large ax. One of the characters is literally cut in half from top to bottom, and then shown in graphic detail awkwardly stapled back together. <br/><br/>A large part of these problems can be directly related to inept direction. Director Matthew Vaughn has no ability to reign in the more ""Hammish"" actors. Samuel L. Jackson pulls out all the stops - and basically ruins every scene he is in. Jackson's performance has to be the worst of his long career. It may well be one of the worst performances of the decade. His character was just stupid and incredibly offensive to so many people on so many different levels. He chose to speak with a cartoonish lisp which might suggest he is effeminate, or perhaps that he has a speech impediment - motivation is not an issue here - don't look for logic or rationality anywhere in this awkward movie.<br/><br/>Fans of Colin Firth, Jack Davenport, Mark Hamill, and Michael Caine will be very very disturbed by how these characters are treated.<br/><br/>On a positive note, Taron Egerton is a delight.

But the violence overwhelms everything else. There's plenty of gratuitous killing, and it's not the least bit subtle. If that's your cup of tea, prepare to have a great time.

It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.<br/><br/>The action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.<br/><br/>There really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act. <br/><br/>Kingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments.

","You cannot convince me they are not paying people to give this terrible film high ratings on the internet. People gave it 10s??? It is unwatchable. I don't worry about foul language for the most part, but a lot of eff-words in a movie clearly targeted at 10-12 year-old boys is a bit much. It was just plain retarded from the get-go and the performances from the actors was not even remotely up to snuff. And I love Michael Caine, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth - I figured, ""How can you go wrong?"" I truly can't figure out who the audience is for this. Garbage. Total waste of $11 bucks. Wouldn't have even watched it free on the internet."
"Bueller67","1","31","57","11 June 2015"," Found this to be really awful
","Sorry, will receive lots of grief for this no doubt. As a huge Bond fan, I loved the concept of the movie. Colin Firth fantastic in this role, Michael Caine great as usual, loved Mark Strong's character but was really turned off by so much of this movie.<br/><br/>The actor playing the kid I found to have no real charm in his role or acting ability, forgettable performance to me. I wish him the best but not sure he is really going anywhere.<br/><br/>I found the scene of the agents being told to shoot their dog to be creepy. Yes I know it's a fantasy story but is was disturbing. Not to mention shooting a blank at close range would severely injure or kill the dog anyway which made the scene even more stupid to me.<br/><br/>The scene where Galahad shoots, stabs and slaughters 79 people in the church was just over the top hyper violence and regardless that the church goers were supposed to be Westboro type fanatics, everyday people including women being relentlessly shot in the head for several minutes straight was a turn off. I have no problem for movie violence even when it's campy. In fact I like it when it's needed for the story. But this was in awful taste. <br/><br/>I thought it was stupid that Galahad, the most interesting character in the movie is suddenly and unexpectedly shot in the head and killed. After that I knew the rest of the movie relied on the kid agent to carry the story. What started as mediocre took a real dive for me after that. I have little interest in a sequel without Colin Firth as Galahad. <br/><br/>The scene where the mother's chip activates and she begins hacking the bathroom door apart in order to slaughter her two year old daughter sitting in a stroller to be disturbing, not funny or clever at all. When Jack Nicholson hacks a door apart with an axe, it made sense given the quality build up of character beforehand. This was poorly thought out implied violence on a child and that scene could easily have been left out with no impact on the rest of the movie. Leave that type of scene to cheesy low budget horror movies. <br/><br/>The scene where hundreds of people's heads explode like fireworks to glorious symphonic soundtrack was not funny. Just stupid, gory and overly violent. And this coming from someone that enjoys movie violence as much as the next person when the story behind it has quality.<br/><br/>I'm more than exhausted of Samuel L. Jackson taking any script handed to him and essentially being the same persona in every role he takes except this time we get to hear him use his typical profanity with a lisp. Personally I was annoyed every time he appeared on screen. <br/><br/>The meaningless short bit about the Swedish princess in the cell offering buttsex in exchange for saving the world was really weird and trashy. Did a 14 year old boy write that part of the script? Because that's the kind of humor that was. And then the quick pan down shot of her rear end as she greets him in the cell patiently presenting her back field waiting to be plowed, seems to me it revealed a little more on camera than her butt cheeks. Was not expecting to actually catch a glimpse of was about to be pleasurably assaulted by the hero of the movie. <br/><br/>This movie's R rating is well justified over what I thought was unnecessary gratuitous hyper violence and blatant sexual content that seemed designed only to cheaply shock the viewer and not really enhance the story. What was an interesting story I thought became really stupid and poorly executed to me. Some movies produce low performance and popularity even when they are very good movies. Often times because they are not dumbed down enough for average viewers being expected to think about the story. This movie however in my opinion deserved it's lack luster box office numbers."

","This film glorifies sodomy. It mentions ""global warming"" as if it's a real thing. It implies strongly that Margaret Thatcher was not a positive political figure. It portrays Christians as lunatics worthy of slaughter. The foul language is so gratuitous that one has to wonder if the filmmakers think it's clever or what point it is they're trying to make by taking that road. There are no heroes or any sort of virtuous characters to latch onto. The plot is full of holes. I could go on, but suffice it to say that this is low-grade filmmaking and a waste of everyone's time.

I guess I was expecting something of a hero movie and this was a joke. It seemed very childish with adult scenes. The graphics were cool but not in any way real. The wardrobe was great as well.

In a way this movie places Valentine's device right in the theater. And shows us our true reactions to horror. Dished up in the right atmosphere, totally acceptable! I wonder how we would react (because we are aware of the moral wrongness) if this music was played, and well choreographed, in a Nazi concentration camp.

It's like a cheap Kill Bill mixed with Ali G InDaHouse.Have I seen over the top violence before? Yes. Have I heard the same jokes before? Yes. This film brought absolutely nothing new to the table.<br/><br/>The volume of action was great but it was executed very poorly. It was a CGI fest throughout and it was unconvincing at best. The acting was subpar. SLJ was an embarrassment. It was the type of performance you would see in a not so serious commercial. Taron played the typical chav role pretty well. He looked the part at least.<br/><br/>The whole thing was just too cheesy for me and very predictable. There were too many scenes where I actually found myself cringing. I recently watched John Wick and in comparison is light years beyond this film in regards to action. This film is for school kids that enjoy sniggering to a sexual reference, rubbish acting and all out action. <br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone because I'd be robbing them of their time. How this film is rated so high is totally beyond me. Worst film I've watched this year hands down."

Some scenes, as in the church, are just disgusting, and from that point the interest level wanes. The scenes in the mountain lair are INCEPTION meets ON HER MAJESTYS SECRET SERVICE with absurd and endless killing which ultimately made me feel ill. 30 minutes too long and from a clown copycat director, this film is great initially, for 60 minutes and then irritating and vile for 70 minutes. Yes the damn thing runs 130 minutes. I really did feel sick and exhausted when it finished. I thought it all a shocking waste of production money time and the studio's trust.

What a disaster. Witty banter replaced with canned-catchphrases. Charm replaced with scatological nonsense.

This movie hits ""bad"" on so many levels such as: the lame plot, bad acting, terrible special effects and mind numbing dialog.

"Joejoesan","8","32","62","11 January 2015"," Kick-Ass meets Men in Black and 60s Avengers
","With movies like X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass, Stardust and Layer Cake writer/director/producer Matthew Vaughn established himself as one of the most exciting movie makers around. Having turned down the offer to direct X-Men Days of Future Past we were very interested in what he was working on instead. Luckily Kingsman: The Secret Service - again based on a comic - doesn't disappoint. Afterwards we can be glad that he put all his efforts in this incredibly funny but also comic-book violent spy flick. With Bryan Singer again involved as director, the X-Men movie also turned out very fine anyway.<br/><br/>The film is about Kingsman, an unknown but powerful British Secret Service. When one of his spies dies, all six remaining agents are asked to come up with a candidate that can replace him. After a dangerous selection only one will remain. Kingsman Harry Hart (Colin Firth) nominates Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton who's also being eyed for the role of Cyclops in X-Men Apocalypse). Eggsy is a small criminal who doesn't know he is the son of a killed Kingsman agent. In the meantime the organization investigates the dubious plans of billionaire and philanthropist Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), who says he wants to save our planet but doesn't tell the world at what costs he will do that.<br/><br/>Three movies pop in mind when you see Kingsman. First of all: Kick- Ass. It has the same humor, violence and over the top characters. Valentine's bodyguard for instance is a girl with no legs but with killing blades. Her action scenes are quite spectacular. Samuel L. Jackson is a crazy disturbed villain. His madness suits the finale of the movie very well. <br/><br/>Secondly: Men in Black. Young Eggsy must participate in a very nasty selection process in order to be the chosen Kingsman. The missions they must do are very dangerous. In the first one a candidate even dies (or it seems that way). <br/><br/>The third ( and major) title Kingsman resembles is The Avengers. No, I'm not talking about the Marvel one. In the late sixties there was this British TV-series starring the ultimate gentleman John Steed (Patrick Macnee) and the first powergirl ever, Emma Peel (played by the legendary Diana Rigg from On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Game of Thrones fame). These two spies used a lot of (hidden) gadgets to solve crime. But whatever happened, like Colin Firth in Kingsman, John Steed always remained polite and stiff. The Avengers TV-series even got a very bad movie version in 1998 starring Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sean Connery. <br/><br/>Kingsman starts of as an entertaining action movie with lots of violence and humor. Entertaining, but not exceptional. Turns out director Vaughn saved the best for last. In the incredible finale the movie really delivers. Absolute highlight is the way the baddies get defeated by the two remaining Kingsman. That scene is so over the top, I think only Matthew Vaughn could have pulled that of.<br/><br/>Yes, Kingsman is great stuff and I can't wait to see it again. Especially actor Colin Firth deserves lots of praise. He not only gives us a very likable and funny performance, but his action scenes are also very convincing and must have cost him months of training. The shots in which he does the fighting are also very long with very few cut aways. We hope he didn't have to do that many takes. Newcomer Taron Egerton as Eggsy is also impressive. He's not only believable as a low life street thug, but as a James Bond-like spy as well. No doubt Kingsman will launch his career.<br/><br/>In one of the first scenes of the movie we see actor Mark Hamill in the role of professor James Arnold. And that's a nice surprise given the fact that it's 2015 now, the year of Star Wars The Force Awakens and his great movie comeback. It at least gives us a hint of how he will look as the elderly Jedi Luke Skywalker. <br/><br/>Kingsman: go see it!"

The music is just noise. Filthy language in every sentence. It left an impression that the people in this movie don't know any language to express their needs or emotions. Absence of sense of class, taste or style. The first 5 min was intriguing but the following was boring. Frustrated, my children decided to nap but the typhoon of the torturing noise didn't allow them to relax. When the film finally was over people left the room speechless and with relief.

Some viewer have been offended by the bloody scene inside the church, but I found it more fun just because irreverent, bloody funny and completely unexpected. It's a bit like what could be a Tarantino's secret agent film. <br/><br/>Of course it is exaggerated in every aspect, a caricature, a cartoon. Of course it is an overly violent film, but, if you take it for what it is - an ADULT comic - and you understand this movie want to be deliberately contemptuous and unconventional, you cannot say it is not perfectly crafted. <br/><br/>In spite of all the usual spy agent hero movies, its strong point is that it's outside the box and for this reason unexpected, surprising and entertaining.<br/><br/>A flawless in its (new) kind, a modern bloody and funny 007 style movie.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This film was so cool! It's not just a hilarious parody of the spy genre, James Bond in particular, but it's one of the consistently entertaining and thrilling films I've seen in years. With an absolutely enthralling story, that goes beyond just taking the mick out of spy movie clichés, brilliant performances, epic special effects, massively exciting action and absolutely stunning direction, this is a film that lets you be entertained to the max.<br/><br/>I'll start with what I thought was the most amazing part of this whole movie: the action. As we've seen in Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class, director Matthew Vaughn knows how to make a properly exciting action sequence, but I've never seen him do it to the extent seen here.<br/><br/>Some of the battles in this film go on for up to 5-10 minutes, and whilst I expected that seeing all that violence for so long would be tiring and boring, I was absolutely exhilarated by absolutely every action sequence here, thanks to Vaughn's stunning direction, using the shaky cam to add to the grittiness but still making it clear as day as to what's happening, as well as some fantastic songs to accompany all the action kicking off.<br/><br/>But it's not just the action that makes this film so good, the story is absolutely spellbinding too. You'd expect it just to be a send-up of Bond films, and while it does do that a lot (particularly towards the end of the story), there's so much more to be had from the plot here. The first half has very little to do with being a parody, and is on its own an interesting and of course hugely entertaining plot, introducing the wide variety of characters in a unique way and grabbing your attention right from the off.<br/><br/>Of course, the whole movie is a comedy as well as an action-packed thrill-ride, and it doesn't disappoint on that front either. Whether it's something hugely sadistic, satirical, clever or just plain stupid, there's a high chance you'll be wetting yourself laughing at what's going on in this film, and although it doesn't impede the story from being as exciting as it is, there's so much laughing to be done for the whole two hours.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the characters and actors are all fantastic. Colin Firth is stunning as the veteran Kingsman agent, whilst Taron Egerton is a hell of a lot of fun as the young protégé. Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson does a great job as the insane Bond villain, helped by a scary but still entertaining performance by Sofia Boutella as the Oddjob-ish evil sidekick.<br/><br/>Overall, there's no escaping the fact that is one of the most entertaining and exhilarating films you'll see all year, filled with stunning action, direction, performances, plot and comedy, and that's why it gets a 9.2 out of 10 from me.<br/><br/>www.themadmovieman.com"

","It's overall a very entertaining movie; especially the way it married traditional gentleman spy service to the rebellious young generation. It was fascinating to see how the young recruits were made up to scratch and the training was inspiring with the qualities it emphasized. I love the way the characters took their names after the Knights of the Round Table. What was both exciting and slightly intimidating was the Blade Girl - I am not averse to bloodshed but every time she made her appearance there was usually more than the usual amount of blood. The director must have been paying tribute to Tarantino with his almost cult-like killing and explosion shots. Except for the parts when he killed off one of my favorite characters and when he (in my opinion) slightly overdid the killing spree, I enjoyed every other moment of this movie. Recommended."

","I can not understand why anyone would enjoy this movie. I actually got up and walked out halfway through. There was so much gratuitous violence that I couldn't stand it. Splattering blood everywhere. In order to explain myself there will be a few spoilers here but I will try and keep them to a minimum. So if you want to be 'surprised' don't read any further. But I wouldn't be surprised if I were you. We were and I am still angry about it. I will say that several of the cast members were very good. The premise of the movie is juvenile. 5 minutes into the movie someone got split in half. This 'gimmick"" was repeated later in the movie. Samuel Jackson plays a black billionaire who dresses like Flava Flav and serves McDonald's to who he thinks is a billionaire donor. Seriously? Then there was the whole shoot the dog bit. Really, how original. But when everyone started killing each other in the church I was done. If you are a thirteen year old boy with anger issues this movie is right up your alley. I went on line to read what happens at end of the movie and was glad I made the decision to leave the movie. How many times to you blow up a person's head and call it entertainment? It really bothers me that some people find this entertaining. This was one step above a snuff film masquerading as a parody/homage to James Bond. Also am I the only one who got the subliminal message with the Obama look alike who gets killed? Seriously? There are not enough words to describe how bad this movie is. if you enjoy blood and people getting killed rather graphically ad nausea then you will enjoy this movie. If you want to see anything remotely resembling a decent movie you will not."

","SPOILER ALERT and WARNING They were lobbing f-bombs at you on par with the quantity in the Die Hard movies. They used the 'bait and switch' method of advertising in their trailer. The trailer would have you believe Colin Firth saved a kid from the streets as in Obi Wan and Luke Skywalker, Agent Kay and Agent Jay, Enders Game, etc. You see that trailer and that is what you are expecting. Then you get in there and a lot more cursing is going on than you expected. Then the last scene in the movie is graphic anal sex. Is this the best you can do after 100 years of cinematography? Crude for the sake of it. The man sitting next to me got up and left shortly before the end of the movie. I thought surely it can't be that much longer, he couldn't wait to go to the rest room. He never came back. I guess he'd been warned about the last scene being so vulgar. I wish I'd read the reviews before I went so I would have left when he did, or not gone at all. I'm so tired of CGI. Newsflash movie makers real people can't fly sideways for 20 feet. I will be finding out who made this movie, and I will be making sure not to try anything else of theirs until it is so old it has been reviewed to within an inch of its life, so I'll know of any vulgarities so I can decide for myself and not have it sprung on me with no warning."

It consists of a stupid, lazy, non-credible script combined with stupid, amateur, unconvincing acting and stupid, gratuitous, repetitive violence. To add insult to injury, in the last few scenes ,it objectifies women in such a tasteless and immoral way that it made me quite angry and really shouldn't have been allowed to be in the movie.<br/><br/>There is NO way that the reviews for this movie are genuine, NO WAY! This film deserves -10 out of 10, it's soooo awful. I expected it to be bad going in as I had done some research, but my husband had wanted to see it so I said I would go. I expected the stereotypes and over- the-top violence, and I got that. But I also expected a plot, some laughs and decent action, but that was TOTALLY absent. Such a rubbish movie. <br/><br/>With a title like 'Kingsman' you would expect a bit of class, but instead it deliberately stayed in the gutter and everyone in it was tainted by its awful stench. The writers, director, producer and actors should be ashamed to be associated with such garbage. I was certainly ashamed of myself for ever having seen it. Absolute crud. Yuk! Don't go."

If offered a choice between watching Kingsman and bathing in sulphuric acid I would urge you to choose the acid bath - it will be a far less painful experience. How on earth did top drawer actors like Michael Caine, Colin Firth and Samuel L Jackson get dragged into it? We're they drugged or blackmailed ? Those are the only explanations I can think of. The film just doesn't know what it wants to be - should it be a serious, edgy thriller? Should it be a rollicking adventure like Men in Black (which incidentally it shamelessly steals from)? Should it be a modern take on the bond theme. In the end it just turns out to be a steaming pile of ordure - note to the film's director and/or editor - if your movie is in trouble and you're not quite sure which direction to go with it don't, repeat don't, just fill it with expletives and exploding heads in the hope that you make it 'edgy'.

Although a very common plot, this movie was made so that is was very unique despite a cliché plot. The longer I was watching the movie, I kept on realizing how much I loved the movie. It was filled with unique action, an unforeseen plot, and a great quirkiness that enhances the film so much. Along with all of these features, the movie was filled with a class A cast. It was a very well needed/well-rounded movie."
"mark-4522","10","13","23","20 February 2015"," Almost like a (good) Tarentino take on the Bond series
","This reminds me of what Tarentino would have done with the Bond series similar to what he did with 70's era Kung Fu movies and action flicks but there's a twist: There are many who say that the theme to Kingsman is conservative. It's like Falling Down for James Bond. It's a similar experience to what I had with the Breaking Bad series which is leftist in feel and scope. In Breaking Bad, the implausible scenario is that a schoolteacher and DEA agent ultimately take drug money to help with their medical care because the government has lousy healthcare benefits. That's like saying Obama has to take the bus because the government doesn't provide him any transportation. It's laughable. But despite that leftist premise, I could enjoy that series.<br/><br/>By the same token, I get the sense that the audience in the DC region theater were mostly leftist but enjoyed the film despite the tone of the film being one of the most conservative or right wing than I've seen in years. <br/><br/>A savvy viewer will find a number of inconsistencies and plot holes but that goes for the Bond films as well. What ""secret spy"" is quick to tell everyone he's a secret spy and sleep around and draw attention to himself? These plot holes are meant to be savored. Working class folks and the upper crust are both portrayed as yobs with a modern twist: NOBODY smokes. Ever. It's refreshing. Remember in the Bond films how everyone puffed away continuously? I hope this becomes a trend that is repeated in later sequels (which there will surely be.) <br/><br/>The film appears to have recruited every potential spy and cameo imaginable. Mark Hamill, Michael Caine, Samuel Jackson, Colin Firth among others both pay homage to the Bond style thriller while introducing new elements (Jackson's particular performance is hilarious.) <br/><br/>Watching in the theater was surprisingly enjoyable because, not in spite of, the other audience members that made obvious comments during some action sequences but were stunningly silent in others. I could feel their shock and relished it. Vaughn takes violence that had been reduced to pornography in modern Hollywood and gives it a new artistic twist while also knowing when to tone things back a little and introduce suspense."
"MUFCOK","8","12","21","11 February 2016"," Kingsman is just what you would hope for from a modern, British, secret agent flick.
","It's got a solid story with strong acting and a great cast. It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation. <br/><br/>First off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don't feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn't over the top and you never feel like it has gone 'too far' but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It's violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!<br/><br/>Kingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It's hard to explain until you watch it, but it's got a certain spin on it, it's quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch. It's definitely worth your time!<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>P.S. The outrage that seems to have swept the internet over the very last scene (so much so, that some versions of this movie have the scene removed) is nothing short of ridiculous. It's political correctness gone mad."

I cannot, in 5000 words or less, convey to you how amazing it is and how many different aspect points from the spectrum of the genre it incorporates -- entirely to the benefit of the viewer. If you've seen the viral snippet with Colin Firth in the church, I can tell you that the entire scene is THE ultimate perfection in cinematic history. It is funny, violent, irreverent, violent in a Tarantino sort of way, punny, action wrought with gratuitous violence, oh so wrong, perfectly scripted, amazingly executed (save, I don't know why the lisp), and absolutely NOT what you would expect from a British film of this genre. It's not that kind of movie. I mean it has an unexpected Colin Firth, Commodore Norrington, Mark Hamill, Michael Caine, an unexpected Samuel L. Jackson, and the Princess of Sweden.

"CANpatbuck3664","10","11","19","29 January 2016"," Turns The Spy Movie Genre On Its Head, In My 2015 Top 5
","I would love to say that I knew ahead of time that this movie would be so special. But I didn't, I thought the marketing looked good but it did seem like the average action/spy movie story line rebooted. My best friend who seems to have a sixth sense about knowing if a movie will be great insisted on going to see this. I was so taken aback with it I went and saw it the next night with another group of friends, that's how much I liked it. I'm so glad it turned out to be the massive hit it was and I'm excited to talk about it.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* In what is presumably the late 1990s, a compound in the Middle East is raided and several masked men are interrogating a suspect. The interrogation goes south when the hostage detonates an explosive device. But most of the interrogators are saved when a brave solo soldier shields the rest using his body to muffle the blast. Quickly we are introduced to 3 Kingsman agents: Harry Hart ""Galahad"" (Colin Firth), Merlin (Mark Strong), and Lancelot (Jack Davenport). Harry admits that it was his fault and he just missed that there was an explosive device. He travels back to England and tells the agent's widow Michelle Unwin (Samantha Womack) about his demise. She is understandably distraught and while they can't celebrate his heroics Harry promises her a favour, one that has no limitations and that if she calls a specific number, whatever she needs will be done. We also meet young Eggsy (he's just a boy here, the older version of Eggsy is Taron Edgerton) who Harry tells to look after his mother.<br/><br/>I could go into the plot further but I don't want to spoil the surprise. I'll go into what makes this movie unique next to so many other spy movies. Kingsman: The Secret Service is a rare breed of movie where it functions well within the genre (spy movies) by itself but it also pokes fun at the spy movie clichés. It could also be considered a comedy/parody. Kick-Ass (a previous Matthew Vaughn effort which I didn't like as much) is another such film from director Matthew Vaughn and seems to be a hallmark for him. It blends the old spy movie magic (outlandish gadgets, over-the-top villain, gentleman spy) with something new and it does so beautifully. It's so much fun and as the movie says, spy movies have gotten a little serious lately and it was refreshing to see a movie that wasn't afraid to tell some jokes while delivering on the action and the plot.<br/><br/>Speaking of the action, this movie has some of the best filmed action I've ever seen. If you have seen the movie, regardless of how you feel morality wise about the church scene, it's astounding how its shot and how horrifyingly violent it is. It really kicked the movie into overdrive for me. Every action scene in this movie is unique and beautifully filmed, stylistically it's as much as you could have asked for.<br/><br/>Talking about the acting next, Kingsman features some really outstanding performances. I can't believe Colin Firth is so good in this movie. He's always been a good actor but I never would have thought he had this in him. He's suave, funny and actually believable as an action hero. Taron Edgerton does a hell of a job considering he was an unknown before this. This is a breakout performance, I'm sure it will lead to many other starring roles. Samuel L. Jackson is awesome as the villain, he has the right amount of theatricality yet he's really funny too. I'm a big Samuel fan already but his character and his performance were different from what you would expect and they add memorable aspect to this film. In smaller roles, Mark Hamill, Michael Caine and Sofia Boutella all shine and round out an excellent cast.<br/><br/>Some people have found this movie to be offensive, I can see that but it more depends on what you want to get out of this movie. I think one of the reasons this movie is so popular is that it really isn't afraid to go there. There's so many violent kills, so much joking at the expense of the typical spy plot and there are some pretty filthy jokes (yes there is a taboo sexual joke at the end, I thought it was funny, I guess a lot of people didn't). Not every action feature has to be this unrelenting but I found it to be refreshing and I think judging by the amount of love this movie has gotten from the public, most people agree.<br/><br/>I saw Kingsman: The Secret Service twice in theatres, I bought the Blu Ray and I've watched it many times since. This is a truly great spy movie which finds the right mix of action and comedy and the balance between the familiar and the new. It commits to the story yet is still outstanding to watch because of some bold stylistic choices. I'm stoked for the sequel and it can't get here soon enough."

The few chuckles provided in the script are completely lost in a sea of bloody, hyper violence. It's also at least 40 minutes too long with at least two overlong subplots that added nothing to the story or the film experience. Mean spirited in the extreme. Total crap. If watching mothers try to kill their babies with big knives turns you on, you might like this one. Sad to see stars like Colin Firth and Samuel L Jackson wasted in such a stinker, although I'm sure they're cashing big checks. This is clearly aimed at boys in the 16 to 20 year old age bracket.

Jackson's aside to the camera says it all, ""It isn't that kind of movie."" Truly my I can say my head nearly exploded over the preceding scene, and stopped only because I realized it was indeed a comic book shooter.

","Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014): Dir: Matthew Vaughn / Cast: Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Taron Egerton, Sophie Cookson, Mark Strong: Matthew Vaughn's lighter followup to Kick-Ass. This one is less graphic yet similar in style and violence. It regards legacy and stars Colin Firth as agent Harry Hart who loses a fellow agent in the film's opening rescue attempt. Guilt ridden, Hart delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow and infant son. This kid grows up and ends up being recruited as a possible agent through an encounter with Hart. He and several other youths are trained and it comes down to two recruits. Central plot regards an Internet millionaire who implants a SIM card in various individuals that results in outburst of violence. One scene, which occurs inside a hate group church is amongst the best footage Vaughn has ever shot, in its slow motion chaos and theme music. Vaughn's other worthy credits include X-Men: First Class and Stardust. Firth plays it straight as Hart whose appearance in the thick glasses, suit and umbrella denies his true abilities. Samuel L. Jackson dressed in an orange jump suit and cap on backwards steals scenes as this profane outrageous villain with a female sidekick whose legs are blades. Taron Egerton plays the young lead whose struggles merge with surprise when he must take centre stage when chaos threatens. Sophie Cookson as agent Roxy is fetching but underwritten. Mark Strong is featured from Kick-Ass but doesn't elevate beyond the standard role. Theme is identity and taking the secret agent clichés to a harrowing climax that does this inventive visual comedy tremendous service. Score: 8 ½ / 10"

","This film deserves to call itself an action-comedy because the action in this action- comedy is awe-inspiring. It seems as if every other scene has some sort of dismemberment in it. Visually, Kingsman is stunning, especially in these action sequences. There is no limit to the blood that director Matthew Vaughn can bring to your face, with fingers being blown off at some points and large wooden spikes being shoved up a racist, homophobic reverend at others. Paired with this like fine wine, the soundtrack to these sequences feel like a coked up serial killers Thursday playlist, that is not a bad thing.<br/><br/>Colin Firth wasn't exactly ""born"" to play Harry Hart, as it contrasts with virtually every other role he has played. It could seem as if Firth isn't really cut out to be an action star, and if you think that, Colin Firth will probably come to your house and kill you stylishly with your own household objects, probably involving some sort of laceration or dismemberment, because you would be wrong. As well as mastering the tried and true sophisticated act he's known for, Firth also brings an aura of sophistication when he burning people's faces and smashing glasses also into faces. Let's just say, if you are a bad guy in Kingsman, your face is not safe from something Colin Firth will dish out, take that in the most innocent way you can, please.<br/><br/>Moreover, Taron Egerton also stands out as Eggsy. Where Firth brings the action, Egerton brings the comedy with his dumbfounded new view of all of the action that is suddenly happening around him. He remains true to his character throughout and has cheeky quips for every situation. Joining him in bringing the comedy, Samuel L. Jackson plays Richmond Valentine, the eccentric villain with a dastardly plan that I'm still not going to tell you about because I JUST cannot be assed, y'know? Please forgive me.<br/><br/>I think that's it. Time for a summary.<br/><br/>Kingsman is really good. I actually can't think of a bad word to say about it.

I guess that's a refreshing change from the usual.<br/><br/>It was also fun to see SL Jackson play a very different role than usual.

","Summary: Watch it -- if you have the time and money to waste -- for amusement, and perhaps out of sympathy for the movie's investors. But don't let the children watch. A bizarre chapter in the otherwise distinguished careers of Colin Firth, Samuel Jackson, and Michael Caine.<br/><br/>This felt like two movies -- the first 60 minutes or so coming off as a James Bond wannabee film, albeit not gaining much momentum. The balance of the film spins off wildly and embarrassingly to the far left (did another producer or editor take over?) with clear intentions of offending anyone with middle-of-the-road sensibilities.<br/><br/>There's plenty of effrontery to go around: the grotesque mass-murder of Southern church-goers (who are caricaturishly bigoted) by the erstwhile protagonist (Colin Firth); the presumptive pseudo-science that ""humans are the virus on Mother Earth""; a Scandinavian princess, when rescued by our hero, offers anal sex (now how is that politically correct?); and more. The depravity, combined with a weak Saturday matinée ""save the world"" plot line, extinguishes any positive trajectory the film barely achieves in the early minutes. Other cringe-worthy moments include Samuel Jackson's exaggerated and offensive speech impediment, and an amputee antagonist who uses her prosthetic razor-sharp extremities to slice ginsu-like through a cast of extras with stomach-turning graphic effect.<br/><br/>All this may attract and intrigue a certain (and large) percentage of the movie-going public. As for me, I am now all the more anxious for the sophisticated, restrained and elegant story-telling we can expect in the next Daniel Craig - James Bond movie. Thankfully, I don't expect that we will see more than one more installment (i.e. last gasp) of the ""Kingsman"" franchise."

You can root for the spies but at the same time you don't hate the villains, you hate the villains' plan but not them because they are also funny and smart.<br/><br/>The story is a little bit a cliché. It's a formula about a character being trained to be part of something great and then try to stop a villain to prove he deserves to be part of the group. It is predictable in some aspects, but it's actually really good, the pacing and the jokes make it enjoyable. This movie has some twists that make the story even better.<br/><br/>
My conclusion is this movie is an excellent start to a franchise. It's so funny you will laugh in every scene or most of them but at the same time it has absolutely good action scenes. It's bloody funny, give it a try, I'm convinced that you will like it."
"dpg-87522","8","2","2","13 September 2019"," One of the best action films evermade.
","0 minutes ago When I saw Kingsman for the first time I was surprised because I liked it a lot despite the fact that this is an action and spy movie, and let's say that the films of that genre are not very good, surprisingly this is the exception, the movie gives you make it clear with the first scene that this is going to have its own level of realism, which will be built through the film moving forward, to this I mean we see a ""serious"" scene about agents who want to interrogate a terrorist , but you understand that it will not be completely serious because of the way in which the credits are introduced, then they give us a good introduction of characters where you understand who is who, which is good since many films do not take the time to know to his characters, but what I really want to talk about and most surprised me was the villain, apart from the fact that this is played by Samuel L. Jackson, this unlike many villains, if he has personality, not you In no time to spare on the screen, his motives are justifiable, simply if you see it from another point of view his plan was not so malicious, this was to eliminate part of humanity to start again and save us from extinction, what really bad in this was that he chose those who were going to be saved and let's say that's not very fair, but hey, the point is that he's a very good villain, and without a doubt the violence is just great, I mean is creative, I say When we have seen in a movie a scene like that of the church? The film is well executed in the sense that it explains something, but without wasting time, and something that I really like is Egsy is not the typical annoying character who wants to be good if because, or who wants to defeat the villain with all his strength to Although these are not even found, the film also has personal moments for the protagonists, for example we see how the relationship between father and son between Harry and Egsy is strengthened through the progress of the film, something that was very brave on the part of the movie is to have killed Harry at the moment, I say at the moment because we already know that in the two he is alive and blah, blah, blah, the point is that for us we were dead in that movie, it was something that I grab you without you see it coming, because it is not very common that in today's movies they kill one of the protagonists of the way in which this movie did it, which is another success for the film since this serves as inspiration to Eg s and to return to become a Kingsman and want to defeat Valentine, but as good as this movie is, it is not perfect, I say through which the movie progresses the characters have technological objects that are suitable for the plot, or that no matter how much training they put Eggsy in their preparation to become a Kingsman, we never really saw them teach him how to fight, I say that the movie has mistakes but this does not mean that it is all the good it has. In conclusion Kingsman is a creative, funny movie, with good characters, an unusual villain, great action scenes, with one or another mistake, that is why this movie earns its good merely 8/10."

","Casting some of the drama / serious oscar winners, you automatically tend to think that it will be one of those serious super spy action flick. But, it gave a twist I never thought would be possible with the cast. This is by far one of the best comedy spy flicks ever made. Imagine all the serious actor's given a bit of humorous scripting to play with? Although, not sure if it deserved to be in the top 250 imdb best movies list.

"jweaks-1","3","11","20","30 June 2015"," Missed potential, gratuitous crap
","This movie could have been great, but it squanders all it's potential. It relishes low-class ugliness. The film tries so hard to be a clever, deconstructive meta-tale, forever winking at the audience about its silly story, that it metas itself into insignificance. Mr. Vaughn has no interest in, or perhaps understanding of, violence as a cinematic tool. He doesn't use violence; he squanders it. Ultimately, there's little to care about. <br/><br/>Kingsman is like a high-speed collision between a Jaguar and a jaywalking soccer hooligan. It's ridiculously out of balance, and when you're stuck in the middle, it doesn't seem so funny. If you like really bad pulp fiction, this movie is for you. Otherwise steer clear of it."

","You know what I hate in comic book based movies? The fact that they don't have the balls to target it to more adult audience, castrating it from all violence (present in the comics!) and foul language in order to fit them in PG-13 category. That's why Dredd 3d felt so fresh and entertaining and that's why almost all Marvel and DC movies are meh.<br/><br/>Kingsman is the perfect example of comic book movie done right. We have everything here - goofy villains, cool Bond-esk gadgets, interesting secret organization fighting crime, action, humour, plot going in some unexpected directions, violent nicely choreographed fights (or just chaotic, messy ones), light feeling movie which is actually pretty depressing study on human nature...<br/><br/>To sum this short review up I'll bring one thing up - a sign of a great movie is that there are scenes that we will always remember. And there's plenty of that in Kingsman. All scenes including dogs (especially 'shoot the dog' scene), hilarious bar fight, bloodbath in the church, introduction of the villain, 'fancy' dinner at Valentine's apartment, etc) <br/><br/>It's cheesy, it's violent, it's technically flawless and it's just a 100% pure joy to watch :)"
"mattpope384","2","17","34","7 June 2015"," If you doubt that movies today are made for adolescent boys...
","If you doubt that movies today are largely made for adolescent boys (or men who still think like them) then you haven't seen Kingsman: The Secret Service.<br/><br/>And the fact that this film did well at the box office makes me think that the Samuel L. Jackson character, Richmond Valentine, is right about humanity's bleak prospects.<br/><br/>I feel dumber for having seen Kingsman. In particular there is a lecherous- even predatory- interaction at the very end between the lead character ""Eggsy"" and a Scandinavian princess that is a gratuitous contrivance to denigrate and sexualize a relatively strong female character.<br/><br/>The message in this movie is that the world can only be saved by wealthy white men who have avoided the estate tax and that the true evildoers are those who believe in climate change....oh, and Barack Obama's head explodes - all of which kind of torpedoes the notion of liberal Hollywood.<br/><br/>The film has a promising start in the direction of James Bond for the 8-second attention-span world. Initially the action is so silly and over the top and the characters so absurdly two-dimensional that it's hard to take it as more than mindless popcorn fun.<br/><br/>There's also some witty dialog between Colin Firth's Galahad and Sam Jackson's Valentine that menacingly send up traditional spy-movie tropes. A few bracingly cold-hearted twists occur during the new-agents' training that let you know the movie will not be trafficking in many feel-good clichés.<br/><br/>But then Kingsman devolves into an unimaginative morass of dehumanization and schlock and eventually the film becomes little more than a first-person-shooter video game. Literally, there is a scene in the film's climax where the action briefly switches to Eggsy's perspective as he runs down a corridor shooting henchmen that is indistinguishable from a commercial for a combat shooter video game.<br/><br/>Firth and Jackson are likable. Michael Caine is- well Michael Caine being an Englishman. As Eggsy, Taron Egerton is entirely interchangeable with any other young actor and equally as forgettable.<br/><br/>I have often thought that Hollywood serves as a pretty good counter-argument to the notion of free markets naturally producing the highest quality to meet the public's demand. That Kingsman: Secret Service did well at the Box Office and will no doubt spawn bigger, louder, dumber, more violent and retrograde sequels only serves as a depressing reminder that crap sells and sells well."
"bob-the-movie-man","7","17","34","7 February 2015"," A great first half but then the pudding is over-egged
","Matthew Vaughn, who's previous films in the director's chair number just four – ""Layer Cake"", ""Stardust"", ""Kick Ass"" and ""X-Men: First Class"" – does not do subtle. But he certainly does do stylish and entertaining. Of his past works Kingsman resembles most closely Kick Ass with its anarchic tone and comic-book violence. This is not surprising given the film is based, as was Kick-Ass, on a new comic book series by Mark Millar (this time with Dave Gibbons).<br/><br/>Colin Firth plays Harry Hart (aka Galahad) a member of a secret spy network called Kingsman. Firth is quite outstanding playing a gentleman spy: a role he was born for. When one of their own gets terminated on a mission Harry proposes Eggsy (Taron Egerton), the son of an ex-colleague, to go forward to a lethal form of training to become the replacement Kingsman.<br/><br/>While all this is going on, a dastardly plan (that will result in global mayhem) is being plotted by the billionaire Valentine (a completely over-the-top and lisping Samuel L Jackson), ably protected by his female bodyguard (and literally a Blade Runner) Gazelle, played by the strikingly beautiful Algerian actress Sofia Boutella. Will the Kingsmen defeat the dastardly plot in time before the countdown runs out? (You can probably guess, but you'll have fun finding out).<br/><br/>Whereas Bond has Universal Exports, Kingsman's ""cover"" organisation is a Saville Row tailor's called Kingsman, giving all of the spies an excuse to wear outrageously fashionable suits.<br/><br/>The ""M"" in this network has the codename of Arthur, played with enormous style by Michael Caine, especially in one notable scene where he suddenly slips from his posh Etonian accent into pure East End gangster. The ""Q"" equivalent is played by Vaughn-favourite Mark Strong, for once playing a good guy and playing it very well indeed.<br/><br/>It's also great to see, before his Star Wars return, Mark (Luke Skywalker) Hamill playing a global warming expert, who has more that one reason to get a bit hot under the collar.<br/><br/>During the heyday of the early Bond films in the 60's a number of spoof films arose: the gratingly erratic Casino Royale (with David Niven) being one, with James Coburn's ""Flint"" movies being a better example. Kingsman is a worthy example of this genre: a film that has its tongue firmly in its cheek, and with a range of nice Bond-references, particularly in regard to the cliché about the villain telling the hero the details of his plot before putting him to an intricate and readily escapable death.<br/><br/>I really liked this film from the off. It oozes style from the opening titles onwards and when we move into the extended agent training section Vaughn turns the action knob to 10, showing off the style of newcomer Egerton, who has great charisma and carries the role well particularly when matched with the charming and likable Roxy (a film debut for Sophie Cookson).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in my view, Vaughan and co-screenwriter Jane Goldman can't quite help themselves and turns the action knob to 11 for the second half of the film. A scene of carnage in a church will be too extreme for older or more sensitive viewers, and a gruesome scene to the stirring notes of ""Land of Hope and Glory"", whilst hysterically funny and done purely for laughs, doesn't quite fit with the mood of the film: it channels more ""Mars Attacks!"" than the Bond-spoof that has gone to date. Similarly a good gag with a Swedish princess is pushed a step too far in a final scene. A case of ""less is more"" in this reviewer's book.<br/><br/>In summary, well worth watching for a fun Saturday-night cinema trip. My one request to Vaughn is that if there is a Kingsman 2 (which you could certainly see happening) then he maintains enough interest to direct it: I'm not sure I could stand the disappointment of another Kick Ass 2.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please see the multi-media version together with more reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to subscribe.

","""We're not going to hear our politicians talk about population, because we have an economic system dependent upon perpetual growth. When you have such a system, you need an ever growing population to sustain it. But no one will admit to this. I've asked politicians, why don't you admit to the truth, that we can't always have growth? And the main answer I get is, well, you can't say that. Any politician who doubts that we can have exponential growth forever is put down or attacked."" - Dick Smith <br/><br/>""In the event that I am reincarnated I would like to return as a deadly virus, in order to contribute something to overpopulation."" - Prince Philip <br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn's ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" opens in a generic Middle Eastern country. Here generic white secret agents known as Kingsmen battle generic brown bad guys. These secret agents are led in the field by Galahad (Colin Firth), a generic spy-hero modelled on Ian Fleming's James Bond and Len Deighton's Harry Palmer.<br/><br/>""Kingsman"" quickly introduces us to Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a generic super-villain who has infinite resources, henchmen, secret lairs and technology which exists only to propel the film's generic plot. Thankfully the Kingsmen have similar generic technology, which similarly allows them to magically explain plot points, propel the film's generic plot and eavesdrop on various generic characters. Why write a good script when everyone in your film has access to a computer which tells everyone what happened, what to do, where to go and who is who?<br/><br/>Midway in ""Kingsman"", we learn Richmond Valentine's nefarious plans. A deranged environmentalist, Valentine hopes to cull Earth's human population, killing billions so that man's negative effects on the planet can be reversed. Spared from Valentine's slaughters are earth's wealthiest inhabitants. The poor die so that the rich can live.<br/><br/>But the Kingsmen also ooze wealth. Dressed in the finest clothes and surrounded by dazzling cars and posh mansions, they are seen as something to aspire to. Case in point Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton), an unemployed, lower class Londoner. Like he's stepped out of a Ken Loach film, Eggsy lives in a generic simulation of 1950s ""kitchen sink drama"", abused mom and all. He escapes this hellhole thanks to Galahad, who explains to Eggsy that social class distinctions make no man better or worse than another, and that anyone can be upwardly mobile, if only they inject a little hard work and perseverance. In other words, being posh is nothing to aspire to, but it is, and everyone can be posh, but really only those who deserve to be. The film's scrambled ideology isn't surprising considering that Matthew Vaughn's a fervent conservative, made videos for the Tory party and is related to King George VI.<br/><br/>""Kingsman's"" second act finds Eggsy and several other generic young men and women being trained by Galahad to become Kingsmen. Thanks to generic training montages, they quickly develop into resourceful murderers. Of course Eggsy, a wisecracking non-conformist, becomes the film's best Kingsman; nothing facilitates conformity more than the illusion of dissidence.<br/><br/>Now with his own private army of super-kids, Galahad launches a little war on Valentine. Cue much hyper-stylised violence, so immaculately choreographed as to be devoid of any thrill, danger or spontaneity. People get stabbed, head-shots are delivered and corpses ""humerously"" accumulate. <br/><br/>Because everyone in Vaughn's film is a random amalgamation of cartoonish traits, nothing in ""Kingsman"" has any dramatic weight. People fight, we don't care. The film ends with our heroes defeating Valentine, seemingly oblivious to the fact that, as per Vaughn's own rules, environmental collapse is coming anyway. Final scene? Eggsy saving the day, rescuing a princess and then being offered anal sex, a ""darkly comedic"" take on the ""flirtatious"" scenes which end virtually all James Bond movies. <br/><br/>Like many contemporary superhero films (""Kickass"", ""Chronicle"", ""Defendor"", ""Super"" etc), ""Kingsman"" attempts to be ""irreverent"". Swearing, casual brutality and randomness are presented as being ""cool"", and postmodern cut-and-pasting is presented as being ""daring"". Elsewhere the film's aesthetic plays like a cross between Zack Snyder, Guy Ritchie and a coked out Miley Cyrus, albeit with conservative shout-outs to Reagan, Thatcher and Rupert Murdoch. <br/><br/>Inept and witless as an action comedy, ""Kingsman"" is nevertheless somewhat politically interesting. A bit like Chris Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Rises"", with its ""evil environmentalists"" and its hero who thinks ""humans aren't ready for clean energy"", ""Kingsman"" presents environmentalists as wealthy bad guys who work with governments and rich dudes to screw the unsuspecting masses. The film doesn't treat the findings of environmental scientists as being wrong, but it nevertheless presents environmentalism as being pushed by those with ulterior motives; environmentalism as an elite project to foster global depopulation. In the real world, of course, the truth is precisely the opposite. Capitalism, orthodox political policy and short-sighted zillionaires are the chief opponents of environmental scientists. The latter believe ""sustainable capitalism"" to be an oxymoron, the former pay lip-service to ""green business policies"" in order to keep doing business as usual. ""Kingsman's"" Malthusian obsession with birth rates is itself a red-herring long favoured by elites. To accept the premise that environmental problems are driven by population, and not the built-in growth imperatives that characterise capitalism's system of commodity production, is to miss the point environmental scientists have been making for decades. Economists like John Foster state this clearly: ""Population growth cannot be examined apart from the economic system in which it is embedded. Negative or zero population growth poses serious problems for a capitalist society which always requires new markets, and always requires a continual expansion of both the labour force and the relative surplus population of the unemployed, all in order to meet the needs of production and profits."" Of course nobody going to ""Kingsman"" cares about any of this. Who cares about logarithmic scales when you can sodomize a princess?<br/><br/>5/10 – Worth one viewing."
"worldbarrow","3","13","25","21 July 2015"," Thumbs Down
","They had me going with the trailer. An urbane man in a suit beating down a room full of goons. I should have considered that this isn't the first time we've seen 'suit violence', but not in a comic vein, so the juxtaposition occurred to me as something fun and new. Too bad this was just marketing. The film doesn't deliver much on its premise. A super -secret society of gentlemen spies, led by Michael Caine, has lost one of its members, and each remaining Kingsman is supposed to propose a new candidate to train for their ranks. There is something like a coming-of-age story for the main character, 'Eggsy', a young hoodlum mentored by Harry Hart (Colin Firth), who was serving with Eggsy's father when he died. The film focuses on younger characters, so it feels like a movie for young people. The violence is comic-book, and while some people do get sliced in half, the film seems to earn its R rating with language and crudity. The Bond films have always used tongue-in-cheek characters in serious plots, but this film is too ridiculous to be taken seriously when it wants to be."

","Imagine James Bond, Jack Bauer, Jason Bourne and Johnny English in one movie, that's KINGSMAN: Secret Service.<br/><br/>On the surface, Kingsman is a lively, and vividly illustrated bloodfest. If you're into movies where blades fly and heads and arms get impaled and detached, this one's for you. It teems with gore and violence, its brutality weirdly presented in ludicrously colorful and hilarious ways. KINGSMAN will both entertain and keep you on the edge of your seat. It starts with a deadly mission, one that would send one of the KINGSMAN secret agents to his death.This death forces kingsman agent, Harry Hart (code name: Galahad), to personally deliver a bravery medal to his colleague's family, which the widow refuses to accept. The only son, receives it, instead. Now several years' passed, that medal, with a phone number encrypted on its back, leads the boy to KINGSMAN. And suddenly, he's brought into the dangerous world of espionage.<br/><br/>The film's charm comes chiefly from two key characters, Harry Hart (Collin Firth) and our young unassuming hero, ""Eggsy"" (Taron Egerton). Collin Firth's portrayal is truly remarkable, delivered with breathtakingly deadly elegance and aplomb, it's the one you would only expect from James Bond, and here, he might have done even more. Standing on totally opposite ground, is Eggsy, a young, playful teenager, who often gets into fights. He possesses an equally irresistible charm, only subtled beneath his choice of clothes, that is too unbecoming of a debonair secret agent. Together, these two, an ensemble of strong supports, Matt Vaughn's impeccable direction, and breathtaking visuals, result to this totally awe-inspiring film.<br/><br/>But beneath that facade of bloodbath and elaborately executed violence, what makes this movie deeply moving, is its reasonating message about what truly makes a man noble. In the end, Kingsman is a motion picture with an irresistibly overwhelming appeal, extravagantly delivered with stunning cinematography and jawdropping, some of which, comedy-imbued action sequences. I give this film 8/10 stars."

Most of what little plot exists was just an excuse to put more extreme violence on the screen.<br/><br/>I was tempted to give this film a higher score, like 2 or 3 out of ten, because of Samuel Jackson's character. Oddly, as the villain, he was one of the few people on the screen you really empathize with.

Then with some smirk, the movie makers can say ""I was just spoofing or paying homage to that well worn trope.""<br/><br/>The movie was utterly unintelligent and utterly pretentious, and any superficial Savile Row English gent class it exploited was there to hide the stupid and violent action scenes & silly plot."

","During a raid in the Middle East in 1997, a probationary secret agent sacrifices himself to save his team. Feeling guilt over the loss of his colleague, Harry Hart, code-named ""Galahad"", delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow, Michelle Unwin, and her young son, Gary ""Eggsy"", saying that if they ever need help, they should call the phone number on the back of the medal and deliver a coded message.<br/><br/>Seventeen years later Professor James Arnold is kidnapped by unknown assailants, led by Internet billionaire Richmond Valentine. One of Hart's fellow agents, ""Lancelot"", attempts to stage a rescue, but is killed by Gazelle, Valentine's henchwoman. Valentine, known for his philanthropy, continues to meet with various heads of state and VIPs, some of whom go missing afterwards. He also announces a giveaway of SIM Smart cards, granting a lifetime of free cellular and Internet access to anyone who wants it.<br/><br/>In London, Eggsy is now an unemployed young adult living with his mother, infant half-sister, and abusive stepfather, Dean. Despite being intelligent and capable, he left training for the Royal Marines and lives the aimless life of a stereotypical chav.[6][7] After being arrested for stealing a car, Eggsy calls the number on the back of the medal. Hart arranges for his release and tells Eggsy about his father - both of them were agents of Kingsman; an ""independent international intelligence agency"" founded in 1919 by a group of British royals who lost their heirs in World War One.<br/><br/>In the wake of Lancelot's death, the agency opens a vacancy for a new agent, and Eggsy agrees to apply as Hart's candidate. He joins a group of other candidates including a woman named Roxy, whom he befriends. Training is overseen by ""Merlin"", a senior Kingsman who acts as teacher, quartermaster, pilot and Ops co-ordinator. The candidates are eliminated one by one until only Eggsy and Roxy remain. Eggsy fails his final test - he is unable to shoot a dog he had raised from a puppy, though the gun was secretly loaded with blanks - and Roxy becomes the new Lancelot.<br/><br/>During this time, Kingsman has been investigating Valentine in connection with the VIP disappearances and notes that Arnold is no longer missing. Hart tracks down Arnold and confronts him about his abduction. A chip implanted in Arnold's head explodes, killing him; Hart is injured during his escape from unknown assailants. Undeterred, Hart poses as a billionaire and dines with Valentine to try to discern his plans.<br/><br/>Hart tracks Valentine to an obscure hate group church in Kentucky, where Valentine and Gazelle are conducting a test. They broadcast a signal, which triggers Valentine's SIM cards to broadcast a tone that causes everyone in the church, including Hart, to become uncontrollably violent. A mass brawl breaks out, with Hart the sole survivor, while Eggsy, Merlin and ""Arthur"" — Kingsman's leader — watch via video link. Valentine approaches Hart and kills him after revealing his plan.<br/><br/>Eggsy returns to the Kingsman headquarters, where he discovers that Arthur is one of Valentine's converts. Arthur explains Valentine's views: humanity is akin to a virus, and global warming is the Earth's equivalent of a fever. Valentine intends to kill the virus before it kills the host, broadcasting his signal worldwide to cause a massive culling of the human race. Only a select few that Valentine has deemed worthy of living — those who have sided with him and thus received the protective microchips in their heads, and the VIPs he kidnapped — will be spared.<br/><br/>After avoiding Arthur's attempt to kill him — killing Arthur as he does so — Eggsy teams up with Merlin and Roxy, the new Lancelot. Lancelot pilots a high-altitude balloon vehicle into the stratosphere to disrupt Valentine's satellite network with a missile, while Eggsy and Merlin directly assault Valentine's mountain bunker. Lancelot knocks out the satellite, but Valentine arranges with a business contact to replace the destroyed satellite. Valentine activates the signal, causing global pandemonium.<br/><br/>Eggsy and Merlin infiltrate the bunker. Eggsy obtains access to Valentine's computer network for Merlin, but is nearly captured by a disgraced Kingsman candidate who recognizes him. Eggsy is later surrounded by the guards, but Merlin activates a security protocol in Valentine's chip implants, explosively killing everyone except Valentine and Gazelle. Eggsy fights Gazelle and kills her with a poison-tipped blade concealed in his shoe. Eggsy then manages to kill Valentine by throwing one of Gazelle's prosthetic legs at him, ending the worldwide carnage.<br/><br/>Ultimately Eggsy, now a Kingsman, reaches out to his mother, offering her a new home and a chance to get away from Dean. Dean and his subordinates move to attack, but Eggsy waylays Dean in exactly the same manner that Galahad had waylaid one of his henchmen earlier.<br/><br/>Go watch the movie guy. 9/10"
"grendelkhan","8","6","10","26 January 2016"," Delivers over-the-top fun, the way that Bond used to.
","When I heard that Miark Millar's comic, The Secret Service (with artist Dave Gibbons, of Watchmen fame), was being turned into a movie, I had a pretty good idea of what we wood get: a lot of vulgar language, over-the-top violence, and a decent plot. What surprised me was how much felt like a tribute to the glory years of James Bond, far more than anything from Eon and MGM. It revels in what made Bond great fun, while adding a modern spin. It also pokes fun at the often pompous, upper class world of Bond and espionage fiction (and reality) and doesn't take itself too seriously. It is vulgar and ridiculously violent, though the violence does tend to be more in service to the story than some of Millar's other work.<br/><br/>Mathew Vaughn direct; unsurprising, after Kick-Ass; but, as he showed in the early segments of X-Men: First Class, he gets spy-fi and delivers it well. He's not too overboard with the jump cuts and does let you soak up some of the screen, before throwing everything and the kitchen sink at you. I do wish he would slow things down a bit, here and there; but, it's a modern film world.<br/><br/>Colin Firth is the linchpin that holds the film together and presents us with a cross between James Bond and John Steed, either of whom he would have played wonderfully. In fact, I wish we had a time machine and take Vaughn and Firth back and redo The Avengers (the Ralph Finnes and Uma thurman one, not Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the rest). Michael Caine provides a nice tribute to the golden days, as Harry Palmer's glasses also seem to figure into the formula, while Caine gets to play the toff (though his accent slips in his last scene). Vaughn brings back Mark Strong to show why he is greatly under-appreciated in Hollywood (the man is a great actor and has been since at least Prime Suspect 3). Taron Egerton makes an excellent young Eggy, while Sophie Cookson is the capable, but self-doubting Roxy. On the bad guy's side we have Samuel L. Jackson, as a sort of Richard Branson crossed with Bill Gates and Russell Simmons, with a dash of megalomania. he is aided by his henchperson, Sophia Boutella, as Gazelle, the most memorable sidekick/assassin since Oddjob. All do a wonderful job.<br/><br/>This has just about everything I felt had been missing from Bond, for years (even before Daniel Craig and the serious tone): a great villain, plenty of action and intrigue, a sense of humor, and a sense of danger. Modern Bond has the danger and intrigue, but has lost the sense of humor and the sheer fun of a super-agent. There hasn't been a memorable Bond villain in years, yet Samuel L Jackson delivered a great gonzo billionaire, where Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce struggled.<br/><br/>I can quibble about a few things; some of the violence would be better left to the imagination and the language really doesn't add much; but, on the whole, those are minor criticisms. The characters are engaging, the plot is entrancing and the action is well staged and rarely gratuitous. This is pure cinematic fun, with a dose of brainpower. I can't wait for more."

"dandare4479","8","9","17","29 January 2015"," Violent but extremely fun spy adventure
","Kingsman like Kick Ass is a action packed and comedic film from X-men first class director Matthew Vaughn. It is well made and filmed with confidence which is refreshing after a spade of disappointing action films like The Expendables 3, Taken 3 for example. Imagine if Matthew Vaughn was allowed to direct an Expendables. This is a violent film but it is filmed in a manor that is in-between soft core action of again something like Expendables 3 and Graphic action of say something like Robocop making it both accessible to both audiences. The film has been marketed in a way which well respected actors such as Colin Firth, Samuel L Jackson, and Michael Caine are all involved in a comedy / adventure film, which is true, however anyone that has seen Kick Ass will know what is going to happen. I applaud the three above for their involvement in something they would normally not take on, they all give good performances, as well as Matthew Vaughn regular Mark Strong. The two young leads also give good performances, however I think Samuel L Jackson steals the show with strong support from Colin Firth.The film is good fun and deserves all the success I am sure it will receive. 2015 is going to be one hell of a year"

"russellingreviews","2","35","89","21 January 2015"," Vaughn had a shot at a classy spy film, but overshot the mark
","Walking into the cinema... I was looking forward to this film. Kingsman looks to be a return to the old-style spy films, but is this film meant to be a farce, a fantasy or an attempt to get back to the traditional Bond style?<br/><br/>Overall rating: 1.5 stars Cinematic value: 1.5 stars Family value: 0 stars<br/><br/>""You are about to embark on the most dangerous job interview in the world."" - Merlin<br/><br/>For those who are clued into the comic world, Kingsman: The Secret Service is an acclaimed series from Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. The spy-recruitment story is not original, but seeing Colin Firth (The King's Speech) as a super-spy presents new possibilities to this familiar genre. Firth plays Harry Hart, who is a part of the Kingsmen, a super-secret spy agency that attempts to recruit Gary Unwin (Taron Egerton) to the spy world. Egsy is the typical misguided youth who does not see his potential until Harry Hart comes into his life. The recruit goes through an accelerated spy training that leads to his role in saving the world. <br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn (X-men: First Class) seems to be attempting to go old-school and bring back tailored suits in the espionage world, but quickly shows that this is not going to be your father's spy film. Not to be considered too prudish, but this film pushes the edge of the envelope with language, violence and sexual situations and then keeps going. Gone are the days of subtle winks and innuendo, this visual experience smacks you in the face with twists on the traditional spy story and then kicks you while you are down for good measure. Vaughn seems to take from Quentin Tarantino's playbook, where nothing is too extreme. Tarantino has moved film making to a new level and his writing is unparallelled in the industry, but Vaughn is not Tarantino. Sometimes violence and language does add to the entertainment experience and the storyline, but this film merely is trying to shock the audience and hide the poorly executed story. The characters lack depth and as Harry says in the film, ""Those films are only as good as their villain."" Samuel L. Jackson as the villain, Valentine, is not convincing and is poorly written. Which can be said of the film, to Kingsman seems to be marketed to the teen market, but this film will make even the most discerning adult look away and blush at the closing scenes.<br/><br/>In attempting to find redemptive qualities to Kingman was difficult, there is nothing to consider. The only recommendation is to choose another film. There is no redeeming value to this film and it would go against all sensibilities to recommend it. <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... Reality did not meet expectations with this film. The marketing is deceptive and the film is not for the audience they are targeting. Usually willing to allow for artistic license, this film is a film of extremes that does not deserve an audience. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Is there a 'line' or discernment to film viewing? (John 7:24, Philippians 1:9-10) 2. Where does the notion of the sanctity of life come?

Other times again, it's a Hot Fuzz-style comedy gore fest. And then there are bits when it's more like a comic book action film. By trying to be all of those things (often not very well), it's none of them, and the film fails to create its own distinctive ""world"" in the way that good films do. The result is a disjointed and strangely unsatisfying film that, to its credit, also has a few quite enjoyable bits along the way.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn said he wanted to inject a sense of humour back into spy films.

I don't mind violence when it's part of the drama (or the suspension of belief), so I don't think that violence takes anything away from the movie. The problem is that there is almost nothing to take away.<br/><br/>The story is appalling, the characters are cringe-worthy, the only enjoyable thing is Colin Firth's suit (but the same suit fitting a youngster with half the class of Firth is looking actually quite poor), the humour is dadsjokesque, and the ending is, to be generous, atrocious. I also found a lot of crass ignorance and obtuse projection of its fictional world. As if we needed obtuse fictional worlds.<br/><br/>What about the performances? Argh! I think Jack Davenport's is the best, but only because he does not get enough time on screen to spoil it. Michael Caine holds water, barely, better not to talk about the rest.<br/><br/>If you put 007 on one side and Austin Powers on the other, this movie is located precisely in the trash bin, where it should stay."

Unless you enjoy exploding heads and slashing prosthetic legs. Of course, maybe all that was meant to be funny. Kingsman is a mixture of a James Bond parody and a video game -- a spoof, of sorts, that comes off more like an industry in-joke. Unfortunately, with the video game portions, you have no joysticks to control the action. And there was no joy. The best thing about the film was the cast of old and familiar faces, including Mark Hamill 37 years after Star Wars. I'm sure some of the actors did it just for the money -- but some of us in the audience paid the price."

Any potential spoilers have been marked but are very vague.<br/><br/>For anyone who ever enjoyed the sounds and themes of groups like The Sex Pistols, The Clash, and the The Damned, this is your kind of movie. Matthew Vaughn has given the punk genre a new flame with his new film ""Kingsman."" While many will see this movie expecting a poorly done money grabber that's riding the coattails of YA movies and James Bond. What ""Kingsman"" delivers instead is an action packed, in-your-face, anti-typical, punk rock movie (just without all the drugs and the angst... oh, and the music).<br/><br/>Vaughn does not care if you like his characters, he does not care if you support their causes, and he does not care about your political stance. Vaughn only wanted to make a movie that was anti-stereotype, and he succeeded. This is even referenced in the dialogue multiple times throughout the film. While the movie could do without several scenes that only serve to add extra time to the already long duration of the film, there are almost no points in the film where an audience member should be bored or confused. Also, (semi-spoilers) while I was disappointed to see certain cast members be killed off, I had no problems with any of the acting; EXCEPT for Samuel Jackson's ridiculous lisp that is almost impossible to listen to, albeit funny to hear at first. <br/><br/>I gave this film a 7 out of 10 for its uniqueness and purpose.

","There is directors that were inspired by the Bond films to make a parody out of it, such as ""Austin Powers"" (film series). Than there are movies like ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" that does a good job taking the certain concepts of it like the gentlemen spy elements than adding there own touches to it. And this film really does succeed when it comes to the entertainment value of it all. I mean this is what the Alex Rider movie should have been. There has been movies about kids or teens becoming a secret agent and working for a agency. But I think this took the formula and polished it to the point where teens and adults can thoroughly enjoy it. It has a good build up, stand out characters and villains and well choreographed action sequences. Add good special effects with a story-line that is coherent and fits together well. Then you got yourself a action movie that is really worth seeing. It's a action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's really not campy either.

","Kingsman: The Secret Service is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is a very fun ride, completely enjoyable from start to finish, jam packed with great action sequences, sincere hilarity and outstanding characters. <br/><br/>The movie is very original, there truly is not, nor do I think there ever will be, a film quite like it. It's certainly a parody of the spy genre but in a very different way, it's not quite like Naked Gun or Austin Powers, it's more of a tribute to old fashioned spy films, like the Roger Moore Bonds. <br/><br/>The cast is fantastic, and as this is a Matthew Vaughn (easily one of the most talented directors in Hollywood) film, there are many actors in unexpected roles. Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson have never done anything like this before,. Firth is the slick, skillful super spy and Jackson is the main villain who also provides a lot of comic relief, you would not expect to see them in these roles, but they completely own them nonetheless. <br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn also likes getting very small actors in the main role, and he made a great choice with Taron Egerton, a talented young actor who suited the role of Eggsy perfectly, and I hope to see more of him in the future. A hilarious, action packed breath of fresh air, Kingsman brought a smile to my face throughout and I am so happy a film this insane exists, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy. <br/><br/>A spy organisation recruits a young man with little skill but a lot of promise, meanwhile, an evil genius plots to take over the world with a new smart phone. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Colin Firth"

Because if they took it all the way, there would be less cheering for this politically charged bloodthirsty scene, and it would be suggested that the posters who say this was ""the best part of the movie"" should seek mental help. I suggest that regardless.<br/><br/>I wonder if the writers for the sequel would have the courage to make a similar massacre scene in a black church, or a Mosque, which fundamentally agrees with white churches concerning homosexuality and abortion... I'd say not. The picture would never see the light of day. This scene was all about fulfilling a specific ignorant liberal fantasy.<br/><br/>The 40k+ numb-skulls who rated this movie a 10 must have had their moral compass replaced by a SIM card from Twentieth Century Fox! With the fight scenes, FX, and cinematography, I would have gave this movie a 5... but since this was probably one of last films Dylann Roof saw before he started his own killing spree, I gave it a 1."

","Kingsman: The Secret Service is the most typical Mark Millar/Matthew Vaughn movie you'll ever get. It has the author's same gratuitous violent content, shallowly depicted intriguing themes and outrageous ideas towards various genres, as well as the director's stylized action scenes and trademark visual quirks. It tackles the same personality and ambition from the Kick-Ass movies; it speaks the language of the well- known genre while also mocking the worst of it, yet goes hypocritical about its own opinion. And as always, it still offers their classic pleasure by just being pure silly and violent, but then it doesn't gain anything more than that.<br/><br/>Just like what they did to superheroes, The Secret Service both pokes fun and shows its affections to the classic elements of the themed genre. Though, the criticism doesn't go any farther than pointing out its clichés and trend by dialogue. It never really tries to transcend anything or prove to be better than what spy movies have done, the film just feels like expressing those opinions. In spite of that, the plot is outright ridiculous, but for the film, it just loves being dumb at those conceits. The movie is clearly contented at throwing away a bunch of fascinating ideas within this world, even at the training scenes where most of their work don't necessarily applied in their actual mission. While it's fun, it never really outcomes anything more than a zany imagination.<br/><br/>However, the pacing feels kind of slower than it deserves. This is the type of film that needs a little more momentum to actually live up to its silliness. Maybe at the action scenes, it did, but most of the film has to settle with many things that don't need much of a heavy breathing. It's still entertaining, the characters are easy enough to root for out of their charm, that a simpler pacing would have make things easier to watch.<br/><br/>And there's a huge benefit with its style. Matthew Vaughn only has a single aim in his action scenes and that is to be ""Awesome."" Even for a sequence that is meant to look terrible and morally ambiguous, the style still manages to gloss it over with cool camera shots and velocity, which strangely happens to be the best action sequence of the bunch. It's kind of difficult to think if this is appropriate, but then this is a property that should never be taken seriously. There is a lot to like in the cast. It's easy to picture Colin Firth as a classy spy, and he does it perfectly, while adding up a sense of gravity in other parts. Eggsy appears as a generic young protagonist, but it's Taron Egerton's charisma is what made this hero shine. Samuel L. Jackson makes for a fun and mostly amusing villain. And there's always a likable presence in Mark Strong.<br/><br/>Kingsman: The Secret Service is self-indulgently fun; so self-indulgent, it tends to sacrifice many of its mundane senses. This is one weird, nerdy fantasy that is easy enough to pleasure comicbook or simply dumb action movie fans. It has style, twisted humor and of course, exciting action. There is nothing else beyond that, though. We just encountered an origin story that has the potential for a new big franchise. We can't fault a film for having an utter joy with itself, it just feels sort of empty. It could have been a little more thoughtful once in a while.And even slightly quicker. But as a total guilty pleasure, this is alright."

Just so ridiculous & unbelievable. The hero receives no training, but suddenly turns into an untouchable badass, WTF? Samuel L was just annoying, & useless. The end scene with the princess came out of nowhere & was just crude & stupid. Someone should get slapped for leaving that scene in the movie!

Even the villain with the crazy knife feet is intriguing. The psychological thrills that play out as the next new Kingsman is chosen are also well done. But then the unspeakable gratuitous violence takes over. I usually very much enjoy spy films; I expected this one to be entertaining a la Men In Black, Mission: Impossible, or James Bond. Instead, it quickly becomes Pulp Fiction ~ for no reason whatsoever ~ a huge betrayal. Pornographic violence. Vapid female characters. An inappropriate sexual scene. All utterly unnecessary and truly disgusting. All attempts at humor or artistry fall flat. Shame on Colin Firth and Michael Caine for being in this movie, from whom I expect so much more.

"chulwinik-62949","3","6","11","31 August 2015"," A hot mess of a movie
","When I originally saw the ad for a new spy movie with Colin Firth, I was excited at the prospect of watching a new and witty franchise. How wrong I was.<br/><br/>This is just one of those movies that was churned out for young audiences without any care for quality or consistency. It's like the creators of this film looked up what was popular on netflix and jammed in all their favorite parts without caring about the plot. Watching this movie was a jarring experience, because there is no solid theme running throughout the film. You see a little Tarantino here and there, a lot of James bond, some Spy kids (remember that one) and a little taste of FX's Archer to finish things off. And worse of all, it really drags in the middle and focuses too much on a poorly scripted teen drama. Considering that we are watching a spy in training, you would expect to see some really cool stunt work and fun gadgets along the way. NOPE! Just some teen angst and some competitive exercises.<br/><br/>While I was disappointed to see that Colin Firth was just a supporting character, I was irritatingly bored with Taron Egerton's character Eggsy; just another bland and rebellious every-teen. He manages to crack a solid joke once in a while, but is never witty- although the movie tells us he is very witty.<br/><br/>I think one of the more annoying aspects of this movie is how often they break that fourth wall to tell you how good this movie is. Considering how badly this movie is written, I found this these constant winks towards the audience very obnoxious. ""Don't you miss all those fun and witty spy movies?"" ""Don't you miss the classic villains?"" Yes I do, but this movie isn't even close to delivering on any of these. So shut up and finish this crap! I could on and one about everything wrong with this movie, but I think that would require more effort than was put into the movie's writing. While the marketing deceived me into watching a movie aimed at teens, I know that movie companies see bad products as a one night stand. However, this leads me to my last and biggest problem with the movie. It is profoundly sexist, but is aimed at a teenage audience. What the hell? To be clear, the movie is not being ironically sexist to get some laughs- because that I could live with. No, this is the bad kind of sexism that is deeply ingrained in the story's plot to make the main (but incredibly bland) lead more interesting. First, the mother is a weak mess that requires rescuing from an abusive alcoholic. While Eggsy's father was an incredible war hero, the mother decided to marry a sleaze shortly after his passing. The movie never explains how the same woman can go from marrying a hero to a pathetic criminal- we just assume that a woman without a good man falls to pieces. Second, Eggsy's main rival in the spy training program is a girl, which you would think is progress. Again, nope! She can only succeed when Eggsy boosts her confidence. She completely lacks any sense of confidence without his support. Making matters worse, she is completely written out of the final act, even though she proves herself to be the best spy in the program! They literally attach a balloon to her back and send her off to the sky, while Eggsy takes on the bad guys. Finally, there is the now infamous anal scene. Again this is a scene that just does not fit, as the movie was never this raunchy and the humor was completely different. Its like the writers of Archer wondered in to the writing room and wrapped things up for them. Don't get me wrong, I love Archer as much as the next guy, but this was just so random. What made it worse is that Princess Tilde was the only world leader in the movie to stand up for her people. So to honor her courage, the movie has her drop her pants for the ""hero"" and offer her anus. If that sounds graphic, that is because that is how the scene plays. Hopefully I am fully conveying the movie's attitude towards women. While I want to dismiss this as just another piece of crappy film making, I am disturbed on why the creators thought the denigration of women was important in a movie for teens. Why is every woman in this movie have to be so weak? Some may accuse me of being overly PC. As a former football player and fratboy, I know I am not. I like raunchy comedies, violent movies, and sexy thrillers. But I don't like it when movie producers underestimate its audiences and dismiss their intelligence. Slapping a few jokes and some nudity to a bad movie does not ""fix it"". I am also not shy about calling out a movie's creators for perpetuating bad behavior. Real men do not need to tear down women to make themselves feel better. Sexism isn't cool or fun, and neither is this movie."
"bugger-17071","3","6","11","30 June 2015"," Confused by the praise
","After hearing nothing but good words about the movie, I decided it was time to go see it. After finishing it, I was confused by the disparity between my opinion of the movie and the reception it got. Sure, the movie is original, it does not use clichés and has really surprising moments, but the positives end there. The action scenes were way too graphic, to the point where I asked myself: what is the point of this? Some of the stunts pulled by the main character were downright unrealistic. From an acting standpoint, the movie did mostly fine, the actors were believable in their roles, even if sometimes hard to understand, but that's British accents for you.<br/><br/>I would say, watch this movie if you are someone who lives for action movies. And don't be fooled by the ""comedy"" tag. This move is NOT a comedy, and does not contain funny moments. It passes more as an action thriller really."
"tony-557","5","8","16","2 August 2015"," potentially great, but sullied by some poor choices

It was really great in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it also makes a few very weak choices in terms of gags that distract from the flow of the movie. Specifically, (and here's your spoiler alert), the scene at the end with Hanna Alström could have been touching, or a least cute, but instead the director decided to go with an anal sex joke. What gives? It's as if the writers and director were in sync to make something new and different, and the Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen show up and exercise their executive vetoes to enforce crassness. After all, how can a Scandinavian royal asking to take it up the butt not be hilarious?!?

Harry aka Galahad (Colin Firth) recruits Eggsy (Taron Egerton) later known as Lancelot. Valentine (Samual L. Jackson) is a multi billionaire bent on reducing earth's population via a Culling but saving an elite few. And this is accomplished by a chip inserted into people causing them to fight to the death when the chip is activated. <br/><br/>Ah, the promos did it again. They promised a good spy story mimicking Bond James Bond and other spy films. The first half was pretty good. The choreography during the fights was outstanding. We see the training of recruits vying for the new Kingsman Agent position. <br/><br/>Then the second half degraded into mass murders in a Church and these murders went on for too long a time, fights breaking out all over the world, later we see exploding heads worldwide, and let's not forget a mother with knife in hand trying desperately to get through a bathroom door to kill her child within. This is entertainment? Hardly. <br/><br/>The ending showed us the lure of anal sex as a reward for Eggsy for saving the planet. Again, this is entertainment? Hardly. <br/><br/>Notables: Michael Caine as Arthur, the head of the Kingsman Secret Service; Mark Strong as Merlin, Arthur's henchman; and Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold. Sofia Boutella as Gazelle is an amputee that now has knives for legs and her choreography is brilliant. <br/><br/>Okay, so if there is another Kingsman Secret Service movie we will know what to expect and not pay any attention to the promos.

","Based on some comic book (another one) this is the tale of the initiation of a teen (I suppose) into a British secret service organization.<br/><br/>The reason why I went to see this thing in the cinema is because I loved ""Kick-Ass"", also from director Vaughn. That movie was also very violent but the crazy concept, a shy high school boy and a 11 -year old girl fighting crime, made it work.<br/><br/>The next installment from Vaughn starts off well, largely thanks to Colin Firth as the mentor. Just until halfway into the movie when Firth character is offed, during the now infamous church scene (extremely violent even for this kind of movie), we're stuck with this 'new kid' for the rest of the movie. As this actor has basically zero charisma it's all downhill from that point. The whole thing simply turns into this violent video game style catastrophe with our 'hero' having to invade the bad guys fortress, in doing so killing dozens and dozens of his henchmen, not to mention exploding heads and a certain Swedish princess.<br/><br/>This ultimately pretty sicko movie will be largely appreciated by a late teen/early twenty audience, not only due to the R-rating but as they simply are the target audience for this: brain dead geeks addicted to ultra-violent video games. If you do not fall into this category : do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague."
"alikhat","1","7","14","17 December 2015"," Bargain Basement Bond For The Brain Dead
","I remember seeing a clip from Kingsman a year before the film came out. It was that great fight scene in the pub and it generated loads of excitement and anticipation in the crowd that viewed it at Wondercon. Who knew that scene was the highlight of the whole movie and it all went down the drain from there like a sludgy turd?<br/><br/>It's simply amazing to me that a film that should have been such can't miss material managed to do almost everything wrong. Dumb, predictable, crude, sexist, unfunny to anyone with an IQ higher than room temperature and violent to the point of grotesque, Kingsman just devolves from scene to scene into a miasma of stupid.<br/><br/>I generally have no problem with movie violence, but Kingsman simply disgusted me. When a film tries to sell itself as a quirky Bond send-up, suddenly dumping a metric ton of Evil Dead-esque hack and slashing (most of which is being committed by the film's ostensible hero) pretty much destroys the tone and makes clear that the filmmakers haven't a clue what they're doing. The pathetic stabs at unPC satire are, likewise, amateurish and eyeroll-inducing.<br/><br/>Probably the single biggest dim-bulb move, however, is systematically killing off anyone in the cast remotely interesting, including the nominal star, Colin Firth, who is denied the dignity of even making it as far as the final half hour (though it's entirely possible he insisted on it after reading through the whole script).<br/><br/>Since everything these days, no matter how vile and utterly devoid of merit it may be, is granted a sequel, we will apparently be getting a Kingsman 2. And how thrilling to know it will star the bland, charisma-free twenty-something leftovers from K1, whose names and faces I'm struggling to recall even though I watched the film less than an hour ago. Yes, nothing says a good time at the cinema like watching the human equivalent of vanilla pudding.<br/><br/>In sum, if you really want to see a Bond-like film, go see a Bond film! Or watch the British Avengers series, or The Incredibles, or track down a copy of In Like Flint. Anything up to and including watching test patterns and infomercials for incontinence care would be time better spent than watching this thing."

Colin Firth shines as the veteran Kingsman, and Taron Egerton and Sophie Cookson are fine as Kingsman candidates, but Jackson is a lame villain who doesn't have the charm or acting chops to fill his role.

But Kingsmen: The Secret service not only took disappointment to another level but also made sure that people love this stupid story. The trailers says, from the maker of Xmen: The first class. The makers must be ashamed of the work they have done. It was like the director smoked up a pot and wrote the whole story. Not only that, the producers while listening to the script must have thought that we should not experiment with this, but then they too must have been swayed by the same idiotic pot. Besides cool action and some heroic type fighting, there's nothing in the movie. It's a total waste of time and money. I feel like burning the DVD or else I would try and bargain with the shopkeeper to give me a discount on some other DVD, but I guess he won't even give it because he knows people would watch it online instead of buying such believe-it-or-not bu*****t film. KUDOS to everyone!! Their efforts didn't go waste as many have rated the movie above 7. Seems like the pot is really dangerous and effective."

Then we start to see the ""makings"" of Joe Public - a bloke like you and me. This is the story of how he becomes a Kingsman.The scene in the pub is brilliant...!!! Slowly but surely a ""Kingsman"" is made. Kick Ass central is the destination of this train. You won't want to get off.... It does get silly - make no mistake, Samuel L Jacksons character is just daft and it all ends up in silliness! But that doesn't matter!!! A Kingsman is born and it's all cool - right down to the final scene in the pub. Don't miss this its brilliant!!!"
"mrvicegarcia","8","4","7","16 May 2016"," Kingsman: The Secret Service is awesome guys!
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is totally awesome! As a kid who grew up watching action films or fantasy films like Star Wars, I feel like a kid again with all those jam-packed action scenes. It was beyond what I expected. Usually with a spy film, it is just your typical protagonist trying to save the world by being on an undercover mission or an underground organization. While some cliché formulas are seen in Kingsman: The Secret Service, how they are interpreted throughout the film is a huge refreshment for me. <br/><br/>I always kinda like the idea that this movie is like a James Bond film but with a more violent and brutal yet hilarious tone and the movie didn't let me down. Visually, the movie is appealing! The colors used will give you really that rich secret agent feeling that is ready to kick some ass. The plot is basically predictable for your typical spy film but that same formula works in this film. Truly, this film is literally nerve-wracking and crazy which is pretty damn good.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn once again that he knows what he is doing with his work. Looking back at his past films like Kick-Ass (2010) and X-Men: First Class (2011), we can surely admit that this movie is an addition to his epic portfolio. Without a doubt, Kingsman: The Secret Service is his most violent yet hilarious movie he has done throughout his career. Comics turned movies about superheroes is this industry's quick way to have a good fortune but sometimes the adaptation is just taken too seriously. But this movie has a perfect mixed of awesomeness, vulgar, and tragedy which is every superhero movie should like (especially if it is an R-rated movie). <br/><br/>Colin Firth, the guy who usually takes dramatic roles, is a big surprise in this film because of being a total bad-ass. This film will make you realize how really good he is as an actor. Also, the biggest breakout star in 2015 is in this film, and his name is Taron Egerton portraying the role of Eggsy. He has so much charm and energetic vibe that it will not be a surprise if we will see him in some other major films to come. <br/><br/>The fight scenes are remarkable and eye-pleasing. The way the scenes are over-the-top suites well in the whole movie and it is too awesome for anyone not to see. The scenes are really brutal for the fact that there are too many blood, parts cut off, and people that are literally cut into half. But Vaughn did the scenes like it's just a comic relief in the film.<br/><br/>In the end, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a must watch! Just don't let the minors watch because it is a foul-mouthed, vulgar film. I am a little disappointed that it hasn't earned an Oscar nomination for Sound Mixing. But nevertheless, it doesn't need an Oscar Nomination for it to be acclaimed. This film is the best spy film for 2015!"

"nmholland","9","4","7","23 April 2016"," One of the Most Enthrawling Action Movies of Recent Years
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is directed by Matthew Vaughn and stars Taron Egerton as young Eggsy, a teenage street kid that is recruited by a spy organization, and must compete with other recruits in his class in order to become the next Kingsman, a gentleman like spy. Upon being recruited, he befriends an older Kingsman named Galahad, played by Colin Firth, that teaches him the ways of being a Kingsman, and, more importantly, being a gentleman.<br/><br/>I actually didn't want to see this movie. I've never been too hot on espionage films, and wasn't looking forward to Kingsman. However, this movie proved me wrong in so many ways. I had an absolute blast watching Kingsman, and so regret not seeing it the theaters. Near everything about this film entertained me, and I was on the edge of my seat through every single action sequence. Kingsman was one of the few movies of recent years in which I had white knuckles through every single action scene, and even most of the talking scenes. Kingsman was an amazing movie, and had great aspects about it.<br/><br/>The best thing about Kingsman is the actors' portrayals of the characters. Prior to watching this movie, I doubted Colin Firth as an action hero, but he was fantastic as this gentleman spy. I read that he did 80% of his own stunts, and it really paid off. Taron Egerton was the highlight of this film. He displayed Eggsy's large character arc near perfectly, and delivered every single one of his lines believably. Samuel L. Jackson played a great villain, and was another great attribute that Kingsman had going for it. He pulled off the ""evil plan"" cliché, while also acknowledging that it was a cliché.<br/><br/>The direction by Matthew Vaughn was amazing as well. The way he manipulated the camera to film at varying speeds while weaving in between characters, mid fight, during the action sequences was excellent. He brought every scene to life so vibrantly that Kingsman sucks the audience in after watching it for only 5 minutes. All of the direction was great, and brought the film to new levels of expertise very quickly.<br/><br/>The score was the third thing that really pulled me into the scenes, particularly the suspenseful ones. Without going into too much detail, the parachute scene was one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen in recent years, and the music had a great part in it. All of the music throughout the entirety of Kingsman was astounding, and sucked me into the film so easily that I felt like I was there, in the film, rather than watching it.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with Kingsman was the ending. Not particularly how the film ended, but some subplots that weren't wrapped up like I had hoped they would've been. This is most likely due to the presence of a looming sequel (Kingsman: The Golden Circle coming in 2017), but I still would've preferred some closure with certain characters and stories that the film presented. Besides that, however, I loved Kingsman.<br/><br/>Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service was a great movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys action, espionage, or just good movies all around."

","Kingsman: The Secret Service with one call as Estate Eggsy (Taron Egerton) calls in a favor from Harry Hart (Colin Firth), an old associate of his father. Hart initiates Eggsy into the Kingsman, a privately operated secret service and, in the course of his training, they both run afoul of evil billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who, of course, has a nefarious scheme that needs thwarting.<br/><br/>The film has one subtitle too many, and it takes that approach to everything: excess in moderation. Its attention to detail is impressive without being overly meta: only Hart and Valentine acknowledge their debt to classic Bond films, and nobody feels the need to comment on the overkill of an evil lair that seems like it could have been airlifted straight from You Only Live Twice."
"brando647","9","4","7","22 January 2016"," A Surprise Hit and Perfect Start to 2015's Slate of Spy Films
","I am a major unapologetic fan of the James Bond franchise and, as much as I love the latest serious Daniel Craig run of the series, KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is apparently the 007 film I've been craving since Roger Moore finished his run in 1985. It takes all the most playful elements of Moore's 007 films, gives them modern sensibilities, and ramps up the stylized action under the direction of Matthew Vaughn. I've enjoyed Vaughn's work since LAYER CAKE and I'll admit I was worried about KINGSMAN. Leading up to its release, I'd seen little to no promotion for it and it was apparently based on a comic property with which I was unfamiliar. To top it off, it was scheduled for release in the month of February, a notorious cinematic dumping ground. But, man, I was wrong to doubt it. Turns out, KINGSMAN is one of my favorite movies of 2015, a year swamped with spy films. The Kingsman are a secret organization of wealthy gentlemen dating nearly a century and their mission is to keep the world safe from danger utilizing seemingly endless resources. Cool gadgets and impeccable style without the hindrance of answering to the government and MI6. Each agent is code- named for one of the knights in King Arthur's court, and they operate out of a tailor shop on Savile Row in London. As the movie begins, a threat emerges in the form of a world-famous tech billionaire whose plan for saving the world from environmental destruction means eliminating its over-population problem.<br/><br/>It all begins with the kidnapping of a famed environmental scientist/university professor, played by none other than Mark Hamill. A botched rescue attempt leaves a Kingsman agent dead and we then jump into the process of finding a new Lancelot. Harry Hart/Galahad (Colin Firth) recruits young Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) and convinces him to go through the recruitment campaign where he will compete with nearly a dozen other candidates for the position. This proves to be a challenge for Eggsy, as he's a street thug (albeit one with above average intelligence and Olympic-level gymnastic skills) going up against Ivy Leaguers with stiff upper lips and wealthy backgrounds. Hart feels compelled to care for Eggsy because it was Eggsy's father that saved his life by giving his own on a mission years earlier in the Middle East. Hart becomes a sort of surrogate father to Eggsy, teaching him in the ways of acting a gentleman and giving the kid confidence to compete. Firth and Egerton are a solid team in the film, and Firth's performance leads me to believe he could've been a fantastic 007 if he'd been given the chance. With support from Mark Strong as the Kingsman's tech wizard Merlin and Michael Caine as the commanding officer of the organization (dubbed Arthur, naturally), this movie's got some serious acting chops in it. But a proper spy/action film is only as strong as its villain and, when that villain is Samuel L. Jackson, you know it's going to be fun.<br/><br/>KINSGMAN has a perfect blend of action and humor. It's definitely a lot edgier in the comedy than 007 films have ever been, seeing as how KINGSMAN totally embraces its R-rating. At the end of a 007 film, we get a tender embrace under the sheets, a cheesy pun, and an ""Oh, James"" from the leading lady. In KINGSMAN, the gorgeous woman prepares for mounting like a dog in heat because, well, he did save the world as promised. This movie is a jacked-up love letter to the fun 007 movies of the Connery and Moore eras, parodying elements with a knowing nod and taking everything a step further because they can. The violence certainly takes full advantage of the R-rating, with a church slaughter halfway through the film spilling loads of blood and establishing itself as the most fun scene of any movie in 2015 (fantastically set to the tune of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Freebird""). The Kingsman may not appear to be much of a threat in their tailored suits with their proper manners, but these dudes can open a can of whoop a**. I would never expect much from Colin Firth but he's got a few scenes in this movie proving that Galahad is not a man to be trifled with. I could go on about KINGSMAN but I'll sum it up with this: the movie is just a crazy amount of fun and there is extra enjoyment to be had for fans of classic 007 who'll see a lot of the tropes toyed with here.<br/><br/>One last note: I really, really hope KINGSMAN 2 brings in Roger Moore in a supporting role, either as the villain or the head of the Kingsman. It would just be perfect."

","If you want to spend a couple of hours on a harmless, enjoyable, funny, and at times violent flick that is a combination of James Bond, Enter the Dragon, Matrix, and NCIS, this is the movie for you! <br/><br/>(I am not sure why NCIS, but there it is!)<br/><br/>Colin Firth and Mark Strong do great as Galahad and Merlin. Jonno Davies plays Lee, the unlikely hero and holds his own along the strong cast. But it is Samuel L. Jackson's nerdy villain with a lisp, Valentine, that makes me chuckle every single time.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fun and easy to follow, although at times a bit to graphic for the lighthearted. The jokes are pretty good too. Listen to the dialogues carefully, you will find a whole bunch of tongue in cheek references and jokes."
"johnbirch-2","10","4","7","3 January 2016"," No middle way - you will love or hate this film
","And I absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>It is VERY violent. A scene in which dozens of people's heads explode to Land of Hope and Glory, with fireworks thrown in was both a high point and pretty typical of the humour involved. If you would find that distasteful then watch something else. Otherwise... its great.<br/><br/>And actually its really not that gory. Yes, people explode, are shot, sliced in half etc. but there is actually very, very little blood - so it is actually fantasy. The violence is cartoon violence. Think Tom & Jerry.<br/><br/>But leave that aside - the story is brilliant. As others have said, this is how James Bond SHOULD be. Gadgets and gizmos, jokes and one- liners, twinkles in the eye, good guys and bad. But it also undermines the type in so many fun ways. <br/><br/>All action, the near two hours flew by. <br/><br/>I was left wanting more - but PLEASE let there be no sequel. No way a second film could be as good as this."
"hounds_star","5","20","55","2 February 2015"," Keep your expectations low ...
","Sadly I found Kingsman was not all it's hyped up to be but it does have some saving grace scenes. There was also a fair bit of fun, plenty of tongue in cheek, some really good action scenes too and only a few holes. The 'violence' never extended beyond being comically gruesome and stayed within its 15 rating limit.<br/><br/>Colin Firth was excellent and apparently performed 80% of his own stunts - which were impressive. <br/><br/>But the overriding thought I am left with is: ""a film like that must surely have had enough in the budget to either cast a decent actor to play the lead role, or else to have paid for Taron Egerton to have had some acting lessons!"" That guy's 'acting' was chronically painful! Get past that, leave any high expectations at home and I think most people would enjoy it."

"CleveMan66","5","13","33","15 February 2015"," ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" features fun over-the-top plot and characters, but disturbing over-the-top violence.
","Defeating the bad guys is very important. So are manners. ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" (R, 2:09) shows us how the two can go hand-inumbrella. Foiling the plans of evil-doers and being a gentleman through it all are two goals to be accomplished at all costs. Buying into that presumption makes for a fun two hours at the movies. Unfortunately, this film also suggests that revered institutions are mostly worthy of our disdain and that human life is cheap and watching many lives end in a short period of time can also be a lot of fun – and even funny. This film is a mixed bag that's hard to review, but I'm willing to give it that old college try.<br/><br/>Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) is a thug. He's in his early 20s, but is leading an aimless life of petty crime in a tough part of London. He's intelligent, resourceful and has moments of selflessness, but is doing nothing constructive with those positive qualities. Instead, he blames his surroundings, his upbringing, his family troubles anything but himself for the way he lives his life. Enter Harry Hart (Colin Firth). Harry is a former colleague of Eggsy's father and seeks to repay a debt of gratitude by rescuing Eggsy from his latest scrape with the law and offering him an opportunity to become a ""gentleman spy"". Harry is actually better known as Galahad, one of a group of modern day knights called the Kingsmen, a secretive spy agency that operates ""at the highest level of discretion"". Eggsy doesn't really have anything else going on, so he agrees to give it a go.<br/><br/>This is all part of a recruitment and selection process reminiscent of Tommy Lee Jones choosing Will Smith to join his group in the original ""Men in Black"". In ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" (based on the 2012-2013 comic book series ""The Secret Service""), Merlin (Mark Strong), the Kingsman who runs the testing and selection process, calls this ""the most dangerous job interview in the world"". Eggsy and several other potential Kingsmen are nearly drowned, forced to jump out of an airplane and then figure out what to do if one of them is without a functioning parachute, plus make very difficult choices designed to test their commitment and loyalty to the organization. As Eggsy's experience on London's mean streets keeps him in the game against his better educated and better bred competitors, he finds that some of his toughest competition comes from the group's sole remaining girl, Roxy (Sophie Cookson). Watching the recruits with great interest from the sidelines is Galahad and the head Kingsman, Arthur (Michael Caine).<br/><br/>The attention of Galahad, Arthur and the others is understandably divided, however. One of their numbers has recently died attempting to rescue a kidnapped university professor (an unrecognizable Mark Hamill – yes, ""Star Wars"" fans, THAT Mark Hamill). And that's only the beginning. Royalty, politicians and miscellaneous celebrities are disappearing all over the world. The man behind all this is billionaire tech magnate Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). But he's not planning to harm these important people whom he's gathering up. He's actually trying to save them. It's the rest of the world that has to worry. With the help of his lethal assistant, Gazelle (Sophia Boutella), a woman with knives for feet, he has a plan to ""fix"" what he considers earth's biggest problem – overpopulation. The hour of his plan's execution is fast approaching and it's all hands on deck as the Kingsmen fight to prevent, what you might as well call Valentine's Day.<br/><br/>Better than 90% of ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a lot of fun, but it's that other 10% that taints the whole thing. Using a tailor shop as a front for an organization of gentlemen spies is clever and is used to maximum effect. The over-the-top take on James Bondian service to queen and country is quite entertaining. The challenges Eggsy and the others have to negotiate in the hopes of becoming a Kingsman are exciting and Valentine's extreme solution to overpopulation makes for a great tongue-in-cheek plot. Jackson is great as a villain with a lisp, a wannabe mass murder who hates killing and can't stand the sight of blood. Egerton is well cast and Firth is convincing as a proper, yet dangerous secret agent who can kick your ass with a beer mug and an umbrella. Caine is always a pleasure to watch and I'm very happy to see more and more of Mark Strong on the big screen.<br/><br/>I liked this movie, but I would have liked it more if it weren't for the excessive violence and institution-bashing. The movie makes out as if the Kingsmen were the ONLY honorable government institution in the world. The story makes a sport out of bashing Christians (albeit very hateful Christians) and makes political leaders all over the world – even President Obama – complicit in Valentine's evil plan. Even more disturbing, extended and vicious fights are shown in gory detail, blood flows, heads explode and many of these scenes are filmed and scored in a whimsical tone. ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" sullies a good story with an unnecessary amount of bile and blood. I'm giving this film a very weak recommendation, but be advised that the extremes to which this movie goes may ruin (or at least greatly diminish) an otherwise mostly entertaining movie for you too.

","I can't help but deliver a positive review for this movie. After all, anyone with a sense of humor and an appreciation for R-rated comical violence would enjoy this. Director Matthew Vaughn - although he has few films to his name - shows his creative side with Kingsman. The story walks a fine, fragile line between controversial levels of violence and dark humor. Although Kingsman reaches its hands into both of these cookie jars, it manages to maintain that balance while preserving the story.<br/><br/>The screenplay is smartly written, and just creative enough to avoid the mundane features of the action genre. By establishing solid character development in several scenes, the audience is kept in the loop, never being conflicted as to whether or not a scene is meant to shock, humor, or please. Perhaps it is the talented casting of Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Mark Strong, and Samuel L. Jackson that makes the ""serious"" scenes serious. There is enough meaningful dialogue between Eggsy and Colin Firth's character that we find a comfortable area with the progression of the story, and are not at the mercy of mindless violence to hold our attention. Nonetheless, Kingsman offers abundant violence that, had creative and fast cinematography not been utilized, would have been nearly unbearable to watch. <br/><br/>Crowd-pleasing, comical violence, and an intriguing premise make this movie a type of cross between any 007 film and Kill Bill. As such, any Quentin Tarantino fan will enjoy this movie for its stylistic scenes of excessive violence. It's not difficult at all to take this movie seriously; it doesn't rely on gore or sex. It's a refreshingly original type of fun, which is something that the action/comedy genre could use more of."

","Gary ""Eggsy"" (Taron Egerton) is a teenager who has no direction in life. His father was part of a secret agency called Kingsman who battle evil undercover. His father was killed when Eggsy was a baby. His fathers mentor Harry (Colin Firth) persuades Eggsy to try out for the Kingsman. Then there's evil Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who has a (pretty stupid) idea for world domination.<br/><br/>This has been a hit with critics and audiences seem to like it. However this directors last film was ""Kick-Ass"" which was OK but got way too violent and vicious in the end. This is no exception. The beginning and middle are not bad. Full of action and energy and some excitement. The violence is restrained but really kicks in at the end. As a rule violence doesn't bother me. However this movie seems to take an unhealthy attitude to it. They seem to LOVE showing people being viciously killed or tortured. It's all speeded up so it's like a Looney Tunes on acid so it isn't too upsetting but after a while it wears you down. It got depressing and uncomfortable. Also the movie is far too long. This doesn't have to run over two hours. Worst of all is Jackson. He's TERRIBLE! His OTT performance wasn't funny or amusing--it was just incredibly annoying. And what was with that lisp? Pretty stupid plot too even for a spy spoof.<br/><br/>On the positive side the rest of the acting was pretty good. Egerton is a likable main character; Firth is always good; Michael Caine is good also in his too few scenes; Mark Strong is fun as Merlin and Sofia Boutella is interesting as Gazelle. So it does have a lot of action, suspense and violence but it's too much and far too cruel."

I'm not personally a huge fan of violence, but it was all cartoon-like enough that it never felt ""traumatizing"" at any point. A lot of other people complain that the movie couldn't decide whether to be serious or comical, but I truly don't see why this is an issue. I think it's that mix that actually made the movie so fun.<br/><br/>So if you're offended by a little ridiculous violence or strongly believe that movies strictly need to fall into binary of serious or comical, then perhaps it's not for you.

You will find yourself thinking, ""I didn't expect her to do that!""<br/><br/>Eggsy is instantly likable protagonist. At first glance he is a misguided teen; but extremely loyal to his friends, little sibling, and mum. It is the loyalty quality and another underdeveloped talent (gymnastics) that make Eggsy an excellent candidate for the Kingsmen. Thanks to the same Kingsmen (Colin Firth) who gave Eggsy's father a chance years earlier, Eggsy jumps at the opportunity to try to become one. The transformation from thug being raised by his 'emotionally lost' mum and her nasty boyfriend to a debonair secret agent is completed through humor, teamwork, trust building, high tech gadgets, and loads of violent choreographed action.

"mhikmetaltug","8","5","10","9 September 2015"," An original and unique spy comedy. Kingsman: The Secret Service Movie Review.
","Kingsman: The Secret Service seemed rubbish American actioned comedy for the first time I decided to watch. Besides the beautiful unique ones I admire my general impressions of the Hollywood made action comedy spy movies triggered my prejudice as usual.Then I have decided to watch it.The same beginning of a spy movie occurred on the screen. An action scene, Special forces, and casualties then a peaceful beginning of a new story with more actions.The situation was simple and similar as usual. But after a while the process of the film plot has begun to show me pleasant surprises with its eclectic context.<br/><br/>The British spy marks of the context may not seem to be the most unique to the audience at the beginning ever since we have experiences on watching dozens of Bond Movies and their pastiche comedy versions. However, the new things I discovered in the script's pastiche parts made me satisfy step by step and natural cause of watching new things, scenes or dialogues attached me to the movie. Of course we can't say that Kingsman is a unique comedy masterpiece but the pastiche and eclectic script writing seemed distinctive even it has mainstream look a like script. And so that I can say I had a good time watching it without any comedy masterpiece expectations. If I say nothing was peculiar I lie.With a clear conscience, I can say that the subject is a classic one but the eclectic scenes with original ideas make the difference.<br/><br/>""Warning These Paragraphs Contain Spoilers"" The idea of depicting an orphan boy having sociological problems from a Slang lout loaded neighborhood, to become a legendary British gentleman spy, through his dead spy father's heritage.The instructor Galahad (Colin Fith) and the spy applicant boy Lee's (Jonno Davies) harmony reach the climax with the 3 rd supporting character Merlin (Mark Strong) who is the reasonable one in spite of the ignorant but genius boy Lee and the real Gentleman Galahad.And besides the harmony of the characters, Arthur's manipulated character and abandoning his agents for becoming one of the most important informant of the cyber organization displayed by a well-chosen actor, Micheal Cane.<br/><br/>According to this slang, type storytelling blended with Royal aspects of the spy agencies, the unique scenes make a place in your mind.Such as the Galahad's bar fight involvement with the slang louts,Massacre in a church scene in the aspect of a gentleman's unconscious attitude,the Kill Bill alike fighting scene of Lee with a crippled woman in a bar Hall, The cyber terrorist image of Samuel L. Jackson that we have never seen him like a cyber villain and the sexual dialogue between a prisoner queen and Lee are the most significant unique components that I still remember.<br/><br/>The result, dosage of the comedy is adjusted well, cheesy fun is less than any kind of its samples and if you look for a good action with a unique humour and if you like British groove I recommend Kingsman: The Secret Service to you to consume for a few times. We have to wait the movie for a while to become a cult but one day it can easily be with its originality."
"bowmanblue","9","5","10","28 August 2015"," A new kind of spy movie
","If you said that 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was like a 'Bond film' then you'd only be partly right. Yes, it's a 'spy movie,' yes you have a 'super villain' trying to basically take over the world and, yes, you have a 'gentleman spy' ready and waiting to stop him. Yet, for all its 'Bond-like' traits, I just can't really liken Kingsman to a Bond movie. It's not better or worse, just a different beast altogether.<br/><br/>It's different because – unlike Bond – it doesn't just concentrate on one area of the spy genre. Our gentleman spy in question is played expertly by Colin Firth and, if the film-makers had chosen to do so, they could have easily concentrated on his efforts to stop our (lisping!) super villain, Samuel L Jackson, from getting away with his dastardly plans. However, like I say, that's only part of the story. Mr Firth, Colin Firth, decides to take on a protégé in the form of a young lad from the rough end of London and train him up in the ways of the Force (in Star Wars terms, anyway). So, not only do we have a spy movie, but with a large helping of teenage coming-of-age thrown in there (oh, and the obligatory teenage romance to satisfy the 'Twilight generation'). Now, if you're already picking up on my distain for twinkling vampires and schoolgirls who don't seem able to smile or close their mouths, then you're probably right. I'm not a fan of teenage love stories and Kingsman could quite easily have fallen down here in my estimation. However, luckily, it's not the case and the 'teenage element' is actually done pretty well and hopefully won't alienate too many of the older generation (like me, for example).<br/><br/>I won't go into too many details about the plot. If you've seen one Bond film (or any other spy movie worth its name) then you'll know. The plot isn't important, only that you know that it's done very well. And, I should mention a special nod to the 'action scenes.' I'm not entirely sure how they're done, but they're damn awesome and stylishly put together.<br/><br/>If you like the slightly tongue-in-cheekness of old 'pre-Daniel Craig' Bond then you should enjoy Kingsman. It has decent performances, stylish action, over-the-top baddies (seriously... a woman with giant razor blades for legs has to be straight out of the Dr No era!) and even a touch of humanity and uplifting character development. A surprise package."

","Was really put off by the reviews of this film but was persuaded to watch it by my grown up children and I am so glad I did!! I loved it! It was tongue in cheek good British humour! I see that a lot of the bad reviews were from the USA which surprised me when you consider the likes of Kill Bill . The violence was almost comic book in this. And the Anal Joke? I've heard worse on the telly! Really am shocked at some of the comments of how shocking and disgusting it was meant to be. Must be our sense of humour. Thank Goodness! I loved all the actors and I love that Samuel.L. Jackson doesn't take himself too seriously. I think in the future I will just find out for myself instead of being put off by negativity. It won't be everyone's cup of tea but ""shockingly violent?"" Not by today's standards by any means."
"Tehmeh","9","5","10","1 September 2015"," James Bond doesn't know crazy
","Kingsman, on the other hand, does.<br/><br/>Action comedies are hard to make right. Although ""action comedy"" doesn't do justice for this movie, nor does the equally vague ""action adventure"", but these kinds of movies rarely nail it. They can be easily failures: either they're unfunny or the action doesn't cut it, or they just simply have no heart in whatever they're trying to do. That is not the case here.<br/><br/>Kingsman: The Secret Service is unexpectedly fresh for a movie that borrows from just about everything. It's outright ridiculous, and you still manage to care about what's happening. No punches are pulled. It's very violent, very funny in refreshing ways and manages to surprise and entertain you in ways that I thought couldn't be possible anymore. I watched some scenes with my mouth open. I couldn't believe what was happening.<br/><br/>How would I describe this movie? Think about James Bond with a fresh sense of fun, silly amounts of amazingly-shot violence, the most ridiculous villain of all time who has a Kill Bill-esque henchwoman, and where you somehow manage to care about some of the characters. It never crosses the line where it becomes either a parody or a serious thriller, it just maximizes the entertainment factor in - it seems - every single scene.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn is one of the best action movie directors around, because he finds many smart little ways to elevate his movies. Jane Goldman is the co-writer, as usual. These two seem to work amazingly well together. They nailed the tone perfectly and almost every moment seems fitting.<br/><br/>Colin Firth is the absolute star of this film. He's every bit as elegant as Bond, even more so. He steals every scene he's in, and to my surprise he delivered the best action scenes of the whole movie too. Amazing job, Colin. Mark Strong and Michael Caine as veteran agents are fine and they elevate any movie they participate in. I can't say a bad thing about anyone else either. Some characters are best left unspoiled - especially Samuel L. Jackson's one. Samantha Womack was very good in a small role, I had to look her up immediately after the movie ended. Overall, the cast was good, and Colin Firth leads the movie like a pro.<br/><br/>I can only imagine how much a PG-13 rating would have hindered this gem. Luckily nothing is watered down and we get the full experience.<br/><br/>If you like action adventure movies, and especially if you think that action movies have become too formulaic, passionless and dull, I will highly recommend Kingsman for you. This movie seems to find fun and excitement in whatever it does. Get some friends to watch it with you, even. I did.<br/><br/>Today, I know what it means to be a true gentleman."

","I'm not for or against this film. I don't get my knickers in a twist over a bit of GCI blood, violence, profanity or the endless clichés. I AM however against the injudicious amount of CGI used in every other shot, & the fact that this film falls apart about half way through. Seriously, you have a bit of realism at the start & it's fairly grounded. But as it goes on it becomes more & more Disney. Until about half way through, right about when a certain character meets his demise, & it just gets reduced to the Hollywood way - Everyone suddenly knows martial art, acrobatics, gymnastics; Slo-Mo to compensate for how slow western audiences are, TERRIBLE lighting, CGI backgrounds, intrusive generic epic music, & the all time high ""Girl power doing round house kicks"" cliché. <br/><br/>Colin Firth has such inimitable demeanour that he is the only one that sells the story. But the kid that takes over? My God he was a chore to watch. <br/><br/>They also try to level the playing field where sex is concerned by having male & female protagonists en-roll for The Secret Service. Another dumb idea seeing that in reality not 1 single woman has worked as a secret agent. This is no doubt taken as discrimination by those as stupid as post feminists, when in reality it is a simple fact that men are more physically dexterous. They soon push her to one side anyway & have the boy get all the screen time. <br/><br/>Samuel Jackson has his moments & is fun to watch but he is non-threatening & you feel sorry for the likable character he builds up. His henchman once again has to be a fit young slender brunette who dodges bullets, never gets scared, shows no emotion, jumps around like a flea on a griddle blah blah blah the usual male-written girl-power tripe. <br/><br/>The ""controversial"" church scene is the best in the movie which is probably why it sticks out. It's brutal, impressively shot, bloody & shows conviction. Which is FAR more than I can say for the rest of the film which goes soft & shows a blatant hesitation of following through. All of a sudden blood is swapped for cheap puffs of coloured smoke copied & pasted in perfect synchronisation in all harmless humour so as to not offend the next lot of screen test reprobates. What a joke. What a mess this film is. <br/><br/>Avoid or watch drunk with the Mrs."

Second the accent is just a bit off putting.This film just seems like a disgrace to the spy film industry. <br/><br/>Yea there were some good parts....but I feel like it just wasn't enough to watch this film a second time.

It was an eye rolling scene. Princesses don't just go around sexing things up. Princesses are royalty.....not trash LMAO. Trashy women offer sex to strangers who save the world.

","Kingsman: Secret Service is a heartfelt parody of Spy Movies, but chiefly ends up a collection of ideas that do not mesh or work well. The cast delivers mixed performances. Colin Firth carries the movie well, and Taron Egerton is refreshing and charismatic in the lead role. However, Samuel L. Jackson is terribly miscast, awkward and misused.<br/><br/>From a technical point of view, the movie suffers from overuse of erratic, frantic editing that gets old and meshes poorly with the script's tone. The movie is chock full of visual effects with standards that range from standard to shoe string budget, although the film had a decent budget of $80 million. The dialogue is often clunky, the movie has pacing problems, and the comedy is low brow yet lacks the energy of (for instance) an Austin Powers movie.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the fight choreography and stunt work is top notch, there is some decent set design and style to the movie, and the story is mostly serviceable.<br/><br/>All told, Kingsman is a movie with heart that unfortunately falls apart due to inept handling of many aspects."

I love action films and the fact that my brother had described it as ""Alex Rider but better"" set my hopes pretty high and I was not disappointed. <br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn is a great director and it is an unspoken rule in my house that if ""Stardust"" is on TV, we must watch it and I also loved ""Kick Ass"". This film had the slight gore of the latter, which is fine by me since I've always watched films like that, and the characters and aspects that don't turn out to be how they look on the surface. In my opinion, the perfect balance has been achieved between comedy, violence, action and even tragedy/seriousness. The actors used are amazing in their parts and it is a star studded cast of Michael Cain, Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson and Mark Strong but I think that Taron Egerton gives an amazing film debut performance.<br/><br/>I've read some reviews where it has been described as ""laddish"" and brash but what else can you expect from a 15 rated spy film based on teenager from South London? In fact, Eggsy's contrast to the typical gentleman spy is what makes this film so good. We need more films that are like this one and push boundaries on the genres that we are used to.<br/><br/>I came out of the cinema desperate to talk about it with my friends but none of them have seen it so I will have to think about how good it is by myself.

","This movie was not very entertaining. I remember being swarmed by its trailer in 2014 and it looked very predictable back then. Young, brash British boy with a checkered past gets drafted into the secret service to become a secret agent, which felt like a very cliché way to start things off.<br/><br/>We follow him through his training along with several other boring recruits and a girl (techniqally two girls but they only had enough personality for half a girl). Somewhere in the movie we learn that Mr. Bland is very good at sleight of hand but Mr. Ballpunt McButtkick isn't fooled. It's a setup for the scene in the movie that I like to refer to as ""James Bond for the mentally challenged"". Without trying to spoil the scene, it (along with the movie) feels like a movie for people with very low attention span, maybe catering to people with ADHD.<br/><br/>The dialogue is somewhat clumsy written and tries to be smarter than it really is. It tries to take itself serious when it should not and it just makes a smelly mess of itself. The delivery is blander than Peter Weller before they made him into the most awesome looking, sounding and acting robot since Optimus Prime, not the stupid new Transformers thank you very much.<br/><br/>Are there no redeeming qualities in this movie? No, but two things make it bearable: The villain and the church fight scene. The villain? It's Samuel L. Jackson and he does his job and he seemed the more interesting than any of the other boring people in the movie. Not only is he fantastic at promoting the fact that he wants everyone to be fat, he's also weird, odd and again, the most entertaining character in this sloth-bucket of clichés. <br/><br/>The church scene is wonderful since so many horrible people are murdered by Glasses Killsalot and they would have deserved it even without Evil Von Fattylove's intervention.<br/><br/>Before you ask yourself ""wasn't Hanna Alström showing her Swedish bum"" yes she was and if you think three seconds of bum on the scene really is a good reason to watch a movie you probably need help making the hard decision in life, such as ""should I go outside without adult supervision today"".<br/><br/>On the subject of Hanna Alström, she was speaking Swedish along with with Scandinavian Prime Minister Bjon Floberg, which was entertaining.<br/><br/>To save you time: don't."

Apparently, that scene was the beginning of a complete insane line of thoughts filling the remainder of the movie with bad special effects - not even funny. Even the script became worse. All lines becoming pathetic one liners - that by no means were funny. Again, ignorant as I am, I thought that an English produced action comedy would at least level ""Johnny English"".

","Full court press with a British action thriller served up with a generous dollop of humor, this very successful film is based on the comic book 'The Secret Service' (writers Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons) and transformed into a screenplay by Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughan – that guy responsible for 'Kick-Ass', X-Men: First Class', 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' 'Layer Cake', 'Stardust'. <br/><br/>For those of us who are not comic book fans or have not heard of the comic book on which this fantastic movie is based, the following is an explanation by Colin Firth's character in the script:' 'Since 1849, Kingsman Tailors have clothed the world's most powerful individuals. In 1919, a great number of them had lost their heirs to World War I. That meant a lot of money going uninherited. And a lot of powerful men with the desire to preserve peace and protect life. Our founders realized that they could channel that wealth and influence for the greater good. And so began our adventure. An independent international intelligence agency operating at the highest level of discretion. Without the politics and bureaucracy that undermine the intelligence of government-run spy organisations. A suit is the modern gentleman's armour. And the Kingsman agents are the new knights.'<br/><br/>And that is only the explanation of the Kingsmen title. The film is blessed with a superb cast. The plot is all over the place and the action speaks louder than ideas of words. It tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. Among the featured actors are Colin Firth as Galahad/Harry Hart, Michael Caine as Arthur, Mark Strong as Merlin, Jack Davenport as Lancelot, unrecognizable Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold, Sofia Boutella as the lower extremity enhance weapon Gazele who assists Samuel L. Jackson as super bad guy Valentine, Jonno Davies as Lee, and the very impressive new face hunk Taron Egerton as Eggsy. Cinematography is by George Richmond, and the musical score is by Henry Jackman, Matthew Margeson with a bow to Sir Edward Elgar.

Harry invites Eggsy to be candidate to the vacancy of a new agent in the agency and he is trained by Agent Merlin (Mark Strong) and competes with other candidates. Meanwhile, the Kingsmen investigate the industrialist Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), who is an insane genius of technology that is plotting a deadly plan with his assistant Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) to save Earth from global warming eliminating most of the population with a chip and saving only those that he has chosen. <br/><br/>""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a funny entertainment with a violent story of a secret service agency in London. The plot is a sort of parody to the James Bond movies in a Quentin Tarantino style. Colin Firth is hilarious but Samuel L. Jackson is annoying with the weird whisper in the way of speaking. There is a funny scene in the credits that shall not be missed. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Kingsman: Serviço Secreto"" (""Kingsman: Secret Service"")"
"just_for_movies","8","8","19","23 February 2015"," A fun movie, but a bit over the top
","Kingsman is the first of many spy movies coming out this year (Mission Impossible, James Bond etc.) and it is pretty awesome. We have Colin Firth playing a smooth gentleman spy/killer and we've got Samuel L. Jackson playing a hilarious, weird villain. I mean, this is enough reason to go see this right?<br/><br/>The story is loosely based on a graphic novel so it's not entirely original, but it is definitely not any Marvel superhero movie. The story and plot are a little different than most movies, but it is still straightforward and fairly easy to understand. It is a really cool concept to; extremely proper, dressed up gentlemen spies/killers going out to stop this maniac of a villain from destroying the world. Speaking of the villain, this guy doesn't always seem like an obvious villain because sometimes you see his point. And he's very funny too; for example how he can't stand the sight of any violence. Kingsman is not only a gory action movie though, it also has plenty of good humor. So basically, the story is very humorous, genius and well paced, while the plot is different but still easy to understand. <br/><br/>In the acting category, this movie strives. Colin Firth is awesome and fits his role perfectly. Samuel L. Jackson is also perfect for his role as the villain; he really brings his character across as a hilarious dude, but also an evil maniac. And the main character is played by newcomer, Taron Egerton. Man is he great. He was funny, but also did some great action stunts. Literally, the casting guys on this movie nailed it. <br/><br/>I loved the music on this movie as well. It had this really great theme, but in between, it also had some great pop music that really fit well with the action scenes. Now this isn't you're usual pop music that comes on the radio 1,000 times per day. No this is just fun lyric-less pop jams that help give the movie a humorous tone. <br/><br/>CGI is another category that was present in this movie. Though a lot was done practically there were some visual effects in here as well. And most of it wasn't bad. But some of it was quite bad. A few of the shots were just so apparent that they were CGI, that it was almost cringe worthy. Other than that, the CGI wasn't bad, but it was far from perfect. <br/><br/>Action was a big part of this movie so I will touch on that a little bit. First of all, it was very fun to watch. It was very stylized, with shaky camera movement and slow-mo. There were also a few shots that vaguely resembled some Matrix camera moves, which I loved. I was very pleased with the action and the way it was shot. That being said, this movie was extremely over the top especially the action. Some of it was unrealistically unrealistic. If that makes sense. But I love over the top action so it was great.<br/><br/>In the end, Kingsman was a fun spy action/comedy with great acting and a cool story. While some of it was not so great, it still delivered what it was supposed to."

","This easily blends the fast-paced and unbelievable action of a comic book film with the absurd, dry British wit of excellent veteran actor Colin Firth. He is Harry Hart code named Galahad, a member of a secret international espionage and intelligence organization called The Kingsman. He recruits Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a young 20 something petty criminal who's the son of a friend that died saving Galahad years before. <br/><br/>Eggsy is competing with other young recruits, most of them young people from British aristocratic families, for the spot to become the new Lancelot. At the same time, tech billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a strange lisp and Yankees hat) is plotting a dastardly world takeover with comic villain aplomb by kidnapping or recruiting wealthy aristocrats, politicians, and other people with spreading around money and influence to further his plot. A large part of that plot is the global distribution of free WiFi-enabled sim cards.<br/><br/>The Kingsman have the unique guise of posing as tailors to Britain and the world's wealthiest and influential people. They operate out of an enormous underground complex based out of an above ground tailor shop. They're independent of normal government oversight and restriction, having operated since the early 20th century shortly after WWI ended. ""We are the new knights,"" is how Galahad explains their mission to Eggsy shortly after his recruitment. <br/><br/>Matthew Vaughan and comic book Mark Millar who previously worked together to bring Kick-Ass and Wanted to the big screen, once again collaborate with even better results than these previous films. This is easily Matthew Vaughan's best film since his British gangster film days. What really makes this film work so seamlessly though is the performance of Colin Firth, he's the perfect gentleman spy and he gives a perfect credibility to the all the gadgets, martial arts and intense action scenes."

","This is a surprising, fun, fast-paced and rollicking movie that introduces us to a hitherto unknown spy agency called the Kingsmen. This film embodies -- no, cherishes -- the over-the-top aspects of the 1970s Bond films, i.e. the handsome lady-killer spy, the British gentleman ethos, the deadly gadgets, the nifty lairs, the colourful villains out to destroy the world with grand plots, and so on. The movie doesn't honour this legacy subtly or logically. It does so overtly, camply and with relish. Let's not forget the mind-blowing violence, which -- although extreme -- is implied cartoonish movie violence and not difficult to watch at all. Sizzling Taron Egerton is perfect, as is Colin Firth. Even overexposed Samuel Jackson is watchable here. I'd rate the movie 8.5. Prepare to have a great time! As Valentine says at the end ""perfect""!"

","To say Matthew Vaughn has had a rather entertaining film career would be a slight understatement. Shooting to the attention of many after producing Guy Ritchie's, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels in 1998, Vaughn has had a directed a wonderful array of films so far, with Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and X-Men: First Class, all being particularly brilliant. Now we have Kingsman: The Secret Service, a film so unavoidable, particularly in my local Vue cinema, where trailers have been hyping it extensively for the past month or so, which in my own experience, is a risky business, with this level of hype more than often leading to a rather high expectation level from cinema goers such as myself. So as I walked into an empty, late- night, EXTREME screening of Kingsman, the bar was set reasonably high, probably more so than any other film so far this year. Mission commence...<br/><br/>First off, the plot is basically Kick-Ass meets the Bond franchise, with a helping of Johnny English. which on paper, sounds pretty damn fun. To sum Kingsman up in one word however, you do not to need to stray far from the film's choice of music; it's completely bonkers, with it's ultra-violent tendencies, including a wonderful Scanners- esque death scene, and ludicrous plot, albeit stealing riffs from 28 Days Later, Stephen King's Cell, and even Channel 4's wonderful Utopia, making it a highly entertaining couple of hours,.Furthermore, it's clear to see the amount of fun everyone involved in the film were having, particularly Colin Firth who makes the most out of playing the suave, smooth and exquisitely dressed Kingsman agent Harry Hart, perhaps making up for his lost opportunity at playing 007 himself*.<br/><br/>Amidst all the fun however, the film does have it's weaknesses. Firstly, it's not as good, or as funny as, Kick-Ass, where comparisons to such are inevitable. In fact, I laughed a lot less than I thought I might, which only results in seeing the flaws within the film much easier, especially in certain scenes when the film is attempting to get a chuckle out of the audience and falls flat on its' face. Secondly, the film is all over the place, and is shot at 100mph, which in an action flick is generally acceptable, yet for some reason, in Kingsman I found it rather annoying, much like I did every Samuel L. Jackson talked (seriously, what was with that strange lisp?). These weaknesses however, are outweighed by the positives, where if for some reason you are looking for a stupid, semi-funny, action spy romp, Kingsman is definitely the film for you. <br/><br/>Part Johnny English, part Kick-Ass, Kingsman is pretty much what it says on the tin. Funny? Sort of. Action-packed? Most definitely. Violent? Unbelievably. Until the next time Mr. Vaughn...<br/><br/>Overall Score: 7/10<br/><br/>* http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/colin- firth-kingsman-the-secret-service-star-on-netflix-bridget-jones-3- and-why-the-james-bond-ship-has-sailed-9991024.html"
"RevRonster","10","8","19","23 January 2015"," So much fun!
","Director Matthew Vaughn delivered with this one and delivered in a big way. Like, this movie needs sequels and ""Can I buy it now on Blu-Ray?"" big way.<br/><br/>The story to ""Kingsman"" is action-packed and never ever lets up on being funny and exciting. The action scenes are incredibly put together and are capable of being amusing and totally badass in the same sequence—not to mention they actually proved that it is possible for Colin Firth to play an action hero. Additionally, the film is incredibly self-aware and wasn't afraid of taking easy shots at itself or the entire spy genre. While not technically a parody, the film is reminiscent of the time when parody meant you could both love and make fun of the genre you were working in—not this stuff now that is just people falling down, getting hit in the nuts, and dated pop references within a scene that kinda/sorta resembles the movie it is trying (and usually failing) to make fun of.<br/><br/>Finally, the film has a truly epic cast of talented actors all performing interesting characters. I had some reservations about Taron Egerton because I never saw him before but he was absolutely fantastic in the film. When you have him, Colin Firth showing he can be a tough guy and the suave spy, Mark Strong perfectly balancing being a badass and a funny guy, Michael Caine being Michael Caine and showing that there isn't a role he can't play, and having Samuel L. Jackson look like he is having the time of his life as the wickedly fun villain Valentine, this film proves to have a cast that works as insanely well as every other aspect of the film.<br/><br/>I have no complaints about this film because I saw nothing that didn't work. Even the film's music never falters as it tosses out a great score that feels like it belongs with the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is capable of using a popular song like the guitar solo to ""Free Bird"" to make movie magic and scenes that are memorable. Everything about this film worked for me and resulted in a film that is action-intoxicating and stupidly hilarious. It will be a sin if this film doesn't become a franchise and get several sequels."
"jackson-regurge","8","8","19","26 January 2015"," An honest action film
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is an excellent piece of modern film work. This movie uses the typical mentor/apprentice formula but puts a modern English twist on it. Although very different from Kick-ass (story wise) Matthew Vaughn does use his personalized style of stylized violence and epic explosive scenes. From watching the film it was very clear that this movie was made by the director of Kick ass. Similarly to Kick ass this movie takes a realistic look at an idea and puts it in a comical action movie which works extremely well.<br/><br/>In general this film is another look on the gentleman spy concept. The film plays with the idea of two people from different backgrounds united to defeat a common foe. Although I was not a fan of the loss of a main character I can see why this was done however I have no idea if this was included in the original comic that this film was based off.<br/><br/>I would rate this film as an eight out of ten because it displays fantastic acting and film work."
"rangeriderrango","1","7","16","16 July 2015"," A waste of time, money, talent and taste
","This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. It mocks so many things I don't know where to begin. Samuel Jackson's imitation of 50 Cent is a good place to start. His sidekick's ode to Oscar Pistorius is another example of bad taste.<br/><br/>It mocks common sense, viewer intelligence, God, the Church, James Bond, good actors, good story telling and the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>I wish I could get back the two hours I wasted watching this piece of crap. The action makes no sense, the violence makes no sense, the whole story makes no sense.

"vinteron666","1","7","16","21 May 2015"," I walked out after the church massacre scene
","The summary line accounts for the only spoiler I'll include with this review.<br/><br/>Rarely have I seen a movie so full of acting potential that ended up being so completely wasted. Colin Firth should be ashamed of himself for ""acting"" in this excuse of a film.<br/><br/>I get the uber-violence genre. It worked in Kick Ass, it worked in The Hills Have Eyes. In this movie, it was just gratuitous and unnecessary. To be honest, it made Kick Ass 2 look like the Sound of Music.<br/><br/>I went to the movie with my wife and two friends. They sat through it; I didn't. About half an hour before it ended, I walked out, found the movie theater's manager, told him some little 5-year old kid was running up and down the isle squealing in delight while people were being butchered on screen and his parents were too busy taking selfies in the front row to notice (no joke, this actually happened - the mother was wearing a burka, so I can't say exactly how the selfies turned out, but they DID use a flash). An usher was immediately dispatched and the family was escorted from the theater. Apparently, they'd been there for 6 hours, slipping in and out of different movies all day.<br/><br/>Now you'd think that THIS was what got me to walk out, but I can assure you, it wasn't. It was the asinine dialog, the poor attempt at acting (a miserable failure, by the way, from some of the great actors of our time) and the unrelenting noise and violence, editing snafus, ridiculous attempt at character development, the complete inability for me to experience suspension of disbelief, the sad attempts at manufactured pathos... they all conspired to make me give up on this film before I lost any more brain cells.<br/><br/>My ticket was refunded by an apologetic manager. I told him it wasn't his fault that the British film industry lost its ability to produce anything that isn't crap. For what it's worth, he agreed.<br/><br/>I know there are a lot of 12 year old reviewers who are going to disagree with my review. But as someone who's been going to the movies once a week for over 40 years, this was hands-down one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen some serious doozies."

","This movie does not disappoint. Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, I mean seriously,how could you not have a good time in the cinemas watching this! The plot,although it had it's flaws,kept you entertained. Also,Taron Egerton delivered a great performance.<br/><br/>The movie is based upon a comic book series,and although it is a comic book based filmed,the action may seem over the top at points. Especially the church scene. Sometimes this ""over the top action"" movies are entertaining to watch,but this movie,in my opinion went to over the top. For instance,as I mentioned before,the church scene. It was not a necessary scene. Sure it was fun to see Colin Firth kick butt,but it didn't need to be as detailed and graphic as it was. But,this scene did not ruin the movie. Samuel L. Jackson played his role perfectly. I promise you,they could not have found a more perfect actor to play this role. He was funny and delivered a great performance. Colin Firth,as always,was great. Taron Egerton always had a great performance. It's always good to see some young good actors with potential. <br/><br/>All in all,this film was a great movie,great action,and great acting.

"ishan-aziz","8","7","16","27 January 2015"," Devastating Fun
","Matthew Vaughn is someone who clearly enjoys his work and you can see that in every inch of Kingsman: The Secret Service. This is a movie where you can see that entertainment and fun was always put ahead of everything else and as one would assume, this resulted in a film that is both entertaining and fun in a way that many action films don't seem to want to be anymore.<br/><br/>One thing that is quite refreshing is how this film never tries to be anything deeper than an action film. Earlier last year I saw The Raid 2 and although that film is far superior to this one it was somewhat irritating when it tried to be a much deeper tale that it was, an element which Kingsman doesn't suffer from. And a predominant chunk of the film's quality comes from how electrifying and ridiculous the film's action sequences are. The camera has incredible pace and Vaughn had the intelligence to maintain single, long, violently energetic shots during the most engrossing action scenes. And it can't be said enough how cool it is to see the cultured and clean Colin Firth beat the sh*t out of people.<br/><br/>What makes the tone of the film so memorable is the constant knowledge that the film really doesn't give a crap about what makes sense or what is reasonable and how much it clearly wants you to know that. Every character in this film it basically a exaggerated caricature and they are all the more hilarious for it. The film embodies how cliché it is and in a way it transcends cliché all together because the audience has the constant knowledge that when something dumb happens, the film is laughing at itself just as much as the audience is.<br/><br/>I have to say I was somewhat irritated when I heard people calling this movie 'original' as I feel that that is not only an insult to actually original films but insulting to this film itself. Because the true genius of the film is how much perspective it gives us on the action genre. Modern action movies seem to be trying far to hard to be edgy and what this film recognises is that it is far more important to be entertaining than different. It builds itself on the best clichés that classic action has given us and cranked up the levels of ridiculousness to the point where you can't help but just smile your way through the film. It is so wonderfully giving and un-self- indulgent to it's audience which is why it is such a joy.<br/><br/>It is a film that is quite hard to criticise seeing as it already seems to be a sort of semi-parody of itself. I did have some problems with some of the characters specifically the female supporting character. When we are first introduced to her they display her as incredibly composed however in later scenes they make her into an incompetent damsel in distress just so that the male lead could act all heroic and comforting (something that seemed out of character for him as well.)<br/><br/>Over all this movie achieves basically everything it set out to do. It's fun and thoroughly worth your time. I would never give it higher than an 8 though because it has no real depth to it at all (which is kind of the point of the movie I guess). Go see it!"

Your average teenager's wet-dream of material accumulation and violence.<br/><br/>I'm sure the 14-year-olds who managed to get in to a 15-rated movie, and maybe even sneak in some alcopops; had the greatest cinematic experience of their underdeveloped lives."
"jb_campo","4","3","5","22 May 2017"," Disappointing, miscast, predictable
","I did not like Kingsman Secret Service for a few reasons. First, they miscast Samuel L Jackson as the lead bad guy Mr Valentine. Second, he overplayed the character to such an outrageous degree that it just got sickening. Michael Caine was also miscast and misused. Need an old English guy who you think is good, or is he? Call Michael Caine who sleepwalked through this cash-grab role. <br/><br/>Colin Firth was OK in his role, and his young apprentice Eggsy (silly name) was OK. Another reason to dislike this - the story was very predictable from start to end. there was no guessing about what was going to happen. Another reason to hate this film was the gore factor. There were so many frivolous blood shots and gore and hatchets and knives. It just went on and on till I just spaced out in disgust.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this flick. I expected a combination of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen with a James Bond flair, or even Sky Captain. But instead this ended up looking like a poor version of the Matrix mixed with the worst Bond film mixed with Commando. It just sucked.<br/><br/>The only bright spot was the lady killer who has a unique way of making her point with adversaries, just like Top Hat used to slice off heads with his bowler hat. Other than that, and mild intrigue, this movie was poor. I cannot believe there is a sequel coming out this summer. Good luck with that - pretty sure the bar will be pretty low based on this first mess of a film. Don't waste your time on this film."

Otherwise for the rest this should be a bit of a disappointment. Some have even tried to compare or 'link' it to James Bond, this has to be the greatest insult to make this comparison.

"MattBirk","8","3","5","17 March 2016"," An Extremely Enjoyable Spy-Thriller!
","Kingsman may just be the most exciting and fun action movie of the year, just like last year's surprise hit, Guardians of the Galaxy. The brilliance of the movie rests in the hands of the writers and their tongue in cheek jokes poking fun at the James Bond franchise, as well as American culture, it's nothing short of amazing. They basically were saying that can do everything the Americans can do (action/over the top fighting), but also while maintaining a high level of sophistication while doing so. <br/><br/>That being said, the action in the movie looked pretty great, lots of fluid/continuous action shots with some nice choreography. Surprisingly, almost all of the great action choreography comes from the Colin Firth's character! And of course like any spy movie out there, there need to be cool gadgets for our heroes, and Kingsman is no different. Everything in this movie is 'cool', from their clothing to their weapons (bulletproof suits, bulletproof umbrellas, grenade lighters), the Kingsman are basically the new James Bond.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie knows exactly what is is trying to do, poke fun at classic spy thrillers while at the same time maintaining a new hip attitude, something today's younger generation would appreciate. And this is not your typical mind-numbing action thriller either, though not terribly original, Kingsman has a certain amount of style and flair to make it something special (that something special might be its political commentary). Kingsman is sure to be one of the best action movies of the year, no question about it!"

If it wasn't for this scene Kingsman could have been a favourite of mine and I am disappointed the joke was even kept in. Some will agree with me on this and others won't. Disregarding this scene, it was absolutely brilliant but the fact that it was there in the first place made me question the whole film but maybe I'm just taking it too seriously."

","The ""violence"" is only the same type of sterilised faux violence that you find in Bond movies but just more of it. It,s very well done and I, personally find gratuitous violence in films so unnecessary, there are so many ways that film-makers can portray violence without actually showing it in graphic detail. A great film, it out bonded Bond by a long way. I don't want to go into the usual over the top orgasmic reviews, some of you should certainly get out more. I cant find much to criticise, the plot of course, is as usual for the genre, totally implausible with more holes than a colander full of colanders, but ..............that is par for the course. Plausible plots in spy films haven't risen their heads since Harry Palmer and too much reality in films is hardly ever good for the box office."

","I am not a huge fan of blockbusters. So maybe I am not the target audience of this movie but I do enjoy them from time to time. But this movie was a huge disappointment and frankly it was one of the worst mainstream movies I have seen in cinemas. Granted I have not seen many movies in cinemas in recent years. It reminded me of another movie which I consider as one of my least favourite movies, Wanted. To be honest, there are many elements of that movie that have been used in this movie and frankly it seemed like a partial remake of that one.<br/><br/>The first problem was maybe Colin firth. I thought he was so incredibly miscast. It seemed awkward to see him do the church fight and the fight with the thugs. He was saying such corny annoying lines which would not seem out of place in one of those Bollywood movies where the hero is all powerful. Even in comparison, those movies at least seem more original. Many of the characters reminded me of many older movies. The same old ""rough kid being trained to fight"" story has been done over and over again. The whole banter between the posh guys and Eggsy is cringeworthy. The lead actor who played the role of Eggsy has zero presence and is pretty much forgettable. He really doesn't have the look for such a role.<br/><br/>I guess also this movie was mostly supposed to be funny. But most of the humor elements fall absolutely flat. What was the point of the head explosions? That was absolutely the worst scene that I have seen in cinemas in recent years. I expected something much more substantial and believable but that really disappointed me. The church fight was also stupid and meaningless. Just meaningless violence but without the beauty of John woo or even movies like the Matrix. The whole movie is so cynically geared to getting a reaction from teenage boys. I am just surprised that there was no eye candy pretty much throughout the movie. Sure there were women but there are no suggestive sexual scenes (maybe that last one in the end). And another thing that I disliked was the use of classic rock music like Freebird. It seemed like an insult to this song to be associated with such tripe.<br/><br/>Now lastly, the presence of Samuel Jackson didn't really elevate the movie much. He does better than the other actors. But as far as I can remember he doesn't really have many memorable lines or scenes in this movie. But I am thankful he is involved in the movie since that made it a little bearable for me and I was able to finish it. There are just too much unbelievable fight scenes and ridiculous things like head explosions (which have been done more realistically by Tom savini in low budget 80s movies), church fights and so on. I know my rating is a little harsh since Samuel jackson is not so bad but I am just rating as far as my personal experience is concerned.<br/><br/>3/10"

He has proved his worth with the ultra-violent 'Kick-Ass', the superior 'X-Men First Class' and now the stylish 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. He is in my eyes one of the most original Directors working today. 'Kingsman' sees him at the top of his game and with the upcoming release of the twenty fourth Bond film later this year, what better time to release this spy parody.<br/><br/>Now, the English have had a poor track record when it comes to spy spoofs. If 'Johnny English' was a guilty pleasure then 'Storm breaker' was definitely a disappointment to say the least. But 'Kingsman' works so well on multiple levels and even the plot is pleasurable.<br/><br/>With the untimely death of two Kingsman agents, the others working in the field must find two suitable replacements. One of the candidates happens to be the son of a Dead agent from a botched mission that took place in 1997. He is Gary Unwin or 'Eggsy' if you are his friend. First time actor Taron Egerton who plays him with edge and conviction, if this is his first role imagine what he could accomplish in the future. The candidates participate in the ""most dangerous job interview"" they will ever get. Eventually Gary takes up the role of a Kingsman agent who is taught their prestigious ways by the smart and very talented Harry Hart played by Colin Firth. Whom still proves that he has got it, even if he is in his mid-fifties. I have heard that the majority of the action scenes he undertook himself and therefore I have to hand it to the man.<br/><br/>Once the agents are assembled they must take down Valentine a villain with a lisp. Samuel L Jackson takes up the role. I would have thought that he would be unable to impress me as he is always able to outshine other major players. But, he proves that he is still one of the most dependable and bankable actors of this generation. Valentine hatches a plot to rid the world of those whom he deems are less than worthy to inhabit it. As he realises that the population is increasing the rate of global warming and must be taken care of. He wishes to carry out this plot through biological warfare with the help of amputee Gazelle whom has razor sharp legs that can pierce human flesh with ease. What follows is one of the best spy films and parodies ever created. This is because every single detail and element is handled with grace.<br/><br/>One of the most important factors for a parody is the laughs. 'Kingsman' always delivers and makes me ever so thankful that the BBFC did not butcher this film and make it a 12A instead of the intended 15 certificate. It would lose half of its essence and almost every gag would land flat. Thankfully they do not and I had to use my arms to keep myself sitting straight and stop from falling face forwards onto the floor. Whether it be when the film takes the mickey out of the James Bond franchise, Valentine struggling with his ever so obvious lisp or the song that the villain plays to commence the end of the world, the film never falters where jokes are concerned.<br/><br/>I will be brief here because with Vaughn behind the camera you know that the cinematography will be dazzling. But, also he is a Director who knows how to orchestrate fight scenes well, which is becoming increasingly rare for action films. One of the techniques that he uses to maximum effect is speeding up and slowing down the action. We get to see reactions more clearly and the full power of a single punch is never wasted. Rest assured the action is photographed spectacularly well and never descends into unwatchable shaky camera.<br/><br/>The whole film maintains a sense of joy that is palpable throughout the two hour run time. The film is a sugar rush of the highest class. For the faint of heart it may be too much to handle; with the majority of characters free loading F bombs in every other sentence, heads exploding like shrapnel (to be honest it does have hundreds of deaths) and jokes about sex. But for others it will be a thrill ride that no other film can replicate or capture.<br/><br/>For all action and spoof fans to miss out on 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' would be sacrilege to your country. Suit up, relax and freak out as Vaughn delivers a high octane, frequently funny and incredibly entertaining treat for teenagers and over around the whole globe. This is a younger, more daring and uncensored Bond for the new generation. If this was to be the next super spy franchise it would be joyous cause for celebration indeed. When it comes to furious action and elating energy, nobody does it better than Vaughn."

","n summary, this movie was rather brilliant, looking back on it, there isn't much i would change. i didn't like the visuals that much in the first scene with the motion graphics, also, this film isn't something you would re-watch soon, it is an action comedy. the movie is quite heavily focused on the comedy, but the action had great choreography, and with this some great and not very commonly seen camera angles for it. what i will say is that sometimes they did feel they were trying a bit hard on the camera movements and editing to hide some things, but it isn't exactly much and it only really happened in one scene, in fact to some it might not be as visible. as for the plot, i think it is an almost original idea, is did follow a secret service kinda style, which follows the James bond theme, but in the movie James bond is referenced, along with in some marketing, and for me, i think it was better than a lot of th recent James bonds, with gadgets and gear, and also putting it a bit on its head, showing some back story behind the main character, what they do in training, and showing what the agency is about. another note i want to make, it did also reference movie clichés and then went against that, it isn't a big note, and to avoid spoilers, i will not say anything. as one final note, i did like how the main character, held his character throughout, and didn't just change character just because oh what he was doing. i did also like the character development that was shown when the main character had to run away before any of his training, he did show off one of the traits that was mentioned about his childhood that he was good at, which in a way reinforced how we see he has hidden potential. near the end of the film, it did show the audience with imagery that it wasn't a movie that was meant to be taken completely serious, but more of as a comedy, which also has action in it. using visual effects and music to draw away some of the seriousness from the film and show it as something else, following this with the final scenes, were more comical than anything else, but while sticking with the style of the movie and looping back to nearer the very start of the movie."
"nzpedals","2","4","8","30 January 2017"," disappointing, stupid and awful
","With all those big name stars, and a topic I like to know about I was looking forward to seeing it all. Not for long though, but I persevered for about 20 minutes, and then saw the last few minutes, and the extra piece on the DVD. Is that enough to be able to comment?<br/><br/>Well, it's longer than I've given some other really big earners! Unless I can see what is happening from very early on, they have a problem in keeping me there. They failed. So, why rate it as HIGH as 2? Coz the special effects are impressive.<br/><br/>Michael Caine looks better than in some other movies. Perhaps age is making him more mellow, and less brash."
"muhammedelgammal_","10","4","8","26 April 2016"," A secret with a twist
","This movie took a different approach on the usual secret service spy related movie, and it definitely paid off. Instead of seeing an experienced spy, it was a much younger group of new recruits who would go through training to become the one of the experienced elite ones. It was cool to see the beginning times for an agent in the secret service.<br/><br/>Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, is one of the young recruits for the Kingsman Secret Service. His father was a former spy for the Kingsman, but he was killed during a mission that went wrong. Eggsy was recruited by his father's partner Harry Hart, played by Colin Firth. Hart felt obligated to look after Eggsy because of his father's death.<br/><br/>The training challenges were pretty intense and demanding. They were fast paced and rapidly built to high suspense. The fighting choreography was extremely innovative by mixing in parkour throughout the scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie surpassed any expectations I had for it based on what was shown in the previews."
"davidshort10","2","4","8","12 January 2016"," Begins well
","Starts well. Attempts to b e homage to the old Bond movies, but goes on far too long and just becomes silly. I only stayed with it because I paid for it. However, it at least shows that Colin Firth is everything that Hugh Grant can never be. It also demonstrated that Samuel L. Jackson must not be rich enough to turn down such nonsense. This must also apply to Michael Caine, even though I do understand why he was cast. The disgusting crudity at the end I presume is the result of one of the creators being married to Jonathan Ross. How can a film include a sequence such as this? I imagine there will be sequels. I will not be watching them."
"jimmydavis-650-769174","1","4","8","3 January 2016"," Embarrassing
","Very glad I didn't waste money on seeing this cringe worthy film at the cinema; it was in parts pathetic, embarrassing and crude. Whatever humour it purports to possess went straight over my head and I consider myself well endowed with a rich, black vein of deadpan running through me. The cgi was very poor; why have such a large amount of it when it's so poor? The younger actors uniformly clichéd and inept. Samuel L needs to call it a day; Colin Firth is a mediocre talent; here he attempts something akin to Patrick McNee and comes up woefully short. Overall, it's a filthy little rag with a fetish feel about it that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Childish muck, avoid."
"AvramSMH","6","4","8","16 October 2015"," Unrealistic, terrible and unfunny
","I had high expectations for this movie and I was disappointed. The first 30 minutes were a bit slow but I was waiting for it to suck me in every minute, sadly it didn't.<br/><br/>The movie is sometimes self-aware of it's ridiculous plot and clichés but that doesn't fix these things. I thought ""ok, this is going to be one of those hilarious caroonish comedies that makes fun of bad spy movies"" but no, it was serious and quite terrible. At first I thought the protagonist was a ripoff of something like Percy Jackson, but the villain was very unrealistic and very ridiculous just like his plot (which looks like an ""evil master plan"" from fart-humor type cartoon for kids). I really don't buy it. There are some comedy attempts in the action sequences that work sometimes, but other times they just look disturbingly disgusting. The style of the action fits this, i guess. Anyways it still looks like a cheap spy comedy that is extremely predictable and the fake tension it is sometimes trying to create just doesn't work."
"yukinokourei","5","4","8","24 September 2015"," Should have been a elegant movie
","Kingsman was a really good film- AT THE START.<br/><br/>The film kicked off with a really good and smooth plot but then everything turned upside down and become non-sense. I sensed no plot in the film after watching it, I may be stunned by the cinematography in the action part but SUPER disappointed by how the film story goes. <br/><br/>It should have been an elegant movie if there's no dialogues with usage of ""F***"", ""B***S***"", ""S***"" and etc. I love how Eggsy's character development turns to be but felt boring because other characters doesn't have much to be talked about-like dummies. <br/><br/>The sky diving act was really AWESOME, falling from the skies and land, the tense is real! <br/><br/>I expected Galahad to appear longer than the film does but meh- he died (sorry for spoilers) In this case, the story was paced and become shorter and the plot started to vanished leaving scenes with non sense actions, I couldn't get what does this film tells about. Seems like that it was ruined even though it have a very good plot (not messy even though it was so cliché)."

"mozgers","9","6","14","7 May 2015"," This is how movies should be
","Before i have seen the full movie i felt a slight childish motive behind it. You know kid spy movie and all. Then i looked at the cast and thought what can go wrong. Nothing went wrong. First of all this movie kinda proves you can do action scenes/movies without exploding everything and anything. Second of all plot of the movie is extremely tasty. It is not like your original bad guy is trying to do evil with evil means. Samuel Jackson's bad guy gives you mixed feelings. It is like you love to hate him or hate to love him kinda situation. Movie shows extremely diplomatic action on hand like dinner table conversations and convincing people are worth more than removing them from the game. My other compliment is for Mark Strong fans. We all seen him as convincing voiced bad guy but Mark Strong keeps rising from that streotype to charming mentor/voice of guiandince all the time. As for action scenes, man i haven't had fun since my early childhood Jackie Chan movie this much. Well coordinated little absurd also you gotta love the songs running on the background. All actors executed their roles superbly even though in some scenes you can feel they are not really into it.<br/><br/>This movie in not a generic spy movie. Yes we get that fancy futuristic toys/tech impossible moves and all but this movie is simply showing us hope. Hope that movie industry can evolve and hope that someday our kids gonna have a tasteful movies to watch"
"Hellmant","9","6","14","4 March 2015"," Fans of Vaughn and Miller won't be disappointed!
","'KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn directs yet another action comic book movie (following 'KICK-ASS' and 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS'), which is again adapted from material written by Mark Millar (the creator of the 'Kick-Ass' comics; as well as other popular titles like 'Wanted', 'Civil War' and 'The Ultimates'). It was written by Vaughn and his usual writing partner Jane Goldman. It stars Colin Firth as a highly skilled secret agent who recruits a street-smart young man into an elite secret agency force. They must do battle with a brilliant billionaire eco-terrorist, played by Samuel L. Jackson. The movie also costars Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Sophie Cookson, Sofia Boutella, Mark Hamill, Jack Davenport and Michael Caine. Fans of Vaughn and Miller won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>The Kingsmen are a special spy organization, in London, that recently lost one of their best agents. They begin a very tough, and highly competitive, recruitment process; to find his replacement. Agent Galahad (Firth) decides to give a young street-smart criminal a chance, named Eggsy (Egerton). Eggsy is the son of an old Kingsmen agent, who was killed on an assignment, with Galahad, in the Middle East; 17 years earlier. Galahad made a promise to help out the deceased agent's family. The agency is also preparing for a dangerous mission; to do battle with a rich tech genius, named Valentine (Jackson), who's threatening to kill millions in an insane population control plan.<br/><br/>The movie is everything I expected it to be; it's full of witty characters, spouting off clever dialogue, in cool and very stylistic action scenes. It's also got a lot of excessive, and very over-the- top, violence and it's even more gory than Vaughn's, and Miller's, own ultra-violent 'KICK-ASS' films (I'd say). Firth is great in the movie and it's also a pretty funny British spy spoof too. The only real flaw (I can see), in the film, is that the main young hero isn't that likable; sure he's relatable, and a believable British punk, but he doesn't have a heck of a lot of character or charm. Firth make's up for what Egerton's character is lacking though and it's still a pretty awesome action flick; as a whole. I'm sure it'll become another beloved cult classic, for Matthew Vaughn and Mark Miller lovers!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/yW1G90SYF_o"

It's exciting, funny, clever, witty and fun as shite. It's a James Bond satire with comic book flair and an overwhelming amount of British hooliganism that made us love flicks like ""Attack the Block."" This movie is near perfect and I can't stress enough how much you'll love a mashing of spy movie, comic book movie, camp movie, Tarantinoishness, zombie movie (hello, church scene) and flat out action.

"raj040492","Null","6","14","28 February 2015"," Entertainer. Period.
","Manners maketh a man. Gentlemen are always in demand in society, the same way gentlemen spy are in demand for action movie lovers. Inspired by 007, this group of people have set an impeccable standard and taste for foiling plots, saving the world and of course, the state-of-the-art......................suits. (You thought I was gonna say gadgets, didn't you. Ya that too.)<br/><br/>First off, let me start with a statutory warning. This genre is not Oscar material nor it is to satisfy everyone's taste bud. If this movie's trailer made you feel weird, it's best if you stay with the Oscar-worthy movies (No offense).<br/><br/>Kingsman:The Secret Service ,as the name goes, is a secret organization (not related to any governments) that does what it does best. When a top agent's guilt makes him recruit a hot-head youngster, things get interesting. Meanwhile evil draws a projectile which brings Kingsman into the play.<br/><br/>The cast has brought a lot of variety into the movie. Colin Firth (yes, the King from King's Speech) pumps the screen with adrenaline, which is actually unlike him, but enjoyable none-the-less. Michael Caine does what he always does. Samuel Jackson is the icing on cake, with his short-tongued English and allergy to the sight of blood (yes, a villain who can't stand blood) is a fun to watch, right till the end.Michael Caine's lack of character usage is felt , not while watching, but while post-morteming it. Mark Strong is another strong presence.<br/><br/>When a middle-eastern-fort starts blowing, the bricks fall down and forms the words of ""20th-century-fox"", it's clear that the movie is all about fun, despite the guns and bloods. The beauty of the movie is that it doesn't try to be something else. It sticks with the fun till the end. <br/><br/>An Ex. Sam Jackson shoots a man and starts walking away because he can't stand blood. He, then asks his assistant. Jackson: Is he dead? Assistant: That's what happens when you shoot someone in the head. Feels good, doesn't it. Jackson : No it's feels f**king awful.<br/><br/>Sarcastic humors is sprinkled all over. A dog with the name J.B (which Michael Caine abbreviates as James Bond, Jason Bourne), an almost direct reference to Obama, sarcasm on Newspapers too (Look out for the paper cutting on the wall with headlines ""Brad Pitt ate my sandwich"").<br/><br/>Bullets, guns, blood dominate the screen which gets gory at times. So, fair warning. <br/><br/>This isn't a ""Wanted"" style action movie nor is it Jackie Chan styled. It's somewhere in the middle but makes a mark of its own.<br/><br/>You are bound to enjoy it."

","The recipe for movie success; Take 1 part Ipcress File, 1 part Austin Powers, a dollop of Bond -- the Pierce Brosnan Bond, and a smidgeon of Charade; then blend, fold, and spindle in equal parts of The Manchurian Candidate and Arabesque. Cook over high heat for 2 1/2 hours, and watch your audiences come back for a second viewing. Make the villain a science fiction, black computer nerd billionaire -- a grown-up Urkel/Blankman if you will -- for the icing on the cake. Kingsman pushes all the right buttons for aficionados of 60s action/spy thrillers with all the up- to-date hilarity of Austin Powers. There's never a dull moment here.<br/><br/>This amazing film moves with the pacing of a Bond flick, and not without good reason. Political correctness spells doom for the Bond franchise as we know it, so this will be a series that can be milked for at least 20 sequels, and I will be sure to watch all of them. Even the product placements were funny. It's OK to laugh out loud at Kingsman."

","29 January 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Kingsman: The Secret Service. This film looked good right from the very first trailer. Very much a James Bond parody but up to date and obviously much younger, the character of Eggsy portrayed in this film is recruited, by a senior Kingsman Agent (Colin Firth) to take the place of a recently deceased colleague. Along with a whole group of other trainee agent Eggsy must battle to prove his worth and become the newest agent. With Samuel L Jackson playing the maniacal baddie, we see a standard good guy, bad guy action movie with quite a few laughs thrown in for good measure. There are some excellent fight scenes and a splendid musical spectacular which completely stole the show. It's refreshing to see a good well written plot combining new gags, up to date technology, reference to established genres and not forgetting Colin Firth in a most splendid British stiff upper lip action role. I hope this is the first of a series of these films. Highly recommended viewing."

Jackson) is planning to take care of the world's ecological problems by severely thinning out the human population.<br/><br/>Unless Spectre (out next week) heralds a major turnaround for the Bond franchise (which I somehow doubt: the awful theme song already has me concerned), Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman will remain as my favourite British spy movie since License to Kill. It's got suave heroes, unbelievable stunt-laden action, natty high-tech gadgets, a megalomaniacal villain with a cool mountain-top lair, a deadly henchwoman with an unusual pair of weapons, and oodles of extreme violence, all delivered at a cracking pace with stunning visual effects by Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn. It also features the best use of Lynyrd Skynrd's Freebird in a movie since The Devil's Rejects (during an incredible fight sequence in a church). A well deserved 9/10."

"Leofwine_draca","6","2","3","12 September 2017"," Warm-hearted action comedy
","KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is very much a kindred spirit to KICK-ASS, doing for the spy genre what KICK-ASS did for comic books. It's a light and breezy affair, a film which never takes itself too seriously, involving British spies battling a megalomaniac bent on world domination. Taron Egerton suffers from being an unlikeably 'street' character for a lot of the running time, and some of the humour is a little crude for my tastes, but otherwise this is a film which hits the ground running with a heady mix of comedy, action, and genre tropes.<br/><br/>The story is ludicrous and a deliberate throwback to '60s cinema. Samuel L. Jackson hams it up a storm as the baddie while it's fun to see Colin Firth playing something other than the slightly stuff romantic figure he always reverts to. Where KINGSMAN excels is in the violent action scenes, which play up brief snippets of outrageousness and feature far better choreography than expected. The church fight is the undoubted highlight, but the large-scale action of the climax is well staged too. CGI is used extensively, but works for the most part. I may not be running out to see the sequel anytime soon, but I'll definitely give it a watch at some point."
"cdjh-81125","9","2","3","7 November 2016"," As Unique As A Spoof Movie Could Be
","I love Spy movies like James Bond, Jason Bourne and Mission Impossible. But those franchises while still amazing don't always manage to retain some of their more sillier aspects that made them so unique but Kingsman The Secret Service is able to be a modern spy/action film that feels like it could be a 1960s spy flick and was on elf my favourite movie of 2015. The cast is the movie ranges from unknowns to veterans but they all bring something to this movie, Taron Edgarton was the perfect lead for this movie not only is he really funny and entertaining but he had a great arc to him that made you love and sympathise with him and made excellent chemistry with Colin Firth who was also Fanta in this movie I loved seeing him to something different, an action heavy and suave spy and he really stole this movie for me. The action sequences are so good in this movie Matthew Vaughn did a really great job at directing this movie, you feel every punch and bullet in every fight scene and the church massacre is without out a doubt this films greatest action set piece. The villains in this movie were really entertaining and perfectly balanced of the Spy leads. Samuel L Jackson was so great in this movie I loved his lisp it made him seem more vulnerable and is again a reference to 1960s spy flicks. But by far a more on the nose reference was his female assistant Gazelle I loved her. The sword legs were a really nice touch that made her all the more bad ass. The training sequence of this film is a great way to set up this world of the Kingsman, I loved seeing Eggsy over come obstacles and put up with the spoilt rich kids. I really liked the character of Roxy in this film I thought she had really good chemistry with Eggsy and I really hope that they'll explore their relationship more in the upcoming sequel. The overall plan that Samuel L Jacksons character has is completely far fetched but works for this films more comical and silly tone and made for an excellent final battle. <br/><br/>Kingsman The Secret Service perfectly blended modern aspects and older throw backs and was great way to kick of a potentially great new action franchise. <br/><br/>94%/A"

","Overall: A fun, action packed movie with the best villain is ages<br/><br/>Good: The gadgets are awesome and the action is phenomenal. Samuel Jackson has the standout performance and his lisp makes his character. Music was decent and the super weapon was unique and creative + it's not a beam in the sky. The acting was good all around for the most part. There are short bursts of humour which do nice to break up the movie but more could have been focused on it.<br/><br/>Bad: All the Kimgsman characters are unlikeable bar two (First Galahad and the Scottish one). I kind of rooted for the villains but that might just be Samuel Jackson's lisp. Some scenes also feel pointless and tacked on.<br/><br/>Best Part: The fight scene inside the church was incredible and you can tell how much work was put into it.<br/><br/>8/10"

I watched it the first time and to be fair was half watching it just not really engaged. So couple of years later here I am watching it again with a more open mind and second time round I loved it. My advice is to ignore the reviews and watch it and don't take it too seriously and like I say you will either enjoy it or just switch it off far to soon. No film can ever be that bad when KC and the Sunshines brilliant song Give it up is on the soundtrack can it. Thought the fight scene in the church was spectacular!! I gave it an 8 but could easily have got higher."

","When I saw Kingsman for the first time I was surprised because I liked it a lot despite the fact that this is an action and spy movie, and let's say that the films of that genre are not very good, surprisingly this is the exception, the movie you make it clear with the first scene that this is going to have its own level of realism, which will be built through the film moving forward, to this I mean we see a ""serious"" scene about agents who want to interrogate a terrorist , but you understand that it will not be completely serious because of the way in which the credits are introduced, then they give us a good introduction of characters where you understand who is who, which is good since many films do not take the time to know to his characters, but what I really want to talk about and most surprised me was the villain, apart from the fact that this is played by Samuel L. Jackson, this unlike many villains, if he has personality, do not have ne no time to spare on the screen, his motives are justifiable, simply if you see it from another point of view his plan was not so malicious, this was to eliminate part of humanity to start again and save us from extinction, what really bad in this was that he chose those who were going to be saved and let's say that's not very fair, but hey, the point is that he's a very good villain, and without a doubt the violence is just great, I mean is creative, I say, When we have seen in a movie a scene like that of the church?
The film is well executed in the sense that it explains you something, but without wasting time, and something that I really like is Egsy is not the typical annoying character who wants to be good if because, or who wants to defeat the villain with all his strength to Although these are not even found, the film also has personal moments for the protagonists, for example we see how the relationship between father and son between Harry and Egsy is strengthened through the progress of the film, something that was very brave on the part of the movie is to have killed Harry at the moment, I say at the moment because we already know that in the two he is alive and blah, blah, blah, the point is that for us we were dead in that movie, it was something that I grab you without you see it coming, because it is not very common that in today's movies they kill one of the protagonists of the way in which this movie did it, which is another success for the film since this serves as inspiration to Eg s and to return to become a Kingsman and want to defeat Valentine, but as good as this movie is, it is not perfect, I say through which the movie progresses the characters have technological objects that are suitable for the plot, or that no matter how much training they put Eggsy in their preparation to become a Kingsman, we never really saw them teach him how to fight, I say that the movie has mistakes but this does not mean that it is all the good it has.
In conclusion Kingsman is a creative, funny movie, with good characters, an unusual villain, great action scenes, with one or another mistake, that is why this movie earns its good merely 8/10."

"eliwyse","10","1","1","27 October 2018"," One of my all time favorites
","The movie Kingsman: The Secret Service is a wonderful film that released in 2014. Directed by Matthew Vaughn, the first instalment of this movie franchise shows the life of a young Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton) who goes from a loser in the streets, into a top notch secret agent who saves the world. The movie also features Colin Firth as Harry Hart, who is one of secret service members known as Agent Galahad. Firth does an excellent job in his role, and the viewer really gets attached to his character. The film does a great job of introducing itself to the viewer and makes it clear what is going on. The viewer knows what the agency is all about, and it even gives some insight on how the organization was founded in a way that makes it seem like it could be possible to exist in our world today. Kingsman is also a great comedy, with some of the jokes being directed towards other movies. At one point in the film, the James Bond film franchise is mentioned and made fun of for having using generic spy plot line in all its movies. The film also states in its own dialog that ""This ain't that kind of movie"" when referring to the generic spy film one would expect. Kingsman: The Secret Service is truly a wonderful movie that can shock someone with a big surprise, fill them with laughter, and put them at the edge of their seat as the movie gets closer to its big finale. I find myself going back to it now and then to watch the fantastic film again."

","Kingsman is an entertaining and fun movie. The pace of the film is upbeat and exciting, while the action scenes are an extravaganza of over-the-top, but very enjoyable, choreography. <br/><br/>Kingsman: The Secret Service follows a young man, nicknamed Eggsy, who begins the story as a delinquent. Invited into a society of spies, Eggsy undergoes intense training and begins to develop discipline and confidence. Under the tutelage of Hart, his spy mentor, Eggsy becomes a formidable agent and is eventually faced with a Bond-style supervillain.<br/><br/>The Eggsy character undergoes a transformative journey that most movie-goers have seen in endless iterations in many different stories. The story begins with a less-than-ideal hero and this hero eventually undergoes a journey that addresses inner turmoil and emerges as a better person. How the film tells this story, however, is what makes the film enjoyable.<br/><br/>While the action scenes are the best part of the movie, they can also be downright goofy at times, with people getting cut clean in half or flipping through the air like a rag doll after getting hit. There are also far too many McDonald product placements in the film. The movie also suffers from somewhat generic features, such as; generic premise, plot, and character motivations.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, Kingsman is still an entertaining film. The casting and acting are great, the writing is good, and the pacing is fine. This movie is worth watching based on the spectacular action scenes alone."

","Eggsy, a young-looking boy that lives in the suburbs, gets in trouble and, after getting bailed out of prison by a mysterious man, he's offered the chance to become a kingsman. <br/><br/>Since this movie came out, it has become one of my favourite movies of all time. It's really easy to follow, the characters are charming in their own way and the dialogue is witty. Not to talk about the action scenes. As a society, we have been exposed to so many action scenes and violence, that not much surprises us, but the way this movie portrays that action is just mind-blowingly good (and quite funny sometimes).<br/><br/>It's always a delight to watch anything by Colin Firth, but Taron Egerton (Eggsy) was truly fit to play that character. There's a lot of character development for Eggsy in just one movie, and even when the movie is about fighting, the development doesn't feel rushed because the writers devote part of the movie just so we can see how Eggsy struggles to become the man he should be to represent Kingsman. It's a breath of fresh air to see characters properly developed in an action movie. That's why I like this movie so much, because it's not just mindless violence. <br/><br/>Cheers to the writers. Fantastic job."
"adam-may-bower","8","1","1","2 June 2018"," Stylish and Widely Entertaining
","'Kingsman: The Secret Service' may have a clichéd and unoriginal plot, but it is excused to it's stylish and entertaining approach and talented cast. This film may have paid homage to spy films such as the well-known-and-loved Bond series, but it's too smart to be considered a parody, but also too silly and ridiculously clichéd to be considered a serious film. However, this ultimately is excused by the fact that this movie is just so cool! With extremely stylish action sequences, memorable characters portrayed by great actors and hilarious humor, this film is a highly enjoyable watch that will leave its audience in awe. The action in this film is so over-the-top and stylised that it results in being some of the best action sequences I've seen in film for a long time. But the reason this movie is so great is all due to it's cast - Taron Egerton is fantastic as the lead role of Eggsy, but we all know that it was Colin Firth who stole the show. He effortless nails his role, and is essentially the main reason this film is as great as it is. Overall this movie is one of the most entertaining and rewatchable films of 2014 due to its highly talented cast and stylistic approach."
"johnnyboyz","6","1","1","4 April 2018"," I'm not convinced this is as good as it THINKS it is, but there is enough to admire to give it a go.
","You come away from ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" a little breathless, but more-so down to its bounding energy and sheer brashness than because you feel you have just seen a great film. For sure, the film is a colourful, kinetic experience; a series of brutal body blows which pulls you left; right and centre - across genres and through homages, but that did not stop me from feeling pleased that it was all over when it was. <br/><br/>In spite of whatever ""Kingsman"" does well - the good choreography; the want to see the characters make it through their odds; the amusing villain - there is an annoying feeling of puerility to the film, or of immaturity. When Matthew Vaughn released ""Kick-Ass"" in 2010, the cover of a popular British film magazine depicted one of the characters in full superhero garb and the headline 'Say Hello to Your New Favourite Film', and there is that same aggravating, even adolescent, sense with ""Kingsman"". It is difficult to put into words, but I am sure you know what I mean - the film is far from being your typical brain-dead blockbuster, and one cannot fault its ambition, but it lacks a certain nuance or sense of subtlety. <br/><br/>The film tells the double-stranded tale of a young London lad getting out of one world and into another alongside a suave veteran of espionage who senses his time is coming to an end as comrades die around him and world threats seem to intensify. Colin Firth plays said veteran: a secret agent by the name of Harry Hart, who operates as Galahad in an all-action British governmental group running in covert operations - try to imagine James Bond's 'Double O' section on steroids. <br/><br/>Parallel to him is the story of Taron Egerton's character Gary, colloquially referred to as 'Eggsy', whose father was part of the same eponymous secret service group Galahad is in until he was killed in action some twenty years ago. Raised fatherless, both he and his mother have since fallen on harder times and Gary, now in his early twenties, finds himself occupying a flat in a seedy part of London whilst periodically falling out with his mother's sociopathic new boyfriend and dodging potentially fatal gang warfare. <br/><br/>Gary and Galahad's worlds collide when the latter loses yet another agent during a mission in snowy Argentina, wherein a scientist specialising in global warming has been kidnapped and a rescue attempt is botched. Galahad's boss, played by Michael Caine, is losing patience: this particular agent, discovered and groomed by Galahad himself, did not live up to expectations. Gary, meanwhile, is living on even less borrowed time and comes into contact with Firth's character through some relatively convoluted means in order to begin, in true ""Men in Black"" style, his inception into the universe of this elite secret agency.<br/><br/>Providing energy to the piece is Samuel L. Jackson's wonderful villain Richmond Valentine; a politician hating eco-terrorist with a speech impediment who has made his name operating in the technology industry and flinches at the sight of blood. He has his henchwoman, Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), take care of the more murderous side of being a super villain - think a more nubile version of Richard Kiel's Jaws character, but with legs and feet replacing teeth... <br/><br/>We have seen films like ""Kingsman"" before, and we have previously enjoyed narratives similar to what is depicted therein, but Vaughn is canny enough to construct the experience in such a way that has us feel like this is our first time. The film is not manipulative in this respect, but it is brash. As was the case with ""Kick-Ass"", it takes absolutely no interest in whether or not it is offending you or even wearing you down - like it or not, this is the route it's taking. Through whatever means, the film manages to balance both revisionism and convention into a congealed, post-modernist package. <br/><br/>The way the film eventually comes to fuse the execution of a dastardly plan Valentine is hatching; Gary undergoing his training and the Kingsman agency uncovering a series of strange occurrences around the world of army militias conspicuously turning on themselves is satisfying. Midway through, Vaughn plummets us headfirst into a steadycam sequence of one of these militias fighting one another in what is a quite striking scene outlining in equal measure both precisely what is at stake should our heroes fail and that the makers of the film have an eye for raw flair and constructive carnage. <br/><br/>Despite being an incredibly striking film, this sequence to one side, I am unsure as to whether ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" amounts to much more than a well-made actioner with a familiar tale of a farmhand leaving behind his domestic set-up for world-saving greatness. It deals, mostly, in stereotypes: the fascist American southerners; the suave Westminster Londoner; the Scandinavian blonde and the Millwall Football Club yobs. Meanwhile, you get the feeling there was meant to be a message embedded in the film somewhere to do with the danger of phone/tablet technology, and what it is turning people into, but it gets a little lost. <br/><br/>Irrespective, there is enough in ""Kingsman"" to recommend it - it executes what it wants to do with a certain unbridled brazenness and does what it wants with a level of enthusiasm where many other action films too often feel like they are going through the motions. This is not the case here."
"letande","7","1","1","30 March 2018"," A bit dirty, but way better than the original comic.
","Ah, The Secret Service... Yet another overrated comic by Mark Millar. Like many of his other works, this one wasn't even fresh enough. It was bunch of the old ideas mixed together with the poor writing. Artwork wasn't that bad, but nah, I never really liked The Secret Service. It was dumb and boring story about how young kid with no future met his uncle, who was a James Bond of sorts. Uncle introduces him to the world of secret service and kid's doing great just because he played enough Call of Duty. Yep, it was that bad. So, when they've announced the movie adaptation, I thought it'll be yet another failure. Like, you know. Like Kick-Ass. But guess what? It was totally different story.<br/><br/>The thing is - movie makers took the best part from the original comic and fixed everything that was wrong with it. The best thing about The Secret Service was that Cinderella concept. The idea of how poor guy with no future can become both secret agent and gentleman. It wasn't really a fresh idea, so, it wasn't enough to save the comic, but this movie sure makes it shine. Really good design and costumes, everybody's favorite gentleman Colin Firth, fantastic soundtrack by Henry Jackman & Matthew Margeson (one of those that'll stay with you forever, like Terminator, or Tim Burton's Batman themes)... The movie just nailed. As for what was fixed... well, the story. The story was fixed. Because there's no way to become good with guns while playing Call of Duty. Obviously. So, now we have proper training and other special agent stuff.<br/><br/>Can't say that the story is very good, though. It's actually pretty generic. Thankfully, small details and memorable quotes help a lot. Movie makers also understood that it was bad idea to make it to much like James Bond. So, they came with the idea to make it a little bit... dirty. Well, more than a bit, actually. While being old school, I totally hated some scenes here, while the others were way too controversial (like the one in a church). But dirty jokes and controversial stuff is pretty much what makes this movie different from typical spy movies, so... like it, or not, it can't be different.<br/><br/>So... yeah. It's dirty, it's totally controversial, but... it's better than the original comic. Way, WAY better. The story may still be a bit generic, but at least it isn't as poor as in the comic and music, costumes, actors and other things sure help a lot. If dirty jokes are your thing, then it's your movie. But the best thing about Kingsman is that it can provide a lot of things aside from those. Unlike the comic, you won't forget this one after you'll finish with it. And that's more than you can actually ask from most of the modern movies."
"CriticalOfEverything","8","1","1","23 March 2018"," Funny, badass, and above all, fun.
","I love this movie a lot. It's honestly the most underrated movie of all time for me. Quite a few people don't like it because it's extremely violent but it has an R rating for a reason. Vaughn's style of action scenes work so well for this movie. They're chaotic, have unique camera angles and movements that focus on what's most important in a scene and they don't just use the whole one punch changes to a different shot that Hollywood loves so much which makes it very refreshing. It's a very, well, ""British movie"" with British humour and slang that I'm surprised most Americans can understand. The soundtrack is incredible as well, Manners Maketh Man might be my favourite track. The movie can get a little silly at times but it's a comic book movie so I can't really nag it for that. The movie clearly isn't meant to be taken seriously and I like that. It's refreshing to have a movie for once that is made to be fun and not just action with dark settings and occasional humour. Highly recommend this. Too bad the sequel is an absolute mess."
"kcc-59514","10","1","1","9 March 2018"," A Really Silly Movie Worth Watching Again
","""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" was produced in 2014 in the United Kingdom, and is a movie roughly based on the hit series of the famous movie spy, James Bond. The Kingsman functions much like MI6, except they have the highest level of clearence in the world, giving them the ultimate control in security and survalliance. There are two movies in the series, and I will write about the first one, ""The Secret Service."" The main plot is that one of the main agents for kingsman, Harry, is looking for a new recruit to undergo traiyning and become a new kingsman agent. He stumbles across a young man named Eggsy, who was a free sprit constantly getting into trouble with the law, and selects him as his choice to put through training with other students that other agents have selected. They go through many difficult trails, testing their ability to think outside the box and work together as well as testing their bravery. In the final test, Eggsy and another finalist, Roxy, were forced to shoot a dog that they had been given in the beginning of the test, and had trained and built a bond with. Eggsy couldn't do it, but roxy did and became an agent. After their test, they both found out that their guns were loaded with blanks. All the while, the main super villain of the movie, Vallentine, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, had a notorious scheme to install SIM cards that could control peoples minds. He did this by giving his SIM cards out for free, and gave everyone free internet connection. He eventually gathered his friends and world leaders to participate in his plot to destroy the world of everyone but them so they could create a new world order, and control the world together. His SIM cards could control people to kill each other. After finding out about this plot, the kingsman decided that they would stop Valentine from carrying out his plot, and infiltrated his headquarters to sneak in and try to kill him. Rosy would be sent up in a weather balloon to shoot a missile at Valentines satellite to stop the SIM Valentine realized that someone in his party would try to kill him. They were all trying to avenge for Harry's death, as he went to a white supremacist church to try and get to Valentine, but was shot in the head by valentine after his SIM card in his phone caused him to kill everyone in the church. Eggsy finally killed Valentine after a long battle, and made the heads of all of valentines party to explode. When scrolling through the user reviews on IMDb for the movie Kingsman, there are a plethora of low rating negative reviews. The negative reviews all had a few common points which ruined the movie for them. They say that there is too much violence, with masses of people being killed without much thought, and filmed in a way to garner laughter and appreciation. One reviewer even said that they took their entire family to watch it, and were traumatized by it. My question is: why would a mother bring her entire family to watch a rated R British spy movie? This genre of movie is basically all about the spying, training, and killing of enemies. It is not for everyone, but it does nothing wrong and more than fufills the expectations of this genre of movie. I feel that this movie is worth watching because it is really funny, and has a really good story that makes you feel connected with the characters and the plot. If you enjoy a spy theme like James Bond, then you will really enjoy this movie. This movie is rated R, with a lot of explicit language, gruesome killing scenes, and some partial nudity at the end which you will want to shield your eyes from. Even though the story line seems quite shallow, boring, and predictable, the producers have added so many different details and graphics that make the whole movie really funny and memorable. What other movie has criminals' heads exploding in rainbow clouds and secret agents in immaculate suits? This movie is worth the hype, and I thoroughly recommend watching it."
"Yidman82","6","1","1","2 March 2018"," Very Entertaining.
","I've never read the comics and I was never a fan of Colin Firth, but Kingsman isn't bad at all. An awful lot of people in the reviews that I've read are comparing this to Bond. In my opinion you can't compare them, they're to different . The film has plenty of action, great fight scenes,Firth is excellent. The story does start to fall apart a bit around the last half hour of the movie , it was like the script writers tried to inject a lot of humour and they ended up overdoing it. The main villain I thought was weak,and the movie does suffer to an extent for these reasons. Still, kingsman is enjoyable if you don't mind over the top action, and if you just take it for what it is, you'll like it."

 Could have Eggsy's part been better played by anyone else, may well have... Samuel L Jackson as a comic villain just about does an okay job. Initial fight scenes were classy, a touch of Tarantino I find there, the church scene was great, but the action sequences towards the end by Eggsy were more video-gamish, the CGI was pretty bad there. Overall still a treat to the eyes, I go with a 7/10, thoroughly entertained..."
"gavinp9","8","1","1","2 January 2018"," Very fun action comedy
","'Kingsman' is fun - it's a modern take on action/adventure save-the-world films and while it pays homage to the Bond films, it isn't a direct knock-off of them. The director Vaughn also ""rebooted"" superhero films recently ('X-Men: First Class' & 'Kick Ass') and is helped ably by this film being based on another Mark Millar (Wanted, Kick Ass, Secret Service) graphic novel, which means you're guaranteed excessive violence and unexpected plot twists. I hope they keep turning his graphic novels into films!<br/><br/>Like any good spy movie, it starts with a ridiculous 'evil genius' - Valentine (Jackson, with a hilarious lisp & wardrobe) - plan: use a neurotransmitter to make people homicidally violent and wipe out the majority of the human race to save the planet from climate change. Then comes the secret spy agency that no government even knows about - the Kingsmen, led by Arthur (Caine). Their top agent Galahad/Harry (Firth, great to see him playing against type) who recruits Eggsy (newcomer Egerton) and we get to see him go through trials until he becomes a ""gentleman Kingsman"". Some very nice suits, gadgetry and locations are used to impress that ""manners maketh the man"". <br/><br/>There are quite a few differences between the film and the graphic novel, but they don't detract from what is a simple, well-made, fast-paced action film, with plenty of wit and comedy thrown in for good measure. All the actors are great and Jackson seems to relish being the crazy villain. I hope there's sequels to follow! The 'fireworks' scene at the end is exceptional & hilarious. Also - only nine months until we get to see Mark Hamill again!"
"deloudelouvain","8","1","1","14 December 2017"," Better than any James Bond movie if you ask me
","After watching Kingsman: The Secret Service I was very surprised I never heard about this movie before. When a James Bond movie comes out you can't see enough commercials about it. That this movie is inspired on the James Bond stories there is no doubt about that. But to me the difference with the OO7 movies and Kingsman is that Kingsman is just better. I really enjoyed this movie even though it was a quite long movie. There are no boring moments, there are plenty of well done action scenes, the special effects make it all look real, and the special spy gadgets are ingenious. I thought Kingsman was better than a James Bond because of the dialogues, the story, and the acting. While in any James Bond movie you always have moments that you think it's way over the top and that it's obvious OO7 will easily win the battle with Kingsman I didn't have that feeling. And while in a James Bond movie they explicitely look at their language in Kingsman it's all a bit rougher and closer to daily life. Colin Firth is always good to watch but also Taron Egerton that plays Eggsy, one of the main characters. I still can't believe I only watched this movie three year after it came out. I just saw there was another one and that will be the next movie I will watch."

","Kingsman: The Secret Service is the next awesome spy movie that is very alike to the James Bond movies, but in a action/comedy humor way. I was very amazed by how the cast was made to have the actors portray the characters they were casted as in the movie. Honestly,Taron Egerton did an outstanding job portraying his character Eggsy Unwin (who is a teenage boy from the streets to the agency of Kingsman) and he learns the way of Kingsman from his mentor Harry Hart (Colin Firth). Eggsy and Harry come along very well in this movie. As well as seeing Samuel L. Jackson portray as a bad guy which his name is Valentine, I was in wow by how well Samuel L. Jackson did in portraying this certain villain throughout the movie. This was my very first time seeing Samuel playing a bad guy. Overall, I enjoyed Kingsman: The Secret Service and my favorite quote from this movie is ""Manners Maketh Man"". This is a one-of-a-kind spy movie that makes me want to watch all over and over again. It's a fun, action-packed thrill ride that everyone will enjoy."
"paulriv","7","1","1","2 December 2017"," Good Brit fun action movie
","This is a fun Brit movie. Doesn't take it self too seriously for an espionage movie. The Kingsman organization is a very old secret service and we follow a new recruit as he tries to make the grade with Colin Firth as his bad ass mentor who provides lots of kill thrills. Samuel Jackson is the worst villain in movie history. His lisp and sideways baseball cap is totally ridiculous and he is totally not believable in his roll as the evil anti-hero. And there is no explanation why an American black man is in this British film to begin with. The only explanation that I can think of is it is only to satisfy the film industry's liberal diversity quota. Would have enjoyed it more had they not chosen that path. If Samuel Jackson is in the sequel I probably won't be interested to in watching it. Not because of Samuel Jackson, who is a fine actor, but because he sucks at being a villain and I'm not into racial diversity quotas in movies."

","I've only just watched this graphic book adaption, and the first thing you notice when you come on this site is the large gap between the general viewers' rating (a very high 7.7) against the metracritic rating (a lowly 6). I can't think of any other film off the top of my head which as polarising, but I side fully with the critics on this one.<br/><br/>I'd already read the graphic novel many years back, and wasn't a fan but still believed it could make a fun film. This film takes the humour, and is basically spy film in the Kick-Ass mould, but it doesn't work for me. I just couldn't find myself interested in the characters, albeit excepting the two acted by Colin Firth and Sofia Boutella, and if anything it was too much of a parody.<br/><br/>It's a fine line when you make a parody to go too far and lose interest, and that for me happens here. There's cliché and so on, but the worst part is Samuel L Jackson as the villain, who really has his worst performance and role I've yet seen from him, didn't even need to make an effort.<br/><br/>The action scenes are excellent, I'll give them that, and like Kick-Ass they are very violent. That's the only interesting point for me.<br/><br/>I'll leave it at that. Maybe worth watching if on the TV on a Saturday or Sunday night, otherwise give a miss. Some will really enjoy it, but I wasn't one of them. It's possible like many others, I'm now just tired of the comic book genre."

","How do you parody something that already parodies itself? James Bond boasts 23 cannon films. 25 if you include David Niven's Casino Royale (1967) and Sean Connery's remake of Thunderball (1965), Never Say Never Again (1983). Those who venture to see the whole series will no doubt understand just how far-fetched and outlandish the world of James Bond is. Crazy megalomaniacal villains, convenient gadgets, patronizing (at best) treatment of women; Maybe Daniel Craig's severe take as 007 has made audiences forget just how silly the series got.<br/><br/>Kingman: The Secret Service is the story of a British hood named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who is given the chance to prove his mettle as a member of an elite secret service organization. Colin Firth plays his mentor (code name: Galahad) because years ago his father saved his life during a mission. While Eggsy is in training an eccentric tech billionaire (Samuel L. Jackson) is in the final stages of his nefarious plan to stop global warming. Can the Kingmen stop him before he submerges the world in chaos?<br/><br/>Critics are calling this movie a cheeky send up of the spy film genre. ""Stylish, subversive and above all fun..."" says the rottentomatoes.com banner over a 74% critic score. I must have missed something. Stylish? I suppose if you think the interiors of an old-timey tailor shop mixed with the interiors of Professor Xavier's School for mutants is stylish. Subversive? Does this movie subvert conventions? No it embraces them. Fun? Well, if your definition of fun is a church full of innocent people getting slaughtered while ""Free Bird"" plays in the background.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying that gratuitous amounts of violence can't be fun. Who can't see a movie like Shoot'Em Up (2007) without a sense of awe an infectious giggling. But in that movie there was a premium on innocence. Those not directly related to the plot were omitted from the bloodletting and the one innocent in the film (the baby) was the one thing Clive Owen was protecting. The point driven home in Kingmen is there is no innocence. By virtue of being alive (and living in London, Rio or Kentucky) you're a participant in the villains endgame and an ""entertaining"" pawn in the story.<br/><br/>But hey, the good guys succeed in the end right? Well they do but the villain convinced nearly every head of state to go with his plan so realistically the world would still descend into chaos anyway. And what of our heroes? An organization that is old-money-rich, white, and British with one co-opted hood laying the kill stroke. Meanwhile the conspiracy they stop is diverse, largely new money and Samuel L. himself is black and if the medallion around his neck is to be believed, Muslim. His ultimate goal: stop global warming. Well if that's not a plot dreamed up by the editorial board of The Daily Mail I don't know what could be.<br/><br/>Each scene that doesn't involve gratuitous violence is rushed at the expense of the actors humanizing their characters. Firth sits in an office full of Sun headlines and explains that each headline represents a day he accomplished a mission for the Kingmen and the world never noticed. Egerton leaves his mother's house by taking a moment to comfort his little baby sister. These are moments that could have shown emotional resonance but were undermined by the villain making an appearance and Egerton escaping baddies with parkour respectively. Why get to know the characters at all when we could briskly move onto the next martial-arts set piece.<br/><br/>All in all, Kingman is an overloaded male fantasy with a fatalistic view of human behavior and an insultingly out of touch, Anglos- know- best mentality. The action, while occasionally cool to look at, can't hide its hatred filled heart and its attempts at parody are at the very most half-assured. Yet despite all this, I'm taken aback by the movie's critical success and the formation of a cult following. What is society coming to when we celebrate the demise of hundreds with computer chips in their neck and laugh at the potential deaths of billions who only wanted free cellphone service.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

"artlife18","8","6","15","24 February 2015"," Such a Pleasant Surprise
","At first glance one would expect from viewing the trailer that this was the typical action undercover hero plot; filled with high tech gear, sick defense skills, some handsomely dapper suits and a mission to save the world. And without surprise, the film would consist of those elements in entirety. However, this hero spy movie actually has a stranger element that is rather a progressive and growing controversy surrounding the ever growing issue of global warming. This film I think tests the strange and rather immoral ideas of a human genocide to ultimately control global warming by decreasing the inhabitants of Earth dramatically. Viewed by most people, it is such a distant and abstract thought that I think reveals some truth to the reality of the situation we have on this planet, although it may not be the best solution to saving the planet for our society. The film's villain and mastermind, Valentine, is played by the comical Samuel L. Jackson. The oxymoron of Valentine begins just as Jackson says his first lines, expecting to have an intimidating factor, with a lisp. This small and seemingly insignificant detail just makes it a little hard to take his ""scary"" character so seriously. I think Jackson did pleasant job portraying his role with such intended sarcasm and humor. Beside the sci-fi half the film revolves around, the other follows the noble and strong heroes of the film, the 'Kingsmen'. The high speed action and intense side of the ""life of a Kingsman"" created the typical hero element with such a clever sense of humor that seemed to get better throughout the movie. Towards the last scenes of the film there was a whole lovely package of smart and witty humor that just kept getting better. Taron Egerton who played the role of Eggsy, the misfit protégé to the Kingsman fellowship was a fitting addition to the cast. I personally adored the character of Eggsy and was won over when he chose not to shoot his beloved pug at the end of his Kingsman training. He fit right along the dashing and classy Harry Hart played by the talented Colin Firth. The pair together was quite fitting as makeshift father and son. That made it just as heart wrenching when Harry passed right in front of the eyes of Eggsy, a definite shock. My favorite scene perhaps comes at the very end where Eggsy comes dressed in a suit and carrying an umbrella fit for a Kingsman to the bar he first met had exposure to Harry's role as a Kingsman. He comes to take his mother from his step-father only to end in the infamous scene shown an hour before in the movie originally performed by Firth as Harry Heart. It was a humorous tribute to the already clever scene. All in all this film was perhaps the greatest pleasant surprise I have had in awhile attending a show still in theaters. Not a waste of a ticket, but instead 130 minutes sarcastic and profanity stricken humor that in my opinion; the best kind."
"onehigginsdavid","3","6","15","24 February 2015"," Disappointing
","The trailers had me anticipating something like early James Bond as a Super Hero. This movie made the Characters look like Jokes. The obviously 'sped up' fight scenes looked stupid and (OMG) Samuel Jackson looked Ridiculous dressed like a Skater Punk. Besides the fact that it was Totally Outside the 'Atmosphere' that the movie was supposedly creating it is just Sad for Samuel Jackson. I get why the studios might want to hide the fact that he is almost 70 and looks more like 90 these days. Sean Connery had the good sense to age gracefully instead of foolishly and Jackson or his handlers should try that. Other than that what I can tell you about the movie without 'Spoilers is Limited' - It is an action movie that I suppose is about as good as most in the Genre; but it could have been more. It seemed to be an attempt to create a new 'Mythical Hero' in the Kingsman and I believe that was a failure. It was unclear Why these people existed as Chaos and Death seemed even more likely with them than without them. Kingsman is a Poor Myth because it does not seem to have any purpose other than its own glorification. That's Hollywood I guess; but I hoped for more."
"TomTomH","8","6","15","9 February 2015"," Brilliant, twisted, thrilling, funny, pleasantly enjoyable and agreeably entertaining. Matthew Vaughn strikes gold (again). He has a licence to thrill this time. A winner.
","We have got eight more months until we see Spectre, which we be Bond's next outing on the silver screen. If there in anything in these eight months that would entertain us while waiting, Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Secret Service is one of the closest to your calling.<br/><br/>Five years ago, we got Kick-Ass, a spoof superhero movie that unleashed a new cinematic language. It was rather one of the most irresistibly entertaining films of the past few years. It's ultra-violent structure and bar-over-topping scale of profanity and humour proved that director Vaughn could be a genius at this stuff. The plot focuses on a teenager who decides to become a superhero. Basically for me, even though it isn't one of my favourite films of all time, the film feels like an instant classic.<br/><br/>Newcomer Taron Egerton plays Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin, a cockney teen from London. Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is a secret agent who works for Kingsman (a secret spy service similar to MI6) on a ""Diagon Alley"", like London street. He finds 'Eggsy' and recruits him to stop an evil mastermind, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). He wants to take over the world with an evil plan (the typical baddie plot, hey?). But before doing so, he needs to complete in a few life-risking tasks with other opponents (sounds familiar to you? Hunger Games? Divergent? Yes, most of the young adult books seem the same these days. Don't you agree?).<br/><br/>Mark Strong and Michael Caine play supporting roles alongside Firth in the service. Even Star Wars' Mark Hamill pops up (as a professor, not a Jedi in case you were wondering...) and clearly and obviously, at 63, looks different to how he looked four decades ago. Let's see how he revisits as Luke again in ""The Force Awakens"" this December.<br/><br/>The jokes arrive agreeably but not as quickly as I was expecting. The film deals with themes such as dysfunction families and bullying. These are serious issues so some ways it has a more mature nature than Vaughn's previous film (Kick-Ass). Vaughn's tone hasn't changed which is a relief. Even if it takes time to register, it's pretty funny stuff. Vaughn and his co-writer Jane Goldman also throw in Bond references as well which add to the fun. <br/><br/>The lacking of ultra-violence is really the only disappointment. There's an overlong entertaining church fight sequence, and the climax at the finale is overblown (probably one of the biggest key references to Bond throughout the whole film). There's also a noticeably clichéd but really fun pub battle. Other than these, there's not a huge amount of action.<br/><br/>You can't help thinking that it might be a mirror image of Vaughn's previous film as it's done by the same director and writers. But after a while, you get used to the different structure of the film itself.<br/><br/>Could Vaughn be an expert at spy movies? I can't answer this. It's a question only for you to answer. Myself, I consider it to be perhaps the best and most clever spy spoof since the Johnny English films. So my answer would be that he would not entirely be an expert at spy movies but one at these style of spoofs. Having done a superhero spoof in 2010 and a spy spoof in 2015, we'll have to see what handle he'll give us in another five years."
"DrKnockers05","10","6","15","31 January 2015"," A fun, exciting, exhilarating roller-coaster of a film!
","Who watches action movies these days and thinks, 'Hmm. For an action film, this is pretty tame'?<br/><br/>Don't worry. This thought doesn't exist when watching 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. At least, not in my head.<br/><br/>With F-Bombs galore, plenty of fighting, some great acting, and a overall exciting story, Matthew Vaughn and co. have successfully helped make a enjoyable film that favours towards fans of mature action movies. <br/><br/>First off, the cast. I'd like to make it known I've never watched a Colin Firth film in my life. <br/><br/>Good thing 'Kingsman' was my first one. Who'd have thought he could pull off the role of a sophisticated secret agent that just so happens to be a kick-ass fighter? By all accounts, Firth himself did 80% of the stunts in this film. And believe me, for all the moves his character Harry Hart pulls, 80% is impressive. Very impressive. <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is equally as enjoyable to watch, playing millionaire tech genius and megalomaniac Richmond Valentine. The man is clearly enjoying himself in this role, and clearly making it his own. My only flaw with his character is sometimes, it's a little difficult to take him seriously as a villain. With his obvious lisp, flamboyant clothes, and squeamishness towards blood, you'd be forgiven if the number of laughs outweighed the number of shocked gasps when it comes to Valentine (except for one MAJOR scene that made my jaw drop to the floor). But I'll be honest with anyone reading this; I seriously don't care about the 'funny villain' act. In fact, it suited him. I haven't seen many bad guys get laughs like Jackson does in 'Kingsman'. And that impresses me. <br/><br/>Impressed by Firth and Jackson and we're barely into the review. Told you I enjoyed this. <br/><br/>Moving on to the rest of the cast; there's Michael Caine who, let's face it, can pretty much play any role he's offered...which he does in this...fantastically. <br/><br/>Mark Strong, a Vaughn alumni previously seen in Kick-Ass, also does a great job playing the 'M' of the film, known as Merlin here.<br/><br/>And to my personal favourite cast member; Welsh newcomer Taron Egerton. Playing Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin, he perfectly portrays a male version of Eliza Doolittle from 'My Fair Lady'...of sorts (that popular story is referenced in a rather amusing scene between him and Firth). While already possessing skills of superior physicality and intelligence, he squanders these and, not exactly by choice, lives a life of petty crime.<br/><br/>That is until he is recruited by Harry Hart to become a Kingsman. How this happens would be venturing into spoiler territory. But don't worry. It isn't glossed over. There is a particular reason Harry helps Eggsy as you'll see... <br/><br/>As the film progresses, Eggsy is a character you root for in every scene. Whether it be for him and his Pug (I did just say 'and his Pug') to make it to the end of the Kingsman training course, or to helping the other Kingsmen save the world, you can't help but feel hopeful that he'll end up successful. <br/><br/>He's also hilarious. Did I not mention that? <br/><br/>My (""dopeass top) hat"" goes off to the rest of the cast, too. Sophie Cookson was a great choice for a fellow Kingsman recruit who bonds with Eggsy during the challenges they face together in the recruitment process, Sofia Boutella masterfully plays Valentine's beautiful but lethal sidekick who has razor sharp blades in place of legs, and even the supporting cast like Eggsy's mother, played by Eastenders actress Samantha Womack, and the Kingsman agent Lancelot, Jack Davenport of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' fame, are well casted. Even Luke Skywalker himself pops up in a couple of scenes as Professor James Arnold, portrayed enjoyably by Mark Hamill himself.<br/><br/>As you have seen, a sterling cast. But when you get a good cast in an action film, you need to have good action sequences to go with them. And this film rarely disappoints. <br/><br/>While I did go in expecting the violence to be a bit more graphic (that doesn't mean it's all sunshine and lollipops violence-wise!), the choreography in the fight scenes were some of the best moves I've seen in movie history. It's exciting without looking like a mess, brutal without being too O-T-T, and entertaining without dropping a beat. A pub brawl, a 7 minute fight scene in a church (yes, you read correctly), and a duel between 2 characters towards the end are just a few of the many joyous action sequences we see. And for those who took my previous statement of the violence being SLIGHTLY less graphic than expected to heart, this film originally had an 18 rating here in the UK before it had reductions to some scenes of violence, meaning it's more than likely the DVD and Blu-ray copies will be released with the 18 rated version in mind. <br/><br/>An honourable mention goes to the soundtrack of this film which, in my eyes and ears, is one to watch out for when it's released officially. There are some incredibly epic sounding tunes in the movie, some genuinely moving ones, and even a tune from Take That themselves in the credits, which I've listened to every day since it was released...and I'm NOT a Take That fan. <br/><br/>Overall, while being slightly less violent than I was expecting (not necessarily a bad thing), 'Kingsman' is definitely the best new film I've seen recently. While you may be put off by the lengthy running time, the 2 hours fly by as you watch this hilarious, action-packed, exciting, and above all, fun film. <br/><br/>But don't take my word for it! Go see 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' and enjoy it for yourself!"

Villain that want's to change the world and some kid, who didn't go any training referring to hand to hand combat, nor shooting, but goes all Neo in the end.<br/><br/>One thing that I liked was fight scenes, well staged, paced and executed fight scenes.

For marketing, movie producers do and have to do many things. However, advertising the movie with Savil Row scenes is too cheap.

This movie has tons of violence & gore & is not meant for the faint of heart & people who get squeamish at the sight of blood. There is one set piece in the movie that is out of this world!

Egerton is extremely likable as the unorthodox lead of the film. Samuel L. Jackson is hysterical as Valentine. Jackson's antagonist is one of a kind & beats several Bond villains.

","It's easy to create an action movie based on big guns, big men screaming, and big name actors. Not this movie. This movie had a style all of its own. It was fresh, fun, and exhilarating. Something that this movie does differently than other action films is actually use the camera in its advantage. Instead of having the camera be something to put on a tripod while waiting for the special effects to happen, the camera is used to portray fluid motion. You can see every punch, gunshot, and stab easily; and the camera compliments them perfectly. If I were to complain about something, it would be the characters. I feel that the characters weren't anything special, and they all seemed to be the same person played by a different actor. However, that doesn't necessarily matter, for what they lack in characters, they succeed in a surprisingly interesting story. The antagonist wasn't the run-of-the-mill mad man who wants to take over the world: the antagonist had solid reasons for what he's doing, and the film explains it fairly well.<br/><br/>Essentially, this was a very fun movie, and I highly suggest it if you're in the mood for a brand new type of action movie."

And then imagine being blown away by amazing action sequences, spectacular choreography, superb dry humour and a great showing by all actors. <br/><br/>You will never watch a film with elderly people and laugh with them as a woman proclaims that she will have ""arsehole sex"" with the films protagonist if he saves the world. <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jacksons lisp works very well, and this is one of his better movies in the last few years, as the films villain, complete with a henchman. Showing true homage to the Bond films of old. <br/><br/>Colin Firth proves himself a classy British spy, and he has the single best killing spree I have witnessed since Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. <br/><br/>Please see this movie twice. Once with your partner, and once with your parents"
"quincytheodore","7","5","12","12 February 2015"," It's loud and occasionally senseless, but one can't fault Kingsman for not having class. After all, looking good is half the battle.
","The movie practically makes a case for itself. It's every bit as outrageous and bizarre as old Bond movies with equally colorful outlandish characters. It uses anticipation of gritty spy movies made in recent decade, then unapologetically opts for much more eccentric route, even though some of them are a bit too strange. When all the bullets have been fired and nifty gadgets used, the aftermath might not be sensible, but it will definitely delight.<br/><br/>Story revolves around Eggsy (Taron Egerton), a young man who has a less fortunate life. After a few events Harry Hart (Colin Firth) recruits him to join a secret service known as Kingsman out of respect for his fallen father. This may play out similarly to a few other spy movies at the start, but what separates it is the exaggerated antics. It has action theme, but everything is done with lighter candid tone. Egerton is a good cast, as he's new and represents youthful bravado with slight volatile emotion.<br/><br/>As the rest of the cast are veteran actors, half of them being dapper British and also Samuel L. Jackson, there's bound to be elegance, especially in the profanity. Mark Strong, Michael Caine and Colin Firth look like they are just having fun, it's fresh to see them beyond their usual somber characters in thrillers or dramas. Props to the character Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), she's as agile as her name suggests. Her character expresses personality a lot through motion and the bionic legs are really nice touch inspired from classic Bond.<br/><br/>Choreography is blatantly over-the-top, all with dodging bullets or deflecting them with umbrella. The direction delivers either pleasant yet surprising details or excessive burst of loud explosion, both are done in earnest whimsical nature. Script is very honest, the movie realizes it's better to play to its strength rather than using convoluted gimmick, as it aptly puts it.<br/><br/>It's loud and occasionally senseless, but one can't fault Kingsman for not having class. After all, looking good is half the battle. is half the battle."

Excellent movie, a unique blend of comedy and action spy movie Its been a long time since I really enjoyed this kind of movie and I highly recommend that you see this movie Colin Firth really nailed his role, excellent acting by Taron Egerton and the rest of the gang Not complicated story, just something you enjoyed with large cola and large popcorn..go on and see this movie..

"Jordan-thornell-7","10","5","12","31 January 2015"," Stylish, obscene, hilarious and British
","""Do you like thpy movieth?"" lisps Samuel L Jackson's megalomaniac Valentine, to Colin Firths suited and booted (Oxfords, preferably) Harry Hart. ""I find them all a little dramatic for my liking"" he croons in the most perfect British accent, ""give me a far-fetched theatrical plot any day"". This one sentence explains everything you need to know about Kingsman; a gloriously over the top tribute, that takes huge risks due to its audacious attitude, and thankfully the risks pay off. From the director who made an 13 year old girl say THAT word in Kick Ass, it's not surprising that Kingsman is just as foul-mouthed and ultra-violent. With Vaughn's signature style of a comic book look and feel, he cranks up the coolness factor and puts you right in the middle of the action from start to finish. Vaughn directs with such enthusiasm and skill, it's hard not to love anything he does. Colin Firth is superb as the well groomed but deadly Harry Hart. He sheds his stiff, British exterior and embraces his new role, clearly having the time of his life. Firth's chemistry with Egerton is that of a father/son relationship and is truly lovely to watch. Taron Egerton is absolutely brilliant as the teen hooligan Eggsy. With his cheeky accent and potty mouth, he's perfectly cast and cements himself as a promising newcomer of 2015. Kingsman not only looks good, but is hugely entertaining, stylishly written, obscenely filthy, extremely funny and brilliantly British.<br/><br/>Please vote for me (Jordan Thornell) in Vue Cinema's film critic comp on their website!!!"

"billgrasha","1","4","9","23 April 2016"," Waste of Time
","This film has so many flaws it is hard to know where to start. Let's just jump in with all the ham fisted homages to other spy franchises. Naming the dog J.B. just so they could rattle off three agents with those initials. The failed attempt to channel John Steed with lectures on being a ""gentleman."" When Steed did that sort of thing, you actually liked him. He understood that a ""gentleman"" was never insufferable. The clumsy shoe phone reference. Setting the whole Kingsman front in what appeared to be a Savile Row version of Del Florio's.<br/><br/>Despite the attempt to make the young lead a take on Luke Skywalker, he seemed more like a refugee from a boy band, perhaps more suited for ""The Justin Bieber Story."" The cheesy martini order. No explanation of how the widowed mother went from being the wife a Kingsman, to being the woman of some London low life.<br/><br/>All in all, more of a first person shooter video game than a movie. The tediously interminable gratuitous killings in the church. Belatedly asking for landing clearance when you are wheels down on final. The bad guy guards in the tunnel complex who were dressed like 21st century imperial storm troopers. Bringing in surface to air missiles to take out a parked aircraft. The conveniently narrow tunnel where our alleged hero could make like Jackie Chan. The ridiculous acid trip like exploding heads. And the very last hidden in the credits bit where it looked like the same pub morons who were thrashed by Galahad appeared to be lining up for another dose."
"xfy1217","1","4","9","23 January 2016"," Cheesy Stupid Time-wasting Junk
","A cheesy stupid superhero movie without basic logic and common sense. Come on, two kids got trained for like several months and became the ultimate weapon and saved the world? They were not even aware when someone put drug in their drink at a bar, yet they killed the most evil guy in the whole world by a single move! How stunning! While 60% of the scenes are showing you how fancy the special effect they can make, 20% is about how well-dressed and cute their characters are, the real plot-mattered part is like 10 mins. It's definitely a time and energy wasting junk that I can't contempt more. The only reason that there is still one star is that no single drop of blood was seen despite how violent the movie was."

After seeing the amount of tens and nines coming from members of IMB mostly from certain states in the USA like Texas i am beginning to understand more about the psyche of far too many ""folk."" I am ashamed to say that some of the film was made not more than half a mile from where I live near Totteridge in the North London suburbs. The mansion that was used for certain scenes ""Grovelands"" is next to a very famous old pub by the name of ""The Orange Tree"" The Orange Tree was a stop made by Queen Elizabeth the first on her way back to London from Hatfield in 1558 to be crowned queen. All I can say is that Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel Jackson must of got themselves drunk as skunks in the pub before having to deliver the garbage they recited in this absolute disgusting turkey."

I appreciate that this is not really a basis on which to place a review but felt the need to express my opinion of IMDb's webpage which I was surprised to find gave this movie such a high rating. The first few reviews I read raved about this movie so much that I thought maybe it is me being out of touch. However in continuing reading the reviews I see that the majority of reviewers were appalled at this garbage which really does cast a serious doubt on the validity of IMDb's rating system. I can only say that I'm glad I followed my instinct on this one and gave it a miss as many others wish they had done."
"MoviemanCin","8","3","6","9 June 2016"," I Love This Film!
","This is a very original action film with great writing, direction, stunts, special effects and acting. It gives numerous homages to the great spy films of the 60's and 70's, especially the Bond films, while simultaneously turning some of their conventions on their heads.<br/><br/>The opening scene set to ""Money For Nothing"" was excellent. I also enjoyed Galahad kicking the s**t out of the thugs in the pub. But the best scene by far was the very colorful exploding heads of the bad guys set to ""Pomp and Circumstance""! It sort of reminded my of the Staja scene in ""A Clockwork Orange"", which was set to the same music. That one made me laugh out loud.<br/><br/>But the best thing was that the villain was an Eco Terrorist who thinks more about the planet than human beings. As the late, great George Carlin once said ""The planet's not going anywhere. We are."" And he's impaled and dies at the end. Too bad Eggsy couldn't have taken out Al Gore at the same time!<br/><br/>I'm definitely on board for the sequel!"

","Having just staggered through Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, I perhaps saw ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" at the wrong time. My sisters especially are big fans of Colin Firth so I rented this.<br/><br/>The story is about a teen from London (Taron Egerton) called ""Eggsy"" who is chosen to interview as a professional spy for a secret group called the Kingsmen. They eliminate applicants during the ""interview"" -- which is actually a series of treacherous attacks, etc. -- until there is one left standing. <br/><br/>""Kingsman"" is reminiscent of The Avengers on TV and 007. It has some very funny scenes, particularly toward the end, and clever dialogue throughout.<br/><br/>The violence was very cartoon-like, but I still didn't like it and found it too much and too graphic. I admit I'm not a big fan of violence, but I'll put up with it for something like ""The Godfather"" - -- not for this. <br/><br/>Lots of explosions and clever spy devices, with good performances by Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, and Egerton. Look for Mark Hamill -- see if you can find him without knowing which character he plays."
"imdbtruth","1","6","16","29 May 2015"," This movie is a PSY-OP for the Satanic New World Order - and it's Rubbish
","This is one of the most propaganda laden films I've ever seen!<br/><br/>This movie is all about planting seeds in your psyche for the impending New World Order and the fulfilment of the UN's Agenda 21.<br/><br/>Lets look at the antagonist and the protagonists in the movie...<br/><br/>Protagonists (Kingsman Cult) - The movie tells us that this is an intelligence organization formed and endowed by unnamed members of society's ultra-elite. They have no loyalties towards any nation state, but rather they're more like global enforcers.<br/><br/>Antagonists (Valentine Cult) - The movie tells us that his motivation for trying to kill the majority of the people on Earth is because he is trying to save the planet from ""climate change"".<br/><br/>In this movie, no matter who wins, the people of Earth are screwed. The protagonist Kingsman clan is a direct product of the global elite. In real life this would include people like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, David Rockefeller, George Soros, Ted Turner, David de Rothschild, etc, etc... These people and many others like them are the driving force behind the New World Order. <br/><br/>""Some even believe we (Rockefeller family) are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it."" ― David Rockefeller - in his own book ""Memoirs"" pg.405<br/><br/>Rockefeller's sentiments echo the ideology of the vast majority of those on the Forbes 400 list. I'd estimate that 7 or 8 out of every 10 billionaires is part of this ""secret cabal"" of globalists. The ""Kingsmen"" are basically a secret society formed by some of the ultra-elite... Also remember that in real life, intelligence is being gathered on each and every one of us and stored indefinitely (also sold) by billionaire companies like facebook, google, microsoft, apple, etc.<br/><br/>The antagonist ""Valentine"" is a different side to the same coin... He wants to kill the majority of the people on Earth to save it from ""climate change"", but this is the ACTUAL STATED DESIRE/PLAN for the worlds ultra-elite including Gates, Turner, Buffet, Winfrey, Rockefellers, Rothschild, Soros, Kissenger, too many known to list. <br/><br/>What's the elite's biggest stated concerns for the planet? 8 out of 10 will say ""population"" and ""climate change""... <br/><br/>And what is the only stated cure for ""global warming"" aka ""climate change""? We need LESS PEOPLE, way less! ""Or we're all going to be cooked...""<br/><br/>This is exactly what Bill Gates said at the TED conference a few years back, except instead of using computers to kill people by sending them violent mind-control signals through their phones, they will use (in Gates' exact words) ""healthcare, reproductive services, and vaccines"" to LOWER THE POPULATION and save Earth from the man-made climate change FARCE! Ted Turner also says we need to lower global population by 80%... They are all globalists, they are all hell bent on depopulation. They will Keep clean seeds and meat for themselves, they are using our food and medicine supply to shorten our life spans, and more importantly sterilize us and our offspring incrementally. At the same time we are being drugged with fluoride in our water (gets in your pores when you shower, same dosage for infants or adults) and being hypnotized by our lying televisions.<br/><br/>The Church Scene - This was one of the sickest and most Satanic scenes in movie history. Underlying message, kill all Christians... They went way out of their way to portray all Christians as hate mongers, racists, ""anti-science"", and dumb... Of course they also had to throw in a ""hail Satan"", but that's just for laughs, right? Nope. And I'm not laughing... In the coming New World Order, real Christians will be marked for extinction, that's a fact... And to you ""Pre-Tribulation"" people out there, you better take a closer look at Mathew 24:29 and so on, because we're going to be here for it...<br/><br/>The mind-control aspect of it is also somewhat interesting, because real mind-control technology is EXTREMELY advanced these days. It's kind of a ""kooky"" subject to talk about, but if you ever examined real mind-control studies like MK-ULTRA, and mind-control studies done by universities, you'd see that the real stuff they were known to be doing 30+ years ago is downright scary! Now with advanced technologies involving ELF, it's weird and scary, but it's cool, because it's ""science"", and you don't ever want to be ""anti-science"" in the ""new age"".<br/><br/>Too much wrong with this movie to mention in my allotted words... And btw, all propaganda aside, I honestly still thought the movie was terrible!<br/><br/>I also cant believe how many idiots are outraged about the dog scenes, even in the story of the movie none of the dogs were killed! It's cool to portray Christians as hate mongers and then take out 100 of them, but don't you even joke about killing puppies! You people are as sick as those who made this movie! <br/><br/>The notion that there's anything remotely ""gentlemanly"" about this movie is absolutely revolting!<br/><br/>Fear not, for if you have faith in Jesus Christ, then you shall never taste death. And be of good cheer, for he has overcome the world! And for those who feel unwarranted hate of our Lord, I beg of thee to open your heart, then open a bible. Once you begin to understand it, you will see the truth, the way, the life. Jesus will return to gather his elect, though he comes not in peace, for this time he shall bring his sword! Fear God. Praise God! May God be with you all..."
"kosmasp","10","5","13","26 June 2015"," So self aware it might hurt
","At least some of the viewers. Comedy is always something that will divide people. Because what's funny to someone, others find boring or annoying. I'll just say colorful sprinkle, you'll know what I mean, when you see it towards the end of the movie. I thought it was awesome, but I heard people complain about this ""getting out of hand"", being unrealistic/over the top.<br/><br/>But that's it, because while it seems to have both feet firmly on the ground, it's always on some other level ""flying"" around and giving kudos to old spy movies by acknowledging their existence and tweaking, sometimes twisting our expectations. Something that is done very nicely. But the movie is not meant for those easily offended. It has some crude humor and one of the last scenes, will have a couple of people (especially in America) cringe .. more so, than if some violence was involved.<br/><br/>If you can deal with that and don't mind this being ""British"" to a point, but very on the point when it comes to jokes, while not forgetting that there are consequences, you'll enjoy this. After an initial resentment against the young lead here, I grew to really like him. A very good achievement. Also hearing Samuel L. Jackson lisp - just amazing"
"akshay-ak-kumar","8","5","13","7 March 2015"," Class Apart Spy Film
","I'm a fan of spy films and an addict of Bond films. Must have watched each Bond film multiple times. However, I also like the good old spy films like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. <br/><br/>Basically, spy films according to me are of two types - the Bond type and the non Bond type. Bond type is where the plot is thin as a wafer and there are fast cars, gadgets, comic book villains, big action set pieces and sexy women. <br/><br/>The non Bond type is exactly opposite of the above. Solid story minus the glamour.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn just turns the tables. He and his writers create an excellent and delicious cocktail of the above types that left me high for a long while.<br/><br/>So like Bond films there is a comic book villain (played deliciously by Samuel L Jackson), a bit ridiculous plot, some cool gadgets, good action sequences and a couple of hot women which includes a villain's henchwoman who has blade feet and cuts people apart literally.<br/><br/>It also has the story of who are Kingsman, an independent spy agency and how time on time have saved the world from crisis. Kingsman can be looked as a coming age of film of a young man who is wasting his life who turns into a spy and gets meaning and purpose.<br/><br/>So you have the writers who spoof Bond, Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer and all the major spy movies we have seen till date. However, its not like Austin Powers and Johnny English which were out and out spoofs. Here Vaughan ensures that things are in control. <br/><br/>It also helps that he gets in a good bunch of actors to play key roles. What attracted me to this film was Colin Firth playing the role of a spy and doing action sequences. Frankly, Firth is a marvelous actor but never seem his doing an action film. After watching Kingsman, I say man please do some more action films because Firth is a pretty decent action hero. Check out the pub and church scene.<br/><br/>Egerton is also a star to watch out for in the future. He is talented and nicely plays the part of young drifter who turns into a good spy. Jackson is brilliant as usual and Strong does a commendable job.<br/><br/>However, the only thing I didn't like abt the film is the blood shed. Well, killing people with guns and bombs in fine. But here Vaughan is very inspired from Tarantino's work. So there is lot of blood spilled and the church scene is a classic case. <br/><br/>If you are someone who doesn't like blood and gore stay away. However, if you love spy films and don't mind the blood spill...you'll enjoy Kingsman. I hope there is a sequel for it."

Don't get me wrong. I'm not one of those anti-killing people movie type person. My problem with this movie is that the killing distracted me from the story... (the story lol) Especially the fireworks scene in the movie. Yes the special effects were cool in all, but come on, fireworks? When you're gonna kill a bunch of people, you turn it into a fireworks show. That part completely ruined it for me. Onto the story... I got the basic plot of the story, but once again, the killing kept distracting me away from the story! In conclusion, the movie had A LOT of potential, but did not live up to my expectations. I do have the admit, cinematography was actually pretty decent compared to the rest of the film."

If you do enjoy fun, old school, aesthetically gorgeous sets and direction and superbly choreographed fight scenes, this is for you. Though some of these moments were not always too my liking, it's hard to deny the pleasure you have watching this movie. The makers of the movie were all in great form: Millar's script is craziness at its best, and it is paired with Vaughn's superb eye and perfect pacing. Colin Firth was a great choice for the main character and Samuel L Jackson is obviously having fun. A winning spy movie, action movie, superhero movie, all rolled into one."
"qadreya","9","5","13","24 February 2015"," Bloody fun
","I've been waiting for this film for a long time and I have to say that I was surprised as to how good this movie is. The trailer seemed boring, so I was not expecting much, but the first ten minutes was great and it set the tone for the rest of the film. What I truly loved about this is even though its a spy movie, it still had fresh, original characters with great personalities, mainly Valentine. The plot is great and the events are played out so well, even though anybody could think of this plot. But it is the action sequence and dialog that makes this film a memorable one. Its truly British so it was great to finally see a culture other than American, especially one as charming as the Brits. Kudos to the director for this amazing work. I am not sure why it got an R rating though, the blood and gore seemed okay to me, not over the top but still so very good. I was pleased to see fresh faces and Samuel L. Jackson playing a chill role. The biggest surprise was Colin Firth, I never knew he could kick so much ass ! I am never going to forget his role. Finally, the best thing about the movie is the absence of over the top explosions. The 'big' scenes are all hand on hand combat (with appropriate gear) and it was fantastic ! I have never felt more alive or joyous to see people get brutally killed and have their limbs hacked off or their brains splattered out as I did in this film. Maybe its how the Brits do it, but for the first time, I didn't see the badass girl wearing skintight clothes that barely cover anything or having a supermodel pose throughout the film... the girl with the legs was a complete badass and I am in love. Its a great film that you will enjoy."
"Screen_Blitz","9","5","13","23 February 2015"," High-octane, violent, and decidedly over-the-top in its roots, Kingsman is a clever spy action spoof blooming with witty humor and style
","This spy action comedy sees English director Matthew Vaughn taking the classic James Bonds films and spinning them into a sweet, yet audacious comedic spoof. Following his success with 2010's 'Kick- Ass', which showcased a tongue-in-cheek approach at the superhero genre, Vaughn orchestrates a fast-paced action vehicle that echoes the classic 007 flicks, but with an over-the-top, stylized approach that allows for a reasonable examination of what an R-rated James Bond mixed with raunchy humor would resemble. Although the film proceeds with a mean- spirited streak and experiments with humor in unapologetic territory, Vaughn crafts his concept with wit and cleverness. There is rarely a moment that goes wasted in the final product. And most importantly, the film is fully self-aware of what it is and does not aim to take itself too seriously. That is the beauty of what makes Kingsman a hell of a lot of fun. This film follows Eggsy Unwin (played by Taran Edgerton), a young man in his early twenties, the son of a former British spy who was slain in a mission gone awry. Following his arrest for a petty crime, Eggsy come face-to-face with Harry Hart a.k.a. Galahad (played by Colin Firth) who introduces him to a secret spy organization known as The Kingsman, headed by Chester King (played by Michael Caine). Their goal is recruit spies and train them to defeat an maniacal millionaire tech genius named Richmond Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson). With a mind-controlling chips inserted inside the brains of millions of people around the globe, Valentine's evil plan is lead everyone on Earth to kill each other and start a new world order, and with Gazelle (played by Sofia Boutella), a martial arts woman with prosthetic legs with blades for weapons, on his side. So it is up to Eggsey and the rest of the Kingsman to stop his diabolical, or face an unspeakable global disaster. <br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn clearly has his tongue in his cheek when approaching the classic spy genre, with characters spewing references of James Bond sporadically throughout the picture, along with the various action elements owing homages to the British spy of cinema. Does the director's comedic approach work? In many ways, absolutely. The movie follows a plot that is almost never meant to be taken seriously, as opposed to the more darker elements that escalate a few scenes. When the action kicks in, there is plenty of violence and a wild barrage of raunchy dialogue and humor taps at the funny bone, while echoing the bold comedic-style of 'Kick-Ass'. It is hard not to indulge in the fun of Colin Firth beating down the bad guys in a bar, while admiring the slick, stylized execution of the action. In the process, the director always keeps things moving and almost never lets any jokes go to waste. There are a few moments where Vaughn tends to push the envelop with his comedic streak, particularly for the conservative right. Easily the scene that best demonstrates this is one involving a violent massacre at Baptist church filled with a hatred-spewing congregation, apparently paying homage to Westboro Baptist. On the other hand, this film never fails to have a good time while allowing you to turn your brain off. Colin Firth demonstrates a humorous streak with subversive dialogue and raunchy jokes. Mark Strong, playing an ally of the Kingsman gets the job done. Samuel L. Jackson, playing a maniacal villain with the persona resembling Dr. Evil from 'Austin Powers', shines with suitable over-the-topness of a villain with a morbid, yet humorous energy. Then there is Taran Egerton, playing a naive young man going from zero to hero, who evolves with solid charisma.<br/><br/>Kingsman: The Secret Service is a high-octane spy action comedy blistering with rewarding comedic energy and fun that is simply irresistible, at least for those who can skim past the questionably bold humor. Matthew Vaughn lives up to his directorial talent, surpassing the over-the-top superhero spectacle that was 'Kick-Ass'. To say the least, this movie is a total blast in the realm of graphic novels."
"mattslim333","9","5","13","23 February 2015"," Brilliant film
","Kingsman is brilliant. Lets not mess around here, it's a truly fantastic movie. Matthew Vaughn delivers a cracking spy film which delivers thrills and spills but also emotion so you can connect with the characters.<br/><br/>The acting in Kingsman in sublime. Colin Firth puts in a stellar performance, acting with grit and getting the comedic side bang on. Newcomer Taron Egerton is also fantastic, getting the right balance between hard man and nice man, without making his character too clichéd. The action and soundtrack are 2 other things which really stood out for me in this film, with the action sequences shot in a very unique and stylistic way that makes the action enthralling. The finale, without spoiling it, it particularly good for action sequences. The soundtrack is a mix of composed music made directly for the film and well known songs, like Guardians of the Galaxy. This works really well, and gives the film a fun tone and makes you smile.<br/><br/>The only reason this doesn't get a ten is because it felt a bit short in places, especially when Eggsy is training. Hopefully this will be extended on DVD, to add that extra bit of story. Maybe the back story was too confusing. Make up your own mind. Watch this film."

","I was so utterly disgusted with one scene that it compelled me to write this review, my first one...ever. <br/><br/>Okay so to begin with, I thoroughly enjoyed the film (prior to the last 20 mins). It was highly entertaining, humorous in bits and the lead actor did an amazing job. I did feel however that due to the amount of foul language and over the top violence in one particular scene at a church that it lost one point. This movie would've made it on my top rated list so you're probably wondering what was so terrible that it completely ruined the movie for me. So let me tell you...<br/><br/>Now, bear in mind that I am a woman in my mid 30's and not conservative by all means but there is a scene in the movie where Eggsy (the main character) is propositioned by an imprisoned princess. What is so wrong with that you ask? Nothing...had she not offered her ""a..hole"" in exchange for him saving the world. WHY?!! it completely took me off guard and cheapened the entire film. It was completely unnecessary and utterly distasteful! Such a shame because it was such a great film too."

","This film was action packed. I had a hard time understanding other reviewers that said the kid wasn't in training when clearly time was changing drastically. One minute the dog is a tiny puppy the next it's full grown adult dog. Then they go to his mothers home and the infant is now a toddler... looks like 2 or 3 years has passed. They just didn't show you the training as you have to understand that's the boring part. The saving the world was the storyline and what was important.<br/><br/>People just need to pay more attention to understand that time passed. The tests they showed were to prove they were worth continuing on in their training.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film started strong and went through the entire show strong. The humor is subtle and again, you have to actually pay attention and it all makes sense. At the end my husband was like, I can't wait for a sequel! I had to agree.<br/><br/>I love the twists and turns and it kept us wondering what the evil guys game plan was. What did his invention do?"
"stephen-ellwood","10","4","10","20 August 2015"," Perhaps its just British humour?
","I was amazed by the many low scoring reviews this film received. This is the director of Kick-ass, one of the most seminal, ""ultra- violent"" films of recent years. I loved Kick-ass and I loved this film for the same reasons - It doesn't take itself too seriously! For instance:<br/><br/>1) Samuel L. Jackson's character is a wonderful foil to Bill Gates efforts to save the world. He actually hits the nail on the head - there's just too many people in the world - and sets about rectifying it in hilarious fashion.<br/><br/>2) His bodyguard is a double amputee with weapons for her feet. A great steal from Oscar Pistorious and Kill Bill.<br/><br/>3) The use of a radical Christian church as a test case. Most reviewers missed the irony of this one but for me it worked on many levels.<br/><br/>4) The opening scene features a suave James Bond character who knows not only the type but also the year of a Whisky with just one sniff - he dies in a spectacular way. Later the Colin Firth character is treated with the same contempt.<br/><br/>5) All the corrupt heads-of-state who colluded with this arch villain at the expense of the masses get their just desert<br/><br/>6) The masses themselves queue up for free SIM cards for their smart phones without ever asking ""what's the catch?"". We are so used to expecting everything for free we seem to forget that people don't actually do -anything- for free.<br/><br/>I could go on as there is loads of subtlety in the film, the mother's fall from grace, the dog shooting incident, the bullet- proof brolly etc. Most of this seems to have been missed by the other reviewers who were just interested in judging the ultra violence. Personally I laughed through most of it as it was plain silly, just as it was in Kill Bill and Kick-ass and completely the opposite of John Wick (which really is violent)."

","Undeniably, there is something irresistible about the English. Overdone, some would say, but that which discernibly distinguishes them. Colin Firth, perhaps one of the last active remnants of the aristocratic legacy of the Queen's culture and coterie at least on the silver screen , stars in this delightfully violent and overwhelmingly recreational movie. <br/><br/>A deliberate digression from self-importance colours up the whole situational setting . We have out of the box action sequences. Seriously worded quips and one liners laced with characteristic dry humour of the Isles. An undercurrent of persistent comic reliefs both cultural and as well instinctive. <br/><br/>The movie is not shrouded in any contradictory , psychologically complex cryptic conceits . The tale is fairly direct and lucidly directed. One can argue that the movie a tad too long but the intensity of the scenes is such, that one does not deem prudent to as much as utter a pretentious sigh of fatigue. <br/><br/>Those who do not relish violence may find the movie a little distasteful and gross . The kinship to Kick-Ass can be clearly identified in the thematic treatment of the movie. However, the anterior is visually quite different. <br/><br/>The most interesting and attractive part of the movie is that despite turning into a serious ""The Spy Saves the Day"" type of flick in various sequences, it doesn't in the least bore you. <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson animates the cast . Mark Strong does a fine job with an interesting character sketch. Taron Egerton also exhibits fine acting skills .<br/><br/>On the whole a very entertaining movie . They should produce more such movies. Reduction in violence can qualify it to be a strong candidate for classic summer blockbusters of the 90's. <br/><br/>I found the movie quite good ."

The cast was very good including actors like Colin Firth, Samuel L Jackson, Michael Caine and Mark Strong. It was like Bond meets Tarantino. It was quite bloody but the action was 100%. It was also funny with a lot of action mixed in. Taran Edgerston has a great future ahead of himself. This movie was very smart and the last fight was legit. I loved the way the stunts were performed especially when she went really high into the sky. But I really think that they could have kept Harry Hart alive as he was brilliant.

","To be honest I don't really understand how come that the rating of this movie stars with a 7. In my opinion it IS a ten but at least (if you are very strict and judgmental) it deserves an 8. <br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Because it's visuals are spectacular, the characters and the actors are great and lovable and fight scenes are just beyond imagination. I think they managed to come up with an entirely new way of shooting a fight scene which involves having many long takes that are rather rare in fight scenes. And who would have ever thought that ""Darcy"" becomes the new action hero in a movie that beats the ""Mission Impossible"" series.<br/><br/>The story itself is good as well, good-written.

They must have been still writing it when the filming was almost done. There are virtually no good ideas here, and a mostly stellar cast is completely sabotaged by the miserable writing.

","Spoiler- This was a great spy in training movie, and could have reached a much broader audience, except for the F- word used at least once every 6 minutes in the film. I was so sorry to hear that perhaps after writing the script the writers found it was too short. They found the easiest word they could fit in as a Noun , Verb or Adjective. So if they could zap those words out you would have a superb movie, and it would not even mess with the dialog. I believe that the action could be too much for some or the violence, but one is able to get up to get a drink or visit the bathroom during those events and still not miss the whole scene. So for those who might remember the TV Guardian product, the would only be a few lines you actually heard during the film, the rest you would be read. This film has a lot of WOW, if you know what i mean ;) I love Colin Firth"

It contains nice and lovable characters with some development (you can't expect too much here of course), a great villain and a good share of funny entertainment and some surprises one would not have necessarily pre-anticipated.

","Kingsman: The Secret Service- R, 2015, Rotten Tomatoes: 75% ➡️Kingsman: The Secret Service is the definition of a bloody good time at the cinemas and I was giddy with excitement when exiting the theater because I knew that I would watch this film on repeat for the rest of my life! This film comes from Matthew Vaughn who is an auteur in my opinion and is a bold, energetic filmmaker who should be recognized for the true talent that he is. Kingsman is about a group of gentleman spies who are tasked with protecting the world from malevolent evils that would seek to destroy it. The story specifically centers on young Eggsy, a two-bit criminal, and his Kingsman Mentor Harry Hart (Colin Firth in one of his best roles ever) who must stop the sadistic Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson doing his best impression of a Bond villain) from destroying the world. Where do I begin with this film. the action is stellar, well-shot, and violently brutal. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I felt like I had been given a shot of adrenaline straight to heart during these scenes. There is an action scene about halfway through, in a church, that ranks as one of my favorite actions scenes of all time. The script is witty and self- aware by making fun of Spy-film tropes while also using them in a new and interesting way. There are some genuinely shocking scenes that I did not see coming which made me respect Vaughn and the film even more. Kingsman earns everything from the audience and doesn't take short-cuts in character development or plot. this is a raucously entertaining time at the theater which demonstrates that going to the movies doesn't always need to be a serious affair. While I adore Kingsman, I can't overlook it's problems. The CGI can be spotty, the pacing can be uneven, and some character arcs end without any resolution. These are the only problems I could muster from this excellent Matthew Vaughn film. Kingsman: The Secret Service is a thrill ride from start to finish that had me emotionally invested and left me with a huge smile on my face at the closing credits! I give Kingsman an #9/10"

"petricor","4","4","10","9 May 2015"," Kingsman: What a disservice.
","I'm a little concerned. To say the least, I am concerned.<br/><br/>Kingsman delights in portraying itself as an over the top parody of James Bond movies. Well, that's the cop-out answer anyway, because it keeps telling us it's different. ""It's not that kind of movie."" Well, is it supposed to be a better kind of action movie then? Let's take a look at the irony: <br/><br/>It's not okay to kill dogs, but people who you deem as ignorant and evil? Totally okay. Dogs are after all innocent, fluffy creatures. People are clearly not. That's why the famous church scene plays out like a music video to a rock song. Heck yes to mass murder as long as those people don't agree with you or your vision of what is right and wrong. Sound familiar? Crack open any history book and figure it out if it's not evident yet.<br/><br/>Repeated twists and turns. Classic ""waiting until the last second for things to work out"" that is typical of each action movie. Talk about hilariously ironic, but wait. It gets worse.<br/><br/>A gentleman has manners, Colin Firth? You don't say! Dressing a wolf in sheep's clothes doesn't change who he is. By he, I mean Eggsy. Cursing every other sentence and only thinking about collecting his ""reward"" at the end is apparently what new generations of gentlemen do.<br/><br/>So, what was his award you might ask? Ever played Super Mario Brothers? What's the point of playing to the end of the dungeons? The princess, of course! Women are a complete mess in this film: from the mother who gets abused to the Swedish princess who refuses to go along with the villain offering herself on a platter to the hero to the only woman Kingsman on screen who is instrumental to the hero's success (ahem: correction, GIRL, because men can be referred to as gentlemen repeatedly, but what does she get called? ""Good girl!"" And I know you know the term lady because you mention it earlier, Eggsy. Don't play daft.). Oh, but lighten up! It was only a comedy! I'm sorry if I want women to not play silly damsels in distress. I'm sorry if I want consistent character development for women. I'm sorry if I want anything BETTER for my gender. I should know by now I shouldn't expect anything better from Hollywood, but I sure as hell don't have to take it standing down.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, I feel like Valentine had proved his point about human beings. If that isn't scary, I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Parody? Satire? Hardly. It's the same old Hollywood wolf dressed up in sheep's clothes. For shame. For shame."

A good strong cast including Samuel Jackson, Colin Firth, Michael Caine to name but a few, take this genre to a new high. Taron Egerton as Eggsy and Mark Strong as Merlin give very strong performances but Samuel L Jackson as a lisping megalomaniac who cant stand the sight of blood tops the castings.

"Robert_duder","10","4","10","14 April 2015"," Be still my red blooded Male heart
","My subject heading is a little bit sexist. Women could easily enjoy this film too of course. I love action films but my heart lies in those unique, adult oriented, non-stop thrill rides that you rarely see anymore. I thought Kingsman looked interesting and I kept putting off seeing it because it wasn't at the top of my list but I kept hearing about how good it was so I finally got in to see it! Thee best movie I have seen in MONTHS maybe in a year or more. It is easily the best movie of the year thus far and I guarantee will land on my best of 2015 list. If you love action, spy, comedy, British humour and literally the most brilliant satire I have seen in years then here it is. Kingsman is brutally violent, stunningly action packed and full of the most bizarre humour and campy scenes that you simply don't expect. I have no doubt there are a lot of people that simply won't get the satire or spoof qualities because we are so used to the brain numbing spoof films like Scary Movie etc. Kingsman features one of the greatest scenes in action film history (the Church scene with Colin Firth) and while it channels something like Kill Bill, it stands alone on its own merits and I hope and pray we see more from this as a franchise.<br/><br/>Colin Firth is an A-List actor but for me he's always been sort of just there. He was terrific in The King's Speech and he's been good in other things but he's never floored me by any means...until now. He is absolutely riveting as superspy Harry Hart. He kicks some serious a$$ and literally proved he has serious chops in the action genre. Taron Egerton is fairly new to the big screen but he really nails this part. I wouldn't even necessarily say he leads the cast because he is almost second to Firth but you can see him rising up and taking the lead in this series. Egerton still plays the role very well as a street smart, trouble maker with exception skills. This kid is definitely going to be one to watch in Hollywood. Samuel L Jackson is our villain Valentine. Now I am sort of to the point now where I am almost tired of seeing Jackson show up in literally everything. He is a terrific actor with a lot of charisma but he is really pushing the too much of a good thing envelope. So I sighed a little when I realized he was the villain. Guess what? I was wrong. He is absolutely perfect. Not only does he spoof every great Bond villain with style and look and that ridiculous lisp but he has some incredible one liners and is a great adversary for our heroes. Another terrific thing about the film is the supporting cast. Michael Caine is amazing, Mark Strong (I could watch a whole film on his character alone!), Jonno Davies, Mark Hamill, Velibor Topic, and Sofia Boutella (in a ridiculous and yet amazing henchman role.) There are also some underused characters that I hope they bring back in future sequels.<br/><br/>For the most part director Matthew Vaughan has really impressed as a director. There is only one film of his I haven't seen and I think he has terrific vision when it comes to mainstream action flicks. He makes everything seem extravagant and over the top and just fun to watch. I feel like he really showcases his talent here for story telling and cinematography and just imagination to the utmost. Kingsman is insanely fun and actually very intelligent to boot. This is the action film I've been waiting to see for ages and I will absolutely add it to my collection and look forward to seeing it again! Kingsman is a blast!! Bravo to all involved 10/10"
"lhrlinha","10","4","10","28 March 2015"," Gentlemanly Awesome
","Kingsman is a nod to the old spy thrillers, with its crazy gadgets, beautiful women, crazy bad guys... but turning it on its head in the best way possible. <br/><br/>I simply could not take my eyes off the screen. First we get some back story, a brief introduction to the Kingsman and how they kick-ass while wearing a suit (totally useless in real life fights, with all ties that can be pulled and pants that prevent any high kicking, but extremely awesome in movie fights). Than we meet Eggsy, a down on his luck kid that shows a hidden potential, and how he wants to turn his life around. He gets chosen and bam! Training. I just love training scenes. From Jackie Chan doing sit-ups upside down or Luke carrying Yoda (Mark Hamill is on this movie), give a few good training scenes and I know the master is a bad-ass and the student will become a bad-ass.<br/><br/>This film wouldn't work if we didn't connect with Eggsy, but Taron Egerton does a fine job. Not only him, but Colin Firth is great as the ""Mr. Miyagi"". I've never seen him as an action hero, but he takes part in the best fight scenes in recent memory. Part of the credit though goes to Matthew Vaughn and his great directing. The way he plays with the camera, not using all that ""shaky cam"" that is all the rage these days, but actually immersing the audience and showing the important parts makes the punches all the more enjoyable. <br/><br/>Also, Kudos for Samuel L. Jackson for the role of the megalomaniac villain, and all the supporting cast like Mark Strong.<br/><br/>And last, but not least, the story is amazing. The script is simple in the beginning, with the underdog story we all know and love. There is nothing wrong with going for the known archetypes, you just have to do it well. And this movie nails it, while also creating something new. The ending of this movie is just delightfully surprising. A great way of twisting the spy genre. <br/><br/>All in all, a great movie experience. 10/10"

Director Matthew Vaughn has achieved a masterpiece here and perfectly weaves thrills and spills with a bundle of laughs that will leave you craving more. The action sequences are superb and puts Bond to shame. Moving at a hurtling speed to rival Bolt, boredom is not possible. <br/><br/>The acting is of a top notch standard. Colin Firth and Mark Strong as usual do not disappoint and newcomer Taron Egerton will no doubt follow in the footsteps of Taylor-Johnson, from Kickass, to stardom. Samuel L. Jackson is simply hilarious as the McDonald's loving, lisp afflicted billionaire madman who perfectly fills the shoes of the 'bad guy'.<br/><br/>Classy will certainly be the new cool as youngsters abandon their snapback's and sweatpants and head straight for Saville Row.

"drawlife","7","4","10","17 February 2015"," Sporadically entertaining.
","I like Mark Millar's body of work. I loved The Ultimates 1 & 2, Civil War, Wanted, Kick-Ass, and Nemesis. I never really read of Kingsman, nor did I hear about it until I saw the first trailer.<br/><br/>With that being said this film was okay, decent fun. <br/><br/>I didn't particularly find the beginning interesting, despite some stylish opening credits. I found that the film really took its time to get started and it took too long to get everything set up. But there are a lot of moments that really kept me involved. In particular Samuel L. Jackson as Richmond Valentine and Colin Firth as Harry Hart/Galahad. <br/><br/>Firth kept me emotionally involved in the film as his character bonds with Taron Egerton's Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin. Not to mention he is a complete badass. As for Jackson, he surprised me the most. When I first heard about the casting of Samuel L. Jackson, I thought putting him within this cast felt a little force, and I thought this was going to be another ""typical Samuel L. Jackson performance."" But to my surprise he was very intriguing to watch. He was a clam, sensitive, and for a lack of a better word, a soft villain, but with an ultimate goal. His character also had a lisp and a swagger to him that was a charm to watch on screen. <br/><br/>Taron Egerton is pretty good here too. He's got chops to hold his own against Firth, Jackson, Strong, and even Michael Cain, who has a small role. His comedic timing is very spot on and has some humorous dialog. He was very good in the role, but he doesn't shine until the last act of the film. Here is where he shows that he's a very capable action star, something director Matthew Vaughn is very capable of showcasing, i.e. Chloe Moretz(Kick-Ass). He also shares a nice, but kinda useless friendship/romance banter with Roxy portrayed by Sophie Cookson. Mark Strong as Merlin is also great here too. <br/><br/>This film also shows off that Matthew Vaughn flare. The action sequences are fantastic and well shot. There is one particular scene in the church that may turn some people off, but one can't deny that it was pulled off with style. At times the film can be hard to follow. I finally understood Valentine's motive and plan in-between the middle and final act, and some bland and boring spots here in there. But Kingsman is very self-aware of other spy movie clichés, filled with stylish action, solid performances and a decent amount of laughs that will pleasantly kill off two hours of your time. <br/><br/>7.5/10"
"chicagopoetry","6","4","10","13 February 2015"," A Mixed Bag of Tricks
","Kingsman is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's just a British rehash of XXX (or any other 007 ripoff / parody). On the other hand, there are a few scenes in it that truly tread the waters of cult classic (the fantastic church massacre being one of them). Too bad these scenes are floating around in an overly long, sometimes dull spy caper with an identity crisis. It doesn't know if it wants to be serious or if it wants to be funny, and the result is that it ends up being neither. Samuel L. Jackson gives the worst performance of his career as the villain, doing a horrible Flava Flav (with a lisp) impersonation, with an implausible evil plot to destroy the human population that world leaders are going along with for no logical reason whatsoever. And his side-kick with the knives for legs; well, if you've seen the previews you've already seen that so it's no great surprise and there isn't any more Robert Rodriguez shtick other than that in case you were wondering. It's like they took Divergent or any number of teeny bopper films and put it in an R-rated bag full of James Bond and tossed in a few Tarantino spices and shook it up and tossed it out hoping what came out was a great film. What came out was not a bad film. I watched it from beginning to end and forgave it for the cheesy special effects. But it's something you'll probably want to wait to watch on your home entertainment system, because I didn't feel it was worth the $12.50 I paid to see it. And, no, it's not ultra violent at all. The violence is very cartoonish and the blood is computer generated so, eh, I wasn't really impressed."
"vincent_tillema","6","4","10","11 February 2015"," Decent attempt at updating classic Bond tropes.
","I went into Kingsman without any knowledge of this movie other than having seen the trailer once and knowing it was leaning towards the corny and cheesy character of the classic Bond movies. A concept that has been tried many times before, but even when done bad still results in pretty fun to watch movies.<br/><br/>Kingsman does many things better than Bond spoofs like Austin Powers or the abysmal Johnny English and a large part of that is due to the actors used in this movie. Jackson and Firth play their roles like they should with Jackson being quite hilarious. The main 'teen' actors aren't annoying as well, which was a big relief. <br/><br/>Storywise this movie makes as little sense as the more out-there Bond movies. To be honest: I already forgot its plot mostly. Not that it matters: its simply a vehicle for a few pretty big action scenes. One of which, in a church, is quite spectacular. <br/><br/>When it comes down to it however, Kingsman doesn't quite offer the thrill of a Bond movie. Worse is the fact that at one point it becomes too reliant (and too self aware) of it's Bond inspiration. To the point of a cringe-worthy joke that involves Bond, Bourne and Bauer being mentioned explicitly. This over abundance of Bond related themes and jokes isn't Kingsman's biggest flaw though. As spectacular and brutal as some action scenes are, they are sometimes nauseating to watch do to annoying camera work and some of the worst CGI I've seen in a major cinema movie in a long time. We rightfully criticize The Hobbit for this, but Kingsman is an even worse offender of bad CGI usage. This more than often gives the brutal action a bit too much of a cartoony, very 'Kick-Ass' feel. It could've been cartoony-Expendable-esque action, instead its Tom and Jerry with blood and bad effects. <br/><br/>That's not saying there are no fun moments in this movie. There are quite a few. Taken as a whole however, this movie just didn't deliver. Nor does it proof the classic-Bond formula still works. It's Kick-Ass influences and over the top humor make it a thing of its own; gadgets and women or not. It's simply a high paced, bit too self aware and slapstick-humor variation of some classic spie movie tropes.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Troy_Campbell","8","4","10","6 February 2015"," Brash, inventive and highly entertaining.
","After successfully dipping his toe in mainstream-friendly fare with X-Men: First Class, exuberant filmmaker Matthew Vaughn returns to non-PC mode with a subversive and sardonic flick that does for the spy genre what Kick-Ass did for the superhero genre. Attempting to deliver a genuinely great espionage flick whilst simultaneously parodying the genre it belongs to, the key to victory for Kingsman is its impeccable balancing of tones. Although Vaughn's arrogant gusto – displayed from the opening shot as we zoom up to an exploding Middle Eastern mansion – is a major contributor to the high level of entertainment on offer, the praise must be shared with regular screen writing collaborator Jane Goldman. The pair not only dish up witty, foul-mouthed banter and regular, cheeky movie references, but they also unleash gleefully irreverent commentary on subjects ranging from Westboro Church-style religious extremism to the ridiculous behaviour of the one-percenters. Even the action is hilarious. Vaughn designs his set pieces with equal parts flair and brutality; the violence is cartoonish yet graphic, the choreography is over-the-top yet exhilarating and a church-set rampage is one of the most downright awesome action sequences of recent times. The contrasts don't stop there either. Colin Firth is calm, cool and collected as gentleman spy Harry Hart and Mark Strong is unflappably controlled as fellow agent Merlin, whilst at the other end of the spectrum British youngster Taron Egerton is brash and self-assured as Firth's apprentice Eggsy and Samuel L. Jackson is in colourful lampooning form as megalomaniac Valentine. There are a few flaws that will irk those who don't appreciate Vaughn's cocksure direction, but with such inventive ultra-violent action, a rip-roaring soundtrack and adult humour aplenty, Kingsman is a big-screen delight."
"cadillac20","8","4","10","5 February 2015"," Fantastic Fun, A Reinvention Of The Spy Film Game For A Modern Age
","As a fan of the comic, I will say this, Kingsman actually manages to trump it's source material in many ways. Taking what we know about Spy films: the gadgets, the villain, the prestige, even the action, Kingsman gives us street level flair here by essentially reinventing the Bond formula and kicking it in the teeth. It's an exciting, action packed, and fun film that conforms to Matthew Vaughn's stylish take on the comic book film. Eggsy is a smart, talented young man living with his mom and her boyfriend in London with a penchant for trouble. With his dad having died when he was a child, Eggsy has lived a rough life dodging the law and local thugs. But when an old associate of his father's enters his life, he's given the opportunity to put his talents to good use and become part of an elite group of spies. <br/><br/>What a blast. From beginning to end, this movie is entertaining. And this is mostly thanks to the actors rounded up here. Colin Firth brings his usual wonderful skills as an actor, but it's his combat skills that make him so entertaining. Essentially the old fashioned James Bond of the film, Firth is as suave as ever, but he also commits violence that goes unparalleled in the film. This is most demonstrated in one of the film's biggest set pieces, taking place at a southern church which was briefly shown in the trailer. He steals the show, but the surrounding performances are just as great. Taron Egerton, a stranger to the States, is excellent as Eggsy. While this could have been a character who came off as thuggish and criminal, Eggsy is actually quite sympathetic from early in the film. He's clearly smart and a guy who wants to protect his mom and see her have a better life. However, like so many these days, he feels burdened by his lot in life and it has turned him into a less than stellar citizen. His transformation from a troubled kid to a master spy is incredibly entertaining and combines the charm and sophistication of the typical spy film with the rough edge of a street level action film. Sam Jackson brings the ham as an unusual villain, Mark Strong plays one of the most entertaining characters in the film as the youngsters spy trainer, and Michael Caine appears as the head of Kingsman, bringing his usual mix of seasoned professionalism and sense of fun.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, Matthew Vaughn does as good a job here as his previous comic book adaptations. He continues to demonstrate how to make a film fun, exciting, and hip without it being overly cheesy or appear to be trying too hard. He seems almost a perfect match up for Mark Millar's work, as he is able to almost perfectly convey Millar's mixture of rough edge, sense of fun, and intriguing bend of known tropes. In terms of breaking down a genre, this is similar to Kick Ass in that sense. The action is as superb as you would expect and we're always allowed to see it, with a lack of dizzying close ups and shaky cam, which is thankful. The climax is especially rousing and exciting, with plenty of varied action bits, from gun fights to a dual between Sofia Boutella's deadly, prosthetic leg wearing assassin and Eggsy. <br/><br/>It's something of a surprise to find this film playing in a month usually reserved for films studios have little faith in. This is summer blockbuster material and fantastic entertainment."
"t-haylings1","9","4","10","2 February 2015"," Funny, not too over the top but a bit jumpy and slightly predictable
","When I sat down in the cinema and the opening credits ran I thought that this could probably be the best film that I have seen in a while because it has a plot twist, both the grenade scene and the initial meeting of Valentine. This made me think that the producers had finally made a film that I couldn't predict every twist and turn of the plot. My initial view of Valentine was that he was a very funny character with his list and accent being a complete contrast from other character that Samuel plays. I also thought the transition of spies and killing to the story of 'Eggsy'. I also enjoyed the back story of Eggsy and how he grew up to be a funny character that I would defiantly enjoy being. However, I thought the way that Eggsy got in touch with the Kingsman was very predictable but the fight scene with Colin Firth was probable the best fight scene I had scene I a long time.<br/><br/>I also thought that the scenes where it jumps from Valentine to Eggsy's training was too short for each scene. The middle of the film was good when I showed how all the characters where either training to become agents or fighting back against Valentines evil plan. In my opinion the McDonald's happy meal meal was funny as it was a good contrast from rich and posh to 'normal' life. Moving on, I thought the fight scene before Colin Firths death was very well planed ad extremely well executed as it flowed from killing person to person. I was very impressed when the producers killed off Galahad without a long dragged out death scene. I enjoyed the constant references to spy books. I thought the way that all the characters reacted the Colin's death was very believable and emotion full.<br/><br/>I thought the was that way people fought after the satellites had been linked along with the cheesy music was a very good combination. It was easily predictable that Eggsy would fight Gazelle but the outcome was very exciting and good to watch. I liked the way that Eggsy killed Valentine was very constructive and showed that your own partner can 'back stab' you at any time. I thought the final scene with princess was a god twist as I personally thought that Eggsy would become a couple with Roxy. <br/><br/>Overall I thought that the producers thought very carefully with how each scene flowed together and the fight scenes were very well choreographed. Even though some scenes were quite predictable I thought that the combination of the producers trying not to hard to be funny but still being funny and the fluidity was good. I would rate it 9 out of 10 because of its type of comedy and laugh out loud effect but the predictability let it down slightly."
"RMS1949","3","5","14","30 March 2015"," Some fun, mostly NOT
","When dealing with a James Bond type of thriller you always need to suspend belief and go with the flow. I get that. But when the flow is boring as watching paint dry, and the main hero character has zero talent or screen presence, you're in for a long couple of hours. <br/><br/>Colin Firth was excellent in his role but no one else added anything to this film. Samuel Jackson plays another yelling, complaining character on screen, now there's a surprise for you. His character was also so stupid and cartoonist that it was impossible to believe he rose to the power he was suppose to have.<br/><br/>It's just a lot of noise that went south quickly. I rather watch a rerun of any Bond, Bourne or Mission Impossible movie than this train wreck."

","After seeing the trailer I thought I'd enjoy the first half cos of the 'joining the spy' bit and not so much the second half because of lots of action scenes, which I enjoy but not massively keen on - BUT I was very surprised that I enjoyed the entire film and the action scenes didn't override the film and were very good and had some very funny bits. Colin Firth was very good, he played Colin Firth (with extra added spyness) to a tee and was very enjoyable. I found Samuel L Jackson's lisp a little bit annoying but if he hadn't had it he would have been WAY more scary as a villain! He was very funny, too! The scenery was impressive and there were great swooping shots and you could actually see what was happening (not too fast).<br/><br/>I really liked the whole 'knight' thing and that they had Arthurian code names.

"freydis-e","3","3","7","20 December 2016"," Silly, sexist and annoying
","OK, this isn't entirely awful. Much of the acting is OK, Sam L is typically amusing and quirky and Firth isn't bad as a poor man's John Steed, though the main character's attempt at cocky assurance mixed with chip-on-shoulder inferiority (I think that's what he's trying for) is more irritating than anything. Pacing is fine – it keeps moving right along. The blades are a great idea and Boutara wears them well, though it would've been cooler to cast a real paralympian in the role, and why not as hardly any acting was involved. I've heard worse screenplays, though it could have been a lot funnier. It's better than the latest Bond movies, but then, what isn't? However it's extremely annoying for two reasons.<br/><br/>First it's very silly. Some of those who liked the film suggest it is parody and therefore is entitled and indeed expected to be silly. Depends what you mean by parody though, the definition: ""an imitation of something with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect"". That could well involve silliness, but this isn't hugely exaggerated compared with the stuff it's supposed to be parodying, and it's never that funny, apart from a couple of Sam L's lines. Both The Avengers (I mean the 60s UK TV show, not Downey Jr & pals, though this also applies to them) and the old Bond movies, extensively referred to here, are funnier than this without being considered either parodies or comedies. Silly on its own is not funny, especially when too many tough-guy movies intended to be taken seriously, involve the same kind of silliness. Example: this cliché that some guy can defeat large numbers of supposedly tough and trained enemies by leaping around in the middle of them in silly ways (see John Wick, The Equaliser and a million others), hinges on one thing only – the supposedly trained enemies cannot manage to shoot him from five yards away. Breathing round a toilet bend in a flooded room is not funny, it's stupid. Breaking glass thick enough to hold the pressure of ten feet of water with an underwater punch is not funny, it's stupid. Austin Powers is parody. Coburn's Flint is parody. Doing silly unfunny things a million other movies have done, or unfunny things so stupid no-one else would ever do them, is not parody, it's copying and idiocy respectively.<br/><br/>Second reason. It's deeply sexist because: they are kings-MEN; the essence of their approach is to be John-Steed-gentleman imitations (no idea why they don't wear bowlers but at least the umbrellas have survived); all existing kingsmen were male; even when a female becomes one she is given a male name.<br/><br/>It probably thinks it isn't sexist because: the most (in fact only) effective bad-guy is female; it allows women to try out to be kingsmen; one of them wins the try-out, beating out our male hero.<br/><br/>But it is really because: even olde-worlde patriarchal sexism has never had a problem with either female villains or demonisation of women in general, going back to Morgan le Fay (to keep up the Arthurian parallel) it's female heroes sexism can't cope with; while Roxy is winning the try-out, she's the only one to be shown whining, 'I can't do this,' and to need helping out by our male hero; though Roxy is the qualified kingsman and our male hero is not, he gets the all-important gentleman's suit, while they didn't bother to make her one; she's subsequently sidelined on a stupid pointless mission, which she completes but still achieves almost nothing; while our male hero is defeating all the bad guys single-handed in the usual silly way, she is falling to earth and floundering around in the snow. Can't they give the only qualified female kingsman even a support role in the mayhem? Of course not. They just want her out of the way so our male hero looks bigger and badder.<br/><br/>More than half a century ago, the UK Avengers was one of the earliest action series to depict female agents (Cathy Gale, Emma Peel) as equal to their male counterparts in every way including the physical. It's rather pathetic that this wholly inferior ripoff has gone back past the 50s to Neanderthal times – and I doubt the reason is even misogyny, more likely ignorant carelessness.<br/><br/>Just very annoying. 3/10 is generous."
"q32modulate","1","3","7","22 September 2016"," Trite, Contrived and Appallingly Boring
","A friend recommended this film and the trailer looked like it could be interesting. Picked up a copy on DVD to watch on vacation and really couldn't get over how awful this movie is. The only one bothering to act in this film is Mark Strong and I don't know how he got roped into this predictable, boring and utterly stupid film. Nothing in it really gels into anything sensible. None of the characters are likable, believable or relatable. Sam Jackson is horrible and I have no idea why they gave him a lisp. The female characters are all portrayed as weak, stupid and needy. Yet another movie where all the good guys are white and any non-white people are cast as bad guys. <br/><br/>And Kingsman just doesn't make sense. Even within the confines of the story's established mythology, it just slides from cliché to cliché. None of the characters have any sort of sensible motivation. There was plenty of room to work up a good story given the plot, they just didn't bother. <br/><br/>I don't know why everyone else thinks this movie is so wonderful. I don't normally write reviews but I figured it was worth five minutes to warn people away from this disaster."

"sol-","Null","3","7","21 December 2015"," Spy movie parody elements plus fireworks
","Not your average James Bond spoof, this espionage comedy features characters who acknowledge the Bond franchise and lament the serious turn taken by the series in recent years with less colourful villains and less imaginative plots. At the same time, 'Kingsman' also features a plot deliciously absurd on the level of 'Dr. No' and 'Goldfinger' with a villain set on destroying most of the human population from his glamorous lair in the side of a mountain. The gadgetry on offer also has a zaniness not seen in the Bond franchise since Desmond Llewelyn's heyday as Q. And yet, even with such absurdities in place, the villain's scheme is remarkably relevant to the world today with climate change issues and conservation in mind, and there is a memorable speech in which humankind is compared to a virus slowly destroying Earth. The film is not without its drawbacks; the tone is often uneven as the story constantly flips back and forth from serious to comedic. Samuel L. Jackson also tends to overplay the villain, lisping half the time for no particularly good reason. Colin Firth on the other hand is very, very good as the proper gentleman spy who trains our protagonist; the way he keeps calm and cool all the time offers some of the film's greatest laughs. The action sequences are also noticeably well coordinated and while the heavy carnage has understandably attracted complaints from some, the filmmakers are careful not use bloodshed for bloodshed's sake. Few films (if any) have used fireworks quite the same way as they are used here!"
"ct_goldston","2","3","7","21 December 2015"," One for the lads
","I was looking forward to watching this movie with my son after seeing the trailer, but ended up very disappointed. A fantastic cast, excellent action sequences (if very violent) and good pace. Totally unbelievable recruitment process for the newly vacant place of Lancelot. The only strong female character was Gazelle, and she was presented as just the brawn to Valentine's brains. It was even doubtful that the ultimate winner of Lancelot's place, Roxy, would have made it past the parachute jump (perhaps not even left the plane) if not for the encouragement of Eggsy. My son thought the princess was a strong female character for refusing to join the evil plan. Perhaps he forgot about the end where she was reduced to an objectified sex toy prize for the hero? Overall, one and a half hours of my life I won't get back."

","Even though the theme of random people becoming spies/agents over night is indeed very worn out, Kingsman does not disappoint. The humor, where there is some, is pretty good but I must say -the close combat scenes were at times poorly directed. The acting was not bad and the villain was very well explained -though some things, like Gazelle for example, I found very unrealistic and far fetched. Samuel L Jackson amazing and the role he played was just perfect for him. The ending was just comical and the plot twists were well thought out though not exactly original.

","Kingsman: The Secret Service is a film that is far better than it has any right to be. What could of been a by-the-numbers parody of the recent Mission: Impossible, Bourne trilogy and Daniel Craig Bond flicks, though each of those respective franchises are great in their own right, is in fact something truly special. <br/><br/>Kingsman gave me the same feeling as last year's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' unpretentious, well directed and fun yet clever. Kingsman works on a number of different levels that make it a joy to behold. For one, it's an intriguing premise. A young boy living on a council estate in London is recruited to join a secret intelligence service working to preserve peace and order in the world and from there, must face a deadly megalomaniac who is intent on bringing about a new world order.<br/><br/>For one, Kingsman is flawless in it's acting, Taron Egerton is sure for high heights, Colin Firth embodies the brilliance of Roger Moore's Bond but gives a far more lethal edge. While Mark Strong, Samuel L Jackson and Micheal Caine all shine in each of their respective roles.<br/><br/>The film is also incredibly slick, the design on the film from the fact all of the Kingsman wear suits to the nostalgia fantastical plot is all a homage of sorts and yet Kingsman is profoundly original in a sense, it blends humour with a plot that is intelligently self aware all the while will still make you actually care for the characters and has enough curve-balls to make this seemingly predictable romp be far smarter than you were expecting.<br/><br/>The music is great, a fight scene to 'give it up' by KC and the Sunshine band was a highlight for me and while the CGI isn't the big Hollywood Blockbuster standard, it still has that visceral punch to it that makes it a beautifully aesthetic and 70s feel to it.Whilst it's violence, though shockingly brutal is just stunning. Never before have I seen an action scene that is so well shot and paced and disturbingly amazing! If you have seen the film, I am sure you know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>It's a controversial film, that wears it proudly on it's sleeve, it's not afraid to offend and is something that many films lack the bravado to do so. It is also incredibly funny, with some great lines and still has some heart and emotion at it's center with a fantastically British flair.<br/><br/>Kingsman is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, whilst Award season is currently progressing, with films that only possess depth or tackle big themes and overly convoluted, complex characters only being nominated. It's so refreshing that a film that is at it's core: fun whilst still being great is finally bursting into Cinemas. This is one of the rare films that I do hope is successful in order to warrant a sequel, if not, then it'll be a shame but what Matthew Vaughn and his creative team have done, is made a film that I will watch again and again."

"svederen","3","4","11","6 May 2015"," An old, tried and tested story in new shiny packaging.
","I watched Kingsman without any prior knowledge of the film, and without having seen the trailer, and as such my expectations were reasonably low. Because of that I didn't walk away disappointed, but at the same time I feel that there at least two serious things wrong with this movie: 1. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is painful to watch. It's 'Snakes on a Plane' bad, maybe even worse. His lisp is forced and unnatural, and it constantly makes you wonder if it's some kind of stab at gay men.<br/><br/>2. A young, rough around the edges character gets picked up by a secret agency to replace an older agent, has to go through some training, and then has to try and save the world? Where have I heard this before? Men in Black? Wanted? Any number of other films? It's old goods in a new packaging.<br/><br/>Warning, some pretty major spoilers below: 3. Suspension of disbelief fails. The action scenes are pretty and well done, and I could accept the hyper-violence at face value, as something that occurs in this comic book universe that the film works in, but it drops the ball on so many other important areas. First of all there's no adequate explanation of how or why the protagonist goes from street kid to bad-ass super spy.<br/><br/>We're simply expected to believe that being dipped in water and jumping out of a plane, somehow trains you to be able to take on 50 men armed with machine guns, and come out unscathed. Then we're expected to believe that biometric security systems are impenetrable to hacking. If it involves a scan of your hand, it can never be hacked into apparently. Or how about that brilliant billionaire villain, who is determined to carry out his plan, but designs his doomsday device so that it only works as long as he's physically pushing a button on it. He can't flip a switch, it has to be pushed continuously, giving the hero ample opportunity to stop the event. It's the antithesis of Veidt in the Watchmen.<br/><br/>Where suspension of disbelief died completely for me, was when the villain explained how he convinced state leaders, presidents, royalty and celebrities to join cause with him. His solution to global warming is to cull most of the world's population, and somehow these leaders of the world are all in agreement and support his plan? The whole film they're building up to this event, this massive catastrophe that will occur at the hands of Jackson's character, and you're expecting something really clever, a twist or a turn or some rationale that would justify world leaders going on board with this insane plan, and then Jackson spouts a few lines of weird Malthusian-extremist rhetoric, in that weird lisp of his, and that's that. No adequate explanation is ever given.<br/><br/>I didn't believe any of these things made sense, even within the film's hyper-violent cartoon universe. It felt like they were so busy making all those violent action scenes, nobody stopped to think... hey is this even making sense?"

There is precious little to praise in this movie save for the action, I enjoyed the brutal fights and gore but I spent most of the movie hoping someone would rip Samuel L Jackson's tongue out so I didn't have to endure yet another unbearable performance by him, this time complemented with a repulsive lisp. I'm not sure how Jackson is still being cast, he hasn't put in a true performance in over 20 years and his boorish personality is hardly appealing, especially after we've seen him be the same person in every single movie..

Its a wannabe Tarantino style but the violence didn't make any sense in any moment, just to be ""stylish"" and show some nice camera work and martial arts...<br/><br/>My GF even rated it 2/10. We're both 29...so maybe too old for this kind of Movies for the ""younger"" generation.<br/><br/>I cant recommend this, and think that 8,2 is WAY overrated.

","I am not usually a fan of ""violent"" films per se, but there was a certain degree of ""candidness"" and ""innocence"" in the violence portrayed in this film... and that combined with great acting, action and humor made this film just simply FUN and a delight to watch.<br/><br/>The idea of ""gentlemen"" agents is to the degree that they are not fully super""heroes"" yet they are not fully ""ordinary"" either. It gives the audience the perfect room for a perfect level of ""fantasy"" combined with reality (for instance, the tailor shop in London).<br/><br/>There was no mucking about in this film. You are not given the time or the need to try delve into everything that is happening. You are not asking yourself 'why' is he doing that? what is the meaning behind that action? That symbol? etc. The film does not require you to wonder beyond what is necessary. In most of the ""superhero"" films these days we wonder what the back-story of the hero is - why is he the way he is? I was surprise to realize at the end of the film that not once did I really try to fathom where all these characters CAME from. They were just there doing all these amazing stunts and looking so dashing in these suits and I really appreciate that about the Kingsman. It is just PURE FUN. You are given the movie to enjoy and enjoy is what you do.<br/><br/>Everything is straight-forward. The story really does seem simple when you think back on it but at the same time, everything is done in such a DETAILED manner and that is what allows us to enjoy it as it is.<br/><br/>I found this movie just completely refreshing and original. Great cast, great locations, great stunts, great music and just.. a great time overall!"

","Congratulations people who got out of the house and paid people money for this. This is a watered down kiddie rip off of James Bond movies you could get in the bargain bin of a walmart.<br/><br/>The visual effects were good, the gadgets and to some degree the scenes like escaping out of the water to test the ""agents"" or driving backwards flipping the cops off was the only interesting parts. This movie tries to be edgy. Any other training place I can imagine if he didn't shoot the puppy he would have been kicked out. During World War 2 in 1933 to get your stripes you had to break a German sheppard dogs neck in front of your superior officer. Not all nazi solders had to do this but it raises a good point. This movie at first has the atmosphere or feeling of the first harry potter movie or a crappy spy kid like movie and it fails miserably at being edgy like the boy and the princess near the end but it doesn't save this movie much. The visuals and a few scenes save this from a 1 star. I think the best actor was Samuel L. Jackson as only him and knife foot girl were the only two I'll remember years from now as you can't get any more unoriginal than our hero and the guy who gets shot in the face by Samuel L. Jackson. God I suck with names.<br/><br/>I Saw this on the weekend and didn't know anything about it. So no WOWWW hype to get an honest opinion. The script was so predictable and unoriginal it makes you wonder if they should have paid people to write this.<br/><br/>ways for this movie to improve .. it's hopeless we needed cellphones and internet to be what would kill us? whats next a movie about how facebook becomes a serial killer and causes our monitor to eat us? The people who wrote this movie I'd blacklist from Hollywood production teams and hire some people who are older than 23 to write this. This shouldn't have been made. Ian Flemming (James Bond creator) would be spinning in his grave over this steaming pile of dog crap. I'm not a hardcore james bond fan boy I've seen 4 or 5 of the movies tops but forgetful kids like the buster brady (mrs browns boys) rip off that kid was, was about as likable or I got about as emotionally involved with him as I did with the abusive father in this movie, the baby acted better too.<br/><br/>Don't spend people money on this atrocity."
"jan_kalina","10","4","11","14 March 2015"," ""Do you like spy movies, Mr. De Vere?""
","A lisp speaking billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine poses this question to a gentleman-spy Harry Hart, currently in disguise; which results in the smartest and funnest conversation you will see this year. From every frame of this film the love for old espionage and old James Bond films is tangible and mostly it is in this scene where the protagonist and and the antagonist of this film profess their mutual love of ""far-fetched theatrical plots"". Also a point is raised that the adventures were as good as the villain. The love for making films, having fun and letting yourself loose in the whirl of ideas can be felt throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>The strength of any film is to have rightly cast actors. Taron Egerton, the most important piece of the puzzle, is the most promising talent to appear in the film since Jack O'Connel in Starred Up. He is charming, witty and just straight-up lovable. If the audience would not like him or sympathize with him the film would fail. Luckily, that is not the case. Colin Firth's talent is finally being used in the proper way. I finally started to enjoy Firth as an actor in last year's Woody Allen's Magic in the Moonlight and here he plays completely against type. The idea behind his casting was – Who is the least likely people would imagine as a spy?"" Colin Firth is delivers the performance of his life as the typical British gentleman with incredible fighting skills. Mark Strong is fun and entertaining as ever, this time differing himself with a Scottish accent. Samuel L. Jackson is the funniest and funnest villain you have seen in a long time. Matthew Vaughn decided to turn the villain formula on its head and Jackson spiced things up with a speech pattern, which results in the most ridiculous bad guy I have ever seen. I also always enjoy a villain with a noble cause. Sofia Boutella as Gazelle, Valentine's partner in crime is a great play on the typical henchman we see in the movies. Her having blades instead of legs is one wicked idea. Michael Caine of course is a national treasure and it is such a pleasure to see him in any film because no one has a screen presence as him.<br/><br/>The camera work in Kingsman is the best I have seen since Bad Boys 2. The cinematography is fluent - no furious cuts, steady - no shaky camera, and is usually done in one take. The pivotal and arguably the bes scene of the film is the people are calling the 'church scene'. That scene is when everything cuts loose, people go berserk and generally mayhem ensues. This is the most violent, bloody action sequence you will see this year and it is all done in seemingly one take.<br/><br/>That brings me to the highlight of the film. Since the film is not censored by American studio executives Matthew Vaughn was completely in hold of the reins. He could cut himself loose. Therefore one of the film's biggest appeal is its ultra violence. Now, I don't want to sound like some blood-lust psychopath but having people be killed in a movie without any blood or the consequences shown is wrong and it hurts the viewer's enjoyment (if I want to see Sylvester Stallone film I expect blood, which wasn't the case with Expendables 3) and it hurts the psyche of a potential young viewer who might get the wrong impression of violence.<br/><br/>Vaughn's taste in music is very similar to mine. I have always dreamt of hearing Dire Straits's 'Money For Nothing' in a film and that is the song the film starts with. I was immediately in a paradise. The brilliantly put together soundtrack continues with Lynyrd Skynyrd's 'Free Bird' and KC & The Sunshine Band playing at the most inappropriate times resulting in a great comedic effect.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn is ,for me, one of the smartest directors, since he is always is in sync with the audience's taste and its demand. So run to theater as fast as you can to see the best action film in years and the best movie of this year. I guarantee that you won't regret having an amazing time with this ultra violent, mega fun, self-referential spy action masterpiece."
"osj2507","8","4","11","14 March 2015"," Cool, Fun, Stylish and Action packed
","This film is an experience and like many others one you have to see in the movie theater, it is very rich in style, great sound, sharp images and fast moving, over the top action. Many things are in just the correct amount, some just to the edge, but it never gets too much, it becomes much, but it fits the timing of the film and it is glorious. There clearly is a very big love and respect for the spy genre and they clearly have very good control of their references to earlier works like James Bond, Jason Bourne and others. It is a very classic English spy, spiced up with some young British talent and an American villain wit a lisp :)<br/><br/>All of the actors do a very fine job, the guys with the routine, Colin Firth, Michael Cain, Mark Strong and Samuel L. Jackson all do a fine job and they are playing parts that we don't experience them in every day, but it fits them very well. The young Taron Egerton who takes the lead role is also doing a fine job and we will be seeing more of him in the future, I think."

The aspect of being a gentleman spy seems very interesting, not to mention the puppies.<br/><br/>It does seem a bit over the top at times (good or bad depending on how you look at it). Samuel L.

"kunalkhandwala","9","4","11","2 March 2015"," Stylish, slick and immense fun
","In a time when celebrities mysteriously started to disappear and environmental damage caused by human overpopulation became the top agenda for a tech tycoon, a small gentlemen's tailor shop in London stood as the last defender against rising evil. For decades, the Kingsman secret service operated as an independent international intelligence agency in the guise of the tailor shop. Its meticulously dressed agent Galahad proudly defines the agency to a recruit, ""The suit is a modern gentleman's armour. And the Kingsman agents are the new knights"". Matthew Vaughn ('Kick-Ass', 'X-Men: First Class') provides the campy seriousness of a James Bond villain's threat but also has slick, bloody action that shocks they way 'Kick-Ass' did. This spy thriller is a patiche of several franchises but with Vaughn's bold, ruthless and stylized action sequences, it creates a genre on its own. The more ridiculous it gets, the more fun it is.<br/><br/>Having the guilt of losing an agent during an unfortunate mission, Harry Hart (Colin Firth) aka Galahad offers aid to his family. Years later, the son Eggsy (Taron Egerton) grows up in the East end with a middle class upbringing and when his immature acts led to his arrest, he used his wild card and contacted the Kingsman. Harry bails him from prison and offers to recruit him as an agent. Any doubt in Eggsy's mind is laid to rest when he witnesses Harry taking down some rogues in a fast reflexive, stylishly canny brawl at a pub. The recruitment for the one agent who will become a Kingsman will see six youngsters in Hunger Games or X-Men type tests to determine their worthiness. From a flood in their dorm room, to keeping a dog constantly by their side and to dive from the skies to land on target while avoiding radars. Meanwhile, Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), the lisping tech tycoon who dresses up like a rap artist is the opposite of the suave secret agents. His evil plan for saving the planet from degradation is to cull the population of the dominant virus. With an app that triggers a micro SIM card installed in each subscriber, he can force aggressive behaviors in humans anywhere on the planet with the help of a satellite. The Kingsman must attack his stronghold and disengage him and also destroy the satellite that would transmit global ruin. <br/><br/>The action is stupendous in parts. The pub brawl is only an introduction to Vaughn's style of slick, fast paced action but it is the precursor to the final mission, that is Harry's solo rage war in a church that stands out as one of the most brilliantly choreographed action sequences in recent memory. This one can be more astounding than what was witnessed in Kick-Ass. Throughout the movie, Vaughn pushes the clichés to new, darker levels that are crazily entertaining. ""This ain't that kind of a movie"". <br/><br/>Algerian babe Sofia Boutella is the stunning steel prosthetic leg bearing human cleaver who dances her way through some shocking action scenes. As Gazelle, she is a threatening supporting villain who aids Valentine by doing all the dirty work. Samuel L. Jackson is a wickedly cool villain. After playing Nick Fury for so long, it is great to see him in a role where he can really open up and be at his expressive best. Michael Caine also gets to step out of his norm of being the gentle elder in the story and his stubbornness as the head of the Kingsman instigates suspicion and despise at the same time. Quite an unusual way to feel about Alfred. Mark Strong is excellent as Merlin, the resourceful Kingsman agent who sees the recruits through their testing stages and plays a critical role in the climax. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as Prof. Arnold who witnesses the bold rescue attempt in the beginning of the movie by an unlucky Kingsman agent. Taron Egerton is impressive. He plays an East-ender with the same natural ability as he plays a Kingsman with a suit on. Among his best scenes is certainly the one where he hesitates while pointing a gun at his pup 'JB'. Egerton remarkably holds his act well in the midst of such powerful actors. If Daniel Craig can be the hard faced serious agent, Egerton will be the earnestly entertaining one who can still kick-ass. <br/><br/>Colin Firth is a veteran of a different genre of films. Therefore, to see him play such a lead role in a movie that mocks a spy genre and involves action that makes even 'Kick-Ass' look amateurish, is just difficult to grasp. Yet, he does so with such ease and finesse. The double-breasted suit was just tailored to perfection for him and he pretty much defines what a Kingsman agent is all about. Kind in his words, gentle in his behaviour but occasionally, needs to let off some steam in a crazy manner. He delivers an equally serious performance as he did in 'The King's Speech' in a movie that is overall just funny and crazy. That, precisely, is his strength as an actor. <br/><br/>Michael Vaughn drew inspiration from Mark Millar's comic book series titled 'The secret service' but quickly altered many aspects of it to add his story-telling style that occasionally goes from stylish to outlandish but it never stops being immense fun. Vaughn pays tribute to the entertaining spy genre but uncannily, forms an alternate one where slicing victims with prosthetic leg blades, exploding heads and stylish gadgets will be common dealings for the Gentlemen who will save the day. Even James Bond would smirk at this job offer.<br/><br/><ul><li>9.15 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"JasonKleeberg","8","4","11","28 February 2015"," Umbrellas have never looked this cool.
","Umbrellas have never been so badass.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for Kingsman: The Secret Service, it seemed like a bit of an eye-roller. It looked like a forgettable action comedy with stupid one-liners and standardized action built for people who like movies like Real Steel or Agent Cody Banks. I was wrong. More movies need to be like Kingsman: The Secret Service, and there are three reasons why.<br/><br/>Reason number one: It's rated R. This movie could have easily been chopped up and delivered with a PG-13 rating, good for all ages, sans balls (I'm talking about you, Expendables 3). It wasn't. The action here is fantastic, full of glorious head trauma, exit wounds, and broken bones. One scene in particular - set in a church - is one of the coolest scenes you'll see all year.<br/><br/>Reason number two: It's an original property. Yes, I know it's based on a comic book called 'The Secret Service', but it basically just borrows loose plot points from it. I wish more studios would take chances on unknown entities instead of churning out sequels, remakes and superhero flicks. That being said, I bet this gets a sequel...hopefully still helmed by Matthew Vaughn. When someone else takes over something that he made, we get crap like Kick-Ass 2.<br/><br/>Reason number three: It was fun. It took itself just seriously enough that it didn't border on parody, like the last two Pierce Brosnan Bond movies that nearly killed the series (The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day). There were serious, heartfelt moments mixed in with a ton of levity. It paid a ton of homage to classic spy movies while being a blast to watch. Rarely do I leave movies saying to myself, ""I need to own that"", but this one fit that bill.<br/><br/>The year is young, but I'm pretty confident that when 2015 is over, there will be no bigger cinematic surprise than Kingsman: The Secret Service. It's not perfect - it drags a bit at points and Samuel L. Jackson's lisp is eternally grating, but every actor aside from him is fantastic (including Colin Firth, which I never thought I'd say), the action is amazing, and the gadgets are fun. If you're into action or spy movies, Kingsman is a must see.<br/><br/>My final grade - A-"
"sesht","Null","4","11","26 February 2015"," Manners maketh the person
","Let me begin by trying to describe how I feel. How does it feel when something surpasses your expectations to such an extent that you have to grope for words to try and articulate how happy you are? Especially when that something happens to belong firmly in the mainstream milieu, something that has forgotten that it can be as fun, as creative, as those blossoming in the Indie milieu as well. That's how I feel.<br/><br/>I did not want Vaughn to direct this. I wanted him to do either Kick-Ass 2 instead (I still do), or the sequel to '1st class' ('Days of future past' was made possible due to his vision, though Singer has turned out to be a sellout). But he chose to follow his heart, and his vision, surrounding himself with his trusted team (Jane Goldman for one), who've consistently churned out top-class, top quality fare ever since their mutual association began since 'Layer cake' turned out to be the Bond audition for Craig.<br/><br/>Well, to the movie in question: I have not read the Mark Millar graphic novel (The Secret Service) on which this movie is based. Perhaps a good thing. I had read KA2, and was disappointed by the movie. Maybe had I not read the novel (but then again, Vaughn could only produce that, and did not direct).<br/><br/>Its a throwback to the Bond (and non) spy flicks of the 60s (maybe a little from the 70s), when the villains motives were simple enough, and dashes of primary colors determined where your allegiances lay. While giving us a close look into the process that dictates candidate selection, it also metaphorically brings to the fore King Arthur and the Knights of (a not so round) table, sans Guinevere. <br/><br/>The casting is spot-on, and bringing together Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Mark Strong in the same flick has to be something of a coup. The younger cast is also spot-on, and the tale is nothing like the way mainstream movies treat their imperfect match-ups - the older person and the younger one, the female and the male and so forth. Each and every clichéd plot detail is dealt with in all sincerity, and you will never question the motivations that each character has that takes them in a particular arc/path, or allow the audience even to treat each dalliance as casual.<br/><br/>Whilst doing that, Goldman/Vaughn also give us refreshingly surprising, and adrenaline-pumping set-pieces, that surprise, sometimes amaze, and are always dealt with sincerely (that word once again, but how important it is!) and keeps things fresh.<br/><br/>There is also a meta element to the whole thing, with characters in the thick of things being self-aware of all the goings-on, their impact on their surroundings, consequences surrounding their actions et al, but not to the point that it becomes (kind of rolling-one's- eyes) distracting. Things are brought up, and let go of, at the right time. Most movies do not get that balance right (here's looking at you, self-aware 'Birdman', with the golden statuette).<br/><br/>There are action set-pieces that would be right at home in a hard-R Korean movie, that are pulled off with aplomb, and elicit the right level of shock, awe, disgust and revulsion at the perpetrators of such gross acts. Style is used, but always in the service of the narrative/plot, not just for effect like it almost always is in other mainstream works (I'm looking at you, Michael Bay). <br/><br/>To me, this is a signature Mathew Vaughn movie, something he has been capable of since directing balls-to-the-wall action sequences in 'Stardust' (not including 'Layer cake' for now, since that was smaller by choice, in ambition and execution, and remarkably effective for all that nevertheless). <br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson, when given free rein, can become a caricature of himself, and I confess that I was bothered about that, and was hoping that Vaughn had not cast him. However, chalk it down to Jackson being aware enough to rein it in, or Vaughn being in complete control of his craft throughout, Jackson's demeanor, character tics (even the not-so-affected lisp, apparently), motivations et al, are in perfect service to the plot, and he makes for a suitably menacing villain, with one of the perfectly nasty sidekicks (front and back too, pun completely intended) to boot. Not menacing enough though, and perhaps that was 1 small almost mis-step in a mostly perfect spy genre thriller.<br/><br/>Taron Egerton, who could have turned out to be 1 more forgettable character among all the heavy-weights, should really be grateful to the helmers (Vaughn, and Goldman, + Millar, for sure) who give him one of the most 3-dimensional characters that a young protégé kinda character has ever been asked to enact. His character is treated with a respect almost never seen in movies of this genre, especially in the mainstream/commercial milieu. More points to the makers, and pointers to those who wanna follow suit, whilst crunching studio numbers. Not much to expect, but something to focus on when it has been done right, with this as a showcase to that aspect.<br/><br/>Every frame looks perfect, and the score contains a few gems from the yester-years, and are used in a good way. One of the slickest made mainstream features in a long while. All the technical aspects are used in the service of narrating the tale, the way they always ought to be, and never call attention to themselves while doing so.<br/><br/>Not to be missed on the big screen, in spite of a few reservations that one might have. Not for the conservative/safe viewer though. you can't please them all, for sure."
"agmoldham","7","4","11","26 February 2015"," Great fun
","Kingsman: The secret service is a thoroughly entertaining movie. It sits somewhere between the Bond movies and the Austin Powers movies in terms of action comedy genre.<br/><br/>The film follows the prospects of Eggsy (Taron Eggerton) in his attempts to follow his fathers footsteps into the secret service. Galahad (Colin Firth) is responsible for trying to get Eggsy to join the service. The film succeeds in the area that so many other films fail - you care about the characters! This isn't only true of the lead characters either, it is also true for several of the supporting cast. There are plenty of laughs and a very memorable visual scene towards the end of the film.

However, the producers excessive and prolonged use of violence really detracted from the movie. The ending (before the credits) was too explicit. The ending (after the credits) was a nice touch. Obviously, MARV and others couldn't really decide what to do with this script. Too bad that it was an opportunity lost. The computer graphics were novel and well imbedded seamlessly into the movie and plot. I will go to see Colin Firth and several of these key actors again, but if it is a MARV production I will check reviews before I spend my money."

","""Shaky cam, CGI blood, and poor fight choreography."" ""Never insult other better movies in your own film"" ""We thought our best joke was one about butt stuff, so we saved it till the end of the film"" ""We thought James Bond parodies hadn't been done to death already"" ""How much product placement can we put in one film...?""<br/><br/>If the above quotes haven't yet helped you decide if this is a movie for you, maybe the rest of my review will seal the deal. Kingsman is a poor man's James Bond parody. It is a movie painfully aware that it is not taking the spy genre seriously, and it keeps reminding us by literally mentioning how serious the James Bond movies have become. But that's strike number one. Don't mention or criticize a better movie, in your own movie. It also serves us the line ""a movie is only as good as its villain"". Bitter irony, since the movie has a pretty poor villain, in the form of Samuel L Jackson with a terribly forced lisp. But there is a lot bad about this movie.<br/><br/>Lets start with the tone. This movie is inconsistent with it tone. It starts off as a comedy, right with the animation of the cartoony opening credits, yet then follows up with a serious tone, and then switching back to comedy for the last half of the film. It is as if the movie was written by two very conflicted writers, with vastly different views about the tone of the film. The movie takes its biggest deviation in tone right about the moment where it serves us with a very violent, and poorly choreographed fight scene in a church.<br/><br/>Then the comedy. The movie aims for the very lowest bar in comedy. When a joke about anal sex is the best joke that you were saving for the end, you should retire as a comedy writer. The movie got only a few chuckles from the easily entertained in the audience. But several people simply left the theater. That made me realize that those people were probably wiser than me. Comedy isn't easy. James Bond was funny, because it tried to be a good exciting film, while having a charming lead drop some occasional humor in it, without completely destroying the suspense. It kept the action lighthearted, without completely going for cheap laughs. Austin Powers on the other hand, was a full-on parody that was all about having a good laugh at all the characters. It wasn't being insulting to James Bond or other spy thrillers. It was just having fun with it, and you could tell there was love in it too. Not so much with Kingsman. The humor occasionally felt spiteful, and almost offensive.<br/><br/>The fight choreography. I already mentioned this before, but shaky cam is just a poor way to hide bad fighting. It is what directors do when they want to ruin a fight scene, or when their actors aren't very good at fighting. By the way, it seems as if the director thinks that a hail of bullets is like rain during a bicycle ride. You just hold your hand before your eyes, and keep going, and it won't hit you.<br/><br/>Now the soundtrack, is occasionally pretty good, when it is isn't assaulting you with annoying licensed pop music during action scenes.<br/><br/>The story, is terrible. I know that it is intentionally trying to serve us a nonsense spy thriller plot. But it was just lazily written. A large plot of the finale revolves around Hollywood once again not understanding how hacking works, or how satellites work, or how computers work.<br/><br/>I was severely disappointed.

","17 years after the sacrifice of his friend Lee and welcoming Lancelot into the secret spy organization Kingsman, Galahad/Harry finds Lancelot killed in a solo rescue attempt, and Lee's son Eggsy arrested. Harry then have a chat with Eggsy where he dismisses the thugs who had a quarrel with Eggsy. Soon Eggsy comes to the tailor shop, which has the secret entrance to the Kingsman HQ. Harry offers to recruit him and Eggsy accepts. In boot camp Eggsy quickly gains a friend in Roxy, and an enemy in Charlie. Meanwhile, Harry investigates on leads from Lancelot's death and gets thrown into a coma by an explosion. At night Eggsy and the other recruits find their room full with water. Roxy finds a way to get air, while Eggsy breaks the two-way mirror to their rescue. Eggsy visits the recovered Harry and they learn that the leads all lead to Valentine, who's sharing free SIM cards.<br/><br/>Harry visits Valentine under guise and finds only information about a hate group in Kentucky. Eggsy and the recruits are tested to parachute with one of them having no chute. Only Eggsy, Roxy and Charlie passes this stage. Eggsy meets Harry back in the tailor shop and to their surprise Valentine is also there trying a suit. The three youngsters have another test to sweet talk a girl. But actually it's a test to endure interrogation, in which Charlie fails. The final test has Eggsy and Roxy to shoot their pet dogs, in which Eggsy fails, thus Roxy becomes the new Lancelot. Harry dragged the angry Eggst and revealed that the bullet for the dog is a blank. Harry goes to Kentucky to investigate. But Valentine activates a signal through his shared free SIM cards, which makes everyone kills each other, from which Harry is the only survivor. But Valentine waits for him at the exit and kills him. Eggsy meets Arthur about Harry, but he learns that Arthur had gained a scar like the professor Valentine kidnapped. Thus Eggsy evaded Arthur's murder attempt by switching his drinks. <br/><br/>Eggsy meets Merlin and Roxy to stop Valentine. Roxy wears a special suit to go into orbit and take out a satellite to inhibit the signal while Eggsy and Merlin goes to Valentine's base. Eggsy manages to sneak in and help Merlin hack Valentine's signal. Eggsy goes back to Merlin as Roxy nails her target. But Valentine gets another satellite and uses his biometric security, preventing any hacks as long as his hand is on the scanner. Eggsy arrives and fights Valentine's hench-woman Gazelle, and finally throws one of Gazelle's bladed prosthetic leg to Valentine.<br/><br/>The story is very nice. It's reminiscent of oldies Bond movies yet it's even more. At first I thought the movie's edge is the combination of the comedy into it. But after I see it, the movie very much like a great nostalgia as it also looks very lively to the younger generations. The elements paying homage to old Bond, and spy movies in general is a great thing to refresh the spy movie sub genre. spy movies get to be varied now; as some rely on the sly gadgetry like Bond movies, while other focus on the intrigues like Spy Game, action like Bourne movies. Or even humor like Austin Power movies. But this movie definitely states that a spy movie can have all of that and still be great without losing focus.<br/><br/>The action is very nice. You get to see classy action and fighting, using the classic spy gadgets like the poison-bladed shoe, lighter grenade and bulletproof umbrella. Don't expect to see efficient fight moves like the ones in Bourne movies. The fight moves are flamboyant with flips, somersaults, and also has a Kill Bill feel to it with close up blood and gore.<br/><br/>The comedy is also very nice. Overall they are funny and well paced. They even get to be very funny at some spots. I couldn't stop laughing at the scene where Eggsy takes JB for a walk. Matthew Vaughn really used his Snatch and Lock Stock experiences to a good way in making some of the fights, particularly the fights with the local gangsters, look funny at times.<br/><br/>The acting is decently good. Having Colin Firth as the focus gentleman spy is a great thing since he has the roots and the face to create the authentic Bristish gentleman aura. He did play as the British king George after all. Taron Egerton didn't disappoint in his performance. Samuel L. Jackson adds a thing to the villain that makes the character easy to remember. Having Michael Caine really adds to the British feel.<br/><br/>MY say is that Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) really deserves an 8 out of 10 score, and a must-see recommendation. Entertainment is guaranteed for me from this movie, and a sequel is a yes for my wish list."

","This is hands down one of the best films I have ever seen. The films perfect blend of witty comedy and over the top action makes for a movie that rivals the forefathers of the spy genre. <br/><br/>I have never really been a fan of action or spy movies, as I found that they have become stale over the years with a recycled plot line (with Skyfall being my only exception). However, Matthew Vaughn has managed to make something truly amazing rise from the ashes of the action genre. This is an epic movie filled with ultra-violence; laugh out loud moments and a strong and coherent plot, thus paving the way for this to be an inevitable success. As some of the other reviewers have put it, this is what would happen if Kick-Ass and James Bond made sweet love and created the ultimate spy action movie. <br/><br/>It contains all the same nuance's that you would expect from a British spy movie, with the elegant spoken word and the dapper costumes and suits. But it is all built around the framework of over the top violence that will make even the strong willed wince in pain. The best way to describe it is, this is an action movie that understands it's an action movie, Vaughn hasn't tried to water it down to make it more 'child friendly' if anything he has turned the dial up and chucked in as much violence and foul-mouthed comedy as he could get away with (however I must stress that it is just enough to carry the film and its brilliant plot, and it isn't just violence for the sake of it)<br/><br/>But I would say the number one thing that kept this film fresh and entertaining was the undeniably awesome cast consisting of heavy hitters like Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson mixed with up and coming stars like Taron Egerton and Sophie Cookson. For me, Colin Firth stole the show as the suave super spy with the ability to kill you with his pinkie finger – because we are so used to seeing him play roles that require such seriousness, it was refreshing and fun to see him out of his comfort zone and play a more dynamic character. Whilst talking about cast, it's only right that I mention that Sam Jackson delivers another sterling performance with a character I promise you weren't expecting, but also Taron shows that he is well on his way to stardom and that he has a range that his acting chops are developing very nicely. <br/><br/>All in all, the breath-taking cinematography and witty script backed by an impeccable cast means that Kingsman: The Secret Service is one of the best films I have ever witnessed. It is original and cool, but most of all it doesn't require much thinking on your part. So you can sit back, relax and enjoy the epic story as it unfolds before you. <br/><br/>P.S. If it is a decision between Fifty Shades of Grey and this masterpiece, I urge you wholeheartedly to make Kingsman your choice as I promise you, you will not be disappointed. 10/10 stars!"

","My wife and I watched the trailer for this film two weeks ago and she wanted to see it and I didn't. Seemed a silly sendup of the spy genre badly miscast with Colin Firth in a lead role and shot in a frenetic style. Surprise, surprise. This is the most fun we've had at the movies in a long while now.<br/><br/>Colin Firth is exactly right for his part. He deftly wavers between dead serious and quiet amusement. Not once did I think even for a moment that anyone better known for action movies could have done half as well. He's very entertaining and in a lot of ways the film revolves around him to its benefit.<br/><br/>I found Samuel L. Jackson's lisp a bit distracting and a little off-putting, but no deal breaker. The character I was most intrigued by was Gazelle the villain's henchwoman played by an extremely comely Sofia Boutella who would make an impressive Bond girl. Throughout she's a delight to watch doing evil despite her having no feet.<br/><br/>There's humor here and a good sense of fun. But I can't say I'm that enthused about a sequel though the main character here, Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, is quite good. His transformation here is pretty impressive, but he's awfully young.<br/><br/>Of course, I started out thinking the movie was going to be boring, and I was quite wrong about that. I could be completely wrong about Eggsy in a sequel. I do know they've racked up enough goodwill with me that I won't be able to resist taking a look."

","Little bit of Bond, Little bit of Kill Bill, little bit Austin Powers. I've always liked movies where the main character evolves into a bad ass better version of himself. The fighting in this movie is definitely above average violent. John Wick recently..i didn't love the movie, but i did appreciate that the violence and fight scenes were more graphic than usual. The scene in the church in this movie was very reminiscent of the scene in the Japanese restaurant in Kill Bill. Also worth noting....I remember reading that Tarantino had to make that scene black and white to get around the censors because there was ""too much"" blood in that scene. There is a scene towards the end of this movie where some animation was inserted in lieu of horrific graphic violence, which i thought was hilarious. There are also movie lines that stay with you for the rest of your life, ""I am your father"", etc... and this movie has might what go down as the single greatest line in movie history...taken in context..who said it...the situation, the fact that it was out of the blue and seemingly out of character for this person, and the other persons response to it...was just great. If you like Bond, Men in Black, Mission impossible, 24, etc....and you have an above average sense of humor, go see it. There are so many movies that are just recycled and lacking in originality...its nice to see a movie that contains elements you don't normally see."

","Comic book films have become a genre in themselves over the last decade. The well-known characters – Batman, Spiderman, Xmen, Avengers etc have been consistently successful which has led Hollywood executives to plunder the more obscure titles in search of the next big thing. Kingsman: The Secret Service is one such title based on the graphic novel, The Secret Service by legendary writer Frank Miller but the difference is this is not a film to take the kids to. But don't let that put you off, it's one of the most enjoyable and over the top experiences you'll see at the movies all year. <br/><br/>Kingsman kicks off in 1997 somewhere in the Middle East. Secret agents, AKA The Kingsman led by Harry (Colin Firth) are on a mission to extract information from a prisoner who duly blows himself up, killing one of their agents. It's Harry's duty to break the news to his widow and in turn meets young Egsy (played by newcomer Taron Egerton). Years later The Kingsman are looking for another recruit and Egsy (now grown up and in the midst of a local gang war) comes to Harry's attention. <br/><br/>The next hour of the film is a cross between The Apprentice and Full Metal Jacket as the potential recruits are tested in life or death situations and whittled down to find the best of the best. In the meantime we are introduced to token megalomaniac billionaire villain Valentine (Samuel L Jackson) who is making it his mission to sell his ""product"" to all the world leaders in an attempt to save the Earth from extinction – of course nothing is ever as it seems and it's only a matter of time before the Doomsday clock starts ticking. <br/><br/>It's here that the film starts to have fun. The casting of Colin Firth is a genius move – always known as a gentle type of dramatic actor in his first action role, Firth is let fully off the leash and must've spent months in training for the two brilliantly filmed, and extremely violent fight scenes that are as good as anything similar you've seen on screen before. Taron Egerton – plucked from relative TV obscurity – does a fine job and this will no doubt be the start of a new career for him. Samuel L Jackson is good value and can play this role in his sleep and his henchwoman, Gazelle is straight from the Comics and slices up opponents with her blades that double as legs. <br/><br/>The director Matthew Vaughn (director of Kick Ass – the copied style of funny, ultra violence here is clear as crystal) is also on great form and handles the action superbly - clearly setting the tone to be an enjoyable ride whilst frequently referencing the old school James Bond films before he went all serious – gadgets, guns and girls are the order of the day. All in all, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a cracking piece of OTT cinematic excitement – Mission Accomplished!"

Even sadder was watching Michael Caine who in the original 'Alfie', which he starred in way back in 1966, at that pivotal scene he (Caine) comes face-to-face what he has forced upon his girl friend Gilda, played by Julia Foster, an abortion and the honesty in Caien's/Alfie's face as he considers the evil of the act.<br/><br/>Now it's fast forward to 2014 a mere 48 years later and oh man is Michael Caine cool as a cucumber in this mess."

","'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is a comedy film that satirises spy movies such as the James Bond franchise. Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by Taron Egerton) is a normal working class 18 year old from London who gets recruited into a super secret spy organisation. Humour comes as he tries to mix with these posh and suave upper-class stereotypes.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn has included his typical ultra stylised violence ('Kick Ass') and it does boast a good sound track. There are a lot of nods to films such as Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' but it just reminds me of examples when things have been done much better. The highlight of the film for me was a scene in which Colin Firth violently massacres a crazy church to the music of Lynyrd Skynyrd ('Free Bird') whilst almost seeming like a continuous long shot.<br/><br/>The screenplay is very unoriginal and the dialogue with the young actors in particular is cringe-worthy. Tarantino type set-pieces just come across as annoying as the film fails to have any cleverness or creativity.<br/><br/>Apart from Colin Firth every actor is either average or just really bad. Samuel L. Jackson, in particular, is worse than usual as he tries to add some freshness to his regular spiel by trying to affect an annoying and distracting speech impediment.<br/><br/>'Kingsman' is going to appeal to the intended target age group as it does contain scenes of fantasy violence depicted as ""cool"" whilst characters swear. It would also help your enjoyment of the film if you have not seen the many, many examples where each scene had been conducted much better. My final rating for this film is 2.5 stars."

","It's not every day that a secret agent movie comes along, and surprises me other than the 007 series. But this film had a great combination of action, betrayal, gratuitous close contact combat, and impressive gadgets to quench the thirst of any agent buff. Taron Egerton was perfect in his role as Eggsy. A young man just wanting to do the right thing, except the opportunities always slipped through his fingers until he was recruited in the prestigious Kingsmen organization lead by none other than Sir Michael Cain. Who was also one of the bad guys bought and paid for by Valentine... (Samuel L. Jackson.) Now normally I would have liked someone other than Jackson because he's done numerous roles as a bad guy, but somehow he fit this role. As for his sidekick Gazelle... (Sofia Boutella) her ability to kick ass gave the word violence a whole new meaning. <br/><br/>Very impressive acrobatics when it came to hand to hand, plus the wonderful display of samurai break dancing with prosthetic foot blades made of titanium. Last but not least was another key or should I say two key figures of Colin Firth who played harry, as well as Mark Strong who played the wise, and jibe cracking Merlin. Altogether this film was a grand display of fun, adventure, humour, camaraderie, and a divine sense of self worth for Eggsy. The music was top notch, and so were the locations as the movie globe trotted from place to place. Including space. So for those who love a good action flick laced with bombs, close combat, technology, and exploding heads to classic music then you won't be disappointed. I praise this film with top honours.

The scene lasts about 5 minutes, and it plain and simply consists of Colin Firth's character murdering nearly 50-75 people in the most brutal/graphic ways.

"f-79248","10","0","0","4 June 2020"," Elite movie that is a must watch
","Have you ever loved a movie so much that you wished you could forget you watched the movie, and then watch it again. Whether you have or have not done this, this is exactly my feelings towards the movie Kingsman: The Secret Service. It is a masterpiece directed by Matthew Vaughn that came into theatres in 2014. It reached an astounding $414.4 million from the box office. After watching the movie I would say this movie combines aspects from both James Bond and Deadpool. It combines the mission and training type stuff from James Bond while also having a comedy relief like we have seen in Deadpool. If you have not seen Kingsman yet, I would definitely recommend it and here's why.
The first reason that this movie clicked so well was because they had a great cast that all fit into their character very well. The cast included big names such as Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Firth, and Mark Strong. Another actor that played a big part in the movie was newcomer Taron Egerton, he played a large part in why the movie succeeded. You could easily tell that all the actors cared about this movie and gave it their all.
The second reason that this movie was very good was because of the cinematography. The cinematography in this movie is very unique and unlike most action movies. During scenes where there are shootouts going on, they often have the cameras moving around the actors while shots are being fired which gives the movie a very unique feel. Since this cinematography is so unique whenever it occurs it intensifies the scenes and drags the viewer into the movie. I have read that similar styles are used in the movie Kickass, but since I have not seen these movies I can not confirm.
The third reason that this movie worked was because of a very entertaining plotline. The plot from the very beginning is never dull. There is always action and stuff going on that draws the viewer in. The plot continuously flows from the main characters backstory, to training to become a kingsman and then right into their first mission. One of the only things that I found problematic within this movie was the fact that they used an american church as a location for a brutal gunfight scene. Some could say this is taking advantage of american stereotypes, but other than this I feel that the plot in this movie was very strong.
The fourth and final reason why the movie was a hit was because of a strong soundtrack. They combined good songs along with memorable background music during important lines. The soundtrack allowed the viewer to better understand the scenes by setting the tone. Another reason why this is a good soundtrack is because it also adds energy and tempo to the movie.
In conclusion I believe that Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Secret Service is an elite movie. It combines aspects of good acting, cinematography, entertaining plotline, and soundtrack. Like I said at the beginning of this review, if you have not seen Kingsman: The Secret Service, I highly suggest it."

","When 007 over there began to take a cold line of literature and art thriller, the movie from comic book brought the audience back to the era of coquettish spy film. How to kill people in a gentlemanly way, with a stylish, powerful and cool modeling and action design, Matthew's story telling ability, Colin's elegant body and strong British style, interspersed with English humor and funny bridge sections, and a hundred people's beheading in church? Just like this."

","Taken from the comic book bt Dave Gibbons and Mark Millar, Kingsmen is all about what it takes to go from a commoner to one of the men on her majesty's secret service. If anything, this is one of the rare comic book movies that improves upon its source material.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn (Stardust, Layer Cake, Kick-Ass) does a great job with this film, making a better Bond film than Bond films.<br/><br/>Ever since a tragic mission in 1997, Harry Hart (Colin Firth) has felt like he owed the family of Lee Unwin - who died to save his life - something. He gave the family a number of they ever need him and seventeen years later, Eggsy - Lee's son - calls him. As played by Taron Egerton, he becomes the true hero that the Kingsmen - a secret organization of spies devoted to protecting the United Kingdom - has been looking for.<br/><br/>He must also deal with Richmond Valentine (Samuel Jackson), a rich genius using free wireless to cut down the Earth's population. He's backed up by Gazelle (Sofia Boutella, Atomic Blonde), a killer with prosthetic legs.<br/><br/>Plus, Mark Strong is great as the handler Merlin and Michael Caine can be in as many spy movies as he'd like.<br/><br/>I love that the idea of this movie is pretty much how Terence Young turned Sean Connery into James Bond. Millar said, ""Young realized he had to turn Connery, this rough Edinburgh guy, into a gentleman, and before they started shooting the movie, he took him to his tailor, to his favorite restaurants, and basically taught him how to eat, talk, and dress like a gentleman spy.""<br/><br/>This movie made me so pleased because someone remembers how to make a Eurospy movie with style while not being overly referential to what came before."

","Pros:
1. The opening scene with Lancelot (Jack Davenport) dispatching a bunch of goons, only to then ultimately meet his own demise by Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), is really stylish and compelling.
2. The action scenes are well-shot, fast-paced, and extremely entertaining. The first bar fight and the mesmerising church fight stand out as prolific examples.
3. The editing is done really well. The fast and quick-cut edits, in particular, help the fight scenes to pop more.
4. The score and soundtrack are used superbly to build up tension, suspense, drama, chaos, sadness, and everything inbetween.
5. The humour is inserted well, it produces charming moments - especially between Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Galahad (Colin Firth) - and it's never too ridiculous or distracting.
6. The film provides an empowering message of taking responsibility for yourself and learning to overcome your natural disadvantages.
7. Samuel L. Jackson (Valentine) gives an amazing performance as an old-school over-the-top spy villain.
8. Galahad's death is shocking and impactful, especially as he served as a father figure for Eggsy.<br/><br/>Cons:
1. Somehow, when Gazelle fights Princess Tilde's (Hanna Alström) bodyguards, she's able to dodge close-range bullets by simply moving her head.
2. During the parachute training scene, there is obvious use of green-screen which is a little distracting."

","In Hollywood, they saw a movie is decided within the first ten minutes of the film. Hollywood will deiced if it's a success or not within ten minutes and so will the audience. Anyways, you certainly need to capture the audiences attention in the first ten minutes of the movie to be a blockbuster hit. Kingsman grabs the audience attention right out the gate and opens with an explosion of action and excitement.<br/><br/>Not only does a bomb go off, a kidnapping occur, but a boy's origin story begins. We are introduced to mystery and intrigue right away when powerful characters come into the scene and we don't really know who is the hero or the villain. We just know the characters are really cool and dangerous and when Samuel Jackson walks in the door and is the one who gets to drink the 1962 Dalmore, we know we are in for a good time as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Taron Egerton plays Eggsy, the boy destined for more who is like any charterer in a superhero movie growing into his destiny. He has a rough home life, filled with a lot of abusive douche-bags trying to bang his mom and because he had a dysfunctional and violent home life, he never lives up to his potential though he is highly intelligent and athletic. Like a lot of smart kids from a troubled home, he has a problem with authority so he quits things like the Marines and is no stranger to getting into trouble with the police. The lack of a silver-spoon has set Eggsy on a certain path, but if he is willing to learn, he can become a KINGSMAN.<br/><br/>What is cool about the training of the Kingsman, is the contenders die during training. This gives the movie a realistic feel. They trainees are put in life threatening situations and if they are not smart enough to figure it out they die in training. They do not get a lecture about how they can do better next time. Sometimes after a scenario about how the most important lesson is teamwork, they will turn around to see during their attempt to only save themselves, one of their teammates died and they did not even notice until it was pointed out.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is what you would expect from a big budget action film. The scenes are clean and crisp. When it comes to cinematography they used a fast speed style to display fight scenes.The action is rapid and effective.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is filled with excitement, action and your adrenaline is pumping the whole time. The movie is highly entertaining, with underlying political tones that seem to predict future trends, like whoever rules Mobile towers, rules the world.<br/><br/>In the end, Eggsy chose not to shoot his dog to get a job. What is interesting is after all his training, he went right back to his old ways, being sucked into the drama with his stepdad. Though you could say it's noble for him to try and protect his mom, in actuality its just a low level of drama that is not worthy of his attention.<br/><br/>What is worthy of Eggsy's attention is the church scene massacre, where there is an epic battle leaving not one body alive in the church, but the Kingsman. The free cell phones that were distributed earlier in the movie, were used to emit a neurological wave that made people aggressive and want to kill each other. This was a test for a cull to kill off a large portion of the population as the villain of the story sees humanity as a virus.<br/><br/>The bottom line is the Kingsman offers entertainment in a high fashion."

","21 February 2015. It's uncertain whether or not Kingsman reflects the best of the evolving black comedy trend in movies or not and whether such a trend is a passing or permanent element of a classic movie. Whichever it is, Kingsman currently is a superior film with its finely honed balance of black, dark murderous content being portrayed alongside British, gentlemanly wit. This film is a Colin Firth's best actor Oscar high English version of the The King's Speech (2010) meets the comedic spy romp of James Coburn's Our Man Flint (1966) meets the hard edged, raw espionage of the refurbished, rebranded James Bond in the form of Daniel Craig in Casino Royale (2006). Dark comedy in the spy genre has been gaining more prominent film focus as they have evolved from the more entertaining comedy action motif of the popular and zany Wild, Wild West (1999) or the romantic interplay of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) taking on the more darker and serious ambiance of the action crime thriller, The Dark Knight (2008) as Sam Rockwell in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) and Pierce Brosnan in The Matador (2005) seemed to make be some of the first forays into this gumbo of movie genres that began with the classic Pulp Fiction (1994), Kingsman appears to take its basic thematic tone from the blackest of action comedy of Uma Thurman's Kill Bill 1 & 2 (2003, 2004) and incorporating a culturally off-balance brush stroke of the military black comedy war movie Tropic Thunder (2008). Recently a number of movies have taken murderous death and blended these atrocious acts with a finely balanced hue of comedic overtones such as Bill Nighy's Wild Target (2009), Violet & Daisy (2011), Brad Pitt in Killing Them Softly (2012), Kevin Costner in 3 Days to Kill (2014) and Katie Holme's very proper but fatalistic Miss Meadows (2014). Kingsman includes the added bonus of a strong performance as a villain in the form of a fascinatingly speech impeded Samuel L. Jackson. This dark comedic action thriller comes across as something, fresh, new, and bold while sustaining an especially emotional intensity throughout and grabbing the audience refusing to let them go until the end. Whether or not this whole creatively new comedic frenzied experience is a passing endorphin high or some established benchmark of greatest remains to be seen."

The cinematography was uniformly awful to the point I started playing spot the green screen to keep myself amused. The action was either poorly executed or over the top and gory. It was as if the director had one seen the toxic avenger and robocop but had never git the irony'.

"leonblackwood","7","3","8","2 August 2015"," Surprisingly Enjoyable! 7/10
","Review: For some unknown reason, my expectations for this movie really wasn't that high and I wasn't that impressed with the footage that I had seen on the trailers but now that I've watched it, I am quite impressed. The action scenes were great, especially when Firth was kicking butt in the church and the storyline really wasn't that bad. The transformation of the rude boy to a suit wearing secret agent was also brilliant and I definitely want some of those gadgets. Anyway, the film is about an undercover agency (Kingsman), who are on the hunt for a new spy to join there exclusive intelligence organisation so the individual agents take on an apprentice to train them up. Colin Firth takes on his fellow agents son, who sadly died whilst saving his squad so Firth feels obliged to give his son a chance to join there elite group. Whilst going through training, a billionaire tech genius (Jackson) threatens to take over the world by installing chips into mobile phones and giving them to people for free, so time is not on the agents side. By the time that the training is coming to a close and there are only 2 candidates left, the tech genius starts to cause violence around the world so the agency has no choice but to step in and save the world. I know that it sounds weird, but it's actually quite clever. It has a type of Bond/Mission Impossible flavour which has enough drama and action to keep you entertained from the beginning to the end. I'm usually impressed with Jacksons performances but he didn't seem to fit in this movie. His weird lisp and gangsta clothing was out of place but the other characters were great, especially Colin Firth who had total faith in his apprentice. I also liked Mark Strong, who helped the agents along the way and Michael Caine was a great touch as the head of the elite group. Anyway, I really enjoyed this film and the epic ending was brilliantly put together. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Although this movie cost a hell of a lot of money to make, you can really see were every penny went and it truly deserved the money it made at the box office. Its the first major role from the 25 year old Taron Egerton, who also starred in Testament Of Youth and has a major role in the upcoming Eddie the Eagle movie. Its directed by Matthew Vaughn who brought you Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, Stardust and Layer Cake and you can definitely see traits of Kick-Ass in this movie. The attention to detail is brilliant, especially during the action scenes and he covered many aspects with the cleverly written storyline. I just hope that they can get a cast as good as this, if they come out with a sequel! Anyway, it amazing to think that Samuel L. Jacksons movies have nearly grossed over $4.5 Billion dollars, with the Avengers being his highest earner at $625million. At 66 years old and with Nick Fury, Black Phantom and Tarzan in the pipeline, he truly is the hardest working man in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Budget: $81million Worldwide Gross: $405million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/comedy movies about a secret agency who recruits a street kid to save the world from a billionaire, tech expert. 7/10"

","KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE review by: Mike Smith<br/><br/>Based upon the acclaimed comic book, this film tells the story of a spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program, just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.<br/><br/>This movie is a fun action film; it has a classic 007 feel to it and it points out the stereotypical spy and action movie clichés and how they aren't going to do the same things; it gives the film charm.<br/><br/>The cast of Kingsman: The Secret Service is an awesome group of actors. Colin Firth plays the ultimate gentleman spy that all men dream of being at one point or another. Once again Samuel L. Jackson gives us unforgettable character. After a while I couldn't put up with his lisp and he started to remind me of Mike Tyson but Samuel L. Jackson is always worth a watch. Michael Caine plays the leader of the Kingsman. He is rarely on screen but when he is he is intense and mysterious. I'm unformeler with Taron Egerton's work but he was the right choice for the roll. He keeps you interested in the film and he is a good actor. I hope we see him in some north American movies because I thing he'll do well over here. Last but not least I enjoyed seeing the legendary Mark Hamill but when he did his accent it reminded me of his joker voice, but that's not a bad thing.<br/><br/>The film takes a bit to get warmed up but the action fight scenes are full throttle, fun and at times intense. Also, the Kingsmen has some light chuckles but what bugged me was the green screen, the CG looked cheap and this film really pushed that it was made for 3D, I'm not a big fan of that.<br/><br/>Kingsman: The Secret Service is worth a watch for the awesome cast and fun action scenes but this movie is very forgettable and it takes a bit for it to get warmed up.

"CinemaClown","Null","3","8","29 May 2015"," Does To James Bond What Kickass Did To Superheroes!
","From the director of Kickass & X-Men: First Class comes a new comic book adaptation that effortlessly blends the over-the-top action of the former with the secret world of the latter, which is then smoothly intermixed with elements of spy-thrillers & is ultimately raised to a high level of bizarro. And the result is an incredibly stylish, downright hilarious & endlessly fun cinema called Kingsman: The Secret Service.<br/><br/>Based on the acclaimed comic book, Kingsman: The Secret Service refers to a secret spy organisation that's looking to recruit a potential agent as a replacement for the position left vacated by a former Kingsman who dies during one of their operations. The story follows a veteran Kingsman agent who takes an aimless young adult under his wing & grooms him for the job while a twisted billionaire unleashes a global threat.<br/><br/>Co-written, co-produced & directed by Matthew Vaughn, whose kinetic direction here brims with creative energy as his latest is his love letter to earlier James Bond classics. However, it also toys with the conventions of its genre & makes fun of the same simultaneously, and with its clever use of violence, outlandish humour & a few cartoonish renderings, makes this film a roller-coaster ride of emotions.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, Production Design team does an excellent job as all the set pieces are meticulously refined. Cinematography makes excellent use of camera that seamlessly switches from a firmly controlled sequence to an out-of-control carnage without ever losing focus. Editing briskly paces the whole narrative. Plus, the energetic soundtrack by Henry Jackman & Matthew Margeson works in the film's favour.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, Kingsman: The Secret Service features a well-rounded cast in Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Strong, Taron Egerton & others. Now Firth may not be anyone's first choice for an action role yet it's the exact reason why his character works so well. Jackson is funny & freaky at the same time. Strong is reliable as always. Egerton is the newcomer here who exhibits great potential & his master-disciple relationship with Firth is a highlight of this feature.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Kingsman: The Secret Service is an early oddball of the year that does to James Bond what Kickass did to superheroes. Its unexpected shift in tones, crazy action sequences & eccentric use of humour may not go well with everyone but even its detractors can't deny the awesomeness of the church scene. While certainly a no match to Vaughn's previous effort, this British spy action comedy is nevertheless an enjoyable, entertaining & amusing ride that comes gleefully recommended."
"g-40208","9","3","8","26 May 2015"," Good action movie...great satirical masterpiece
","I went to watch this movies with mixed expectations;a friend said it was stupid and a complete waste of time, the ratings on IMDb claimed otherwise. In my opinion, those who think the movie is stupid or has a weak plot, did not get past the thin veil that looks stupid. Digging a little you get to realize the real issues that the movie wishes to highlight.The movie has some humorous and light-hearted moments but too much violence and action to be classed as a comedy, I can compare this to DR Strangelove by Stanley Kubrick. This is not a stupid movie or a waste of time as claimed by some, I recommend you to watch it and be the judge; however,if you like to watch uncomplicated,easy to understand movies and traditional plot styles...THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF MOVIE."
"xcvb_2003","8","3","8","25 May 2015"," Classy, exciting and just outright entertaining.
","""Manners Maketh Man."" <br/><br/>This is one of those movies that completely takes you by surprise. I enjoyed it immensely. James Bond type-ish British spy film, but with way WAY more wack and awesomeness. Matthew Vaughn is a great director. I've watched all of his films (except Layer Cake) and the guy just has a knack of delivering really enjoyable/entertaining movies (Stardust, Xmen - First class, Kick ass). <br/><br/>The cast delivered great performances all round. Colin Firth simply KICKED ASS. Loved his character and how classy yet deadly he was. Taron Egerton, the protagonist, was some nobody to me before I saw this movie. Now, he is a star in the making. Samuel L.Jackson, while didn't stole the show or anything, was a pretty good villain with a funny lisp condition.<br/><br/>The plot actually felt somewhat fresh and wasn't your typical 'Take over the world' type scenarios that you see in this genre. Although I have see the main mechanism elsewhere, the reasons for doing, the justification and all that was something that I could standby with. Also, the movie had some messages about over reliance on smartphones, privacy hacks etc which I really liked.<br/><br/>Coming to the action, let me just say that it was just awesome. The pacing was so well done that many scenes had me on the edge of my seat with my heart thumping like crazy. The hand to hand scenes were also well executed. Full of gore, long takes, class and no excessive shaky cam and fast cuts bullshit. Add dark humor layer to it all and it was just a wonder to watch it all. The Church scene in particular really WOWED me. <br/><br/>Sound effects and OSTs were also perfectly edited in scenes, enhancing the experience, adding more adrenaline, class, humor etc as required. <br/><br/>The only complaint I had was that the movie tried to develop some romance and while I'm REALLY glad it didn't linger on it, it did kinda felt out of place and just tacked on. <br/><br/>Overall, it's the best movie of this year so far for me. I just hate myself for not seeing it in the cinema. <br/><br/>8.6/10"
"Semisonic","8","3","8","23 May 2015"," From chav to gentleman in two hours
","It's actually a rare occasion that you see a movie based on a comic book about British people. Until i managed to recall V for Vendetta, i thought it's my first rendezvous with a material of such sort. Especially since it revolves around a figure of an English gentleman, and who can be a more unlikely comic book hero than a tea-drinking suit-wearing umbrella-cane-carrying snob?<br/><br/>Well, this is where it gets interesting. Because, although our main gentleman figure is played by Colin Firth, a seasoned veteran of Regency era courtships and chivalry, it's not gonna be a Pride and Prejudice of any sort. What we have here is a modern day dandy spy squad. But it's not just James Bond dressed for Royal Ascot. It's more like Captain America dressed (and mannered) for the same sort of thing. Fancy, ain't it?<br/><br/>But, as with a recipe for a proper Martini, all the ingredients, including the last one, are equally important. And, as a cherry (or should i say an olive) on top, we have here a little social confrontation, because our modern time knight with impeccable looks and manners chooses as his apprentice a young chav'ish guy, who's equally talented and troublesome.<br/><br/>At this point, i believe that anyone who's at least mildly interested in the action/adventure movie genre will be intrigued to the limit. And they should be, because Kingsman: The Secret Service delivers a today's interpretation of the ages old fairy tale about a commoner who rose up and got into the highest ranks thanks only to his courage, wits and honor. And this time, instead of bows and swords, we have shotguns and super spy gadgets.<br/><br/>Surely, as any fairy tale, Kingsman is hardly a sci-fi. So don't expect much plausibility here, since what's believable is not always fun. Instead, enjoy how marvelously graphic this movie is, how brilliantly the fighting scenes are filmed and how insanely surreal (or surreally insane) the main villain is. It takes a courage and some wild imagination to actually transform the current collective subconscious into a figure of flesh and blood and make this figure really evil, but only evil enough to still take it seriously. Because, as we know from the old Bond movies, the over-the-top baddies cause more laugh than fright, and we don't want the audience to laugh before the punch line, do we?<br/><br/>But no matter how gentleman material you are, it's hard not to get your suit wrinkled and specked a bit when it's raining punches and bullets. So, while Kingsman is light-hearted and jolly enough to be on par with Kick-Ass, it certainly lacks some depth and character development. Surely, we see how Eggsy, the ballsy (no pun intended) Galahad's protégé, goes from that council housing punk to well-esteemed gentleman with fighting skills straight from The Matrix. What we don't see is some real, not fairy tale sort of, challenge he has to overcome to become what he becomes. Just a bit of brawling with some higher-born competitors and one skydiving trick - that's all. He doesn't even seem to break a sweat, which falls in line with the fairy tale style, but lacks realism so much that it undermines the value of the achievement somewhat. And yes, there's product placement. So explicit and blatant that they even make Colin Firth endorse McDonald's as a part of a dialogue. I try not to be a snob, but that was a bit too much.<br/><br/>So, while Kingsman is hardly a movie that would hold you enthralled on a re-watch, it's still entertaining enough for your first date to be pleasant. It's fresh enough, funny enough, and who would skip an opportunity to see Colin Firth kicking major ass for three minutes straight? Not me for sure. And neither should you, because for that alone watching Kingsman can be a lifetime experience ;)."
"NicoRobin007","10","3","8","23 May 2015"," If you know what you're signing on for, you'll love it. If you don't, why are you going to see this?
","Here's what trend I am noticing with these reviews. With rare exceptions, it's getting either a 1/10 or a 10/10, which means for this movie to have a stellar 8/10 IMDb score, for every one person that gives it a bad review, four people have to give it a perfect review. This is a rough calculation obviously, but it's actually important to my review. Instead of looking at this as, 4/5 people liked this movie, I look at this as everyone who likes this genre of movie, liked this movie. Now, why do I make such a claim? Read the negative reviews. Every review is about how there is too much violence or the plot being over the top. What did you expect walking into this. Look at the rating and the reasons for the rating. Watch the trailer. Read one review for the movie. Watch the other movies by this director. Take your pick. These are all indicative of what the movie was actually like. These reviews are basically akin to ""I didn't like the Avengers because there was too many superheroes."" I'm not implying you should know every little thing about every movie you see, but shouldn't you at least know the general idea of what you're getting into? Ranting aside for how people don't educate themselves before spending their money, if you like these types of movies, you'll adore this one. I'm beating a dead horse, but it's a British Kick A**. Plain and simple. It's unique, quirky, humorous, enjoyable, and fun. They do a great job of mixing action with comedy, much like the aforementioned title. Honestly, I laughed more during this than any comedy movie I've seen in years. I'd prefer to keep this review entirely spoiler free, so I won't be giving any examples of witty lines or particularly memorable action sequences, but believe me, they exist.<br/><br/>There were so many unexpected bright points from the movie as well. Samuel L. Jackson's character was beyond amazing. I certainty didn't see that coming. The plot, although indeed over the top, was extremely clever at certain points in the movie. There's some predictable twists, but a lot of the interview test scenes were handled very cleverly. The whole British twist on the movie added something fresh as well. As someone who generally doesn't personally like British movies or even the culture (no offense intended, just not my cup of tea...pun intended), I found it to be a welcome theme for this particular movie.<br/><br/>There were a few tiny grievances I had, however. They probably didn't need to swear as much as they did, but that's just a personal preference and not anything actually wrong with the movie. I also thought the music wasn't that great. Maybe I'm spoiled from Kick-A**'s, well...kick-a** soundtrack, especially during fight scenes, but I wasn't feeling it for this movie. The universal complaint I seem to see in these reviews that I'll agree with too is the gratuitous last three seconds of the movie. It was kind of demeaning and added nothing to the movie. But(t...another pun? :) ), we all know why it was there. Sex sells. There's not much you can do about that at this point.<br/><br/>All in all, if you liked Kick-A**, you WILL like this movie. If you like stylized action, you'll like this movie. If you like James Bond, you'll probably like this movie. If you like unique movies, you'll like this movie. If you're easily offended by excessive violence, you will not like this movie. It's, for the most part, not even that gory; just violent. It's as simple as that."

","I could go on and on about how great this movie is, but I think enough people have already done that. Colin Firth is the ultimate in impeccable spy persona. Samuel Jackson is that very rare breed of (almost) lovable villain. The villain's assistant is beautiful danger incarnate. Good guys become bad guys. There is something for everyone in this movie. Ultimately, this is a movie about character; what makes someone a good and decent human being. It's also about how sometimes failing a test reveals a much more worthwhile side to a person. There are no holes in this script. The only reason it gets a 9 instead of a 10 is that I really didn't like the closing credits soundtrack."

","WOW! I absolutely loved this film! First of all, there's the classic British humour that just makes it hilarious and it's all the way through!<br/><br/>Kingsman has been amazingly well cast too! Samuel.L Jackson is genius in this film! He plays the comical lisping villain, and is the cherry on top of the cake. Then there's Collin Firth who's equally as good, playing a secret service agent. It's quite odd to see him come from things like the Kings Speech to being an all action agent but refreshing! Finally, the young Taron Egerton gives an amazing performance! He is able to bring out all your emotions in one film, leaving you breathless.<br/><br/>The filming is completely original and refreshing too! The way people's heads blow off into fireworks is just funny and exhilarating! The massacre scene in the church, while being horrific is also comical to watch and can't be taken seriously! <br/><br/>Over all, this film is just amazing; great actors mixed with a great storyline and fantastic filming makes what is in my opinion a perfect film. However, if you're expecting a deep bond like spy film, well; ""This ain't that kind of movie bruv'""!"
"Tariqinto","9","3","8","16 May 2015"," They have done every little thing just right!!
","Kingsman: the secret service, one thing I can say about this movie, they have done every little thing just right!! It definitely falls into the Bond genre (I think it's about time to give the Bond movies their own genre). This movie is different in many ways yet it embraces its genre completely, yes, it is a British spy action comedy but it's like they wait for you to expect something and then they do the opposite. <br/><br/>Directing: Matthew Vaughn is usually great with these kind of movies, Kingsman gives the same vibe as Kick-ass, the perfect balance between action and dark humor. The film was violent yet not gory, he avoided the gore and the messiness that comes with it. One of the best fight scenes I have seen in a very long time. In most of the fight scenes there were some awesome long takes, which is very hard to accomplish, as opposed to short quick confusing and totally unimpressive scenes. Vaughn usually adapts stories with comic book backgrounds and makes the characters and story come to life on screen with all their cartoonish and comical nature, unlike Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan who take a comic book story, strip it from all its comical charm and turn it into a typical action movie that does not really need a superhero or a supervillain to be special. <br/><br/>The story: surprisingly original and the attention they paid to detail is impressive, it's a solid well-rounded 'major plot holes' free. <br/><br/>The casting: this was pure brilliance, let's talk Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson, both have been thrown out of their comfort zones, especially Colin Firth, but both did it brilliantly!!! Colin Firth proved that he can be a bad ass and do the genre that he has been accused of lacking the capabilities to do. Samuel L. Jackson's character, Valentine, is very interesting, he's like a genius Bond villain with a soft heart, low tolerance to violence, a very evil yet smart plan and a lisp. Mark Strong acting wasn't as great as the aforementioned actors but I blame whoever wrote the character because they didn't give him a lot to work with, the character was flat and typical. But Mark Strong is always great. And I still think he's one of the most underrated great actors."
"Dr_Sagan","Null","3","8","9 May 2015"," Fun action comedy with a couple of grizzly scenes and a Colin Firth full of style and finesse.
","(I don't expect anyone is reading this, since this is the ...426th review posted, but here goes!) This is an over-the-top action movie build on the British style of Roger Moore's 007 and the ""The Avengers"" (TV Series 1961–1969).<br/><br/>I can think a couple of actors who might be suitable for the main role but the finesse and elegance of Colin Firth is beyond any criticism and the main reason to see this movie. You might never believed that Firth could pose as an action hero but in the league of 55-65 spy-type assassins gives ...Liam Neeson a run for his money.<br/><br/>The direction is stylish too and its main purpose to please the audience. Lots of slo-mo effects, one-vs-100 fighting sequences, sky diving, many many explosions etc. Not the boring type. This movie has good action choreography that becomes even more fun when you see Colin Firth delivering it! The script is overall clever although the premise is common. The wealthy evil mastermind vs. ""a"" British secret service (not MI6), but even that idea has held some sarcasm for itself.<br/><br/>With the exception of a couple scenes near the end that are crossing the line to the ridiculous this movie has some emotions too.<br/><br/>Overall: Recommended"
"julianmarq","10","3","8","4 April 2015"," An utterly exhilarating experience
","I didn't know this movie existed before I went into the theater to watch it. I hadn't read reviews, I hadn't seen trailers and I didn't even know it was based on a comic book (which I haven't read either). I just happened to stumble upon it in my weekly trip to the cinema and, since there wasn't anything else worth watching (that I hadn't seen) at the moment, I decided to try my luck...<br/><br/>... Glorious, if I'm going to use one word to describe this film, it is that one. After having watched, in theaters, a string of depressive dramas and offbeat comedies (mostly last year's Oscar nominees and some art-house movies) in the past few months; this movie reminded me why I love the seventh art so much: it's just shameless, stylized, escapist and balls- to-the-wall fun.<br/><br/>The first thing I want to comment on is the acting and I'm not going to focus on the veterans (it's pretty much a given to expect amazing performances from Firth, Jackson, Caine and Strong; even if, in the case of Firth and Jackson, their roles are quite outside their comfort zones) but on our protagonist. Egerton plays the role with panache, comfort and emotional depth unusual for someone who is pretty much doing their first big role and in an action/comedy flick no less. There's no moment in the movie in which I could say he isn't Eggsy. He clearly threw himself to it and had a blast, there's enough conflict, audacity and (to use Merlin's words) ""cheek"" to spare. And he also did most of his stunts to boot.<br/><br/>That leads me to another fantastic asset of the movie: the stunt work. The action setpieces are just things of beauty and although everyone mentions, and with good reason, the church scene; my favorite moment occurs at the end and it involves a lot of parkour. It's mesmerizing.<br/><br/>The comedy is also spot on and perfectly timed, Galahad's line in the church is flawless in every sense, and that's just one moment.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, both the compositions for the movie and the pre-existing songs, fits like a glove and sets the mood of each scene seamlessly. Of particular note is one of the most inspired uses of ""Free Bird"" I've heard.<br/><br/>In the director's seat, Vaughn does a great work of letting us see all this in the smoothest way possible, he has an eye for genial moments that he puts to great use.<br/><br/>Here's hoping it gets enough money to warrant a sequel and this one isn't messed up like certain other of director Vaughn.<br/><br/>All in all Kingsman gets a 10/10 from me (and it's the sixth movie I've ever watched to get that rating). I'm not claiming it is a landmark masterpiece of cinema but, as far as escapism go, this movie does achieve perfection."
"rossjonesa","8","3","8","31 January 2015"," Very good. Lacked in a couple of areas.
","This film is very good. The action sequences are very entertaining, keeps you on the edge of your seat. The plot was a little too drawn out, yet had some very good twists, such as Harry's death. The idea of a SIM card that can control people is very good. The one major area where this film failed for me was the CGI. The explosions looked horrendous. It was obvious when things were CGI'd. Even still the fight sequences had tremendous visuals. The script was very well written to show the the Kingsman's class, ""Manners Maketh Man"" is one of the best lines in the film. The characters were very well developed, apart from ""Roxy"" who was really just there. Firth played his character to perfection, Caine was alright and I believe that Taron Egerton has a very promising future in action. The standout character has to be Valentine, the lisp he has makes his lines absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>Overall this movie gets a solid 8, superb fights and dialogue, just lacking in CGI. Really a more funny James Bond."
"therocksbarneyreviews","7","3","8","31 January 2015"," If you liked ""Kick Ass"", you'll like ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"".
","""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" isn't quite what you'd expect having seen how the film has been advertised. But for those who might have read the well-acclaimed 2012 comic that the film is based on and from there may have noticed that the film is bringing back the same duo that bought us ""Kick Ass"" (Matthew Vaughn and Mark Millar), ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" may perhaps prove to be less of a shock. The film is most of all a fun one, well-executed by the man whose influence is prominent in it, Matthew Vaughn, the film's director. But Vaughn's style, as seen in the several action sequences that come to define the film are not all that ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is and the rest of it is relatively generic, poor and boring and definitely stands out in contrast to what I remember ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" for.<br/><br/>The film's action sequences are each brilliant with one in particular perhaps being the best I have ever seen, where Colin Firth (playing Harry Hart) cuts and shoots his way through the throats and heads of a group of fire and brimstone American, bigot church-goers. The film's ending is also brilliantly shot, unfolding in front of you like a painting. Some have called this style obnoxious, which I understand, but it fits into what ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is, a film with James Bond archetypes that have been cranked up to about level 100, and that are the complete opposite of the James Bond films we are currently used to.<br/><br/>And this is the same for the film's main villain, tech billionaire Richard Valentine (played brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson) who obviously has a phobia of sorts for blood and a lisp. He dresses in a way that is a relief in contrast to the suits I've seen almost every single James Bond villain play in recent times, instead wearing orange, blue or purple baseball caps with matching outfits of course. When I first saw Jackson on screen I couldn't help but burst out laughing.<br/><br/>What lets the film down is in what happens when Colin Firth isn't killing everybody in the room. Boring archetypal stuff that is a product of what happens when this James Bond parody is trying to be serious for a moment. Moments like when the film's protagonist, Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton) is running down corridors with soldiers chasing after him and miraculously seemingly forgetting how to shoot their guns (I mean this scene is painfully poorly shot). It's these moments I suppose that emphasise how Vaughn is not much a director of actors, but more of action and that is where he succeeds here, as he did in ""Kick Ass"". <br/><br/>Ultimately ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a good film, and the average member of the audience my age will come out agreeing with me because of how similar it is to what we saw in ""Kick Ass"", but for the critic that I am slowly becoming several things stood out to me which proved detrimental towards the film's style. However, if you want to see a film that is full of blood and gore with a great soundtrack to keep the pace up, a film that in many ways I found took inspiration from my favourite film of 2014, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", then look no further. You don't need to think and you can just be whisked away by Matthew Vaughn along the corridors of Richard Valentin's base, even though there may be the occasional moment when you find the soldiers aren't shooting at, nor running after you."

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.4/5 stars<br/><br/>Stylish, subversive, and above all fun, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" finds Director Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"") reinventing the rules of spy films with gleeful abandon. Yes it's completely bonkers, totally wacky, unabashedly over-the-top, and at times even indulgently campy, but it's also, downright, one of the most no-holds-barred, entertaining action-comedy romps you're bound experience in years. More importantly, it's a celebration of the fun-filled, lost art of political incorrectness.<br/><br/>Based upon the acclaimed graphic novel by exalted comic book writer Mark Millar (""Kick-Ass"") and illustrator Dave Gibbons, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. Basically you need to imagine a Sean Connery James Bond movie with the potty dialect of ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" and the action from ""The Raid"" franchise. But there are numerous deviations from the source material - albeit of the extremely rare kind where the adaptation offers a refreshing take on your something you're already familiar with and immensely fond of - to the point where one could deduce that on day one of filming, the creators must have thrown away the moral compass and taken a group vow to splatter our sensibilities with stylish, gratuitous violence and one ""wait, what...?"" moment after another.<br/><br/>At its heart, ""Kingsman"" is just as much a parody of James Bond and his spy genre cousins as the ""Austin Powers"" franchise. Admittedly, it's not a full-on spoof like ""Austin Powers"", but this action- comedy is very aware of the clichéd world in which it operates. Eventually, it's an entertaining, endearing, delightful ode to spy flicks from the 1960s - a rowdy, amusing romp - spoofing the James Bond concept of dapper gentlemen involved in international intrigue. Still though ""Kingsman"" is a loving homage to spy movies, it has just enough gravitas to stand as a memorable film in its own right.<br/><br/>Much of the credit for this crackling adaptation from Millar's popular graphic novel goes to Director Matthew Vaughn, who, by now, has done more than enough to hold his own among the likes of Tarantino, Kurossawa, Spielberg, John McTiernan, and Eastwood as one of the best in the business when it comes to helming action movies. He keeps the action coming and astutely juggles numerous topics to deliver a vibrantly entertaining good time. Providing a sedate detour from the grizzly violence and insanely diabolical plot are the witty one- liners that range from eliciting chuckles to uproarious guffaws.<br/><br/>Assisting Vaughn in delivering a seamlessly fun package is the top- notch cast. Oscar winners Firth and Caine add action star and sly backstabber to their resume with spirited aplomb. Firth's performance in particular is nothing short of a revelation; not in a million years one could've imagined that one day this serious, dramatic actor would clean house armed with nothing but his wit, charm, and a bulletproof umbrella. Jackson, clearly had a blast playing a megalomaniac, and camps it up in hilarious fashion. Newcomer Taron Egerton fares solidly as Eggsy, becoming the story's driving force, and evolves into a junior version of Firth, complete with tie, 1960s-style spectacles, and the aforementioned umbrella.<br/><br/>This isn't for the politically correct or the faint of heart. But, if you're on its groovy, twisted wavelength, it's a stoned blast. A smarter spoof than ""Austin Powers"" devoid of the over-seriousness of the ""Bond"" movies, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a stylishly assembled, crazy action-comedy, and a much-needed fresh take on spy movies."

","Kingsman The Secret Service is a fantastic spy thriller that has a lot of heart and is very funny. The direction from Matthew Vaughn is dynamic, using steady and shaky cam as well as they possible can be used and not relying on 30 cuts every 5 seconds during the fights. The acting is great, from Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson to newcomer Taron Egerton and Vaughn regulars like Mark Strong and a nice smaller role from Mark Hamill, everyone is on their game and fits flawlessly into their roles. The story is smart, fun and easy to follow and the musical score fits to a T. All in all Kingsman is a great entertaining movie that has a little too much violence and language then needed, but other then that is a great ride of a movie. 4 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review http://youtu.be/d0fUozleeRU"

"lucasnochez","10","4","13","2 March 2015"," Film Review: Kingsman: The Secret Service
","Upon first glance, Kingsman: The Secret Service looks like an outdated, outlandish attempt to reinvigorate the action spy genre that saw Pierce Brosnan fail miserable as his final appearance as the famous spy-agent James Bond in The World is Not Enough. Since 2005, thanks to the likes of Martin Campbell and Christopher Nolan, two directors that took two very different iconic action figures, Batman and James Bond, and injected a much needed, gritty, dark, reality-based foundation to these characters and their overall narratives, over-the-top action has long been expired. In the last decade, what has arisen, is a very dark and realistically twisted take on many action icons, both in the superhero genre and the action hero genre, that allows the cartoonish elements of these characters to fade, and the realistic to rise in popular and rewarding box office results. <br/><br/>One of these aforementioned films that inhabited a reality based narrative structure was the recently re-envisioned X-Men film franchise, which was, ironically, reinvented by Matthew Vaughn in X-Men: First Class in 2011. The film, which took place in 1962, set around the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis, showed just how much the comic book genre succeeded among audiences when introduced around real-world events.<br/><br/>The amazing thing about Kingsman: The Secret Service, is that the same man who was responsible for breathing new, raw life into the X-Men franchise, after the disaster that Brett Ratnet's X-Men: The Last Stand was, is the same man that is bringing back the absolutely manic and outrageous spy-agent genre with a vengeance. Thankfully for everyone, Kingsman: The Secret Service is the action movie we have been waiting to see and the is the tremendously alternative to a highly unbelievable 007 movie that never came.<br/><br/>Upon first view, I too was worried about the dynamics of Vaughn's newest Millar adaptation (Vaughn had already adapted Millar's Kick-Ass). Looking back at the trailers, the action looked silly; the players too clichéd in the world of agent-spy standards; and gimmicky thanks to the inclusion of adorable pugs and attractive cast members. Boy was I wrong!<br/><br/>Kingsman is a highly calculated film romp that never takes itself too seriously, yet never lets go of its grip of highly entertaining action movie and escapism Hollywood fluff. To think that Vaughn could have potentially abandoned this project completely to make X-Men: Days of Future Past is sad. Thankfully, the highly visionary and confident filmmaker stuck to his guns, and delivers easily, one of the most entertaining films of 2015 thus far.<br/><br/>Kingsman begins as any action movie should; with a girl. But this girl, is a recently widowed mother who surprisingly has a stranger visit her in the late night, to tell her that her husband, a Kingsman (unbestknown to her) was killed in the line of duty. The stranger, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), is unwelcome in the home, and focuses his energy to his partners newborn son, Eggsy (newcomer Taron Egerton), where he discloses to him that, if ever in the future he encounters any problems, the Kingsman are indebted to them forever thanks to the bravery of their patriarch.<br/><br/>Flash forward a decade, and Eggsy is a troublesome youth, whose failed attempts in the marines, and trouble with the law finds his luck at the crap end, time and time again. It isn't until Eggsy, who in an act of defiance for his mother against her petty mafia boyfriend, finds himself in a police station, in deperate need of the Kingsmans help. After a quick phone call, that ends ambiguously, Eggsy is released of the police station and greeted by the same man who visited him and his mother upon the news of his father's death, Harry Hart. Luckily for Eggsy, Harry offers him a job interview, that could see him in the same line of work as his father, and could change his world forever thanks to an unexpected visit to a tailor shoppe.<br/><br/>On the surface, Kingsman seems to be a neat and well dressed action film. Once cracked open, Kingsman is a rough, tough, cocky-filled fuel ride of adrenaline, bad manners and tailored attitude that puts James Bond and company to shame.<br/><br/>Vaughn, whose decision to keep the material in his native English tongue, complete with attitude-filled cockney accents and strong British accents, breaths new life to the very apocalyptic world take over plans of the film's villain, and easily the best and most iconic villain of 2015, Richmond Valentine, played with such bravado and vigour by the astonishing Samuel L. Jackson. I know what your thinking. How in the hell can Jackson, whose playing a villain with a bad and wholly unnecessary lisp, offer any bravado and vigour to a role that is more comical than anything? My answer to you, is that you just watch the film and see for yourself. In addition to being one of the best aspect of Kingsman along with his highly inventive and wholly contemporary scheme to rid the virus known as mankind, Valentine, as well as the film itself, is a highly meticulous and thought-out tongue and cheek ode to the many iconic and memorable films and film villains of the early 70's and 80's. One of the best dialogues in the film, when Valentine and Hart meet for the first time, and indulge in some fine, wholly signature American cuisine, the two discuss, each of their displeased thoughts with the current state of spy, action movies. ""A spy movie is only as good as its villain"", says Valentine, in which Hart agrees formidable. I can only imagine how big of a grin screenwriters Jane Goldman and Vaughn himself had penning the script to this film with that notion in mind."

","This is one of those movies where after the it ends you will say, that was 2 hours well spent. Action begins from the go, and it is very realistic or at least they have made it look realistic on the screen, unlike some other similar movies, there is no flying or gravity defying moves here, its more of a close combat and that really intrigued me. Precision perfect stunts and amazing cinematography with a touch of humor will definitely make you come alive. The characters in the movie are really appealing, A notable candidate would be the super villain, calm,humorous and villainous all at the same time, loved his character. Even though the movie is action packed, it comes with a good story, a very good one in fact, so the bottom line is, this is a Great Movie and worth your time !"
"RforFilm","10","4","13","25 February 2015"," Kingsmen: The Secret Service is a fantastic send up to old fashioned spy thrillers that truly kicks butt!
","The last time that my dad tuned the channel to BBC, he shut off the TV, claiming that the Brit mentality had tired him out in less then five minutes. My poor father, as I'm a big fan of British television, especially of comedies like Mr. Bean and Blackadder. It might be for the funny accent as I found their sound very fancy, but it may also be for the mindset on how they process ideas. With Doctor Who and The Avengers (not the Marvel heroes, but a spy series). I've always seen their thinking as more out of the box and oddball. Who else but the British would have come up with something like Monty Python and the Holy Grail. <br/><br/>One of their most well known properties are the 007 spy movies. They too had that British set up as we had a super human that had a lot of strange gadgets, cool vehicles, and an actor that can both kick butt and be very suave. The course of the films have gone from being realistic to almost science fiction-like. This had put fans at a crossroads of where something like Skyfall would fall. For those that want a return to the more outrageous should come to Kingsmen: The Secret Service. <br/><br/>While on a mission in the Middle East, secret agent Harry Hart (played by Colin Firth) witness a fellow agent killed by enemies. He visits that family back in London where he gives a young boy a medal that has a phone number to call should he need help. We cut to years later as the boy has grown into Eggsy Unwin (played by Taron Egerton), an unemployed youth whose intelligent was once training in the royal marines. He's arrested for steeling a car and finally takes up the phone number to see what happens. <br/><br/>Eggsy get's released from jail, as paid for by Harry. With a vacant slot open, Eggsy is recruited to apply to join. He sees what Harry is capable of when he fends off a set of drunken ruffians with his fighting skills and an umbrella with gadgets. Eggsy meets up with the other possible candidates while Harry investigates billionaire Richmond Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson) with the too good to be true free cell phones and Wi-Fi he's giving away. Eggsy meets up with the head of the agency, ""Merlin"" (played by Michael Caine) but fails his next test, sending him home. But when something goes wrong and Valentine may be looking to take over the world, Eggsy may be needed to be a kingsmen after all. <br/><br/>Kingsmen: The Secret Service made me realize that it's been a while since I've seen a spy film like this; one that totally embraces the tuxedos and fine taste along with the high tech weapons and machines. The Bourne series was a more realistic spy movie and the 007 movies still have the strangeness, but relies on being more of a blend of the old and new ideas. <br/><br/>Kingsmen: The Secret Service is more of a comedy-action movie then anything. Oh there are some action scenes (some really good ones!), but I was surprised with how much fun I had with the spy sequences and the witty banter. <br/><br/>Colin Firth is one actor I would have never pictured as an action hero, but I now see that no one else could have played this guy as well as he did. Samuel L. Jackson is great as always, really loving his role as the villain. Newcomer Taron Egerton is a force as he had movies like Bond and a sassy mouth that could also lead him to be a comic star. He could go wither direction.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten umbrella guns out of ten. The Kingsmen: The Secret Service is another British creation that I hope both strikes a cord with American audiences and sparks a series."
"YoungCriticMovies","8","4","13","24 February 2015"," Kingvaughn: The Kingsvaughn: The Director Brings a Quality Action Film and Makes Colin Firth an Action Star
","Young Critic 2/18/2015 It's nice to have these kinds of surprises in the winter season of rubbish. Along with Paddington, the wide release of American Sniper, and now the surprising and bold Kingsman: The Secret Service it's turning out to be a good winter season. Going in to see Kingsman, I expected the typical action-spy thriller with the high stakes, stunts, and evil villain, but I wasn't expecting an artistically directed film with a perfect contemporary plot and courageously pushed comedy. Director Matthew Vaughn did it yet again with the help of veteran and rookie actors who pushed out of their comfort zones.<br/><br/>Kingsman is adapted from a comic series that was first published in 2011. The premise of the film is that of a young English troublemaker named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who is recruited by a Kingsman agent named Galahad (Colin Firth). The Kingsman service is basically a continuation of King Arthur's knights. They are an organization more secret and discreet than MI6, and their work goes largely unrewarded (Galahad's office is covered with the front pages of newspapers the day after all his successful missions). Eggsy is tested and evaluated along with other recruits to fill a vacant spot of a murdered Kingsman. As Eggsy trains we find out that the assassination of the Kingsman agent is Silicon Valley billionaire Valentine's (Samuel L. Jackson) fault. Valentine has an evil plan that actually ends up being less absurd and is worrying for most of the audience; it plays around with our ubiquitous smart phone usage and with the climate change problem. Valentine's plan (if you don't mind my revealing it) is that through his phone products he can trigger a violent and uncontrolled part of the human brain that would cause an unfiltered surge of violence. This evil plan would cause death and bloodshed, but it would also get rid of the problem of overpopulation, global warming, and even extinction animal species. As Valentine says: ""Humans are like a virus. When you get a virus your body heats up, trying to kill the virus, and that's what the earth is doing."" The smart line made me think of global warming in a way I hadn't before. Now of course I'm not defending or rooting for Valentine and his plan at all, I would much rather cheer for an awesome fighting Colin Firth.<br/><br/>The genius of this film comes from director Matthew Vaughn. His film resume includes Kick- Ass and X-Men: First Class, both really good films that also stood out from other action films for their boldness and originality. I admire Vaughn for being so risky with his films; in Kick-Ass he went on to mock the very genre that was becoming the highest grossing and most popular genre in the world. With First Class, he retook the decayed ­X-Men franchise (and a superhero film) and revived it by unerringly replacing the whole cast, making it a prequel, and mixing the historical, dramatic, and comedic genres. With Kingsman he avoids falling into the standard clichés, by riskily conducting his action sequences (one is a huge massacre in a church, another depicts a woman tearing down a door wanting to murder a child, exploding heads at a cocktail party that turn into fireworks) and he doesn't shy away from adult humor (usually coated or avoided by action films that want to play it ""safe""). His touches of auteur-ship are seen and faintly remind us of Tarantino with scenes such as the exploding heads one, which is tuned to ""Pomp and Circumstance,"" or with the snappy and extremely smart dialogues that seem out of place, but ground the characters' humanity. But the greatest feat of all is that Vaughn avoids being predictable, some important characters die, which you don't expect at all and there are some unseen betrayals. These surprises make us be on the edge of our seat, actually fearful for the stakes of our characters.<br/><br/>But having a great director only takes you so far; the spectacular cast was a big factor in attracting an audience and keeping their rapt attention. The star of the marketing campaign for the film was Colin Firth, but you would never expect Colin Firth to be an action star. Firth was known for his gentlemanlike roles in all his films from Love Actually to Pride and Prejudice and even in The King's Speech. In Kingsman he plays a badass secret agent, but nevertheless the role is suited for him (that's meant to be a pun). The Kingsman service is unique in that their agents dress in expensive suits and carry umbrellas, heavy rimmed glasses, and gold watches and rings. Firth fits perfectly into this agency, it was almost made for him. He succeeds not only by pulling his own stunts, but also by maintaining a cold and straight face throughout the entire film, smirking once or twice after some awesome stunt or another. If I may be so bold it was the first time that we've seen the wide range of Firth's abilities, he had been enclosed previously to one type of character. We also have the more than worthy Taron Egerton, who plays the lead role and whose transformation from London lowlife to gentleman agent is extremely smooth. I hope to see more of him, be it in future Kingsman films or in other films. Finally, we have very notable contributions from supporting actors: Michael Cane and Mark Strong, who both are Kingsmen in the film. And of course we have Samuel L. Jackson, having the time of his life playing a villain with a lisp and cackling evilly.<br/><br/>The great chemistry in the cast along with the spectacular and bold directing from Matthew Vaughn make this a needed tribute to the 007 films that at the same time spawn a quality and enjoyable franchise.

"DoubleOscar","9","4","13","23 February 2015"," An Excellent and Over the top Spy Spoof
","Kingsman is a movie that will either make you cry laughing and have your eyes peeled to the screen for every second, or it will offend and disgust you. For me, it was the first option. This movie was delightful and over the top in every sense, yet self aware. This self-awareness is what made the movie really shine for me because it played off of that a lot and created very clever jokes. As for more specifics, the villain, played by Samuel L. Jackson was hysterical and a clear homage to classic spy movies. The choreography for the actions scenes is flawless and the contrast between dialog and action gives the movie a perfect pace. Overall, Kingsman is one of the best movies of the year thus far and I look forward to what Matthew Vaughn has to offer going ahead."

No one I spoke too had a bad word for it, it was well paced and kept you involved. All the cast were good, but Samuel L Jackson was terrific. Although a certain resemblance to Bond movies, it made it's own distinctive style. I am guessing there will be a follow up."

"www-hiall","10","4","13","19 February 2015"," Kingsman: The Secret Blockbuster
","I've got to admit that this movie looks like a combo of Bond, Johnny English, and Austin Powers and this is the result. But the film however is flawless in almost every sense; good action and cast, plot was realistic, and some pretty dramatic twists that you couldn't see coming. The action is solid and entertaining to say the least, weather it be Colin Firth (Galahad) beating up thugs on his own and not breaking a sweat or Galahad just straight-up massacring a church full of Valentine's followers. The only downside to the action scenes is the obvious use of green-screen and CGI for the loss of limbs or fast punching, but that is very minor complaint compared to how well directed this film is. Also, the cast was well chosen. Sam L Jackson nails (basically) himself as a evil businessmen and Michael Caine and Colin Firth completes the classiness needed in order to be a Kingsman. The plot was great because it felt like a realistic for a comic-book movie. Finally, the 2 twists really make the you sympathize with the characters: when Valentine kills Galahad, you feel for Valentine when he says killing people is wrong or when it is revealed that Arthur joined Valentine, you see how people can be easily corrupted. Final thing, the end-credit scene is top notch. It shows Eggsy getting revenge on his mom's deadbeat boyfriend and his goons. This final scene really shows how Eggsy has evolved from being a British punk to being a well educated Kingsman.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say this movie will get a sequel and is slightly better than Bond (just Skyfall). I really want to see if SPECTRE can beat my expectations and raise the bar even further than Kingsman has done. Take care, bye-bye."
"ollemoy","10","4","13","19 February 2015"," James Bond on Steroids Equals a Masterpiece
","This movie surprised me in every way. I expected a decent action movie, instead I get a masterpiece of a movie that manages to execute its plot fantastically.<br/><br/>Today so many movies have a long beginning, introducing us to the characters and the plot, but it get's boring as nothing really happens, and so the result is just an exciting last half. Kingsman: The Secret Service however does not make you wait and begins the movie on a BANG!<br/><br/>Another thing movies tries is to have several plot lines at the same time, but it gets confusing, and they loose the audience. Kingsman, on the other hand executes this perfectly. Every plot line has a beginning, climax and a satisfying end. <br/><br/>So what is it that makes Kingsman execute everything so nicely? First of all a great cast. Colin Firth proves that he can play an action role, and performs excellent. He does his character so well its worthy of lots of awards. The rest of the cast, even the ones appearing for just a short period of time does nothing else but make the movie shine. <br/><br/>Second reason is the perfect action scenes. I thought I had seen well executed action scenes, but Kingsman takes it to another level. The reason for this is use of the camera, and the pure brutality. Every move, every punch, and gunshot was so satisfying it makes you begging for more, and they deliver. <br/><br/>But Kingsman also knows how to balance the movie, and when the movie is not hardcore action scenes it manages to stay bad-ass by having lots of humorous scenes, and exciting interactions. The plot line, twists and buildup is perfect. And just as the conversations and buildup would get boring in any other movie they perfectly time it and go back to action.<br/><br/>Lots of movies have good action, or good plot lines, but no movie has ever executed it as well as Kingsman: The Secret Service. This movie is a must watch, and should be bought on blue-ray!"
"IanAJohnson","8","4","13","14 February 2015"," This film was funny and action packed
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is a British secret agent film that calls back to the old spy films, especially the James Bond series of films. There is a lot of fun to be had in this film. The acting is great all around, even the small characters that only have a minute or so of screen time are up to par. In terms of the plot there are very few issue I had with it. The training segment was cool but there was almost no training shown on screen, just tests that took place between the training. This made it kind of jarring to see a people gain tremendous skill so fast. The music is fun and fits extremely well into the fun, over the top action scenes. This whole movie is very self-aware about how over the top it is. There are many times in the story where characters will reference old spy movies and bring up how clichéd their current situations are. The dialogue is very witty so most conversations are very interesting to listen to. There are many interesting and unique characters that I loved watching interact with each other. Some of the accents can be a little thick so I may take a little time to get used to. The action is not to be taken seriously. If you've seen the trailer you know what I am talking about. People will be hit in the face and flip a couple of times before hitting the ground. This is definitely a positive; the film definitely gained a lot from that. The villain's motivation is kind of dumb, but you can get into it because of the self-awareness of the movie. The action scenes are phenomenal. While they can be a little shaky, you can definitely see the immense skill that went into them. The editing of the action is very original and blew my mind. Be warned that this movie definitely earned that R rating. This is the source one of two real negatives with the movie. The language is just filthy but does not feel like it had to be. I am perfectly fine with some F words during action scenes. I'm sure that if I was fighting for my life I would curse, too. The problem is that people cursed constantly, even if it wasn't necessary. It didn't feel natural when people would curse about small, irrelevant things. If you want an example of a movie that utilizes cursing is a realistic way, then watch the movie Chef, or V for Vendetta. I typically don't care too much about this but there was so much cursing in inappropriate places that it began to bother me. The gore on the other hand was fine. Yes, it was pretty gross and shocking, but the film did it rarely enough and never lingered on it for long enough to really bother me. There was a very unnecessary (and very brief) nudity scene at the tail end of the film designed to be funny, but just came of as awkward. My final complaint is rather small but there is one product placement for McDonalds that was so obvious and in your face that it took me out of the scene for a while. Be sure to stay for about minute after the credits roll because there is a little scene that concludes a somewhat important arc."
"bob the moo","Null","3","9","9 October 2015"," Has interesting and intense elements, but the tonal control is surprisingly weak and generally it is a messy affair throughout (MAJOR SPOILERS)
","I had only vaguely heard things about this film when I sat to watch it and, being honest, I was of the mind that it was more aimed at younger audiences. My basis for this was that it seemed like a spy spoof with gentle humor from the brief clip I had seen. Of course very early in the film the action and language let me know this is not the case at all. From this point on we have the standard structure of the new recruit providing the narrative and also acting as the viewer's eyes as he too is introduced to the world of the secret agency. This leads into a fight to stop a typically crazy plan for world domination, and as a plot I found it perfectly enjoyable.<br/><br/>In the specifics though the film is oddly unbalanced in terms of its tone; there is an element of it trying to do that same balancing act that Kickass did, but here it does not come over so well. In some cases it is quite silly and plays to its comedic nature, but then in other ways it is very intense and dramatic with no laughs to be hand. Mostly it must be said, the film does manage to get the silliness and the violence to go together hand in hand, generally with comedic or stylistic flourishes that stop us taking it too seriously – or by killing baddies so the viewer has no moral qualms about any of it. There are examples of the opposite though, and for me the most obvious is the church scene, where we have the mass murder of civilians during a church service. The film tries to make sure the audience is prepared to go with it, by making sure we see this church being a rather vile affair preaching hatred of minorities, however it is really not enough. The scene is delivered with slick style, and an upbeat soundtrack, and feels like it should be fun – but the actual content (and my feeling on it) says that it should be horrific – because it certainly is horrific to watch. It didn't help that the US had a massive shooting a few days before I watched this (although statistically, that is never not going to be the case), but the murder of civilians in a church felt horrible (regardless of the brief highlighting of their abhorrent politics), and to have it played out in an entertaining way just did not work – it felt tone deaf, like the Kickass concept was imported but not testing to see if it fitted. This was followed by a scene of one specific violent act which was actually really well done in terms of the impact on Harry emotionally and physically – it is a great twist and an impacting moment, but like the massacre, it just didn't feel like it belonged in this film. There are other examples of this messy design, and of course the most famous is the anal sex gag right at the end. The internet is full of opinion on that so I'll not add too much; I did understand it was going for a Roger Moore Bond-style sex joke, but it wasn't funny, was delivered in a tone- deaf manner, and again it just felt totally out of place. Otherwise I though excesses like fire- work head explosions actually did work, and married violence and humor well, but the film cannot do this consistently at all.<br/><br/>The cast are good and mostly carry the film through trouble moments even if they too seem to be unsure what type of film they are making at any given moment. Firth is a great lead and plays his part well; even getting a person into the cliché. Egerton is pretty good, not least because he makes a likable character out of someone who is mostly either a chav, or a cocky arse – with the remainder of his character covering for this. Jackson is a lot of fun in the villain role, and the supporting cast is well fleshed out with turns from Strong, Davenport, Caine, Boutella, and others.<br/><br/>Generally the film does have enough going for it to make it enjoyable in a darkly violence way; it is well made and has a strong cast. The tone of the film is very uneven though, and there is some very difficult material in here (both violent and comedic) which needed a very good control to make it work – this it doesn't have and as a result it really doesn't work, often really pushing the viewer out of the film by how tone-deaf the delivery of it is. It is worth a look for what it does well, but those weaknesses are much bigger and impacting that they should be."
"Spectravideo","2","3","9","28 August 2015"," Well suited junk
","I gave this one a ""2"", solely due to the fabulous suits. Damn they look nice! But all this talk in the film about being a gentleman is poorly reflected in the dialogue and the horrendously violent action scenes. I'm sorry, but I immediately feel disgusted and come to think of all the massacres and horror that's going on in the world. I don't want to watch that as entertainment. That is just sick.<br/><br/>The movie also lacks something else: easy going, ""real"" characters. As it is, everyone behaves and talks very strange. Harry Hart, for example, is as stiff as a tree. A smile and a joke, or a witty reply to the villain would have been in order. Valentine's motives are unclear, or at least difficult to understand, and so are many of the other characters actions too. They just don't seem real, any of them, except Eggsy, who is very well played by Egerton.<br/><br/>I love spy movies, but this one could have been much better with a different approach. As it is, it's more or less junk and leaves a bitter after-taste due to the violence."

The spy girl that went out to the moon is hot as hell too. His mom played nice role. <br/><br/>What I hated about the movie is that the music background didn't fit most of the themes. You should have choose better EDM songs. But anyway the movie isn't about music or soundtracks.

"bryank-04844","9","3","9","12 August 2015"," 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is completely awesome and probably the most fun you'll have with a film this early on in the year.
","I can officially say that the first AWESOME, s movie of 2015 is finally here, which is 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. Based on Mark Millar's comic book, director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Snatch) has once again delivered the goods and high entertainment value with an homage to spy films, particularly the 'James Bond' franchise. So what's that mean? It means the guy who made 'Kick-Ass' and produced 'Snatch', made his own version of 'James Bond', and it's as violent and gory and funny as his other films I mentioned.<br/><br/>What works so well with 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', besides the fun acting, incredible fight choreography, stunning camera work, and over-the-top characters, is that it's self-aware of exactly the type of movie it is and wants to be. It even goes so far as to mention the 007 agent a few times and talk about the usual spy genre movie tropes and how this is completely different, which of course it is. I only wish I could go back and watch this for the first time all over again.<br/><br/>There isn't anything really new here as far as story goes, but how it's executed and delivered is as fresh as the morning snow. In London, there is a super secret service, made up of highly trained and intelligent people called the 'Kingsman', which on the outside is a storefront for very fashionable clothing, but is rather a spy agency that comes with all the fancy weapons and gadgets. This elite group is headed up by Arthur King (Michael Caine), and we center on one of the agents named Harry (Colin Firth). As this group tours the world, stopping bad guys, it's bound to happen that some super agents will bite the dust, hence a need for new recruits.<br/><br/>This is where a young man named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) steps in as a new recruit and has a forgotten relationship with Harry. A good chunk of the film is spent in a dangerous and highly entertaining training camp sequence where Eggsy along with other possible recruits try to attain the role of Kingsman. These training sequences put Navy SEALS boot camp to shame. Meanwhile, a billionaire guy named Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a hilarious lisp) has invented a microchip to make the internet and phone calls free for everyone. In fact, the microchip is free itself and available to the everyone, everywhere. But Valentine has a secret diabolical plan in play with these microchips that just might kill everyone on Earth.<br/><br/>So now the Kingsman must step up to the plate and prevent this from happening, and needless to say, things hits the fan in the most gruesome and fun way imaginable. Some of you might think Colin Firth is not the right man for a character who can kick anyone's butt in two seconds or chop a dozen heads off in one swing, but I'm here to tell you that you're completely wrong. Firth is a maniac, period. He owns this role with strong charisma, wit, and elegance. It's like if his older roles from some period romance project he did, finally grew a pair of giant balls and found an underground arsenal of giant guns and was programmed to kill anything and anyone in matter of seconds.<br/><br/>That's how Firth plays this role, and I couldn't get enough of him. Taron Egerton does a great job here too as the punk kid with a bad home life with a heart of gold, who changes his tune and becomes the person he was supposed to be. And boy, is he rewarded at the end of the film too for his accomplishments. Unfortunately, there are not any snakes or sharks here for Samuel L. Jackson to be afraid of, but lucky for us, this is a highly energetic and flamboyant role for Jackson, unlike anything we've ever seen him in. His lisp is golden and hilarious, his fear of blood, vomit, and violence causes huge belly laughs, and his love for McDonald's hamburgers and fries hit all the right notes. It's the classic over-the-top James Bond villain here, and Jackson played him perfectly.<br/><br/>And if you're a fan of the fight scenes from 'Kick-Ass', meaning the no-cut, one-shot camera movement to capture all the decapitations, blood, kicks, and punches, then you'll greatly enjoy the fight choreography here. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is completely awesome and probably the most fun you'll have with a film this early on in the year."

","I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. It was quite refreshing to go into this movie not quite knowing what to expect and being astounded at the great acting and directing. Brilliant action sequences mixed with great humor set this spy movie apart from any other spy movie I've ever seen. While most spy movies are all about the action and drama, and most spoof spy movies are all about the comedy of poking fun at the spy genre, this movie has a breathtaking balance of action that will keep you on the edge of your seat, as well as some great comedy that will be having you grab your gut with laughter and joy. It is surprisingly violent especially in some scenes (especially involving churches) which is a welcome surprise with the way the action is shot. Definitely a surprise, but a very very welcome one. 10 outta 10."
"connorsimmo-78859","8","3","9","1 August 2015"," An awesome fun film with great acting and memorable violence
","I didn't see Kingsman in cinemas. I was at a store, saw it on sale and picked it up. I didn't expect to much, yeah it had Colin Firth and Samuel L Jackson on the cover but i still thought it would be a boring 007 knockoff. Boy was i wrong. This film is awesome! It had a cool plot, great action and an awesome cast. Seriously, i don't think that there was a weak cast member. All the performances were solid especially Taron Egerton as Eggsy. I went into the film expecting a film aimed at teen audiences but this film easily earns its R rating. There is one particular scene which depicted some extremely graphic violence. It caused controversy but it sort of acts as a statement that this film is not for kids. They handled the scene in a comedic way which at least makes it enjoyable to watch. Its scenes like this however, that make the film so memorable. I say definitely check it out. Its my movie of the year so far. Great entertainment!"
"lampic","9","3","9","1 August 2015"," Very entertaining
","Unexpectedly entertaining movie - honestly, I assumed this will be just another run-of-the- mill action boom-bang-a-bang but it turned out it was compulsive watching with lots of humor that affectionately pokes fun at James Bond. It has all the ingredients of usual clichés (elegant mentor leading young unknown and green talent trough procedures that would create another super-hero) and it works wonderfully as everybody obviously had lots of fun while making this, specially Colin Firth who for once steps out of the box where directors so often forced him to be just another romantic lover in historical costumes - you can clearly see his joy of being allowed to do something different and here, for a change he is a bad ass who fights, breaks bones left and right and all of this without ever losing his suave posture. His young protégé is Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who metamorphoses from poor London boy in sneakers into another elegant secret agent and has just the right charisma to carry on the rest of the movie. There are also obligatory celebrities (Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Caine) but honestly the movie would work with anybody in these roles. There is no point in taking this movie seriously and trying to find any deep meaning - critics are collectively praising it for being entertaining, funny, full of action and lots of car crashes so it is really a good, old fashioned cinematic action extravaganza that screams for sequels."
"EzioMonty117","10","3","9","17 July 2015"," A violent, funny and exciting action thriller for adults
","Kingsman: Secret Service is fantastic, it just delivers a lot of thrills and violence that it is nearly unbelievable, this film is one of the best of 2015. I saw this the first time when i was on a plane, i saw the airline version.<br/><br/>The plot is about how a promising street kid whose mom is poor with an abusive father and a baby, joins the Kingsman to stop a Tech genius from using a Sim-card, which allows free-internet to cause people to go insane and go on a murderous rampage, it's up to Eggsy, the street kid to stop him and his assistant from releasing the Sim-card to the public.<br/><br/>The film is very good, so good in fact, it's much better than any other Matthew Vaughn Movie before that. The script in this Movie is both funny and well written, while the performances are top notch, the film just falls flat when compared to it's likable characters, most of the characters are good, but some can be forgotten.<br/><br/>The violence is good, but there's just too much of it, it's like Kick-Ass just not as realistic. The shout-out for the film is of course Colin Firth, he is fantastic, he delivers the lines perfectly. The film is also funny, some scenes made me laugh like the part where Galahad said he was a Catholic whore and where the dinner at the Meeting with the villain was McDonalds Food.<br/><br/>The Church scene is if not the most violent scene i've seen in a action-comedy, this seen includes every single ways to die as possible, impalement, shooting, getting fire in the hair, Axe and stabbing.<br/><br/>When i saw the trailer for this Movie, i didn't expect it to be that violent, literally. When i saw the trailer, i thought it was a PG-13 Movie, but i was wrong, it's violent, rude and has sexual References.<br/><br/>Kingsman: Secret Service is a fantastic film, the Music, action scenes, script, acting, characters and plot is great, despite the violence being a bit much innit (pun intended) and a few character Development issues, otherwise great Movie, recommended for the People who are sensitive.<br/><br/>10/10"

","My son reckoned I wouldn't like this movie, but I did and would have watched it a second time but fell asleep. Action plus, great cast, special effects and as the director mentioned, one has to have a nasty villain that made the 007 movies so great.<br/><br/>I don't know if they can follow it up with a second sequel but they will have to follow it up with a great cast someone to replace Arthur (Michael Caine) and Colin Firth (Gallahad).<br/><br/>I thought the script and editing were brilliant, it brought smiles too my face, especially the ending. ""Good manners maketh the man"". It does, even though he might be a dangerous person inwardly if one crossed him badly. In other words, he or she, doesn't wear their heart on their sleeve and only attacks the unworthy.<br/><br/>I loved the approach and theme, and hope they dare to make a sequel that would also get a 10 out of 10. To coin a phrase, it will be a hard act to follow, but well done. About time the great spy movies got some humour in them, as they are what we would like reality to be, but unfortunately it isn't."
"TxMike","Null","3","9","12 July 2015"," Mostly entertaining but taken down by pervasive filthy language.
","What is it with the British, at least the way they are mostly characterized in these kinds of movies? Is there an edict that all the characters have to use the F-word several times in any conversation? Now I understand the concept of using language that will help make dialog seem realistic, but just like too much pepper will ruin a steak, too much pervasive peppery language can ruin a script. It makes the movie less interesting and less entertaining.<br/><br/>The movie is adapted from the comic book. Young actor Taron Egerton is in the role of Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin who is smart and talented but seemingly wasting his life with petty misbehaviors of various kinds. He is given a chance for redemption when he is among 9 young men and young women to train for a select secret organization. When he is successful he is expected to save the world. <br/><br/>Nothing in this movie is plausible, it is all over-the-top stuff. Samuel Jackson plays an evil guy who is hatching a plot to thin out the world's population. If it had been less ""dirty"" it would have been a much better movie. It also has lots of violence.<br/><br/>DVD from my public library."

I feel like I am gushing in this review, but this really is a must-see movie for anyone that enjoys action packed thrillers with just the right touch of humor.<br/><br/>There is violence to be sure, but it is done in such a way, that is entirely unobjectionable and even farcical - but in the most enjoyable manner. Colin Firth is the perfect choice for Galahad and Samuel L.

"brchthethird","9","3","9","4 July 2015"," Hugely entertaining and loads of fun
","KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is one of those movies that grabs you by the stones and doesn't let go until the credits roll. I haven't seen any of the spy films that it pays homage to, but if they're anything like this I'll get right on it. The basic story is about a young man, Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who joins a super-secret spy organization, helps save the world, and becomes a better person in the process. The entire cast did an incredible job playing their characters. You have seasoned veterans like Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson. And then there is newcomer Taron Egerton, who is a revelation. He has a suave, cool attitude to him that really sold the character he played. Not only were the performances excellent all-round, the actors looked like they were having a great time, which spills over onto the audience as a result. The action sequences, an important part of a film like this, were also really good. Matthew Vaughn has a way with kinetic action (see: LAYER CAKE, KICK-ASS) and he delivers that here. Although the editing and camera-work pushes the boundaries of comprehensibility, the geography of each scene was never in question. The crown jewel of these is a scene in a church set to Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird. If you aren't on-board with the film at this point, maybe it isn't for you. If there's anything that be said negatively about the film, the characterization of the villain might not sit well with some people. There also was quite a lot of CGI enhancement. And, there's one sexual joke/scene towards the end that could come off as crass, but I thought it was consistent with the type of film this was trying to be. Generally speaking, all of the complaints that could be made of the film have (to me, at least) a valid explanation. It's a highly entertaining film with a good story, excellent action, and a great sense of humor. Just sit back and enjoy the ride!"
"peterp-450-298716","8","3","9","4 July 2015"," Everything that's missing in a Bond movie ...
","I am offering you the opportunity to become a Kingsman. A tailor? A Kingsman agent. Like a spy? Of sorts. Interested? You think I've got anything to lose?<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of Bond films. Too clean, too boring and too stiff. And there was always Q who came up with some new inventions and coincidentally they came in handy in that movie. I would love to own his crystal ball. Also, every movie was stuffed with action, but you'd never see a speck of blood (Before all Bond fans react furiously: I admit that I haven't seen all Bond-movies. So I could be wrong on that part). And in every film a bunch of gorgeous ladies paraded around, but I've never seen a millimeter of offensive nudity. ""Kingsman : The Secret Service"" feels like a James Bond flick, but then provided with all these last-mentioned facts and an excessive dose of humor.<br/><br/>Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is a member of ""The Kingsmen"", an espionage organization, which is even more secret than the secret service itself, that gets all the dirty jobs from MI6. Hart is a genuine Englishman and looks more like a distinguished businessman or banker than a master spy. During an operation in the Middle East, the father of Gary ""Eggsy"" (Taron Egerton) got killed, after which Hart gives this toddler a medal that could be useful in the future. 17 years later, during the kidnapping of a professor by the multi millionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), another secret agent is killed during the rescue operation. Hart recommends Eggsy (grown up, unemployed and no prospects) as a candidate to join ""The Kingsmen "".<br/><br/>The whole film has the atmosphere of an old spy movie like James Bond or ""The Avengers"", a popular series from the 70's with John Steed as a secret agent who faithfully wore a bowler and was equipped with an ordinary umbrella with all sorts of ingenious gadgetry. Compared with the civilized manners in those days, ""Kingsman"" is rather brutal and radical. Don't get me wrong. Hart is an example of courtesy and attempts to be as reserved and correct as possible, regardless of the situation he finds himself in, as befits a true Brit. But it's mainly the dissolute tone and graphic violence that makes the difference. The film sometimes tends to take on Tarantino-like proportions. The fragment in the local church is such an example. 3 Minutes of rage swirling across your screen with Hart acting as a purebred John Wick. Or the scene in the local pub where he demonstrates equivalent fighting techniques as ""The Equalizer"". Colin Firth doesn't look particularly like a well-oiled fighting machine and some movements look rigid, but all in all this 55-year was convincing enough. He proves that besides serious roles full of drama as in ""Devil's Knot"" and ""The Railway Man"", he's capable to handle lighthearted, action-packed roles as well.<br/><br/>When Eggsy begins the grueling training, with annoying rich kids as opponents, I was afraid it would lead to a kind of ""Ender's Game"" or ""Divergent"" story. Fortunately, this wasn't the case. The whole training proceeded under the watchful eye of Merlin (Mark Strong). The only thing that was a bit unbelievable for me, was the fact that an inexperienced teenager as Eggsy, whose most exciting life experience so far was peeing against an electric cattle fence, can grow out into an experienced parachutist in such short period. However I tolerated this since this action comedy doesn't take itself seriously in the first place. And also lets mention Michael Caine, as the Godfather of all Kingsmen, who perfectly took upon himself the role of ancien.<br/><br/>In a real spy movie, a bad guy shouldn't be missing obviously. This part was played with visible pleasure by Samuel L. Jackson as the lisping multimillionaire Richmond Valentine who worries about the future of the earth. In particular, the global warming, concerns him. For this, however, he has devised a diabolical plan. Only the implementation of this plan is inadequate. Jackson is peerless in this role (About time after a few feeble performances) as the eccentric Valentine who can't stand seeing a drop of blood and tends to lose consciousness in that case. To avoid this, he has a graceful assistant called Gazelle (Sofia Boutella). A true fury and fighting machine with razor-sharp legs with the necessary amputated limbs as a result. Finally, also a honorable mention for Hanna Alström as the Swedish princess. She didn't need much acting talent, but her graceful butt was prominently displayed in the end.<br/><br/>""Kingsman: The secret service"" is a must see movie. Do you enjoy a touch of dry English humor, overly bloody action moments and all of this with a wink to the great spy movies of yesteryear ? Surely this film is made for you. Brace yourself for this espionage which contains brute force as well as humor. And it doesn't avoid well known clichés, but still brings them in a different way so that you actually won't notice it really. Magistrale movie !<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

With a lot of Hollywood action films, fights are slow and cumbersome, while a fight in this film is at high speed signalling well practised choreography.<br/><br/>The script is fine, with the various scenes that encourage rooting for the ""blue collar makes good"" are easy to spot but all the actors play their parts well, at the very least. Samuel L Jackson puts in a non standard performance while Colin Firth plays the cultured agent shtick with pizazz. Sofia Boutella makes an impression though sheer audacity and physicality, though at the end of the show i did not even remember her character's name (if it was given).

Be that as it may though, this movie I felt. Not having seen a trailer it took me by complete surprise, like a long awaited answer to a primal yearning would, filling a hole in my conscious desires with heaps of guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>My attempts at resisting the charm of the script's self awareness proved futile, not just in respect to the explicit meta references, but also in Deus Ex Machina appearing as a projection of the viewer's voyeuristic appetites, an ever-present companion who is dying to cheer with us and proudly admits the simplicity of it's nature, the very same way the protagonist proclaims awareness of the euphemism behind his desire to drink a glass of plain old Gin."

"nicolas-232-828687","Null","3","9","7 June 2015"," Brutally Entertaining.. Kill Bill meets James Bond meets Wrong Turn
","This movie was based from the Comic Book, ""The Secret Service"". I have not read the comic book so I do not know anything about this movie. I was expecting somewhat a Spy Kids type of movie. What with the lead character being on his teen (or at least he still looks like his on his teen). You wouldn't expect something ""BONDish"", BOURNEish"" or ""MIsh"".<br/><br/>But lo and behold.....this movie is not for kids.. definitely. Limbs are flying everywhere, a human torso was cut into pieces, heads blown off....it's just like James Bond meets Wrong Turn out there. Though you can't actually say the premise as being too dark, I can safely say that it juggles between being serious and being comedic..<br/><br/>The movie is about a young man's (fondly called ""Eggy"" by his peers) journey on being a Secret Service agent for the secret group only known by their name, Kingsman where the agents names were taken from Camelot's Knights of the round table. He is to follow on the footstep of his deceased father who died heroically in one mission.<br/><br/>Unlike most movies where the main hero passes the test, this one chooses a different path. Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton) was made an agent not because he qualified but because he needs to be qualified given the predicament. By the way, I didn't find much significance between the agents training and their soon to be missions. The training and tests are just there I think as training and tests. That's all. I also find the training on caring for a dog and then as a final test, you'll need to kill that dog truly odd. Though there were blank bullets, I'd say, this test is stupid. The teens are being trained as agents and not as assassins. This portion of the movie reminds me of Azumi part 1 and Naked Weapon where part of the assassin's final training is to kill their partners. The final test in those movies is just appropriate given the fact that the protagonists are being groomed to kill without mercy. The agent's training in this movie is supposed to be on becoming a hero and to protect others. Why the hell would they be tested to kill a dog and then fail if they couldn't? It didn't make sense at all.<br/><br/>I will not go on into so much details. The movie is fun. It was a thrill ride from beginning to end. The action sequence are spectacular. The fight scenes are wonderfully choreographed especially those from Valentine's (name of the main villain played by Samuel Jackson) female assassin, Gazelle. Not to be outdone with were those coming from Eggsy as well as action sequences from Collin Firth who plays the role of Galahad, Eggsy's mentor. You may compare them with Kill Bill's but more fast pace.<br/><br/>It's a fun fun fun movie, the music is great, you'll love it. But if you're not into movies of the violent kind, stay away from this one."

","Roaring, overly indulgent fun amidst the rubble of the classic spy films and programs that dominated the 1960s. It's a more deadpan, action-focused take than Austin Powers, of course, but I'd hardly venture to call it serious. The tone is decidedly carefree, which should be no surprise given the creative team's track record. Director Matthew Vaughan and comic book author Mark Millar, who teamed to bring Kick-Ass to the screen a few years ago, are also the guilty parties in this case, and it's right in the same ballpark. Tons of effective punchlines, a few really great cornerstone action sets, and a wide spectrum of colors to cover for a very simple, shallow, recycled plot. And it works, honestly, both as a standalone mind-number and as a winking, grinning, elbowing satire of Bond and company. For my money it lingers too long in the training room, but once the cast graduates it's basically balls-to-the-wall the rest of the way home. Gratifying if not nourishing, like the big McDonald's spread enjoyed by a certain nameless character in a key scene, I had a great time but felt a little guilty about it later. The chapel brawl and the series of colorful explosions at the film's climax are two spots I'll have a hard time forgetting, though, and I feel like I'm richer for having experienced them."

","The movie is entertaining. But I wonder how the rating of the movie is 8(out of 10)!!! Because too many dumb people rated this movie higher. It should get at most 6.5. A simple observation that, the ""main problem"" of the storyline is a usual one. That's ""Saving the mankind from a devil-minded genius"". That is too much old and assumable. There are also some lacking of logic in keeping secrets of a secret service agency. So I thing the rating of the movie is for Business purpose or too many people under aged people saw it and rated it. <br/><br/>BTW ""romance with the princess"" reminds me ""007"". Also the fighting in church made me a little ferocious"
"srinikethan","5","3","9","24 May 2015"," C'mon,i thought we did away with this genre after spy kids...
","I expected so much much from the actors (Colin Firth, Nick Fury, Alfred, Luke Skywalker), you have got to set certain standards. I would say Colin Firth came out on top from the big four with a class act and others were pathetically under-utilized (point one). You see Bond - style introductions to everyone and then the movie deteriorates to a cross between Austin Powers and Spy Kids. <br/><br/>If you enjoy some violence though, you will get your money's worth, sickening killing scenes in there. I enjoyed some of the action sequences and hence the 5/10. The film was awful - the script was crazy and oft-seen to the point of being so predictable. The character eggsy is a classic Karate Kid role and a stupid kid turns out a great warrior at the end, you should be a movie virgin to not see that coming!<br/><br/>Samuel Jackson as the bad guy is so dumb and he might as well be sucking on a lollipop through the movie, that's how stupid his character seems. Michael Caine has so much less screen time than in first half hour of Nolan movies but then refer point one. Mark Hamill should have been drunk when he accepted the cameo and you feel sorry for Samuel Jackson to be a part of this movie. If you wanna watch, have very low expectations and you might just scrape through.<br/><br/>In the same genre, have you seen this series ""The Middleman (2008)"" - I strongly suggest you do, only a handful of people have seen it before it got cancelled. It is an excellent example of how good this movie could have been.."
"ironhorse_iv","8","3","9","31 March 2015"," It's good to be King! Kingsman: The Secret Service is over the top, fun.
","This movie is a love letter to the old school bizarre campy spy films, while also reenergize the genre to the mature audience, by keeping it modern and smart. Without spoiling it, the movie is full of movie references. Too many to list, here. The movie is also full with satire comedy wit, reverence melodrama, and hyper-violence action. Kingman has the right amount of realistic, and camp value to be entertaining for the most part. Directed by Matthew Vaughn, and loosely based on the comic book The Secret Service by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. The movie tells the story of Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton), a young trouble man, who might end up for a life behind bars. However, he is saved by an old friend of his late father, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), whom recognizes potential in the youth and recruits him to be a trainee in the secret service organization call the Kings Men. Meanwhile, villainous Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) launches a diabolical plan to solve the problem of over-population by worldwide killing spree. Can Harry and Eggsy stop the madman or will Valentine's plan come to light. Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, every character, every frame, and nearly every line of dialogue is delivered with a hilarity tongue in cheek, brash motion. Newcomer Taron Egerton was pretty good as Eggsy. The trailer of this film, make it seem like his character was an unlikeable thug, but I'm pretty glad, that they didn't go that way. Eggsy is coarse and prone to fights, and at first glance appears to be a typical Lower-Class Lout, but he's also protective of his mother and sister, has a deep well of kindness and loyalty to animals, and wants to do right by others. Colin Firth works great as the mentor, Harry. Firth is the veteran actor, with a smooth, proper British charm, but also a deadly operator. His ability as an action hero is amazing. The church scene with him, alone, is worth the price of admission. I love Samuel L. Jackson's character. Valentine is a very friendly, cheerful, and charismatic man who cares about the world so much that he's willing to kill most of humanity to save it. He's also appalled by the violence and afraid of blood. I love how Valentine discusses various tropes of Tuxedo and Martini Spy Fiction: like the James Bond series with various characters over the course of the film, showing how dangerously, he can be. I haven't saw, many of those types as villains, before. One thing, I didn't like about the character is the lisp. It was kinda annoying. It kept coming in and out. His henchwoman, Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) is very intense. She really look like she could take down the hero. The fight toward the end in the dance floor, was good. I love how they adapt dance moves to the fighting style. The movie has this stylized action and design that people will clearly love or hate. I think the endless parade of so-over-the-top-that-it's-almost-cartoonish violence; is pretty cool, but kinda jarring. Don't get me wrong, I love how the action sequence are shot: very clear, without shaking cam, and quick cuts, but the violence and its choice of using blood is a bit confusing. It's a bit odd, that anything worse than a gunshot wound is remarkably clean. Most notably, when person is cut in half or head explode, it does not result in a single drop of blood. It's gruesome, no matter what. The movie language is also harsh, and the movie's odd sexual ending, might offend some. Still, it makes me wonder, why the movie didn't try to go for a hard Rated R. It seem that the movie was trying to go PG-13, but change its mind, half-way, through filming. Another fault of the movie might, to be how loose the adaptation is, compare to the comic book. They took a lot of artistic license on this story. A lot of things have change, big time. Gary London becomes Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin. Gary's Uncle Jack is no longer his uncle, and is renamed Harry Hart. The Secret Agents become referred to by codenames derived from Arthurian legend, so they might retain their names if they aren't ever called by their real ones. Characters like Sir Giles and Rupert Greaves in the comic are no more. They form Merlin (Mark Strong) and Arthur (Michael Caine), respectively. The villains change, also. Gazelle was a man in the comic. The character of Mark Hamill is combined with the character of James Arnold played by Mark Hamill. Much of James Arnold remains in the form of a new character, Richmond Valentine. Another thing, annoying from the film is the product placement. McDonald's being eaten by the villain. Come on! The movie has a great movie score by Henry Jackman & Matthew Margeson. It was easy listening. The movie made good use of establish songs such as Dire Straits' ""Money for Nothing"" in the intro, and Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Freebird"" during the church massacre. KC and the Sunshine Band's ""Give It Up"" was also rocking! Director Matthew Vaughn expressed interest in a sequel if the film did well at the box office - as the film exceeded all box office expectations it is a definite possibility. I hope, they do. Overall: Despite, the large amount of violence. The movie does have an enduring message with the quote, 'Manners maketh man' meaning, class and money aren't what define you -- your character does. Loyalty and hard work are rewarded. This movie is a must-watch. I do recommended."
"ThomasDrufke","9","3","9","13 February 2015"," Everything You Hope For And More
","Part of the genius of Matthew Vaughn's films is his ability to blend genres. Whether it was First Class, Kick-Ass, or even The Debt, he has time and time showed just how versatile he can be. This film is straight up awesome. I found myself laughing at just how ridiculous it was, but it worked. The film is also incredibly funny by itself make no mistake about it. It's also very self aware, much like the Fast & Furious franchise, in that it toys with the fact that it knows it's insane and has fun with it.<br/><br/>I have to say though, I didn't have high hopes when they announced the film a few years back. Why would Vaughn leave Days of Future Past to work on some film called Kingsman? Luckily, both films turned out to be terrific. The casting directors also deserve a lot of credit for finding Taron Egerton. Talk about a young kid who should probably be looked at for the new Peter Parker, man does he have talent. He also has something that other possible candidates don't necessarily have, which is comedic chops. This film has more laugh out loud moments than the recent SpongeBob film. Samuel L Jackson gives us many of those humorous scenes, as this is probably the best he has been in quite some time. His trusty Bond villain-esque sidekick is also a bright spot. Or perhaps the cinematography and special effects crew should be credited for just how seamless these action scenes are. This is likely the closest we will ever get to a non Gareth Evans Raid film.<br/><br/>The film is also impeccably unpredictable. It's refreshingly to see the action genre get revamped a little bit. Even the best action films can be predictable at times. It's funny because I feel like I should have seen some of the twists and turns coming, but it's a tribute to Vaughn's directing that I didn't. Some may say that the action can be a little bit too over-the-top even for a film that acknowledges it's own boundary-pushing. There was one moment where I thought it probably didn't need to take it that far, but it was still immensely entertaining. I really do hope that this spawns a franchise. Egerton has a lot of potential, and this world deserves to be explored further. It's a film that even my sister, who isn't particularly a fan of these types of films, really enjoyed the experience. It's a much better choice than that one other film people are seeing this weekend...<br/><br/>+Egerton's surprisingly good performance <br/><br/>+Samuel L hasn't been this entertaining in years <br/><br/>+Unpredictable <br/><br/>+Over-the-top action works<br/><br/>+Potential franchise <br/><br/>-Don't get too obsessed with that ridiculousness<br/><br/>9.3/10"
"sweetboyy_99","8","3","9","13 February 2015"," Dear God, Please Let There Be A Sequel
","I went into the theater with very high expectations. The movie exceeded those expectations. Honestly, me and my buddies were just bored and wanted to watch a nice action movie. What we got was so much more. This movie had some of the best camera-work, special effects and style I've ever seen in an action movie. With effects and camera-work that would put The Matrix to shame this is a result of passionate and hard work. Without giving anything away, the script was actually more than acceptable. Nothing spectacular, but nothing too predictable either. The humor in this film was very clever and didn't feel out of place at all. It was a perfect blend of action and humor. The actors did an amazing job and the directing was splendid. I could not ask for more. I'm not even kidding! I was pleasantly surprised. This movie has to feature one of the most amazing fighting scenes ever, I sh*t you not. The way it is edited looks awesome and it all just kicks ass! The CGI is used wisely and the movie doesn't overly depend on CGI which was a pleasant surprise. Long story short, me and my mates laughed our asses off through the entire movie, and we were glued to the screen with excitement watching those adrenalin-pumped scenes. The best part of this is that this movie fits anyone! Teens enjoy it. Adults do too. Male and female. It's really a great film. I am going to watch this movie again soon and hopefully when it comes out, I'll be buying it on Blu-Ray. It deserves a great rating!!<br/><br/>I'm hoping, and I do think that it's going to happen, for a sequel. Since the title has a sub- title, I'm guessing there'll be more movies. I'm hoping for some more, I am thirsty for more! Go watch it. Now. You won't regret it. (Unless you're a bigot or a Christian who can't take a joke, that is. I warned ye.)<br/><br/>It gets a strong 8 out of 10. :)"
"dmhughes-448-695102","9","3","9","13 February 2015"," Another Great And Hyper-Violent Mark Millar Comic Book Adaptation
","If there is one individual who has most recently become a true legend in the world of comic book writing, then it would have to be Mark Millar. With works like Nemesis, Kick-Ass, Wanted, Marvel's Civil War, Old Man Logan, and Ultimate X-Men and Fantastic Four under his belt, Millar has managed to follow in the footsteps of classic comic book writers like Alan Moore, Frank Miller, Will Eisner, and Neil Gaimen, and like many of these artists, Millar has been able to see and even assist in watching many of his works be adapted for the silver screen.<br/><br/>For Millar, film adaptations of his work have had mixed, but interesting degrees of success. Wanted (2008) was a stylish and adrenaline-pumping experience with some great performances by Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman, but I do admit that the actual film was an awful adaptation considering the story and characters had almost nothing to do with the comic. Kick-Ass (2010) was a gleefully violent, hilarious, and faithful adaptation of Millar's work that helped jumpstart the careers of Chloë Grace Moretz and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, not to mention it featured the last truly impressive performance by Nicolas Cage, and while Kick-Ass 2 (2013) was far inferior to its predecessor, it was still a decent adaptation. <br/><br/>Now we have Kingsman: The Secret Service (2015), which while only loosely based on Millar's The Secret Service, is still a funny, well-acted, and beautifully ridiculous action film that more Hollywood studios should observe and copy in the future. Also, this film should make Liam Neeson nervous; he's not the only older actor who can pull off action movie roles. Welcome to the action ring, Colin Firth!<br/><br/>The plot of Kingsman is very much in the same vein as a classic James Bond film, and the film is not afraid to make fun at Bond's expense (or even Jason Bourne for that matter). The film focuses on Eggsy (Taron Egerton), an unemployed London resident who has a cowardly mother and an abusive stepfather, and has spent his entire life giving up in situations where he could have easily succeeded (school, the military, etc.). After getting arrested by the police, Eggsy makes contact with a long-lost ally, Harry Hart/Galahad (Colin Firth), who happens to be a member of an organization known as the Kingsman: individuals who pose as sophisticated tailors and businessmen who in reality have become the new ""Knights of the Round Table"", and work to protect the world and keep it in balance. <br/><br/>Eggsy is then offered a chance to become a Kingsman like his late father before him, and must compete with other hopeful (and privileged) candidates like Roxy (Sophie Cookson), all the while under the watchful eye of Merlin (Mark Strong), a senior Kingsman and trainer. Meanwhile, Galahad, under orders from Chester King/Arthur (Michael Caine), is sent to investigate lisp-ridden billionaire, philanthropist and tech tycoon Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) and his bladed prosthetic leg-equipped assistant Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), who seek to drive the world into chaos and create a new world order, and eventually Eggsy and Roxy have to join the fight, and gleeful violence and action ensues.<br/><br/>The plot is clearly inspired by the James Bond films of old, but director Mathew Vaughn and long-time collaborator and writer Jane Goldman, who've created excellent films like Stardust (2007), Millar's Kick-Ass (2010), and X-Men: First Class (2011), manage to keep the film deliciously retro and fresh. The story is great, the action is frenetic and edgy, and reminded me of Vaughn's previous work in Kick-Ass, and the performances are all excellent. Firth is great as Galahad, and I would love to see him star in more action films. Egerton and Cookson are solid in their roles, and it'll be interesting to see what future starring roles they'll partake in. Strong, Jackson, Caine, and Boutella all have moments to shine in the film. Mark Hamill and Jack Davenport are also funny in roles that could be chalked up as cameos, but their roles are important in driving the plot forward.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have with the film are that in some instances the special effects are decent, but you can tell that they are just CGI. The same held true with Kick-Ass, and even X-Men: First Class; Vaughn is able to craft great movies on relatively small budgets, but focuses more on using great actors and a story rather than effects, and there is nothing wrong with that. It's just on a few occasions the effects were so obvious that I was pulled out of the experience. Also, while the humor in the film is really great, there were one or two moments where the comedy felt designed to be shocking and perverse but in no way to drive the plot forward, but that's mostly a warning for anyone who doesn't like seeing those kinds of things. <br/><br/>Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a fantastic action flick with a great story, excellent acting performances, awesome humor, and some jaw-dropping action scenes. If James Bond were to ever become rated R and hyper-violent, I think this would be the film to copy. Also, like Kick-Ass, Vaughn knows how to use classic rock songs in his action sequences. In my opinion, Vaughn and Goldman are the two individuals who are able to make excellent and worthy film adaptations of Mark Millar's work, and Kingsman is no different. Simply put, it's one of the best action films of the past few years, and should be seen by any fan of the action/spy/comic book movie genre."
"ree-bee103","9","3","9","9 February 2015"," Daring, talented fun, but too violent for sensitive viewers!
","From the very start, you can tell this movie is on a whole other level to most of the stuff coming out of Hollywood nowadays. From the innovative opening credits to the perfect comedic timing with EVERY line, it's fast paced without being in the least hard to follow. I loved the edgy new take this movie had on the spy theme. I loved it because like my favourite James Bond movies from decades ago, it doesn't take itself too seriously. I loved the main character Eggzy, with his street gait and kinda sexy cockney accent, and I LOVED Colin Firth as a spy. He was as gentlemanly as ever and BECAUSE of this, he was really interesting as an ultra violent fighter. And of course the villains were extremely bright characters, my boyfriend couldn't suppress giggles the whole time Samuel L Jackson was on screen. However, the ever increasing violence was too much for me. The church massacre scene I found out of place and tasteless, and it completely ruined my enjoyment for the talent this movie had to show. It made me feel complete terror at how desensitized to violence Hollywood expects its viewers to be. MOST of us normal people don't find that amount of killing acceptable or ""funny"", and it just made me feel sick for the rest of the movie. Someone in the movie theatre said aloud ""What are we watching?"" and I think a couple people left. Despite that however, you can tell love, hard work, and lots and lots of guts and talent went into making this movie and no one left the movie theatre indifferent. I recommend it for anyone who can stomach violence!"

","Just a little note to highlight the fact that this is not just Bond, there are other classic Brit spies in there ones that were actually superior to Bond but never got the 'success'. One is Harry Palmer (who was an 'anti-bond'), who was actually played by a much younger Michael Caine in the 60's, (Ipcress File, Funeral in Berlin)all set against a cold war background. The glasses in particular are Harry's. Another screen spy was John Steed from the Avengers (not Marvel Avengers !) and New Avengers, played by Patrick Mcnee, I think I have heard that this is getting remade shortly for the big screen.

"a_reubin","10","3","9","30 January 2015"," The spy version of Kick Ass
","Wrote this elsewhere. Copying cause I don't feel like doing a new one<br/><br/>I'll start this by saying that this may not be for everyone. Metacritic currently has it at a 75/100 which is understandable. The movie can probably be best described as the campy James Bond type spy movie for the modern age. It takes the risks that no Bond movie will probably ever take again (not since the disaster that Die Another Day was). They make no attempt to hide this and halfway through the movie make it pretty clear that it's what the film is going for without breaking the fourth wall. Until it...kind of does break the fourth wall a little. To enjoy the film you're gonna have to turn off whatever part of your brain governs rationality and skepticism. Because the tech and gadgets used here will cause your eyes to roll if you're expecting this to be a Skyfall style spy movie. <br/><br/>Seeing posters for this did nothing for me when I first heard about it. Then the trailers grabbed my attention. What I wasn't expecting was just how violent it was going to be. The action sequences are over the top to the point where the agents are superhuman. Again, you're gonna have to turn your brain off a little to enjoy it. If you're incapable of doing so, just don't bother seeing it. If you can, I think you'll enjoy it. Most of the theater who got advanced screening tickets applauded quite loudly. Twice. They applauded the first credit screen then partway through it there was a bonus scene. More applause at the end.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure how Colin Firth has never been cast as a gentleman secret agent before. He absolutely nails it. Samuel L. Jackson is actually pretty delightful as the villain with a disdain of violence (not exactly a spoiler as this detail of his character was in trailers). Micheal Caine is actually a touch disappointing in his role. I feel like they really underutilized his talents. Wasn't expecting Mark Hamill to be in it, but was pleased with his appearance, and his British accent was completely believable. If I hadn't seen pictures of Hamill prepping for Star Wars 7 I would've thought he was just some random British middle aged actor. Mark Strong was solid in his role but nothing too fantastic. The big surprise to me was Taron Egerton (who I had to look up, I'll admit), the lead of the film. The guy who kind of looks like Josh Hutcherson. It honestly is quite impressive to see him go from this British ""bruv"" to towards the end of the movie a sophisticated secret agent with honestly, the charm and wit of James Bond. The transformation is believable and impressive. Looking back on the movie that may be my favorite thing about it and given that he's only...24 (I think?) I don't think it's completely absurd to consider him to eventually replace Daniel Craig. Maybe he's not the best choice but he's made my list. Might not grow out of his boyish face, but if he does he should get a call.<br/><br/>Anyway aside from the individual performances, the movie's plot is completely ludicrous (in a fun way), the violence is over stylized, but the humor is quite fun. After seeing all the comedies I've seen. certain jokes are just predictable and Kingsman has its share, but some jokes are quite surprising.<br/><br/>TL;DR summary: Intentionally campy, a lot of fun if you don't expect a serious spy film, quite funny, super violent at times (I can only really compare it to 300...actually no this is more like a spy version of Kick-Ass really, but it's not quite as gory) more entertaining than most movies I saw last year. If there's a sequel, I will watch it. Also Sophie Cookson may just be my new celebrity crush. And also my ticket was free through the advanced screening service I'm signed up for but when I find time, I'm gonna pay to see it again...in 13 ****ing days.<br/><br/>EDIT: back to the Kick Ass comparison, I think if this is well enough received as it was for me and the friend I took to see it, it may enjoy the same cult classic status. Luckily for...it. It will come way before the big blockbusters of 2015 will hit theaters. May give it enough time to gain that appreciation. In my personal opinion, it's better than Kick Ass."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","10","2","5","29 September 2017"," Smart satire enhances this stylistic, subversive and supremely entertaining spy homage to uproarious new heights; phenomenally fun film-making delivered with a wink and a nod.
","Not so much a spoof as a homage with some satirical elements, this uproariously entertaining and sharply witty action-comedy manages to meld together a number of differing genres without ever feeling like a mishmash, working best when it plays into or against the 'secret agent' tropes it so clearly adores. In fact, its occasional absurdity harks back to the days of Roger Moore's Bond. It's also important to note that the film stands on its own two feet as a brash and stylistically violent outlier within the genre. It does occasionally struggle to juggle its various elements, particularly during the second act as it tries to mesh its investigative spy plot with its initiate training sequences and maintain a consistent villainous presence (in the form of Samuel L. Jackson's brilliantly unique and understandable billionaire who's definitely the hero of his own story). The occasional extremely important expositional line pops up seemingly out of nowhere just before the plot needs to be propelled forward, while the passage of time is often unnaturally compressed to keep the pace compact. Thankfully, then, the third act is one of the best in recent years. It makes excellent use of escalating action and rising stakes, managing to introduce valid new threats each time it seems our heroes are successful, while always remaining a tense experience and never losing sight of it's slightly tongue-in-cheek tone. This is phenomenally fun film-making, the kind of slyly stylish cinema that knows what it is and who it aims to please. It's sure to leave you with a smile on your face. 10/10"

I started to have fears of director Matthew Vaughn's impressive action credentials being confined only within the X-men universe. But as the standard bond plot goes on; the more insane and crazy the action became. <br/><br/>Statements were being made about the idea of violence- how much is too much- should we identify with our heroes reacting to violence with little to no emotion (if not sadistically enjoying it); and at the same time Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman were reveling in not only the crazy violence displayed on screen, but the potential reactions of the audiences. <br/><br/>I saw one trailer of this marketed like a spy-version of one of the Young Adult novels; and the thought of teens expecting Stormbreaker 2 when watching this made me side with Vaughn and co.

Now let's take on board that it is directed by Matthew Vaughan, co-written with Jane Goldman, and based on a comic by Mark Millar, and we should be prepared for it to be original, full of (often outrageous) action, stupefyingly violent, overflowing with profanity, very funny, and vastly entertaining. Think Roger Moore-era Bond crossed with Kick-Ass and Wanted.<br/><br/>Millar doesn't come across as likable when I see him interviewed but, by heavens, the films based on his stuff are entertaining. For me, everything in this film works – the performances are all terrific, the action is great and often laugh out loud (it manages to be both funny and credibly visceral – think the birdman at the start of Kick-Ass or the computer keyboard in Wanted). I could have done without quite so many F-words, but oh well.<br/><br/>Recommended if you enjoyed Wanted or Kick-Ass."

","WARNING SPOILERS: I have never wrote a movie review because I've never felt so compelled to. This movie was promising with big name actors, a smart plot and a great opening. I liked that they incorporated the idea of implanted SIM cards because many of my friends and colleagues often speculate that is how world domination and the end of the human race will emerge. Unfortunately, this movie was scrapped with bad humor and taste that would only appeal to creeps.If only they left out the lack of respect for human life (slaughtering innocent people in a church and our world leaders heads exploding into rainbow powder), the lame American political references and the absolute sexism (having the strongest female role stoop to offer anal sex to a teenager) this movie may have had a future.This movie will NOT be a household title, it will NOT be passed from generation to generation and it WILL be forgotten with a long list of other movie titles that were promising but just didn't make the cut.Hopefully this movie flop will remind directors that substance matters. Morals not profanity, oxfords not brogues."

","A mind blowing spy action with a hint of British class that makes you proud to be British. Kingsman provides action, intensity, comedy, and fun for all viewers. If you think it is a simple spoof of all spy films, you could not be more wrong.<br/><br/>Colin Firth provides that awesome, and fetching fighting skills, and character for viewers to support. Seen in continuous fight scenes, with sensational Cinematography, we meet the James Bond side of Firth with non-stop skills. <br/><br/>Kingsman is definitely a 10/10, and must see film of 2015. Although the film contains constant bloody and graphic content throughout, I believe that Kingsman is film for the whole age appropriate family.<br/><br/>This film is strongly recommended by this viewer so, grab your ticket and enjoy 2 hours of action packed thrills."

The story moves along at a good pace without to many slow bits, and with some very good funny bits thrown in for good luck as well.<br/><br/>After what has been coming out of America this year, this was a welcome change.

","Best spy movie you will ever see. it is like all bond movies had sex and produced this.<br/><br/>During a raid in the Middle East in 1997, a probationary secret agent sacrifices himself to save his team. Feeling guilt over the loss of his comrade, Harry Hart, code-named ""Galahad,"" personally delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow, Michelle Unwin, and his young son, Gary ""Eggsy"", saying that if they ever need help, they should call the phone number on the back of the medal and deliver a coded message.<br/><br/>Seventeen years later, Professor James Arnold is kidnapped by unknown assailants, led by Internet billionaire Richmond Valentine and his henchwoman Gazelle. One of Hart's compatriots, ""Lancelot,"" attempts to stage a rescue, but fails. Valentine, known for his philanthropy, continues to meet with various heads of state and VIPs; some of whom go missing afterwards. He also announces a giveaway of SIM cards, granting free cellular and Internet access.<br/><br/>In London, Eggsy is now an unemployed young adult living with his mother, infant half-sister, and abusive stepfather Dean. Despite being intelligent and capable, he left training for the Royal Marines and lives an aimless life. After being arrested for stealing a car and taking it for a joyride, Eggsy calls the number on the back of the medal. Hart arranges for his release and tells Eggsy about the existence of Kingsman, a secret intelligence agency for which both he and Eggsy's late father worked. In the wake of Lancelot's death, the agency opens a vacancy for a new agent, and Eggsy agrees to apply. He joins a group of other candidates, including a woman named Roxy. Training is overseen by ""Merlin,"" a senior Kingsman that acts as teacher, quartermaster, pilot and Ops coordinator. The candidates are eliminated one by one until Eggsy and Roxy emerge as the final two. However, Eggsy fails his final test, and Roxy becomes the new Lancelot.<br/><br/>During this time, Kingsman have been investigating Valentine in connection with the VIP disappearances and notes that Arnold is no longer missing. Hart tracks down Arnold and confronts him about his abduction. A chip implanted in Arnold's head explodes, killing him; Hart is injured during his escape from unknown assailants. Undeterred, Hart poses as a billionaire and dines with Valentine to try to discern his plans.<br/><br/>Hart tracks Valentine to an obscure hate group church in Kentucky, where Valentine and Gazelle are conducting a test. They broadcast a signal to his SIM cards, causing everyone in the church, including Hart, to become uncontrollably violent. A mass brawl breaks out, with Hart the sole survivor, while Eggsy, Merlin and Arthur—the Kingsman's leader—watch via video link. Valentine approaches Hart and kills him without revealing his plan.<br/><br/>Eggsy returns to the Kingsman headquarters, where he discovers that Arthur is one of Valentine's converts. Arthur explains Valentine's views: humanity is akin to a virus, and global warming is the Earth's equivalent of a fever. Valentine intends to kill the virus before it kills the host, broadcasting his signal worldwide to cause a massive culling of the human race. Only a select few that Valentine has deemed worthy of living — those who have sided with him and thus received the protective microchips in their heads, and the VIPs he kidnapped — will be spared.<br/><br/>After avoiding Arthur's attempt to kill him — killing the group leader as he does so — Eggsy teams up with Roxy and Merlin. Roxy pilots a high-altitude balloon vehicle into the stratosphere to disrupt Valentine's satellite network with a missile, while Eggsy and Merlin directly assault Valentine's mountain bunker. Roxy knocks out the satellite and Eggsy fights his way through Valentine's security forces, while Merlin detonates the security chips, killing all who were part of Valentine's plan. Eggsy then fights and defeats Gazelle before killing Valentine and saving the world.<br/><br/>In a mid-credits scene, Eggsy, now a full Kingsman, reaches out to his mother, offering her a nicer house and a chance to get away from Dean."

","It may sound ""out there"", but I think this is in contention for the best spy movie of all time. While the original James Bond films certainly take that title, the modern ones have become a disappointment to the sub-genre, and this humorous film took me back to seeing the originals. It had everything that made them classics, and more. Along with hilarious side-splitting comedy, it added a neat plot twist, some fantastic action sequences and remarkable special effects. Samuel L. Jackson was the perfect villain, and I would commend the younger actors for a performance that will hopefully put them into the limelight for some larger appearances. Perhaps my only criticism is the lack of development in the romantic interests that were clearly evident in the film. The movie teases and taunts, hinting at a relationship which never comes to fruition. But I take no shame in saying that I left the cinema with tears in my eyes, giggling at the perfection of this film."

I am really glad I watched this movie, Samuel Jackson literally had me laughing the whole time especially with his lisps. This movie also had me entertained with the fight scene when the one man fought about 40 people in the church and had to overcome the battle. I really enjoyed the fight scenes and the plot twists.

","With a movie of this quality, it is quite easy to set aside technical- physical impossibles and just settle in for the ride. It was so over the top funny that the technical goofs only made it more hilarious than not. The music was powerfully fun, the acting and Brit street lingo was great, and quite simply, I had to watch it several times because I kept recommending it to friends and family. It only slowed down--for me--during the last ""phase"" of 20% or so. The scene at the backward church in Kentucky was epic!<br/><br/>Set in the UK's London, the street lingo the Brits (apparently) use was entertaining all by itself and I learned a few more expressions from our British friends. The two-finger'd ""flick-off"" the Brits use was also accurate--allegedly originating from the British Longbow shooters of the middle-ages who were so hated by their enemies, having their bow fingers cut off was just the beginning of their punishment if captured. I watched the film in the USA and in Italy, though the Italian audiences seemed more muted in their response, perhaps because the type of humor (guns, bombs, etc.) doesn't get them as much?"

","This film was way better than I thought. I thought it was going to be some goofy film only a child or someone with no taste in the art of cinema would enjoy. It was action packed, what I really like, and a bit funny at times. As for the hero, villain, gadgetry, and plot goes this film is kind of James Bondish but it has its many twists which makes it different from James Bond films. The characters in this film were great. Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) made for a pretty good villain, but Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton) wasn't really the hero that I expected. To me he was a little punk because he failed the last test in what would have made him a Kingsman. It wasn't because he didn't have the ability or didn't know how to complete the test it was simply because he let his feelings get in the way of becoming something way greater than what he was. Harry Hart / Galahad (Colin Firth) was the real hero of the film. He was wiser and played everything cool without being brash and flashy. In the opening scene I was excited to see Professor Arnold (Mark Hamill), being that I'm a preDisney Star Wars Fan. It was a big surprise for me to see Luke Skywalker appearing in another huge film like this one. My favorite character would have to be Gazelle (Sofia Boutella). She was literally a cut above the rest as far as villains go! I mean she was bad! Overall this is a great film. As I said before, it is kind of James Bondish. British secret service men who has their headquarters in a fake tailor shop who are fighting against a villain who is trying to take down the population in order to preserve the earth and at the same time detonating a chip in some of the world's leaders and elite's heads killing them. Now, their heads exploding was a nice touch in the film, but I didn't really care how everyone's heads exploded in sync with Edward Elgar's ""Pomp and Circumstance"". That was a bit far-fetched. Oh yeah, those of you who will enjoy or enjoyed seeing Barack Obama's head exploding, that's the only time you will see something like that ever happening to him, is in a highly fictional, highly fantasized two hours and nine minutes Adidas commercial."
"thomas-w15","8","3","10","17 February 2015"," Who doesn't love a good action movie!?!?!?
","Kingsman: The Secret Service- Today's spy movies feature too much goriness and unneeded intensity that the final product always turns out generically the same and adds nothing to the genre. To put it simply, they have no style. Kingsman: The Secret Service, I am very happy to say, is an exception. Stylish is the best way to describe this movie. It is the best spy film I have seen since Casino Royale. It is a breathe of fresh air to see a movie that perfectly balances action and comedy together. It is more like the Pierce Brosnan Bond films and in my opinion, those were the most enjoyable. With great action, witty humor, and great performances from the whole cast, Kingsman: The Secret Service is the most enjoyable film of the year so far.<br/><br/>Is it perfect? No. No film is ever perfect. The only flaw I could see though was some of the action sequences seem really far-fetched and hard to believe. I believe this is on purpose though. This is the quintessence of why kids want to be super-spys when they grow up. It so much fun and the spies always seem to do it with what today would be called ""swag."" <br/><br/>The best aspect of the movie was, no matter what it was doing, it was doing it with style. It added something to the genre. Even though it didn't hold back on violence, it didn't focus on it and that was a huge difference in making it stand out from the other spy thrillers of the past. Everything going on in the film was so much fun. The action they did, no matter if a guy was getting cut in half or one guy was taking on a platoon of bad guys, no one ever had to turn away because it was never too much violence, it was just enough. The director, Matthew Vaughn, said this movie was in part a tribute to the old Bond films. He definitely did them an honor. <br/><br/>The acting and action were both equally the best parts of this movie. Colin Firth by far had an incredible performance as the suave, badass Kingsman Harry ""Galahad"" Hart. No one could've played his part better. The way he was able to carry himself throughout the movie was the same kind as the likes of Pierce Brosnan, Sean Connery, and Daniel Craig. When I watched the trailer for Kingsman, I wasn't sure who the actor playing the main character was. Taron Egerton is his name and I believe the casting department did a great job at choosing an up and coming actor to play Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin. This way, the audience did not think of him as any other characters as they were watching the movie and were able to believe his transformation into a Kingsman very quickly. He delivered a great performance as Eggsy, and you could tell he was having a lot of fun while doing it. <br/><br/>Be aware there is a good deal of violence in this movie. But, if you are a fan of spy films or good action films in general, I recommend you see Kingsman: The Secret Service while it is still in theaters. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"
"kieranbattams","10","3","10","17 February 2015"," ladies and gentlemen.. i have a new favourite film
","I expected this film to be good.. in fact i expected this film to be great.. but nothing could have prepared me for the experience that is Kingsman: The Secret Service.. the only film which features a badass Colin Firth taking out what can be described as a sea of people single handedly.. whilst still being stylishly suave.<br/><br/>The film follows a basic formula.. but isn't your typical spy film its more than that. The action is on top form, the humour is on top form and the cast is perfection. As well as Colin Firth we get a brilliant performance from Samuel L Jackson as our villain Valentine. I like when a film gives a character their own traits that you can only see a certain actor pull off, and Sam Jackson nailed it as this funny as hell character, who does have the worst lisp i think i have ever heard. To top this off we have Michael Caine and Mark Strong on top form and surprisingly newcomer Taron Egerton as ""Eggsy"" is absolutely brilliant, from streetwise chave to charming gentlemen. This was a brilliant start for the young actor.. give the man more work! Plus the lady with fricking razor blades as legs.. yeah she was awesome.<br/><br/>I actually had the pleasure seeing this in cineworld's 4DX experience as well. This was fresh and cool to see. Made me feel i was in this film, when a gunshot was fired i felt it go past my head.. the seats moved (this was especially good during Eggsy's carjacking scene) and even bubbles filled the auditorium in one particular scene involving.. yes you saw this right.. exploding heads.<br/><br/>All-in-all Kingsman is loud, badass, bodacious, stylish, funny and overall one of the greatest action films i have seen in my time, i highly recommend this. The action was very much like kick-ass so if you have seen that then you know what you're getting in to. One scene involving badass Colin Firth on top form in a church is a prime example of one such awesome scene and had me fixed to the screen the whole time in anticipation of what was coming next. At the end of a day when i feel this good about a film and i have already vowed multiple watchings that is when my highest rating is deserved which is why i feel Kingsman deserves a 10/10. Now i feel like putting on a suit and becoming a super spy. Not sure if thats a good idea but it has to be done. A new favourite for me for sure and the best cinematic experience since Whiplash."

","My boyfriend dragged me to this movie last weekend and I went solely because he asked, I had no desperate need to see this film and though the trailers looked good I don't generally go for action types especially action/comedy duo's as they generally fall short of one genre or both. I thought all the best bits of the film were in the trailer as is nowadays, but I was pleasantly surprised when the film had so many little bits that had me laughing like a maniac. <br/><br/>The film provides ample back story to the main character as well as a good amount of story to the plot, I like the way the story is set up with little nods to the knights of the round table. The comedy is questionable but if you aren't easily offended you'll enjoy it. <br/><br/>If your a man trying to get your wife/girlfriend/female friend to watch it with you I strongly recommend this film (and perhaps showing the reviews for this and 50 Shades) <br/><br/>10/10 Best underdog film of 14/15."
"mochamac","9","3","10","14 February 2015"," A Brilliant Revival of the Original Bond Format on Steroids!
","After the success of Kick-Ass and X-Men First Class you would expect something special from director Matthew Vaughn; Kingsman: The Secret Service will blow your expectations to smithereens. This ultra-violent, super-charged reboot of the spy genre may be the most exhilarating blockbuster of the year. A gloriously bold venture, Kingsman furiously pushes the limits of mainstream cinema to bring you exactly what you never knew you wanted.<br/><br/>Colin Firth revels in the role of suave spy Harry Hart, who introduces us to elite super-secret organization, Kingsman. Hart recruits Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), the least likely candidate, to join Kingsman's grueling eliminatory training process designed to test his mettle and loyalty. Relative newcomer Egerton displays impeccable talent as the rough-around-the- edges Eggsy, commandeering every scene with utter charm.<br/><br/>While Eggsy overcomes each challenge in this particularly unorthodox program, callous tech mogul Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) plots a global revolution of catastrophic proportions. Jackson is emphatic as the sadistic and flamboyant super-villain, Valentine who ironically cannot stand the sight of blood. Fortunately, a sexy sidekick with some killer blades is on hand to carry out his dirty work. Jackson's chemistry with Firth is particularly electric in an excellent postmodern scene, which sees the foes discuss their preferences in spy movies.<br/><br/>Brimming with crisp aesthetic and vibrant style, Kingsman displays high value and sophistication. The fight scene choreography hits every mark flawlessly, allowing the effervescent action to flow in a way only Vaughn can capture. The Kingsman agents manage to fight off mobs of mindless killers in marvelous locations without acquiring a sole crinkle to their immaculately tailored suits. An excellent soundtrack by Henry Jackman is teamed with fast paced, well-timed rhythm that barely allows you to catch your breath. Kingsman brings the fun back to spy movies with this hilariously irreverent and brazen proof that the concept never got old, but was rather in dire need of some fresh and innovative oomph.<br/><br/>Kingsman is not without fault, the gratuitous violence can become a tad tedious, but the sheer audacity to the step away from the watered down action to which we have grown accustomed is precisely what makes Kingsman special. An attempt to present a strong female character in Roxy (Sophie Cookson) is also admirable, but falls short when she constantly achieves by chance rather than skill. Unfortunately Roxy is left merely to overcome her fear of heights while the boys save the world. With Hit-Girl for comparison, Vaughn certainly could have done better here.<br/><br/>A brilliant revival of the original Bond format on steroids, Kingsman brings street to the elite with surprisingly hilarious consequences. With a wealth of talent that also includes Michael Caine and Mark Strong this British bombshell is cinematic gold. It even carries the solid message that anyone has the potential to be a gentleman; it is all about what you project and how you carry yourself, after all, ""manners maketh man""."
"TheSquiss","8","3","10","3 February 2015"," A sit back & go with the flow romp. Violent, bloody & hugely entertaining.
","Adapted from the acclaimed comic book by Jane Goldman (Stardust, The Woman in Black) and directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Kick-Ass) Kingsman: The Secret Service is a sit back, put your feet up, go with the flow romp. It doesn't pretend to be anything else, and it achieves its goals admirably.<br/><br/>Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is an agent with a super-secret undercover organization hidden behind the façade of an exclusive tailor's outlet in London. When one of the Kingsman agents is killed in action, a brief, intensive selection process begins through which a replacement will be found. Whilst the majority of the potential recruits are public school educated and born with silver spoons in their mouths, Harry's proposition is Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a streetwise kid from the wrong side of town and a pitiful history. With death or expulsion the penalty for failing each task, Eggsy battles prejudice as well as aptitude tests in a bid to become a Kingsman.<br/><br/>From the opening titles of Kingsman: The Secret Service we know we're up for fun. The credits tumble out like rocks from exploding walls as Vaughn sets the tone of adventure and derring-do. We think we know where we're going but Goldman and Vaughn have formed a reliable partnership that maintains the ability to surprise, to appall and to shock simultaneously. This is tongue-in-cheek, logic be damned magic.<br/><br/>Throughout Kingsman: The Secret Service we are treated to bloody, violent, beautiful choreography that leaves us wincing, laughing and admiring the audacity of the mayhem they spread across the screen. The church sequence is a marvel to behold and a scene that Tarantino must wish he had created first. As for the grand, spectacular finale, well, let's just say you've never seen fireworks like this! It is a visual triumph that is, in an odd kind of way, mind-expanding. Riotous, beautiful and very funny indeed.<br/><br/>One of the great joys of Goldman's and Vaughn's collaborations is that they seem not to care too much what anybody thinks. They just do it. They know the rules and they play the Hollywood game but they do it their way. Product placement has long been a standard of filmmaking, and though there is plenty of it on display here, one particular example is the funniest, classiest most blatant since, well, ever! <br/><br/>Like Goldman's and Vaughn's other work, Kingsman: The Secret Service doesn't take itself seriously. It is joyfully camp at times, frequently taking digs at the genre it is mocking. In the Roger Moore years, James Bond became a buffoon, an unbelievable pastiche of himself. Here, Bond gets a makeover and frivolous fun is on the agenda throughout. All the ingredients are here: a super villain, excess, beauty and gadgets. This is gadget heaven and umbrellas have suddenly become cool.<br/><br/>Colin Firth is clearly having an absolute blast as the suave agent. Who needs Paddington to boost your cinematic profile when you can shoot, stab, smash and bludgeon this stylishly? Firth is a class act and this is proof once again that there is far more to him than simply the stiff upper lip persona.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is on scenery munching duty the as Valentine, a twisted tech genius holding the world to ransom under the guise of being its savior, and why not? There's a certain amount of ham in his performance but it works perfectly here and he's in good company.<br/><br/>Egerton makes for a fine, watchable secondary hero that we may perhaps find it easier to identify with but he's not in the same league as Colin Firth or Michael Caine and does not easily drag our attention away from them. Mark Strong's accent takes a little while to settle in but he, too, brings light humour and a certain gravitas to Kingsman: The Secret Service, as we have come to expect from his presence.<br/><br/>There are plenty of gaps in the plot (at what point does Eggsy actually learn to fight properly?), and occasionally the humour is a little too obvious and slips below the level Vaughn sets, but all of these glitches and flaws are forgivable when a film is this much fun.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when a film is as much fun as Kingsman: The Secret Service, the temptation (and pressure from the studio) must surely be there to forge a sequel.

Now, I STRONGLY disagree with their homophobic views, but glorifying them dying violently on the big screen in front of millions of viewers just because they have bad opinions?!? How does that not make you even worse?! And later on, they do the same thing, while a bunch of rich people's heads explode. What did these people do to deserve that? They tried to survive the impending apocalypse. Yep, if you try to save yourself, you now deserve to die and everyone will be happy if you do.

The only reason I'm giving it 8 instead of 10 is because the villains evil work doesn't make sense! Bad guys do bad stuff for the sake of the ENVIRONMENT?! non-sense!.. The production & direction is so good, reminds me of Sherlock Holmes.And Eggsy reminded me of Peeta Mellark from The Hunger Games during his last part of the movie!

"kislaykaushal22","9","3","11","13 March 2015"," A really cool action movie
","This is awesomeness redefined. Every time I believe the world has seen enough action movies, I get jolted off my senses to accept that there exists million other exciting ways to kick, jump and fight. And when violence combines with humor and Lynyrd Skynyrd solo, the jolt is even more devastating. Kingsman, the secret services, as the title suggests is an undercover organization 'tailored' to protect the world from unprecedented dangers which threaten mankind. Its members are the world's most agile, skilled, intelligent, suited and British gentlemen with a penchant for vintage whiskey and cute dogs. The movie covers basically two issues. One is to find an ideal replacement of one of the most able members of the service. The screening process is one of a kind, I have ever seen. It's wonderfully conceptualized, pulsating and unpredictable. The other issue is to avert a massive catastrophe which I cannot comprehend at all until the last quarter of the movie. This certainly forced me to speculate and commanded focused attention throughout the movie. Among the characters, the first pick is of course Colin Firth. Very few can portray the grace of a king and valor of a knight as convincingly as he did. At the helm, the think tank is always Michael Caine who exudes the persona of a wise old man who stands firm on his beliefs and ideals- either for good or bad; we have to decide. 'Taron Egerton' is one of the most able contenders for being a Kingsman but disappoints a little when he actually is. All in all, the movie is a must watch. A real refreshment for the ones who are actually bored of typical action movies."

"Buddy-51","7","3","11","8 March 2015"," Even a surfeit of blood can't tarnish the fun
","Deftly directed by Matthew Vaughn, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a nostalgic throwback to those early Bond days of the 1960s, when just about every other comedy coming out of Hollywood was a spy-movie send-up (""Our Man Flint,"" ""In Like Flint,"" ""The Silencers,"" ""Agent for H.A.R.M."" etc.). <br/><br/>This latest addition to the genre, based on the comic book ""The Secret Service"" by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, tells of a spy agency so secret that even other spy agencies don't know it exists. Kingsman is made up of a cadre of highly trained, dapperly dressed ""gentlemen"" spies who consider themselves to be the descendants - in spirit, if not in flesh-and-blood - of the knights of yore (they've even given each other code names like Lancelot and Galahad). That dapperest of dapper gentlemen Colin Firth plays Harry Hart, aka Galahad, a veteran agent who recruits a directionless youth (Taron Edgerton) from the streets of London - the son of an agent who over a decade earlier saved Hart's life - to train in the art of spying (like in ""My Fair Lady,"" the eager trainee pipes in). Eggsy's first major assignment will be to thwart the dastardly high-tech plot of a crazed gazillionaire, played by a lisping Samuel L. Jackson, who intends to save the planet by eliminating the ""virus"" (i.e., humanity) that seems bent on destroying it.<br/><br/>The humor in the Jane Goldman/Matthew Vaughn screenplay ranges from brittle and dry to pitch-dark satire, so dark in fact that the movie occasionally threatens to run off the rails into a tonal train wreck. Luckily, however, it always manages to right itself just at the point where we're about to bail out on it. It's true that the violence may probably be a tad too graphic for a movie of this type but the overall spirit of good cheer and unalloyed fun triumphs in the end."
"shadowyx12","8","3","11","7 March 2015"," One of the most fun theatre-going experiences I've had in recent memory
","The plot of ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" involves various agents of an international secret intelligence agency (The Kingsman) on a mission to take down an insane billionaire's plot of 'improving' the world. One of these agents is 'Eggsy' - a troubled young man who is given an opportunity, among stiff competition, to become a Kingsman.<br/><br/>QUICK REVIEW: Matthew Vaughn steps it up again with Kingsman: The Secret Service. Yes, the humour and violence may seem immature and tasteless to some, but if you enjoy the kinds of humour and violence in movies made by Tarantino or even Edgar Wright, then this film is perfect for you (I personally love stylized violence myself). Most of the action scenes are done hand-held, but they're proficient enough so that you can see every punch, kick, and gunshot clearly.<br/><br/>Expect to see one of this film's lead star, Taron Egerton, in a lot more films in the future. Not only did he get his character's tough exterior and quick wit down, but he also has his character's sweet and caring side down. The chemistry between him and Colin Firth's character is also strong.<br/><br/>Speaking of Firth, he too proves himself as an actor who can take on physically demanding roles in this movie. I would even go as far as to say his performance is as suave as Sean Connery's when he's James Bond.<br/><br/>Vaughn could not have picked a better actor to play the main villain of this movie. Samuel L. Jackson is as HILARIOUS as he is cold as billionaire Richmond Valentine.<br/><br/>Fun, irreverent, and jam-packed with action, Kingsman: The Secret Service is one film you don't want to miss in 2015.<br/><br/>VERDICT: See it in theatres... NOW."
"nishant-infy","8","3","11","7 March 2015"," Entertaining, Funny and Gripping Movie
","A refreshing way of presenting spy movies with expensive gadgets and suits. The main difference compared to Bond or Bourne movies is the comic angle which very well suits the whole theme. I wish there were more romantic angle to the story and also I wanted to see more of the training that Kingsman go through so that they become so good. There is a good material for sequel I think. So this movie is more on entertainment side. They could have added more depth to the characters however that could have been challenging to do in a 2 hour movie. With sequels, the character exploration can be attempted to create a legendary Kingsman story itself."

","Kingsman: The secret service is one of the few movies which can make the viewer laugh even though there are brutal action scenes. It is the only movie where even genocide can seem humorous. It brings back the classic James Bond style and the concept of spy agents. Usage of futuristic gadgets, glamour, adventures including traversing the globe and of course, a lot of action-packed sequences. The music which is integrated with certain scenes is brilliant and the screenplay is beyond ordinary. I may be biased towards British movies because anything British fascinates me. <br/><br/>This movie is brilliantly made in terms of action and humour. Even though it has a cliché spy story, it is portrayed differently."
"BillSims28","9","3","11","28 February 2015"," Kick-Ass meets James Bond: Superbly Stylish and Highly Enjoyable
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is the latest hyper-violent offering from Layer Cake/Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn. Starring Colin Firth as highly gentlemanly secret agent Galahad, Kingsman tells the story of Eggsy, (exciting new-comer Taron Egerton) a chavvy London teenager who seems to be at a low point in his life, until he meets Galahad and discovers the Kingsman society, which includes Michael Caine and Mark Strong as members of the Secret Service. As Eggsy begins the process of joining Kingsman, he discovers the plot of human-hating Valentine (a lisping Samuel L. Jackson.)<br/><br/>Now where Kingsman succeeds is perfectly blending elements of laugh-out-loud humour, nailed by the spot-on comic timing of Egerton and Firth, a subversive commentary on the spy genre (from the silliness of the 1960s to the Bourne-ification of the James Bond series) and very fun, extra stylish action sequences. Notably a stand-out sequence in a church full of racist Southerners, to the tune of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird,"" has viewers visibly grinning with delight as they watch the eye-catching, finely-staged action unfold. By making the characters and the ""gentleman"" ideals realistic, Vaughn creates a fine film in which you not only want to be the characters but also could be them. Unlike a certain 007, Galahad and the true Kingsmen represent the qualities of what a real, every-day gentleman, which is both riveting to follow and entertaining to watch. <br/><br/>There is little bad to be said about Kingsman. I suppose if you hated Kick-Ass and dislike the spy genre in general, it is almost certainly not for you, but it is probably worth watching anyway. Also, once the main plot begins to get under way, it slows down for a while. Nothing major actually happens for a while, but it's still highly entertaining. Jackson, apparently doing his lisp on a whim, is just as interesting to watch as always, as is his ""legless"" sidekick Gazelle. Mark Hamill appears for a while, simply to prepare us for the shock of seeing him on screen again in The Force Awakens this December. All combines to make a thoroughly amusing and exciting film; the best non-Bond spy film in some time. Please don't see Fifty Shites of Grey over this."
"keyos27","9","3","11","25 February 2015"," Never judge the movie based on its trailer
","""Do not judge a book by its cover."" is often the common idiom that suits to possibly many underrated films out there, including ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."" There has not been any sacrament of myself planning to watch this movie because of a dull and cliché trailer that gives off an impression of the cheesy action movie with a ghost of hidden excitement. It definitely resembles to an obscure and mediocre Hollywood goof, solely based on the trailer.<br/><br/>However, I ended up watching it after coincidentally getting involved into the plethora of great reviews and positive opinions about this film that have littered the media and my surrounding. And I am glad I did. Almost everything about this film stands out among a lot of its counterpart. The introductory starts strong off by unleashing bits and pieces of prowess and personality of the private organization, Kingsman in the most entertaining way. And as it carries on, things get more intense with more character development and a series of predicament that leads to the breathtaking climax after a great amount of well-written shenanigans that transpire in different places which makes the cast twice look cool and bona fide. Although, I wish the director had them articulate little slower or clearer to neutralize the accent to make it easier for others to comprehend. <br/><br/>By watching a whole movie, each cut scene that I think of it as an underwhelming performance or over-the-top in the trailer surprisingly turns into an awesome sequence. It does not squander a minute to fully describe the protagonist who puts all of its energy into improving himself while fervently vying for the one and only Kingsman title with several others under the Kingman's unerring guidance as well as using all the skills he has obtained during the span to fight against the ominous and wicked pair that tries to get a grip on everyone in the world with manipulative SIN cards that can be inserted to mankind. <br/><br/>There is no such thing as ""Too much"" or ""Too little"" in the name of Kingsman. The moderate amount of characters, dialogues, and battle scenes are timely introduced and shortly edited. And what every character says is critical and relevant to the plot and those words speaks for its identity. The same thing goes to the battle scene. It effectively capitalizes on a shaky and fast-paced camera technique as well as focusing on significant parts where nifty artifice and brutality are vividly depicted. The massive scrum of entire nation beating each other up has more depth to it because as the outset gradually builds up, the origin of the outbreak gets disclosed, thus gives you another reason to watch it.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the atmosphere of this film reminds me of the mitigated, but funnier version of ""Kill Bill"" sequel where the meaning of death is quite redundant. Obviously, the level of blood spattering and cruelty is different, but sharing one similarity would be the main character focusing on its nemesis as the deadly number of enemies and unexpected twists ensue. What truly differentiates the ""Kingsman"" in a good way from the ""Kill Bill"" would be types of weapons with a variety of uncanny attributes and the level of humor in which most action genre can rarely utilize."
"BLAlley","8","3","11","22 February 2015"," A fun spy romp with plenty of action
","Kingsman takes itself seriously enough to avoid the label of spoof, but keeps it's tongue firmly planted in cheek as it carries the audience along for a fun ride. I would say it's neither James Bond nor Austin Powers, but ultimately resides somewhere in the middle alongside 60's spies like Matt Helm or Derek Flint, but with the kind of action and set pieces we have grown accustomed to in modern cinema. Everyone involved is endlessly watchable, even those with smaller parts. Newcomer Taron Egerton was very good as both the street-wise punk with an oddly sophisticated past, and the dapper Kingsman he eventually becomes. The action and effects were well done, although some may find a certain choice near the end to be a bit odd. It does serve a purpose, however, adding levity in place of violence that would be excessive even for this film. In my opinion it works. Overall Kingsman is a fun update to an old concept, and I can hardly wait to see more."

The supporting actors/actresses were all good and the film soundtrack, well let's just say I'm still humming it! The story line is fantastic but hey it worked.

Don't get me wrong, there are some things left unanswered but that really isn't important for this movie, it can certainly be left to imagination.

If he can pass their test, he will be one of the new initiated into their ranks - just a threat from a twisted tech genius threatens the world.<br/><br/>Every since the first trailer for this movie came out I already known that this movie was going to be great because Matthew Vaughn directing it and that guy knows how to make a well made film that reminds everyone what good movies are, and that's why these no surprise that this movie was awesome.<br/><br/>Kingsman: The Secret Service is a like tribute to good spy films that seem to be serious or not very well made these day, yeah they where cheesy and goof but that's what we remember best from them and this movie was the perfect tribute to that, and a perfect tribute that everybody isn't going to see because everybody is going to see 50 Shades of Rubbish, I just lose faith in humility after that.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn to me is a director who knows how to direct good action scenes and knows how to entertain the audience, and with this movie he directed this with style and a enough effort to make a bad-ass film, even when his movies mostly flop at the box office it will have a cult following and Kingsman will have a cult following. Nice work Matthew Vaughn.<br/><br/>Jack Davenport who is a new star and this is his first big role his every been in and my god was he great in this movie. This is my first time I ever seen this guy act and let me tell you this guy has a bright future a head for him.<br/><br/>Now at the first I didn't really thought that Colin Firth kicking ass would work, but after seeing the movie I was wrong..dead wrong. Every time Colin Firth was in a action scenes I bought it because I heard in a article that he did all of his stunts and I got to say he pulled it of brilliantly. His character Harry Hart was the best character in the whole film and every time his on screen he stole the whole film for me.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson has the villain was just spot on brilliant, I mean talking about a villain that was fun and freaking hilarious. But at the first I wasn't very sure about the way he talked in the film, he talked like Adam Snadler from WaterBoy, but after a while I got use to it and it worked for his character. These days I feel that Samuel L. Jackson is just filling it in with his new movies, but in this I actually sawed him playing and caring about his character and he knocked it out of the park.<br/><br/>This movie probably has one of the best action scene I've seen since...I'm not kidding you here but The Matrix, and that's the Church scene. May god way do I even begin with this, the scene itself was fast paste but I still could see what was going on and that action scene was shot beautifully well and it showed what action should be filmed. So watch when you see the film look out for the Church scene it will not disappoint.<br/><br/>Now for problems and I only have some: I got to say that the first couple of minutes of the movie I didn't really get sucked in into the movie that much, but as the movie went along I finally got into it.<br/><br/>Overall Kingsman is a movie that deserves more attraction, skip 50 Shade of Whatever and see this movie, trust me this movie is more well made than 50 shades."
"matthewssilverhammer","9","3","11","21 February 2015"," Yes!
","Kingsman deserves better than listing comparisons of it to other films. So let me get it out of the way: Imagine a cartoonier Bond film, influenced by Edgar Wright's brainy editing, with Wanted's unabashed silliness, Kill Bill's oddly gorgeous violence, and Guardians of the Galaxy-style comic book humor and you begin to get the picture. Above all, it's an absolute blast of pure movie fun. Boasting a great cast of perfectly matched characters and actors, kinetic scifi action choreography, and tons of slyly intentional silliness, Kingsman is funny, ultra-violent, and bursting with vibrant color. The Kingsman is a secret British organization that combats against the biggest of Earth's threats currently looking to replace one of its most recent lost members. Its structure has the skin of the ubiquitous YA-novel-turned-film genre, only much rougher. With director Vaughn at the helm, my fear was that Kingsman would be similar to many of his recent efforts: an interesting but ultimately sad miss. Blatant product placement and a couple too-clever-for-its- own-good jokes aside, this is happily not the case. Led by the classy and surprisingly action-inclined Firth as the elder statesmen of the group, the movie chugs along with inspired verve. It's also really smart. Themes like the presumptuous danger of playing God and personal honor vs. public persona bring just enough moral complexity to put it above films of its type. However, the boldly big goofiness that propels the film is never far from sight. Kingsman is a super smart action thriller that won't disappoint anyone wise enough to skip 50 Shades of Grey."

","After ages I saw a good Action/Thriller/Comedy movie. How many times you watch a movie and say 'great action! but could have had a little more comic scenes' or 'all action but where is the story?' but with Kingsman you get a package deal.<br/><br/>There is a secret service/intelligence agency called Kingsman which is ""very secret"" as Michael Cane says and its working domain is international. This time they loose one of the kingsman and want to find a good fit for it. That's where the real story starts.<br/><br/>In one of the initial fighting scene in the movie you can find out which kind of the movie it would be. This scene has a little humor, sleek action and a kick-ass/funny introduction of the Villain.<br/><br/>The story is very simple and nothing new in that and it would have been a very ordinary movie in any other director's hand but Matthew Vaughn makes it stylish and irresistible!<br/><br/>The Action scenes are of course the highlight of the movie but everything else shines out as well. The dialogues, the costumes, the swag, setup everything.<br/><br/>Performance wise everyone has done a great job but Colin Firth has acted marvelously and he has taken the movie to whole another level. His dialogues delivery is excellent, his fight sequences will certainly shock you in a positive sense and most importantly his chemistry with Taron Egerton is awesome. Specially the church fighting sequence will blow your mind.<br/><br/>Samual L. Jackson as a Villain has enjoyed most in this role. You can clearly see that he is very comfortable in this character who has a slight lisp (and you will love it) and a fear from gore/bloody sights and yet he is the one responsible for all the blood and gore in the movie! He has a very likable personality as a Villain and never forgets to be a funny but dangerous antagonist.<br/><br/>The training of new Kingsman part could have had a few more scenes as you would enjoy them.<br/><br/>Taron Egerton is good as Eggsy and has some good action sequences in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall a great action movie which I would love to watch again because ""A gentleman never ceases to appreciate a good movie"" :)"

","When Eggsy was a toddler, his father was killed in the line of work. He was given a special medal by a well-dressed gentleman, telling him that he can call when he is in trouble. Seventeen years later, growing up in a rough London suburb, Eggsy got himself thrown in jail after engaging police in a backwards car chase. He calls the number behind the medal, and in comes the dapper Harry Hart to the rescue. Knowing Eggsy's wasted talents in gymnastics and academics, Harry brings him to try out for a vacancy in his ultra-secret spy organization, the Kingsmen.<br/><br/>The fun begins with the opening credits, when letters would form out of the rubble that fell from various explosions of an ancient temple, to the tune of Dire Straits' hit ""Money for Nothing"". You knew by then that you should be ready for something tongue-in-cheek. The beginning sequences do not hide the fact that this would be a graphically violent film. Throughout the film we will be regaled with fights with guns, bombs, and blades, all in extraordinarily spectacular fashion we have never seen before.<br/><br/>Colin Firth, an actor who is practically typecast as the shy or dour guy in romantic comedies, shows a totally screen persona here. As Harry Hart, aka Galahad, he is a swashbuckling super spy like we have never seen him before. Mark Strong makes another memorable screen appearance as Merlin, the Number 2 man among the Kingsmen. The ever reliable Michael Caine plays Arthur, the head Kingsman. You know he can play this role with his eyes closed. <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as the villain Richmond Valentine, an insane megalomaniac telecom tycoon with a lisp planning to have mankind kill each other. Exotic beauty Sofia Boutella is Valentine's vicious henchman Gazelle, a graceful killer with her deadly sharp prosthetic legs. Mark Hamill was unrecognizable as the elderly environmentalist Professor Arnold, whose abduction starts the action.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise is the breakthrough star-making performance of Taron Egerton as Eggsy. In the beginning it took some time getting used to the new face. But as the film went on, Egerton will possess the screen with his action skills and suave charm, even in the presence of his esteemed co-stars. By the time the film ends, you could not wait to see more of this young man in future films. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a very entertaining, visually stimulating film. The production design, with all those gadgetry and weaponry, is very inventive and eye-catching. The musical score is pulsating and exciting. The action sequences were really relentlessly bloody, with various body parts getting impaled, sliced off or blowing up. Yet, this was all done with typically British wry humor and aristocratic class. <br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn takes the James Bond genre, and mixes in the superhero and hi-tech elements of two excellent films he directed before (""Kick-Ass"" and ""X-Men: First Class""), as well as some Cockney elements from his earlier productions like ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". With ""Kingsman"", he has actually managed to create something even more fantastic. This is the best 2015 release so far. 9/10."

","I remember the very first trailer for ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" almost a year ago being rather unremarkable in the way it portrayed the action and spy genre, sort of seeing it as a spy film playing safe and not giving it much thought. However, when a release date of October 2014 was pushed back to February 2015, and the trailers began to become more prolific, it seemed that the marketing team behind the film started to deal with the film in an entirely new sense. The trailers became a riot, showing so much craziness and complete insanity that one wondered what would be left to show in the actual film. I went from a generally dismissive attitude to genuinely being excited for, what I saw, a something totally new and fresh.<br/><br/>""Kingsman"" is exactly that; a film that slaughters convention and any and all expectations to create something completely unpredictable, zealous, and most importantly, highly enjoyable. The film opens by showing a mission in the Middle East, carried out by the honorable Kingsman, an elite spy organization. We see a Secret Agent by the name of Harry Hart (Colin Firth) try his best but fail to save the life of one of his fellow agents, leading him to deliver a medal of bravery to the man's widow and young son. He tells the song, Eggsy, that if they ever need any assistance to call the phone number on the back of the medal and state a special message.<br/><br/>Seventeen years later, another Kingsman has fallen, leaving the organization questioning how to proceed against Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a wealthy inventor who is dolling out free cell phone service in efforts to control the population and his henchman Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), equipped with sharp metal legs. Eggsy lives in London with his mother and abusive stepfather, and is arrested after stealing a thug's car at a local pub with some friends. He uses his sole phone call in prison to call the number on the back of the medal given to him as a child, and is bailed out by Harry, who wants him recruited for the secret service agency known as Kingsman in efforts to stop Valentine and company.<br/><br/>The Kingsmen use a variety of sophisticated weaponry and fighting styles that would normally leave the untrained aggressor crippled and sore for weeks. Harry, however, is not an untrained aggressor, using suave tactics to brutalize his enemies or instigators and assure that justice be served in a fair manner. He takes Eggsy as his prodigy, showing him the ropes of a Kingsman and what it means to work for the organization, as it's more than just umbrella guns, knives that propel out of dress shoes, and inconspicuous grenades.<br/><br/>Obviously, ""Kingsman"" is a blatant parody of the Bond franchise, but it is so in the best possible manner. Rather than lazily parodying character names, mannerisms, and proposing direct references to films of the franchise, writers Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughn (""X-Men: First Class"") lampoon style, which will always bear a greater longevity than mindless name-calling and spoofing in parodies. The key to the art of parody is in style and convention, which Goldman and Vaughn understand from the get-go. What results is an uproariously fun film that never runs out of energy and always provides something fresh in a currently overcrowded pool.<br/><br/>""Kingsman"" wisely comes amidst a time where the superhero genre and the spy/espionage genre are in their primes, but never adhering too much to one particular side, creating a joyful hybrid rather than yet another project to get lost in a sea of others. In what looks to be a big year for the superhero/action genre, ""Kingsman"" provides those experiencing fatigue and dissatisfaction from the ubiquity of such projects with a pleasant sense of originality and style to their content that could've easily been just another example of muchness in a genre.<br/><br/>The film is likely to play nicely, with generally little competition in the same vein and an obvious push with communities like Reddit and 4chan embracing the content for its simultaneous slickness and uniqueness. Moreover, the film plays nicely for people simply looking for a cinematic experience that appears to have a pulse after a month of general ho-hum and mediocre releases. There's an unabashed level of excitement the film bears during a time of unimpressive titles that will undoubtedly find ways to cheer up a crowd that has long been done a disservice so far this year."

Highly recommend the movie, especially for those action movie lovers. Know I'm just going to sit here and try to hold back the tears. Yes I literally want to cry because the move is over, and it's been two hours already since I have seen it. The acting was phenomenal, and hilarious. Samuel L Jackson did an outstanding job! It was so good that it was so tempting to go back and buy another ticket just to watch it again. Only good words and thoughts come to mind when I think of this movie.

","I can't help but wonder if all the folks reviewing this movie saw the same film! The movie is based on a comic book, folks! This is a satire-spoof type movie of the 1970's spy movie/show genre. Think early Bond or the Man from U.N.C.L.E., but WAY over exaggerated, over acted, overly violent (but in a funny way), overly ridiculous & overly implausible (ah, but is it?) BUT utterly great in its delivery. We and the audience around us laughed out loud throughout. Entertaining & engaging characters. Samuel Jacksons lisp which many called distracting was part of the over acting. It's meant to be distracting. I know the church scene is what blows the violence level through the roof. But following the movie premise, it's kill or be killed. People complain about too much F bomb. We do not remember an overuse of the word. We walked out of the Wolf of Wall Street disgusted & complaining about the 500+ F-bomb drops. We can't recall an instance of it being said in this movie. The movie will bring up discussions on micro chipping, cell phone technology and technology in general, and global warming, or lack there of, to a lesser degree. Yes, that is Mark Hamill playing Professor Arnold. Don't miss that fact until you see his name in the credits, like I did. Don't take the kids. Just go see it for what it is, funny & enjoyable. And don't miss the 3 second long scene where you see Valentine with Obama in the window of the White House listening to him (Obama) speak. Sounds just like him too. Could it be..."

Let's start with the acting, not one person was bad. Colin Firth plays his role as a spy so well. Samuel L. Jackson was great as the villain. One of the best and funniest villains in the past few years. Everyone did great but the person who stole the show, was newcomer Taron Egerton. This was his first film and wow, he can act. Hope to see him in more movies. There some cameos that just makes the movie more special. The action was amazing, the way Matthew Vaughn handles each action scene, just makes you wanting more and more. This was the first spy movie to add a little bit of every other spy movie and make it great and different at the same time. It's James Bond meets Austin Powers.Overall Kingsman: the secret service is a crazy, fun spy movie, that everyone should check out."

"cleric42","8","3","11","30 January 2015"," A great combination of action and comedy
","Kingsman was originally a graphic novel by Mark Millar (the creator of Kick Ass) and Dave Gibbons. Having read the novel, it's a decent story, that is sort of a coming of age film combined with a James Bond-like setting. It's a decent novel, but in my opinion it is overshadowed by Millar's previous works. However, the movie takes his ideas to different levels, and in almost all aspects it outperforms the novel. <br/><br/>The story is about a less fortunate 'lad' named Eggsy (Taron Egerton), who lives in a council flat after his father; a kingsman, is killed in action when he was a child. The movie centres around the spy world of the kingsman, Eggsy being trained to become a kingsman, and Samuel L Jackson's plot to 'save the world' by killing most of humanity, in what can only be described as a send up of our technological progress in the last 20 years. <br/><br/>Colin Firth is the true star of the show however, displaying the class and mannerisms of the gentlemen that are the kingsman, while kicking some serious ass in some scenes, and making amusing jokes in others. <br/><br/>The action you would expect in a spy movie is there in full force, some scenes are directed extremely well, combining a blend of blissful carnage while a blistering soundtrack plays overhead. The comedy is strong as well, while it may not be laugh out loud all the time, the film ticks along with a constant pace of puns and quips you would expect from this genre. <br/><br/>The movie also pokes fun at the genre throughout the film, whether it by using sarcastic remarks, breaking the fourth wall or using Eggsy's working class background to undermine the gadgets and flair of the 'kingsman'. <br/><br/>While the movie is great fun there were a few minor niggles that annoyed me. Obviously there are changes from the novel that change the story, but there are certain lines (one in particular involving a Swedish princess) that sometimes leave you almost cringing, and really felt out of place in the context of the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, if you are looking for an action packed movie full of entertainment and surprise then this is really good fun movie."

","Kinsman is supposed to be a spy-comedy, but I hardly found anything funny. I find it strange that many viewers (having low IQ) are going ga-ga on how funny it is, as if it were another Austin Powers.<br/><br/>There's just nothing great about the story; although it is a quirky one involving SIM cards. No points for that at all. But it is a stylish film with a James Bond feel to it, with some thrilling aerial stunts.<br/><br/>What I hated in the film are: gratuitous scenes of violence (although not like '300') and liberal use of the F word. The mass murder scene in the church amounts to glamorising violence to the extreme, which made feel totally sick.<br/><br/>Talking of violence, towards the end it has scenes of human heads blowing off. But, thankfully, it was not shown realistically but in a colourful way, as if the heads were balloons filled with coloured water that blasted to release high-rising spurts of colourful water.<br/><br/>I know ""Kinsman: The Secret Service"" is a huge hit, but it is not worth a second look at all. <br/><br/>It is shocking how many retarded viewers have glorified this disgusting film to the hilt!

When Michael Caine ordered them to shoot dogs,they didn't know the bullets were empty.In these would-be agents' minds,they thought they were going to kill their dogs.So if you have a sound judgment of morality, you are not qualified; if you blindly follow orders, you are a good agent? <br/><br/>The mom's submission to her violent abusive new husband borders on masochism. The only female agent is also the only person who's scared of height; when she finally overcomes many difficulties and accomplishes her mission,its resulting effect in fighting the villain is proved to be next to none.The only capable woman (who's also the only disabled person) is the evil killer.What would Queen of the UK think about the movie? <br/><br/>But I'm not a feminist.Many people are upset about the anal sex in the movie; but I think it is completely acceptable.I don't think there's anything wrong or degrading in two consenting adults doing whatever they do.(Come on, the guy just saved everyone's ass in the world.)"

","I went into this movie expecting just a fun spy-action comedy. I certainly got that, but it felt like a lot more than just that. <br/><br/>Kingsman: The Secret Service has a very goofy plot. It's over-the- top, and it certainly knows it. However, the plot is still serious enough to keep you interested. Considering the handful of twists throughout the movie it easily keeps you engaged, and although you love laughing at how over-the-top it is, you still want to know the overall outcome. <br/><br/>The characters are quite well done. Sure, some of them are a little cliché, but that doesn't necessarily make them bad. Plus most of the cliché-ness is drowned out by the greatness of the rest of the movie, so I hardly noticed it until after the end credits rolled. They still felt real enough to keep you engaged in who they were and how the plot drove them forward. <br/><br/>The action scenes were fantastic. The camera work and constant speed of each duel was captivating, and oftentimes quite hilarious. Nevertheless, they're some of the most engaging fights I've ever seen, and some of the overall best. The choreography is fantastic, to an almost unreal level at how people are capable of moving as smoothly and quickly as they do (I wouldn't be surprised if there was some editing on the speed of each character though. Nonetheless, they were always beautiful to watch). Most of them appear to be done in one shot for the most part, which is even more fantastic. And considering the plot twists throughout, you were never sure who would actually win a fight, which really kept you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Overall Kingsman: The Secret Service is not at all what I expected, and in this case it turns out to be a good thing. The plot is silly, yet serious enough to keep you engaged, the characters are well- done, and the fights are stunning. This movie reminds me of Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz, with it's goofy plot and over-the-top action, only I thought this movie was better. If you did like Hot Fuzz, then you'll love this. In the end I would highly recommend Kingsman: The Secret Service. It surpassed my expectations on every level, and I'm sure it'll do the same for you."
"joeravioli","4","2","6","7 November 2015"," Kingsman rips your soul from your body with terrifying ease
","You know what made Roger Ebert a great critic? He enjoyed movies more than he enjoyed being enjoyed for enjoying movies. His writing made it obvious, little emotional flourishes and gorgeous analogies that set him in another league, miles away from many other critics. To him, films were not technical achievements; rather, they were human experiences, emotional experiences, philosophical experiences, or even intellectual experiences. He was one of the few critics that wanted films to affect him, rather than reveling in his power to affect a film's ratings. To put it bluntly, Ebert's taste emerged from his existence not as a film critic, but as a human.<br/><br/>Ebert took Vaughn's Kick Ass (2010), and justly gave it one star, asking his readers ""Will I seem hopelessly square if I find Kick-Ass morally reprehensible""? Well, I certainly thought so. I loved Kick-Ass, and although I have felt slight ethical twinges during recent viewings, my reasoning went as follows ""The bad guys get wasted, and they're bad guys, so I don't really give a damn if they get blown up."" Kingsman: The Secret Service makes Kick-Ass look like an episode of the Teletubbies. The bad guys get wasted, the not so bad guys get wasted, the good guys get wasted, about fifty or so bigots get wasted, the whole world wastes itself, and finally, a cheeky little princess gets wasted (but not in the same way as everyone else), each getting wasted in the most obscene and bloody way imaginable.<br/><br/>Kingsman is a surprisingly unfunny and disturbing little film, packaged with irresistible stylishness and beguiling obscenity. Perhaps I should specify: the film in itself isn't very disturbing, but the way it goes about masking its amorality, and the fact that so many people are blind to it definitely is. Most of it is rather bland, but when it isn't, it is mind-blowingly insane. But my question to you, not as a critic (although I suppose that designation isn't deserved, owing to the widespread abhorrence of my IMDb reviews) asking a reader, but as a human to another human, is ""At what cost?"" Kingsman has a solid structure: a talented yet extremely crude young man (Taron Egerton) whose life is drifting towards the dark world of drugs and crime is given the opportunity to join a secret spy agency, an opportunity which he readily accepts. But things aren't as easy as they seem, as he is one of several candidates who must compete in a series of death-defying trials to eventually earn a place in the agency. The other candidates are wonderfully cocky, posh British boys whom you can't help but hate, and a girl, Roxy, is also thrown in there simply to shake things up. Meanwhile, billionaire genius Richmond Valentine is plotting to end global warming through unknown, but obviously sinister means.<br/><br/>The training scenes are the best parts of the film, at times hilarious, at other times spectacularly intense, but at all times fun as hell. But then the film sees fit to dissolve itself in a moral cesspool with the most stylish and well-done massacre that I have ever seen in my entire life. I'm sorry, but as well-done as it is, I have to say that it was an awful experience. Sure, the people who get killed are bigots (I congratulate Vaughn on his meticulous manipulation of my sensibilities), but the sheer body count, and the simple glorification of indiscriminate death is too much (or too little?) for me to bear. Since when did entertainment have to be all about pointless and startlingly gruesome death? Then began my struggle. Do I buy into this? Or do I reject it? Each subsequent scene brought even more fun than the last, pulling me back into the film, assuring me that I wasn't a monster for enjoying (?) the film. It is made with such seductive glee and that it is hard to remember how awful the film's ideas and intentions actually are. But finally, Kingsman reaffirms my abhorrence by killing literally everyone.<br/><br/>What terrifies me about the film is that my friends love it. What terrifies me even more is the fact that this film has received critical acclaim. And what terrifies me the most is that I almost enjoyed it as well.<br/><br/>Kingsman: The Secret Service is a lurid film made for those without moral scruples. It is stylish and fun, (even though its humour comes across as rather bland) at the expense of hundreds, maybe even thousands of lives. The fact that this counts for entertainment (and good entertainment at that) in our world is rather a poor reflection on us as a species. I urge you, all of you, to attempt to engage your moral compass when watching films, because if we can look at this film and deem it acceptable, then there is something very wrong with us indeed. Remember Ebert, and remember what made him the greatest film critic the world has ever known."

"franksanchez2","5","2","6","27 June 2015"," Great fight scenes, confused directional style and unrealistic plot
","Kingsman the Secret Service, directed by Matthew Vaughn, is a 2014 action thriller that pays homage to the classic British spy genre. It stars Taron Egerton in the lead role, with Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Sophie Cookson in supporting roles and Samuel L. Jackson as the villain. Many reviewers really liked this movie, but although there were a few good things about it, I did not like it so much. Let me explain why. <br/><br/>The plot was clichéd and predictable. The main character Eggsy (played by Egerton) was a classic troubled teenager that is recruited by Harry Hart (played by Firth) an old friend of Eggsy's late father, to be part of the Kingsman Secret Service and capture bad guys that want to destroy the world. Eggsy goes on to learn the ways of the Kingsmen and eventually saves the world from an obnoxious megalomaniac (played by Jackson) that wants to destroy the world with his super weapon or something like that. That is basically the whole plot. Along the way, some people betray each other and some people get killed and there is a lot of explaining the plot that goes around in circles and there are some very cool fight scenes. I really felt that the plot lacked substance. There was really nothing special about a teenager perfecting his skill and saving the world from a bad guy. Even with a simplistic plot like this, interesting things can be done with it. The problem with this movie was that the stylistic choices including bright color schemes and out-of-place upbeat music and the dialogue, made it hard for me to take the movie seriously and really get involved in the fact that Sam Jackson's character wanted to kill everyone. The gore and tension throughout the movie was downplayed by the style. People were getting killed and there was upbeat disco music playing in the background. It felt as if they were going for a light-hearted family movie, and then there was intense murder scenes with lots and lots of gore that were still treated in the style of a light-hearted family film. It just didn't make sense. The characters didn't seem to take it seriously that people were dying a lot. I really didn't understand what Matthew Vaughn was going for in stylistic choices.<br/><br/>One of the main problems I had with this film was Samuel Jackson's ridiculous performance as the villain Valentine, especially his annoying lisp. Jackson is a great actor and I admire many of his performances, but his character simply wasn't remotely believable. We were supposed to believe as audience members that Valentine was some kind of evil genius that created some kind of technology or something like that (I lost track of the convoluted explanations) that caused people to fight each other, when he acted like he was really dumb. He was visible clueless when Colin Firth's intellectual gentleman character explained his position on environmental problems, something that Valentine was supposedly an expert on. Throughout the movie, Valentine consistently wears a casual baseball cap and swears casually in professional discussions. He gives the impression that he is an uneducated thug and not even a good one at that, but in fact according to the movie, he is a technological genius and public figure that creates a super weapon. In addition, he relies on his bodyguard Gazelle (played by Sofia Boutella) to do all the fighting. Valentine captures many WORLD LEADERS and important people without even having an army. He has a few henchman that show up at the end and are easily disposed by Eggsy and his comrades. It just isn't believable. At all. His character also seems somewhat racist given that Jackson is the only black actor in the film. Of course the one black guy has to be the evil terrorist WTF? In addition, Jackson and Sofia Boutella are the only non- English people in the film and they are the bad guys. It seems as if the filmmakers are trying to say that English people are smart and everyone else isn't. <br/><br/>There are many other problems I have with this movie including the long boring pacing with many unnecessary dialogue scenes (or information dumps), the convoluted plot structure, clichéd character development and consistent lack of substance. The one thing that I did like about this movie were the elaborate and well-choreographed and well-filmed fight sequences. There were quite a few fight scenes throughout the film and they were filmed often as long shots that were sped up and slowed down with pans and not much shaky cam. It reminded me of the stylistic fight sequences in Green Street Hooligans (which was a very good movie by the way). Aside from how well the fights were put together a lot of them seemed unnecessary and featured gratuitous gore and violence that didn't belong. In particular, there was one scene where Firth's character starts killing people in a church that lasts for probably about 3 minutes. At the end it is casually explained by Jackson that he used his weapon to brainwash Firth into killing everyone, and Firth barely reacts to that before getting shot in the head. This is somewhat of a surprise in the movie, but honestly Firth's character isn't likable enough for me to care one way or the other. <br/><br/>Besides the cool fight sequences, good cinematography and okay acting, this movie is a tediously long action thriller that lacks substance, original characters and plot elements, is predictable and has many plot elements that simply aren't believable or realistic. It has a family fun style but is way to gory to watch with young kids. Watch this movie if you are drinking beers with friends and don't mind cheesy movies or Samuel Jackson's obnoxious lisp. I give this movie a C- or a 6/10."

It shows a good sense and personality, one that belongs entirely to itself. The action is also quite shocking. I had no idea it would be rated-R, so when I saw the film I was pleasantly surprised by the type of violence shown and interconnected with some strong themes that the film is trying to play with.

In fact, the whole film is visually spectacular, from the speed of the fight scenes to the thoughtful framing and color choices to the classy and unique way they integrated cg into their spy tech. <br/><br/>It was actually pretty well-written, too, and I'm picky about that. For frame of reference, I think Avengers looks pretty cool but the dialogue is dreck. Kingsmen, though, asks you to suspend your disbelief as much as you would a comic book movie, but also provides answers to many logic holes that a viewer with half a brain would have. That said, much of its charm is also borne by its formulaic story. Like in the aforementioned Star Trek, our young troubled hero must prove he's worth his father's salt to an organization he's destined to join, and does so by helping to defeat a sociopathic supervillain. I'll trade originality of plot for sharp one-liners delivered by an intelligent cast in these rare cases.<br/><br/>The film has its flaws of course. Sorry ladies, Kingsmen is a boys' club, save the occasional tropey man-eater female assassin or damsel busting at the seams. Oh well, you can't have everything. TL;DR: This movie is f'ing spectacular. If I were British I probably would have loved it to an unhealthy degree."

","I enjoyed this film very much. It was a fun, action-packed spy thriller for a new generation. Great mix of comedy, action, thrills and really unique spy gadgets. I remember when the first trailer came out and I was like this is one film I have to see in theaters. I don't normally go, but something about this flick called to me. In the age of James Bond and Ethan Hunt, which both characters I enjoy and their movies, this takes the spy world to the next level. I don't think I have ever gone to a movie where I said awesome or so cool many times to myself. Even if you are not a fan of spy flicks, this movie is still worth a watch especially for the church scene alone."

","Such a fun take on the modern world of espionage. The cinematography in this film was done beautifully and the action sequences in this film are so amazingly executed. I appreciate a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and this movie knows how to portray the class that feels like British royalty, but the comedic humor of all classes. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) really excels in this movie and is truly an underdog worth cheering for. I loved the soundtrack and the use of color throughout the film."

","A seasoned British spy (Colin Firth) mentors a younger spy (Taron Egerton) as they join a broader effort to save the world from an evil plan of an eccentric billionaire (Samuel L. Jackson).<br/><br/>""Kingsman"" is occasionally too busy in its story but is still above average compared to other modern suspense-thrillers. It also has more than its fair share of violence (the odd use of the upbeat song ""Pomp and Circumstance"" in a particular scene is bizarrely unforgettable). Yet it still comes off as entertaining and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Like the James Bond films (likely an influence), the gadgets and special effects add much to the entertainment value. Firth also brings along his dependable amount of class and talent especially in a scene when he must verbally defend his actions in a redneck, hate-filled church. Having Michael Caine in the cast is the icing on the cake."
"MihaiSorinToma","8","1","2","8 December 2018"," A good action flick
","When a seemingly ordinary boy with a troubled life, especially due to his stepfather, gets recruited by a secret intelligence organization, he's put into a situation where he must learn plenty of new elements, including teamwork. As a result, he must do his best to prove himself as a new great threat arises, putting the whole world in danger.<br/><br/>It's a pretty unusual movie, one which introduces a world-wide threat which can only be solved by a couple of highly skilled spies, along with their impressive devices and a brand new recruit who must quickly get accustomed to his new position. I say it's unusual not due to its story, but because of the way it presents it. It has a tendency of not taking itself seriously, thus you get plenty of amazing action sequences but also a lot of sarcastic and funny situations. You won't get to laugh out loud but you'll still have a better time due to it. But, as it often happens when talking about this approach, you can generate some laughs but you also are prone to a reduced amount of thrill and drama. Also, it can become pretty predictable, fact which also doesn't do it much good.<br/><br/>The characters involved are well developed, diverse and likeable, played by some very charismatic actors which simply make them shine. If the story is mostly ok, its characters are truly impressive from my point of view. As said before, another very well implemented aspect is represented by the action part, which is full of highly exaggerated combat, shooting and spy-like moves which are truly awesome. It's pretty hard to describe them otherwise as the child in me can't help but be astonished.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned, it's quite an unusual movie. If you ask me, it's in a love or hate situation. If you can accept its approach and especially its exaggerations, you're going to have a great time watching it. Otherwise, this might not be the movie for you. As far as I'm concerned, it's a very good movie which entertained me until the end and made me lust for a sequel. If it had a better antagonist and a better story, we would have been talking about a truly great movie."

","""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" tells the story of a privately funded Intelligence Agency, that consists of the best agents, trying to solve cases independent from countries and governments. When a rich enterpreneur plans to decrease humanity through a newly developed sim-card-technology, it is time for the newest members to proof that they earn their membership.<br/><br/>For my personal taste, the movie is a bit too colorful and hectical. At points it feels more like a persiflage in itself and you really shouldn't start to think about the inner logic of the plot too much. The later consists of a crime quite similar to one Dan Brown described in one of his novels, only in a rather excentrical and odd way. The production value is high, the film looks great and has every technical feature to be considered a blockbuster. Unfortunately, the characters are a bit stereotypical, the story is rather predictable and the gags not always in the right spot.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is a bit overrated in my eyes. I was expecting an adult comic movie such as Kick-Ass but sometimes this felt more like a Scary Movie for spies. The result is not a bad film, it is still quite entertaining and professionally produced but it doesn't stand out from the crowd."

","Another of those movies I am glad I did not waste my money on (saw it on ITV last night) and if I had not had the flu and needed something to do to while away a couple of hours I would resent the waste of the time.
Where to begin to try to make sense of the mess that it all seemed to me. Having also seen Spectre last weekend (again thanks ITV) comparisons are inevitable. Sadly, the Kingsman comes nowhere close either as some kind of comic book to film parody or attempt to ""re-invent"" this long-established genre (that does not need it on the strength of Spectre). 
Others have picked out the worst excesses of this movie so no need to repeat them here suffice to say none of these I found entertaining - and after all, is that not the point of a movie? And while it has extreme violence (yes, really off the scale) and f-bombs aplenty mostly c/o Samuel L, the only nudity was tacked on at the end in such a slipshod tawdry way I watched the credits in disbelief. 
The Bond films got it right more times than wrong, Kingsman never came close. Now there is a sequel but thanks to ITV I shall not be visiting the theatre to see that nor paying for a download. Do yourself a favour: instead of watching this travesty and insult to your intelligence, dig out an old Roger Moore Bond film and see a master at work."

","A James Bond type action film with doses of comedic relief Kingsmen really blew me away! Funny thing about these ""ultra-violent"" yet comedic movies they either get a 9 or 10 or a 1 or 0 (either love em' or hate em') There is no middle ground in a movie like this. People that abhor gratuitous violence should not view these type of films. To me it's more intriguing to see something that repulses people than a movie that gets a 5 or 6 rating. I say HOORAY!! for all those who gave the KINGSMEN the rating it deserves (9-10) And for all those who panned it with a 1 stick to what you know and like. Boring drama. Colin Firth was absolutely brilliant as was ""Eggsy"" I never wrote a review before so this is a statement not only about this film but people's attitudes in general. Thank you."

And as every spy movie,it comes with a bad guy that has an evil plot to destroy the world and in this one the evil plot it's brilliant.Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain named Richmond Valentine, and the villain plan was to offer everyone in the world Sim cards that grant free lifetime cellular and Internet connectivity. But what the people don't know is that those Sim card can trigger a signal that causes them to become murderously violent and start killing each other. Another thing that I found it worked pretty good with the movie was the humor. Even though most of the spy movies have a serious tone and a few subtle jokes,this movie was the opposite,it was full of funny moments and jokes that blend well with the movie.

","The Kingsmen is a long standing international secret service operation. It is fashioned after the Knights of the Round Table.

As young adults compete for the honor, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a lisp) conspires to save the world from Global Warming. His side kick is a woman (Sofia Boutella) with knives as lower limbs. Together they spoof the super villains in films.

The story while not really the best in the world was still good or at least decent enough to keep me interested. The weak story is the thing that drags this down a couple of points. But I like the characters and the bond the characters all have. It felt real to me, especially with Eggsy and his mentors. I also think the final thirty minutes or so were some great action packed thrills and it did leave me in suspense. The final mid credits scene was pretty good as well, would suggest watching that if you see the movie. <br/><br/>Short and generic review but just wanted to get my initial thoughts down: Not a bad movie, not a great one either.

"baldasgetout-26409","9","1","2","16 September 2017"," Engaging hilarious riot
","Maybe it helped to have been raised in a British media sphere to recognise the clichés from sixties British TV and films; but sent up, parodied, twisted and subverted. I began with no expectations other than the information in the title: Kingsman, the secret service. The hero faces a series of selection challenges, a theme as old as storytelling. His motivations are as obscure as the motivations of the Bondian villain are improbable, the material culture of the villains HQ is pure sixties Broccoli, but the means of communication are up to date. I'm not sure the plot makes any sense- that doesn't matter as we are propelled from illusion to crisis every minute. The hero receives ambiguous off-hand help from a mentor, but no discernible training before he's put to work. The film is certainly amoral, even anarchic. The Kingsman organisation is an independently funded secret service, with no governmental or democratic oversight. Violence is extreme and cartoonish cf Tom and Gerry, the mores of political correctness are not observed. Most of the cast are dead by the end. The hero does get the girl ( to the tune of 'Slave to Love'), though not the one you expected, another confounded expectation. There is some bad taste here and there. But there are values- and not bad ones for this age of lost boys-wear a suit and tie, have a polite manner, accept some help from 'old people', take a little instruction; and your mother might yet be proud of you. There's a sleazy mendacious Michael Caine, and Colin Firth ( still better known in the UK as 'Mr Darcy') does the unthinkable ( and I don't want to spoil that). And the torch has been passed to a new generation. It probably didn't get many Oscars- there's not much angst here about the American condition- but there's a pastiche of modern Merry England, and that scene in the church. Two hours approx of escapism. Enjoy."
"SyoKennex","10","1","2","13 September 2017"," Saviour of the Spy Genre
","I've watched Kingsman: The Secret Service many times since it's release in 2014, and not once have I ever thought it deserves less than 10 stars. In a world filled with films that just end up following numerous tropes and becoming overdone, Kingsman is a refreshing film that reminds us just watch spy films are meant to be.<br/><br/>We follow the story of Eggsy, a young man with an abusive stepdad, who loves his mother more than anything. After getting into trouble with the police, he is signed up to undergo training to become a possible Kingsman, a gentleman spy ring. At the same time, the world's new criminal mastermind is just starting to unveil his new plot to take over the world.<br/><br/>I think the first thing about this film to note is the humour. It's absolutely spot on. It really captures British humour and shows what we're about. There was nothing that didn't fit right into the movie and the feeling of it, and everything flowed along brilliantly.<br/><br/>The second thing, is definitely the cinematography; especially during the fight scenes. George Richmond did an absolutely amazing job, and I'm very interested, just from the church fight scene, to have a look at other films he has done cinematography for. He has a real talent for it, and it definitely made Kingsman even better. <br/><br/>The acting on everyone's part was absolutely brilliant. It's obvious that everyone put a lot of work into their roles, and with legends such as Michael Caine, Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Firth it's not hard to see why the acting quality is so high. With breakthroughs actors Taron Egerton (Eggsy) and Sophie Cookson (Roxy), Kingsman proves high on its casting quality and Reg Poerscout-Edgerton did an amazing job. With such films as Guardians of the Galaxy, Age of Ultron and The Man from U.N.C.L.E under his belt, it's not hard to see why he was picked for the job.<br/><br/>At the end of the day this is a gory, wonderful new retake on the spy genre, and it does absolute wonders. With humour to suit most people, a heart breaking underlying story line, and a massive villain with an up to date way to take over the world, Kingsman proves itself in every aspect of film making, and is a blessing to the cinematic world."

It's too violent for kids, but it's too silly for adults (and no, ""Kick Ass"" and the campy Bond films never worked for me, either).<br/><br/>When you flag up your in jokes as they're used, it doesn't make them endearing, it just makes them trite. You're drawing too much attention and trying too hard, instead of being suave.<br/><br/>Don't kid yourself, Matthew. It's EXACTLY that kind of movie. You just can't resist."
"NakamuraUbermensch","8","1","2","9 September 2017"," The thought provoking spy flick with a heartbreaking story about complex characters and corrupt governmental agencies. Well, that ain't that kind of movie.
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is a delightful surprise, the movie that had everything to be just a generic spy flick turned out to be one of the best action movies of 2015. Whether you take it as a parody or as a homage, Kingsman is great at both, it combines everything that made the genre so good into a very unique piece of entertainment, the gadgets, the megalomaniac villains, the badass fight scenes, it's the kind of movie that is so fun that you just don't want it to end.<br/><br/>Regarding the technical aspect, the movie is style from beginning to end. The directing is amazing, I thought Matthew Vaughn was great in X-Men: First Class, but here, he's much more free to do what he wants to do, and it gives the movie a really exotic look (you'll remember the church scene). The cast is excellent, there is not even a single miscast here, Colin Firth is excellent, so are Samuel L Jackson and Taron Egerton.<br/><br/>Perhaps Kingsman is not a movie for everyone, it might be too silly for some, too violent for others, or even offensive for those who are not used to the dark humor used here. But if you're tired of the new spy movies that just want to be serious and dramatic, and miss the old ones, that just wanted to be fun, give Kingsman a shot and you won't regret it."
"andrewnmiller","10","1","2","2 September 2017"," Violent, gory and just plain fun.
","For someone who has never even heard of the Kingsman comic let alone seen the movie, I was unsure about what I would get when I sat down to watch Kingsman: The Secret Service. Well, mark my words when I say that this movie straight up rocks! From it's fast-paced action and wit to it's homages and mockery of the spy movie genre, this is everything that the modern James Bond movies wished they could be.<br/><br/>The movie begins in 1997 where a secret agent named Lee Unwin loses his life to protect his team during a raid. After that, the squad leader Harry Hart gives a medal to the Unwin's widow and her son. 17 years later, a professor is abducted by humanitarian Richmond Valentine while one of Hart's fellow agents code-named ""Lancelot"" tries a rescue only to be killed by Valentine's henchwoman. We then cut to Garry ""Eggsy"" Unwin living with his mother and stepfather and while he is an smart and gifted young man, he lives the life of a common theft. After being arrested for car theft, Garry is freed and seeing potential in the boy, Hart takes him under his wing to become a Kingman. Now, Eggsy must complete his training and stop Valentine from ending humanity.<br/><br/>With the overabundance of comic book films in the last few years, some have fallen into the pit of trying to be too somber or brooding, however where Matthew Vaughn's foresight rests on and what his previous comic-book movies have proved so far is that they walk a fine line to where the tension and solemn character moments conclude and the parody and comedy take over, leaving a distinctive action film that manages to stand out from the watered-down bloodless action films that keep getting released. Kingsman is a movie that's completely unmatched and its own thing while wholly adopting its English cultural roots, even the marketing for the movie takes cues from the Bond films. As Kingsman is an out of the ordinary movie, it works within the context of the spy movie genre by itself but also it takes jabs at spy movies and their clichés that it could be seen as a comedy/spoof much like the Austin Powers films, but personally I see the movie as a complimentary tribute to the genre. The best example of this in the movie is during the cabin fight sequence where there is a jug of whiskey, several men are killed and not a drop of whiskey has been spilled and then Lancelot shoots his fingers at the past and say that they are the future, a perfect homage to the genre. Also, Kingsman mixes the appeal of spy films such as the bizarre gadgets, the exaggerated villain, and the aristocratic spy with new ideas and it does so perfectly while also breathing new life into a genre that has gotten way too serious over the last few years and it's so energizing to watch a movie that isn't nervous to have some fun or make some jokes as opposed to some recent action movies.<br/><br/>The way the film is shot is some of the finest I've seen in any action movie and the cinematography is truly eloquent but without the quick cuts and shaky cam that continue to plague modern action films and is mostly done in one shot which gives the movie a bit of fluidity. Of course a great spy movie is nothing without a lot of gory action and Kingsman delivers that in spades and the over-the top violence is one of the movie's largest selling points, now I personally don't care for extreme violence in movies just for the sake of having it, but seeing somebody be killed in a movie without showing any blood or the ramifications of that action is an insult to the viewer and it dilutes their joy when watching the movie. Thankfully, Kingsman doesn't suffer from that which allows Vaughn to go all out with the action and gore and while there are plenty of stand-out action set pieces throughout the film such as a fight in a pub where Harry Hart knocks out several guys with an umbrella or at the end when Eggsy takes on Valentine's henchwoman, the crown jewel of the movie's action scenes is a scene where Harry is in a church where everything breaks loose and people go crazy and shooting commences, easily one of the most perfectly composed action set pieces in any action or comic book movie.<br/><br/>Of course, a film of this caliber wouldn't have been as good had it not had a cast of great actors to play these characters, but Kingsman delivers that in spades and every actor plays their role to perfection. Sofia Boutella is deadly and outrageously exciting as the iron leg wearing henchwoman Gazelle. Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful as the villainous Richmond Valentine and has the right amount of stagecraft to him and yet manages to be quite witty at the same time with his lisp and loathing for blood. Mark Strong is engaging and reliable as Merlin and makes the role even better with his Scottish accent. Sophie Cookson is wonderful as Roxy, however it's Taron Egerton who is the breakout star of the movie and he is incredibly appealing, enduring and downright hilarious and yet still stays true to who his character is and has jokes for every circumstance, but Collin Firth nearly steals the entire movie as Harry Hart which given his knack for playing serious roles, would come across strange but Firth is so wonderful as a cultured spy and it's so energizing and enjoyable to see Collin step out of his serious acting shoes and play a more vibrant character and rounding out the cast is the always wonderful Michael Cane as Arthur.<br/><br/>I can't praise Kingsman enough, it's just a total blast to watch. Go watch it already!"

","This is an enjoyable spy movie similar to the James Bond movies with a more light hearted tone. It has a core problem of having the main villain seek to destroy the world, which makes the ending quite predictable. However the most grievous error was the misuse of the amazing actors Mark Hamill and Michael Caine, which were in smaller roles that didn't take advantage of their unique strengths. In short it's enjoyable, however has a fundamental flaw in the predictability of the story and misuse of actors."

","I was very surprised how much this director expanded the 6 issues material to a quite extraordinary film.<br/><br/>We have the toys,we have the villain,we have the mentor figure and we have the lead,all pieces falling perfectly into place to form a Kingsman's journey to success.<br/><br/>Eggsy's life and growth are meant to reflect our lives and our continuous evolution and strife to be better.He had a tragic childhood,losing his father,her mother replacing him with some unworthy suitor she found,probably to provide safety to her family.Despite the life he is inspired to lead in spite of his new father,Galahad takes him under his wing and proposes him to be the next Lancelot,a recent Kingsman who died on the field,in honor of his former student,Eggsy's dad sacrifice for his team.Despite not passing the final test,after his mentor's death he takes the responsibility of stopping Valentine.What I particularly liked is that he came up with the solution which got them out of an almost deadly spot even if I expected Galahad to come back and save the day.This movie does well on shading light and giving the deserved spot to their main character without undermining the journey and grooming his qualities which he uses in the last arc of the ingenuity,combat training,wisdom,quick thinking,efficiency and wit.His best quality,in the end remains his good heart which kept him on the right path all along,a good example being that he did not want to shoot the dog or that he wanted everyone to be safe on the parachute test.<br/><br/>Valentine,played by Samuel L.Jackson is a great villain for me,because he doesn't want to take over the world,kill millions of people,he just wants to provide a mean to diminish the population of the planet so that certain individuals can adapt better and survive more safely.Like every villain he corrupts the politicians of the world to be on his side but unlike some he also uses the hero to test his device,Galahad,who killed everyone in the Church,then kills him without revealing anything.I liked that he takes precautions with the explosive chip inserted in the neck,showing his suspicion. Despite being a maniac for a good cause,what is funny about him is his homophobia to some degree.<br/><br/>The minor characters:Galahad,a well groomed,old Kingsman who hasn't lost any bit of his charm,who's mission is to groom the boy and in doing so repaying the debt to his father,is the mentor,who has to die for his student to take matters into his hands.Gazelle played by the charming Sofia Boutella,was the lover of Valentine,a keen,well trained assassin,who was Eggsy's ultimate test,being his shadow and an apprentice of her own who in the end failed killing the hero.Merlin as his Kingsman's name suggest is the ultimate support,always there to help,the right hand of this story's hero but also his teacher,the one who tested him,among others to see who is worth of a place at the ""Round Table"".<br/><br/>This movie had an amazing,fitting soundtrack and great action sequences combined with good characters to form a great story and journey."

","This movie exceeded my expectation for a spy movie. It is a perfect combination of comedy and action. Even thought the characteristic and costume follow typical James Bond style. The story is not as predicting. The opening is pretty violent as well as the church scene. However, the fast action and smooth editing makes them the most memorable parts of the movie. I also love the last part in which they turn the head explosion into fireworks. So hilarious!"

","After his father is killed in the service of his country, ""Eggsy"" (Taron Egerton) lives with his mother and her low-class boyfriend with little opportunity for upward mobility. However, he still holds onto a locket given to him as a young boy with an advisement to call an inscribed number if he ever needs serious help. So one day after fighting off some local bullies and being subsequently arrested for stealing the gang member's car he makes the call. To his surprise he is immediately released and the charges are all dropped. It's then that he learns that his father was a member of a clandestine organization in the British government known as the ""Kingsman"" and he is encouraged to join. However, it isn't nearly as easy to graduate from the program as he would like and he watches as the other people selected begin to drop out one by one. Meanwhile, a crazed billionaire by the name of ""Richmond Valentine"" (Samuel L. Jackson) who has come up with a plan to save the world from greenhouse gasses by killing almost all of the people who inhabit it. And with very few agents available to investigate Eggsy is called upon to help out before everything and everyone is killed. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting movie which raced from one exciting scene to the next in a very smooth manner. Unfortunately, the director (Matthew Vaughn) chose to take the low-road and utilized an over-abundance of vulgarity for the sake of some cheap laughs much too often. And most of it was simply unnecessary. In any event, this grew rather tiring after awhile and seriously limited the movie's overall appeal. But even so it was still entertaining to a certain degree and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

Eggsy gets off to a rough start, but eventually follows in Harry's footsteps. Jackson (Pulp Fiction) plays corrupt, computer whiz, Valentine, Caine (Batman Begins) plays Arthur, the head of Kingsman and Mark Hamill (Star Wars) also appears briefly as Professor Arnold.

"oscaralbert","9","3","12","19 February 2015"," Not just the best James Bond spoof yet . . .
",". . . but KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is even more important for its vicious critique of and poetic justice for the One Per Cent. In spoofing Bond, KINGSMAN touches all the bases with its own twists. Secret agent trainee ""Eggsy"" names his obligatory pooch ""J.B.""--not for Bond or James Bond wannabe (if he could just remember) Jason Bourne, but for Fox TV's loose cannon Jack Bauer. There are takes on the Bond gizmo's, the Bond martini, the ""Bond girls"" (Eggsy's are no holes barred), the Bond one-liners, the Bond villains, the Bond villains' mutant-like Henchpeople, the Bond predicaments, the Bond implausible escapes, the Bond outer space Hijinks, the Bond villains' verbal diarrhea, the MI6 elaborate hideouts, the villains' more elaborate hideouts, etc. David Niven's CASINO ROYALE Bond spoof was a total mess, and the Austin Powers series was ALL tongue-in-cheek spoof, laying it on way too thick most of the time. KINGSMAN hits a more perfect balance of wry, self-conscious (and often self-proclaimed) homage, and a movie with plots and characters the viewer can take somewhat seriously.<br/><br/>Regarding the One Per Cent, is it too much of a ""spoiler"" to say to watch carefully when ""Pomp and Circumstance"" starts playing in order to see Barack Obama's head explode? Unfortunately, in most of the 23 Eon Company Bond flicks out so far, Agent 007 only looks out for the interest of the One Per Cent, everyone else be darned. Refreshingly, KINGSMAN is just the opposite. When Samuel L. Jackson's villain comes up with the idea that a few billion ""little people"" need to be ""culled"" (or purged, for those of you non-lobster eaters), he has absolutely no trouble convincing most of the world's ""elite"" to go along with his plan to create more elbow room. ALL of the villain's Rich and Powerful collaborators' heads explode in a Candyland sort of way toward the close of KINGSMAN, thanks to Eggsy and his allies. Jack Bauer could be counted upon to behead a baddie or two, but it was just one at a time. KINGSMAN goes Bauer and the Fox TV thousands of times better. (What else would you expect from Twentieth Century Fox?)."

","I thought the movie was below average from the beginning, but the cliches and especially the sexist ending resulted in me even regretting watching it. Seriously, it's the 21st century and people still think it's ok to put a woman in a cell, have her bargain with a kiss to be set free by the so called ""hero"" and promising him, a complete stranger, anal sex if he saves the world (and actually giving it to him when he succeeds). I also resent the cliche with the woman being from Scandinavia, which reinforces the false image of women from these countries being ""easy"".

"johnplocar","9","2","7","9 January 2016"," Do you like action and absurd spy films? Well than this is perfect for you! It was for me.
","""Kingsman: The Secret Service"": To describe this movie in one word, the word would undoubtedly have to be ""cool"". This movie drools cool from its characters to its violence to its style to its camera work, this was bloody and awesome! I've been a pretty big fan of this director since 2011 when I first saw a film of his, which was ""X- Men: First Class"". I dug the hell out of that flick, I thought that it was a real fun time in the theater and is still possibly my favorite X-Men flick to date. Then I finally got around to checking out his movie ""Kick-Ass"", which in my opinion is one of the greatest comic book movies of all time, right next to Tim Burton's ""Batman"", Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"", and the Richard Donner ""Superman"" films. This movie deserves a place as one of the great spy films to go alongside something like the James Bond franchise. It shows a real love for those movies, particularly in the Roger Moore era, but does its own thing with the genre, plus being creative in how brutal and violent one single frame can get. It is amazing to watch every action sequence happen in the movie. Samuel L. Jackson had me laughing my ass off with him as the villain while simultaneously being fairly unique and intense in his character's own right. For a brief time in the movie I didn't quite understand what his motivation was for his ultimate plans, but once it got to the explanation I was right on board. Not that I ever got off board necessarily, it was just something that popped in my mind occasionally is all. All the characters in the film are a blast to watch in their own ways; Colin Firth commands every scene that he is in with his suave attitude and great talent for taking out an entire room of bad guys all on his own. The lead character ""Eggsy"", played by Taron Egerton, a young guy who seems to be pretty early in his career really does an outstanding job in his role here. He remains likable and completely believable in his action sequences, never once faltering where the character could easily fallen into being relatively annoying if played by a lesser actor. But he keeps the character feel real, someone I can route for and interesting to watch. I like the quirky touches that Matthew Vaughn brings to his films, they don't ever seem quite conventional yet they don't come across as too out of the realm of comprehension either. His films know how to have fun and can also hold a real sense of danger too. ""First Class"" had fun playing with its time and setting, but still dealt with themes of prejudice and nuclear war. ""Kick Ass"" had fun with its comic book style with bringing that over-the-top world into a somehow extremely grounded and extremely gritty reality. And now ""Kingsman"" with the mystery, highly stylized silly action and spy gadgets while also threats of mass genocide from the villain. One of the best spy and action films I've seen in a while; if you are a fan of the spy genre and action in general then this may be right up your ally."
"secretzfan","10","2","7","28 December 2015"," The best spy film of 2015!!!
","It is not only the best spy film of 2015 but right now for me it may end up being the best film of 2015. No seriously it really might. I haven't had this much fun with any film since the first Avengers movie and this is defiantly a lot more adult than that one, and even with its adult themes and a being a 'R' rated film it holds so much back from us. I mean there are times when you forget that its 'R', and then you watch a fight scene in it and you remember the reason why. Still with all that being said it still a film I highly recommend. I have personally watched the film at least six times maybe more. <br/><br/>Colin Firth does a great job in it to the point were he should be commended for what he managed to do in the role. He truly gave a lot of life to his performance playing the hardcore spy who was been doing this for a long time. He also was a great father figure and a lovable character overall. <br/><br/>Taron Egerton is defiantly going somewhere in the future with his career, and I myself can't wait to see where he finds himself at. I absolutely loved him playing this kid from the ghetto who was trying to make a life for himself and be something to someone who wanted him to be. <br/><br/>So overall this is a exceptional film that deserves a lot of notice and needs to be on everyone's top 10 list even if it isn't number one like it will probably end up being for me."

","Kingsman: The Secret Service is an action spy comedy film based on the comic of the same name and directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass, X-Men: First Class). I thought it was great fun. It was action packed and really funny in all the right places.<br/><br/>Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) is a teenage delinquent, who lives with his mum and her abusive boyfriend in a small flat in London. One night, Eggsy steals the car of someone he doesn't like, crashes it into a police car and is sent to jail. A short time later he is bailed out by man named Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a veteran secret agent who informs Eggsy that his father was one of their top agents who died saving Harry's life 18 years ago. Harry takes Eggsy under his wing and leads him into the world of espionage to stop a dangerous super-villain Mr. Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) from taking over the world.<br/><br/>There are plenty of allusions and references to other action spy films like the James Bond and Jason Bourne series and this movie satirises many of their most memorable moments really well. The film's action scenes were also very well choreographed and this is thanks to Matthew Vaughn's fast paced directing style. Colin Firth was great as the English gentleman style secret agent Harry Hart and newcomer Taron Egerton was also enjoyable as the protagonist Eggsy. There was rarely a dull moment.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10 and I recommend it to anyone who liked the first Kick Ass movie and Hot Fuzz."

","Kingsman was highly recommended to me by a friend that knows what I like in film and TV and I finally got a free movie weekend from my provider and saw it available to watch. It was not at all what I expected--it was extremely out there and not believable...yet I was still into it.<br/><br/>Usually there are things that are outrageous and if there are an overwhelming amount of said outrageous things, the story loses believability for me and I have trouble suspending disbelief. For most of the film, I could not buy into the ridiculous scenarios, but I kept with it and kept trying. I enjoyed Taron Egerton's Eggsy so much so, and grew attached to the character. I wanted him to succeed and felt for him during his Kingsman training/testing. I think the real turning point was a major character's death, and then I totally was able to suspend disbelief and cheer on Eggsy and what remained of the Kingsman Service. <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is great, but his character was one of the ones that didn't make any logical sense. I could never take him seriously as a baddie because of the way he spoke. His sidekick with the lower leg blades, or whatever those were, were another outrageous element that made this movie utterly ridiculous. <br/><br/>Overall, I rate this 8 out of 10 stars for the humour it provided and the discovery of Taron Egerton!"

The way director Matthew Vaughn was able to pull all of these elements together to direct a hit like this is amazing.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed the classic James Bond spy films, but Kingsman was such a unique take on the spy movie genre that it is hard not to like. <br/><br/>One thing that really pulled this movie together was the casting. Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L Jackson all play very important roles in the film and complement each other very well making the movie that much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>I would recommend Kingman to just about anyone who enjoys a good action movie with some comedy and romance mixed in.

This film contains my personal favorite scene in any film, though to a casual observer this could be any one of many, as every scene has either impeccable dialogue or mesmerizing fighting sequences.

"IsaacSage","9","2","7","10 November 2015"," Review: Kingsman: The Secret Service
","People always talk about the good old days of movies. The 60's and 70's are prime targets. One of the biggest products of the 60's was the spy film. ""Goldfinger"", my favorite Bond film, was a huge hit, and a lot of people want to recapture the magic of said film. Even the filmmakers do. Why else would the DB5 make an appearance in 2012's spectacular ""Skyfall?"" The truth is, if Goldfinger were made today, people probably wouldn't like it. It's great because of the nostalgia, because we get to see what made a sexy hero, girl, and villain back in the day. Some bits would work, but the weird names and cheesy lines would not connect with an audience not warned that it's a movie from the 60's. Kingsman: The Secret Service is not an homage, or satire of 60's bond, as people say. It's a remake. Since I hate everything about remakes, one might expect I'd hate this film. However, the sheer fun factor, and the attitude that makes Kingsman feel as refreshing as it is is worth the price of admission. In the film, a young criminal named Eggsy(Taron Egerton) is recruited by Harry Hart(Colin Furth) to join the Kingsman, an organization of spies that, well, save the world. Eggsy begins his training, while Harry tracks down Valentine(Samuel L. Jackson) an evil Russel Simmons selling SD Cards that release violent brainwaves. Each actor digs into their roles perfectly, and the standout is the DiCaprio like Egerton. However, this is a 60's Bond plot by all accounts.Ridiculous villain with mountain lair, check. Henchman with crazy physical disability, check(this time it's in the form of a razor-legged woman.) But the plot has been injected with the fuel of 2015's ""meta"" culture. James Bond, as well as other spy films are referenced almost constantly. The fact that these references work is astounding. Of course, there couldn't be a young recruit without his learning to work together with other young recruits. Some are rich and spoiled, some are nice and humbled. These parts work...but less well. They set up exciting set pieces, but ultimately feel too cliché for their own good. However, the third thing that makes Kingsman feel fresh is the thing it has most going for it. Director Matthew Vaughn's extremely modern brand of ultraviolence. A masterful, Tarantinian scene in a church comes to mind, but the finale is just as gleefully destructive. This adrenaline shot of modern techniques combined with the old-school sensibilities of ""Goldfinger"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" elevate Kingsman. It's not just an action film, it's one of the best films of the year. It speaks to the film's list of great moments(or my overlong writing) that I don't have room to mention the AMAZING score, and gorgeous pop-art production design. If a 60's Bond film was made today, it might look something like this."
"autisticreviewers","9","2","7","10 November 2015"," Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.
","Spy films nowadays are all taken seriously since the reboot of the famous 007: James Bond series back in 2006, and as well the introduction of the Bourne series in which helped to format what kind of spy flick could be in existence. Kingsman however is something that is both over-the-top and yet takes us back to the 90's generation of spy movies that are often looked back today and regarded as cheesy or bad. Not to say that Kingsman is already this year's worst film immediately nor too put it down, but it achieves the audiences in ways you could or couldn't expect it, and truth be told it won me over!<br/><br/>Based on the acclaimed graphic novel of the same name by the writers of the cult hit Kick-Ass 1 and 2, Kingsman tells both an origin story and a thrilling adventure of epic proportions. If you have had read the book, you could expect pretty much what will happen but surprisingly Matthew Vaughn has given more detail to make it seem more epic. There are some minor changes to the original characters but the structure of whey they go pretty much follows the book but better in the results on screen.<br/><br/>If the mixture of Bond, Kick-Ass and perhaps The Avengers were to be combined, this would be the film that would have came out of it! Kingsman: The Secret Service is a shot of pure fire of action, comedy and pure escapism that will indeed keep you awake and it certainly earns a spot of my favorite films for 2015 alongside Birdman.<br/><br/>4.5/5 - Nick"

","I love over-the-top violence and lengthy, frenetic fight scenes (Suckerpunch) so this movie was extremely satisfying and stimulating for me. It is Jackie Chan meets Tanrantino with a lavish budget spent on mega CGI. I think I might have to buy a copy - it's that good. I was quite impressed with all casting with the exception of Jackson's lisp and aversion to the sight of blood. These traits were a little off- putting after seeing him dominate other roles. Gazelle's is a stand out character with an unusual weapons at her disposal. Her ""handicap"" does not slow her down at all, rather she has turned her replacement limbs into lethal instruments and has the training to wipe out rooms full of armed men.

","Kingsman is a movie about secret service, the people of this secret service help to keep balance in the entire world by keeping down the crime levels. Now what happens is a member of this elite service is killed, thus a training type mission is carried out for recruitment of a new member out of five individuals. As the story runs, it is found out that one of the organizations in charge, which deal with sim cards has actually prepared a method to convert every individual into psychopath by just listening to some kind of music. Only those with a circuit fitted into their bodies (neck) are immune, except for the choice that circuit can make ones head explode and result in their death. All of kings man die due to this except a few, just because their chief along with many chief's (of various organization's) come together with villain.<br/><br/>This villain only does these because he thinks population as virus and he feels for pressure on nature. It's shown that he is some kind of spiritual entity. Pressure on nature is already handled by our nature via diseases like AIDS. Still taking a drastic step is questionable as by statistics population growth will slow down. It may be justified as people act only properly, if there is some kind of fear. Example is fear of Boss in office where people are employed. If that is happening a lot needs to change like a person employed for what he desires. The trained individual is not trained for any sort of combat, still manages well, a negative mark there. The movie is great; I still have certain amount of sympathy for villain.

A protagonist who was just a punk till he decided to be awesome instead. Great action sequences, an even better OST and a story that while being plausible, was absolutely bonkers at the same time.

","It took me a bit to consider watching Kingsman, there was something about the poster and marketing for it that just didn't seem like it was right; it just didn't reach out and grab me I guess is better to say. We decided to check out the trailer a few times over to see if it was something that we'd be interested in, of course we finally said ""Okay... Let's watch it"". I have to say that going to see this movie was fully worth the cost. Kingsman: The Secret Service is quite possibly the best spy comedy that I've saw in a very long time. This movie is filled with spots that will have you laughing out of your chair. The cast for Kingsman: The Secret Service couldn't have been picked any better, these guys gave their all in this movie; I wouldn't have been able to not laugh if I was in their shoes.

","Sitting down to watch ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"", I had no prior knowledge of the movie except that it was a modern film take on the idea of the British secret service. I don't know what I was expecting, but I didn't expect what I saw. I am not saying that this is a terrible movie. The production values are slick, there are some exhilarating action sequences, and the movie thankfully does not take things completely seriously. However, the comedy and the action really does not mix. The comedy is really goofy at times, while the action is really hard core at times, and the two extremes don't really mix. And at over two hours in length, the movie goes on too long. (I should add that even at that length, there are a few minor plot gaps that suggest some linking footage was cut out or not filmed at all.) But as I said in my summary line, I was not bored. This movie is a matter of taste; I can see why some people would not like it. Who would like it? I think those who are fans of the sometimes over the top action/comedy cinema coming out of Hong Kong would best appreciate this film. You've been warned (or given a recommendation.)"

","I think it's fair to say you either love or hate this film. The wife was on Facebook within the hour, and I ended up watching it in another room as she found the violence too gratuitous.<br/><br/>However, I loved it! By all accounts, I should hate Colin Firth with his overly upper-class British accent. But he really holds this film together. I do wonder what it would have been like without him.<br/><br/>I knock a star off because I did get annoyed with some of the accents (the cockney barrow-boy levels were turned up to 11). Eggsy's trainee compatriots were far too predictably nasty as well.<br/><br/>The villains concept worked for me, although you do have to ""go with it"" a fair bit. I don't believe the film takes itself too seriously, so neither should the viewer.<br/><br/>I think a good acid test of a film is if you'd want to watch it again... And I have. There's one scene in particular worth a second watch. Those that have seen it will know which one I mean! Watch it!"

","A witty spy movie that is highly watchable.<br/><br/>Colin Firth and Taron Egerton are excellent co-stars, playing private agents pitted against a mad environmentalist played by Samuel L Jackson.<br/><br/>The plot ticks along nicely. It is very light-hearted in feel and full of witty one-liners.<br/><br/>They play on this lightness cleverly by interspersing the movie with scenes of horrific gore and violence. It's an unnerving mix but they make it work. Colin Firth's massacre of a church congregation in particular is hard to forget.<br/><br/>Overall a good bit of escapist, gory, witty fun."
"theresews","9","2","7","4 August 2015"," The gentleman-image returns to spy-movies
","Yesterday evening I had the opportunity to finally sit down and watch this movie, which I had already heard many positive things about. <br/><br/>Firstly, if you are looking for a serious and realistic spy-movie filled with heightened moral points, I suggest you go see something else. However, if you are ready to accept some breaks of realism and some hard language, this movie is a gem in its genre. The humor is cheeky without being ridiculous (which for me is in fine keeping with these Kingsmen being gentlemen). The main character's development throughout the story was, for me, also believable and Colin Firth's performance as secret agent was spot-on. In its entirety, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" has many of those clichés involving the anti-hero becoming super-hero, but the thing that makes this movie stand out, is its ""return to the roots while reinventing them""-ability. In its hay-day, James Bond was a perfect portrayal of this gentleman-spy who always knew what to say and who was always a step smarter than the next guy. However, in recent years (for me) James Bond has become more ""rough"", in the sense that he rarely wears suits anymore and has become more of a soldier than a gentleman-spy. Not saying the movies aren't still good, but many of those elegant gentleman-moments has gone away. Therefore, it is lovely to be reminded that the gentleman-approach to the spy-genre is still achievable and possible. It is lovely to watch a movie again, which is packed with superior one-liners and gadgets disguised as everyday-items. <br/><br/>The movie gets 9 stars from me, because I was entertained throughout it all, entranced by the action, stunned by the cinematography and because it returns to many of the origins, from which spy-movies came, while also throwing some modernity into the mix along with a clever eye for use of clichés - and also knowing when to break them. <br/><br/>So - before you go see the new ""Spectre"" and agree with yourself that this is how spy-movies should be, give this one a try :-)"

You can feel the density of Britishness in this film. Spy toys are much more convincing than Bond's but the film based on a comic book so there are some computer graphics that made it a bit more cartoon like. Fight scenes, which I loved most, combined with creative camera angles and right soundtracks made it very interesting to watch again and again. Sure, you can guess the plot as it's Bond style film but who cares, it's supposed to be easy to watch anyway. And man!, Colin Firth can FIGHT WITH STYLE."

","If you like old-fashioned James Bond style movies you probably like this one. It is a bit more outrageous and has a few more overly silly moments than the old Bond movies but on the whole this is a very fun and enjoyable secret agent movie.<br/><br/>Gary is, via a few twists and turns at the beginning of the movie, recruited by a secret agent employed by a super secret private organisation with remarkable resources. Their agents looks and behaves like London upper class gentlemen but have remarkable fighting skills. The initial scenes when Gary is recruited are just great.<br/><br/>Gary is then submitted to a rather gruesome training schedule and at the same time the main plot plays out in parallel. Of course the two threads merge towards the classical showdown with the megalomaniacal evil mastermind in the end where, naturally, Gary gets to save the world.<br/><br/>The movie has all the ""goodies"" of a secret agent movie. British gentlemen agents, action, secret agent ""stuff"" like shops that are not what they look like, hidden entrances into secret bases, rooms that are actually elevators and of course gadgets, lots of gadget to help our heroes thwart the evil mastermind's nefarious plans. Of course said mastermind have a personal henchman a la Oddjob to do the more grisly parts of his evil biddings. I quite liked this rather unique henchman, or rather henchwoman, and her odd weapons. More so that the main villain which I found a bit bland at times.<br/><br/>On the whole I enjoyed this movie a lot. However, there are some silly parts which drags it down a bit. I especially disliked the colorful exploding heads towards the end of the movie. That just felt like the producer/director was smoking some funny stuff when making those scenes. There were a few other scenes which I felt was going too much towards silly comedies as well. Without those I would probably have added a star.<br/><br/>All things said this was well spent 130 minutes as far as I am concerned."

It basically does what it wants in the name of style.<br/><br/>It has a fantastic musical score, the best of the year, thus far. The special effects are a mixed bag; some are fugly and others look nice.<br/><br/>There's plenty of comedy to be had and even the action sequences reflect that.

","Kingsman: The secret Service is a wonderful new film in the spy- action genre. The film is directed by Matthew Vaughn, who has directed some interesting stuff in the past, including X-men: First Class, Stardust and Kick-Ass. The film stars Taron Egerton as Eggsy, and Colin Firth as Harry Hart. <br/><br/>This film feels like an early James Bond flick, with all the wacky villains and plots one would expect from such a film. However, it really has modernized the message and approach, with extreme, if goofy, violence and lots of modern gadgets and goodies. There is a lot of charm in this film, and it makes me feel like a young boy again, watching flicks like Thunderbirds or Agent Cody Banks or Spy Kids. <br/><br/>Even so, this is not a film for children. It just has that slight fantastical feel that many children's spy films are graced with.<br/><br/>There is a ton to enjoy in this film. The spy genre is done well, with intrigue, gadgetry, and Bond-esque suave/cool. The actors are superb, with Samuel L. Jackson making an appearance as a particularity interesting character. There was also good, taught emotional drive throughout the film. I was superbly impressed with this film.<br/><br/>On a minor note, the film did have some corny/kitschy elements which did not always work. There was one scene in particular near the beginning, in a log cabin, which I thought was a bit much. These scenes were relatively small in number, however, and did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the film. <br/><br/>This movie was great, and deserves to be cherished as an excellent new addition to the spy genre. I look forward to more from all the actors involved, and especially Mr. Vaughn. I would love to see this become a James Bond style series of films as well.<br/><br/>This film is highly recommended.

The film is fast paced not boring and easy to watch. A great set of characters (Taron Egerton's characters is slightly unbelievable as a street kid, but is otherwise captivating and comes across as very comfortable in the role despite his filmography being minimal in contrast to many of the a list cast but still holds his own.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","7","9 July 2015"," 'Kingsman' blends modern and classic spy styles into another lovable Vaughn film
","The days of the classy '60s spy films seemed long lost. The world has gotten too complicated for simple stories of agents in tuxedos squaring off with megalomaniacs. Yet in walks ""Kingsman: The Secret Service,"" based on a Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons offering that sleek look and those beloved spy genre conventions but with plenty of modern-day sensibilities.<br/><br/>If Matthew Vaughn wasn't already a candidate to direct a future James Bond film, behold his audition tape. The ""Kick-Ass"" (also from Millar) and ""X-Men: First Class"" director makes yet another stylish and wickedly fun comic adaptation, raising his own bar for creative action sequences. More underrated, however, is his partnership with screenwriter Jane Goldman. This duo has yet to slip up, impeccably balancing the tropes and formulas of action flicks with just enough originality to keep their stories engaging from start to finish.<br/><br/>""Kingsman"" stars newcomer Taron Egerton as Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin, a street kid recruited by Kingsman agent Harry Hart, codename ""Galahad"" (Colin Firth) to join the top-secret organization after they lose an agent. Eggsy's father was a Kingsman, and Harry sees that same potential. As Eggsy undergoes a competition with other young men and women to fill the vacancy, Harry works to uncover a sinister plot being orchestrated by tech mogul billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson).<br/><br/>The script does gloss over Eggsy's development from troubled thief to top-flight field agent, perhaps the film's biggest flaw, but Vaughn and Goldman maintain suspense is basic yet effective ways. Will Eggsy in fact win that spot with the Kingsmen? And what's Valentine up to anyway? They recognize their best cards and play them at the right time, and that's what a good blockbuster does. Some impressive twists toward the end of the second act also rejuvenate that intrigue when it starts to wane.<br/><br/>Egerton is a solid young talent and he's surrounded by a cast who would do just as well in an Oscar-contending drama with Firth, Jackson, Mark Strong and Michael Caine. Some gravitas was definitely required to legitimize Kingsman in the eyes of the audience; without it the concept would feel too much like a cheap knock-off. These heavyweights help the film give off the vibe of an homage to the spy genre with contemporary twists. The character Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), Valentine's ""muscle,"" a double leg amputee with those springy leg prosthetics used by runners but outfitted with piercing metal blades, is not dissimilar from the Bond character Jaws.<br/><br/>With plenty of creative action sequences, many of which have surprises built into them, ""Kingsman"" entertains with a relative ease that so many similar action films and obscure adaptations seem to so rarely replicate. Not to mention Vaughn is becoming a bit more of an auteur, crafting fight scenes like dances but filming them with a visual roughness so as to get the best of both the practically slow-mo stylish action approach and the physical ""Bourne""-style approach.<br/><br/>Vaughn will likely abandon the ""Kingsman"" series (should it become a series) as he did with his previous efforts that received follow-ups, but where he goes next is worth tracking, especially if Goldman's in tow. And hopefully a serviceable blueprint remains in the hands of 20th Century Fox to try their luck with developing the next modern spy franchise.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"rubbersoul95","8","2","7","7 July 2015"," Action with Class
","Action movies are a dime a dozen, but with so many of the same this film manages to be original and intriguing. The action has a sort of class about it, paying homage to the attitude of the James Bond movies. It's enticing in a way that so many action movies are not nowadays, and it successfully combines a relevant, modern story line with classic excitement and humor. I thoroughly enjoyed this film overall, though I do have two negative comments. First, while the comic relief was appreciated through the duration of the film, I found it became excessive in the final scenes. It matches the attitude that was established in the beginning, but the extent to which it was used can be off putting to some, making it seem almost cheesy, although there are some great laughs. Secondly, the main character develops skills that would take years to master in a matter of months. Certainly it helped to move the story along, but was unrealistic even in the face of the plot itself. These two mild disappointments are easy to accept, however, as the movie in its entirety was better than the standard."
"jimbo-53-186511","7","2","7","3 July 2015"," Not all of it works, but the bits that did were very funny and there were definitely more hits than misses
","Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton) has gone off the rails since the untimely demise of his father who was working for Kingspan at the time. After getting in trouble with the police, Gary remembers an important number that he can ring at any time he needs it and after ringing this number he is released from prison and becomes friends with Harry Hart (Colin Firth) who is one of the heads of the Kingspan organisation. Harry gives Gary the opportunity to make something of himself and make his father proud of him by joining this secret organisation. but has Gary got what it takes to make him succeed?<br/><br/>Yeah I'm prepared to except that this was a little clichéd at the start; a young man has gone off the rails and needs a bit of direction in life, but the way that this aspect of the plot is developed is very well executed. You just can't beat a true gentleman actor like Colin Firth beating up a load of chavs and then returning to his unfinished pint of Guinness. It's wonderfully pompous, but also very insightful at the same time which is a very hard trick to pull off. We then witness a marine core training regime which again in the wrong hands could have come across as boring or dull, but again there is a requisite amount of fun injected in to proceedings, but then we're reminded of the seriousness of the requirements of the Kingspan Service. It works well because it shows the serious nature of the training, but also manages to make light of it at the appropriate moments. <br/><br/>The performances across the board are roundly good; Firth does a pompous uppity toff like no other, Caine is Caine and basically phones it in (although Caine phoning it in is still better than watching most other actors trying). Egerton is the star of this show who is an interesting actor - he can play the cockney chav well, but is also surprisingly effective outside of this cliché - he kind of reminded me of Jack O'Connell. Again Geoff Bell is Geoff Bell and is a very much one note actor, but he plays that note very well and is excellent here.<br/><br/>Kingsman isn't an obvious and goofy spoof in the way that Johnny English, or Get Smart is (the eventual agents aren't bumbling or inept, but with Kingsman it has more subtle nods and winks to the genre and it was these subtle nods and winks that really had me laughing - the war room scene from Dr Strangelove and the obvious parody of The Spy Who Loved Me towards the end). This is where the film was at its strongest.<br/><br/>The only weak aspect of this film lay with Samuel L Jackson as a villain and the entire sub-plot; for starters as much as I like Samuel L Jackson as an actor I could not take to him as a villain here - he wasn't intimidating or funny and that stupid lisp started to get on my nerves after a while. Although his involvement in the story makes sense towards the end, it was a little bit dull for the majority of the running time leaving it up to the rest of the principal cast to keep things moving which thankfully they manage to do with relative ease.<br/><br/>Thankfully, more of this works than doesn't and it has enough set-pieces and action sequences to make this an enjoyable picture. Yes it's not entirely successful over its full 120 minutes running time, but it kept me laughing consistently and also had enough heart to it to make you care about the characters all round. Jolly good show!!"

","Manners. Maketh. Man. So says the dapperly-dressed secret agent Harry Hart (Colin Firth), right before he bars all exits and proceeds to glass, stab and maim an assortment of goons in that most British of locales, the pub. Kingsman, the latest film from Layer Cake (2004) and X-Men: First Class (2011) director Matthew Vaughn, and his second collaboration with comic-book writer Mark Millar (after 2010's Kick-Ass), is both completely preposterous and ridiculously entertaining, simultaneously mocking and paying homage to the traditional idea of Britishness in an ever-changing society, and no doubt infuriating many a Daily Mail reader in the process.<br/><br/>Harry Hart, a Harry Palmer-like gent, is a Kingsman; a highly secretive and unaligned ring of spies and agents who dress sharply and certainly know their manners. After an operation to rescue Professor Arnold (Mark Hamill) from a possible kidnapping plot sees one Kingsman agent disposed of in a particularly gruesome fashion, Harry is tasked with finding a replacement to fill the spot. The son of a former agent who saved Harry's life years previously, Eggsy (Taron Egerton), is now growing up in a council flat with his layabout mother and abusive stepfather. After a joyride lands him in the police station, Eggsy calls the number on the back of a Kingsman medal given to him by Harry when he was a child, and he is bailed.<br/><br/>Harry enters Eggsy into the trials to become a Kingsman agent along with a bunch of upper-class toffs who refer to Eggsy as a 'pleb'. The group of youngsters must perform a series of tasks under the watchful eye of Merlin (Mark Strong), involving escaping from a flooded room and shooting a dog in the head. Meanwhile, Harry investigates links from recent strange events to internet billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a flamboyant man with a lisp and a fondness for wearing caps indoors. whose upcoming deal to offer SIM cards with free calls and internet to everybody for free reeks of conspiracy and may be related to an incident involving an exploding head.<br/><br/>When Harry and Valentine have their inevitable face-to-face sit-down moment, the two munch on Big Macs at Valentine's hideously decorated mansion while discussing the joys of the ludicrous Bond movies of old, when things weren't taken so seriously. Kingsman is an obvious Bond pastiche, with deadly gadgets, a henchman wielding an unconventional weapon (in this case - knives for feet), and an outrageous villain. It even comes as a surprise when Firth fails to raise an eyebrow while delivering a double entendre. It shows that these kinds of movies can still be fun without the shadow of uber- seriousness seen in the Daniel Craig Bond's and the recent Bourne movies lurking overhead, while telling the people who will be inevitably offended by the spurts of shocking violence to get a grip and remember that it's only a movie.<br/><br/>However, it did little to prepare me for the movie's key set-piece, which involves a church in Kentucky inhabited by a group of bigoted, right-wing religious types - and Harry - indulge in what can only be described as a pub-brawl massacre. I have never witnessed a scene that would usually be portrayed as a tragedy executed with such glee, with Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird blaring out while men and women are stabbed, shot, bludgeoned, set on fire and, in one particularly grisly moment, get slammed into a wall so hard it snaps their spine in two. It seems to go on and on, but it's an absolutely thrilling moment stocked full of cartoon violence, and will no doubt making some viewers expecting a light and funny experience wholly uncomfortable in the process.<br/><br/>It's sadly not all great. Eggsy's recruitment and training is formulaic and none of the tasks are particularly original or clever. This period of the film also keeps Eggsy and Harry apart for most of it, when their few scenes crackle with chemistry. But ultimately, Kingsman is an intriguing experience. bending to generic tropes while seemingly playing by its own rules. Firth displays a comedic willingness rarely seen and Egerton, who has popped up from nowhere, is a real find as the swaggering Eggsy, a baseball-cap wearing yoof who calls people 'bruv', who in most actors hands would have come across as extremely annoying. Kingsman dabbles in enough extreme violence to cause most viewers to question what they really enjoy seeing on screen, and it's a throwback with a modern twist, celebrating the days when movies could be fun, inexplicable and inconsequential, Just don't watch it with your nan."

","Kingsman is presented by the same people that brought us Kick-Ass, one of my favorite movies of all time. Therefore, Kingsman is one of the most anticipated films this year. I heard a lot about Kingsman when it first came out then I watched it in the theaters. I have to say that this has become one of my favorite movies by far. Matthew Vaughn has pleased me once again with his sense of humor and outstanding cinematography.<br/><br/>There is one think that I like Kick- Ass so much is it's ""out-of- expected"" humor which the second installment, not directed by Vaughn, didn't accomplished. It gives you a feeling of ""parody"", but not exactly. In Kingsman, clever lines are presented to the audience without using fart or stupid jokes. It has its own unique style that stands on its own very well. It's very different from other spy or action movies, and has combined with the comedy genre real well. The filming is also speechless, though a bit of shaky cam, all of the action sequences are very satisfying. It gives you so much action that you can't feel even more satisfied. The slow motion, the clever collocation of the soundtrack, and the sense of humor among the fighting all made me associate to Kick-Ass, and I love it!<br/><br/>The acting is also superb. I especially love Colin Firth in the movie; it is the best choice to be the supporting actor. He has the taste, he style, and the look to be a Kingsman. Samuel L. Jackson is great as being the villain with its weird accent. The main actor, Taron Egerton, did an excellent job being Eggsy, and he has got lots of potential in the future.<br/><br/>Other than that, there are always unexpected surprises delivered throughout the movie that makes you sweat, laugh, or even mind-blown. Kingman: The Secret Service is definitely worst watching and keeping. I have watched the second time today and it still doesn't bore me. I hope to see more movies like this or even Kick-Ass in the future. Oxfords, not Brogues."
"westsideschl","8","2","7","20 June 2015"," Kick Ass 3
","For the first third of the film I was thinking that this was going to be a poorly constructed & written Bond ripoff with lots of formula action & stereotyping of characters. Supporting that thought was the eye candy and famous name selection of actors, who seemed to fulfill the above formula/stereotyping school-of-acting technique admirably. But then the comic book character spoofing began to emerge and first came with force with a church scene, so outrageous, that I had to cringingly watch again, just to confirm what I was seeing. Eggsy was responsible for about 60 departed poor souls (well they were haters supreme) within the house-of-the-lord no less, and another 40 or so dispatched by fellow church going haters. Add another 100 or so elsewhere and Eggsy surpasses ""John Wick"" for one person personally sending baddies off to another (better?) life. There was another film, a few years back, of someone cleaning up a semi-abandoned ""Projects"" development of druggies, but I can't remember the title. That one had similar outrageous numbers. Finally, the coup de grâce, was the July 4 fireworks, with appropriate musical overtures, of the security exploding heads. Disgustingly outrageous. Rivals ""Kick Ass"" for over-the-top imaginative, albeit fantastical, action scenes. There was one positive message - humans, watch out, Gaia is going to extinguish you if you don't clean up your act."
"Clockwork_Orange55","8","2","7","20 June 2015"," ""This British spy-action-thriller cinema, is at the most least, delightful.""
","It is like a classic 007 dancing on a rainbow. Despite being a fact that it is indeed an adaptation of the comic book 'The Secret Service', it borrows and toys with bits of references to 'James Bond' movies. However, Matthew Vaughn's triumph continues. Success first rained down with ""Kick-Ass"", then ""X-Men: First Class"" and now, the colourful and endurably fun ""Kingsman"". Matthew Vaughn is absolutely the cool and stylish artist of action pictures, although not winning on being one of the best filmmakers around.<br/><br/>Kingsman is a secret intelligence organisation. It shares similarities with MI6, but more that it stays to be fiction, and adopts the possible highest level of secrecy. It was during an unseen 'invasion' in the middle-east, when a colleague of Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a kingsman agent, sacrifices himself. Through the simplest and obvious nature of human behaviour, uncalled guilt grows on Harry, and he feels like he has an obligation to repay him. It ranges to to the dead agent's family and conclusively, to his son, Eggsy (Taron Egerton). 17 years passes. The young-matured Eggsy is chosen to be a candidate for a replacement of a dead kingsman agent (not his father), and somewhere in the world, an unorthodox villain has an unsound plan of saving the world.<br/><br/>Vaugh is wonderful in his handling of the characters. Harry Hart and Eggsy are great heroes – neither pretentious, nor over the top, or acting idiots. But them carrying humane behaviours, and in them are good manners and unsupported arrogance. Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) and Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) teamed together to be a pair of shining villains. They are not dull, but fun and unique. Building up colourful characters is the film's sheer A game, and as tarantinoesque they are, they are still profusely underrated.<br/><br/>Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson had with them the two best performances of the show. Firth was smooth, confident and charismatic, while Jackson was campy-funny. Overall, the two stars captured formidable screen presence, rather than heavily relied on great acting skills.<br/><br/>The fact that made Valentine a fascinating character is that he drives his plan with good intentions, out from his villainous actions. He attempts to save the world from complete slaughter, but his methods are plain crazy and with devoid of understanding from him, evil. Unlike any other villains, he does not have a goal to achieve absolute power, but to save. Valentine is probably unwantedly insane, and unfavourably, naïve. To me, Valentine is not the bad guy, the bad guys are the wealthy politicians and celebrities who dog the footsteps of his mind.<br/><br/>The film's most solid moments rest on its staggering action-fighting sequences. Through its tight editing and engaging choreography, those near perfect fighting scenes are broken down into unique pieces, stitched together to boast entertaining cinematic experiences.

"CMTiago","8","2","7","18 June 2015"," A spy action film like no other
","The thing about Kingsman is that this movie mixtures genres unlike any movie I've seen. With the Bond influence ever present and the crazy Tarantino-esque violence that was also present in Vaughn's previous movie Kick-Ass, this movie not only pays respect to the old spy films, but also comes into it's own to become a classic for the next years in my opinion.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Firth's Harry Hart visiting the family of a fallen partner and he leaves the door open for any help to the son of said partner. Fast forward 17 years later and things aren't going too smoothly for young Eggsy. He is constantly in trouble and has to deal with his mother's boyfriend bad treatment. Luckily for him, he will be chosen as a recruit by his dad's old friend and therefore be a candidate for the secret organization known as the Kingsman. Yet an imminent threat will come to light, as billionaire Valentine will look to eradicate the human race. Will Eggsy be up to the task and manage to save the world?<br/><br/>Unapologetic fun is what you're gonna get with Kingsman. Its R rating suggests a lot of violence and the movie delivers with some of the best action sequences of the year. Vaughn really shows off his talents as a director with the camera always moving but capturing every single important moment. Truly a great directorial effort yet again from the British man. The acting is also phenomenal as Firth pulls off an unlikely role, Egerton emerges as a rising star and Jackson makes for a fun villain. I gotta say though that Gazelle was my favorite character with a number of kick-ass moments.<br/><br/>Thoroughly entertaining with a great artistic touch, Kingsman is a refreshing take on the spy genre as it plays with the changes that have occurred over time and with Spectre coming out later down the line, I don't see any reason why we can't have different variations of the genre succeeding. I for one welcome it."

","After some cool intro credits, some British agents raid a compound in Afghanistan. They grab some guy and tie him to a chair. Suddenly they realize he's got a bomb. One of them throws himself onto to guy as the bomb explodes saving his team mates. One of those on the team, Harry Hart, visits the widow and offers help. She rejects it so he gives the medal to the young son. On the reverse of the medal is a number. If called and given a code, help will be forthcoming.<br/><br/>We are taken to Argentinian mountains years later where an environmental scientist has been captured. A suited Brit knocks on the door and wipes out all the bad guys. Someone knocks on the door and suddenly the Brit is cut in half by a girl amputee wearing blades for legs. Oh, no...it's Samuel Jackson at the door...<br/><br/>Turns out all these Brits are ""Kingsmen,"" a super secret agency of gentlemen. Now that that two of them have died it's time to recruit a new member. At this time, the young kid from the intro is older and in trouble. His mom's new guy is some bad guy who is abusive. One day the kid steal a car and goes for a joyride and ends up in jail. He calls the number on the back of the medal and gives the code. Next thing he knows he's meeting Hart who proposes that the kid get his act together so he sponsors him to join the Kingsmen.<br/><br/>What follows is some training and ability tests for several kids to take the one available spot. In meantime, Jackson is up to no good. He's supposed to be a billionaire genius entrepreneur out to save the planet and humanity. He decides to give away free SIM cards for free internet and phone to everyone who wants one. But he's also kidnapping the important, rich, and famous and others he's implanting with a chip behind the ear. The chip allows him cause these people to go completely berserk or to to blow up their heads at the push of a button. He does a test run at a church. Then he announces he will save the planet by eliminating a large part of the population. Now the remaining Kingsmen and the young recruit will have to keep Jackson from following through with his plan.<br/><br/>Kingsman is a fantastic action thriller that offers violence and intrigue. It captures the magic long lost by the James Bond movies and also some of the thrilling violence that the early Jason Bourne movies had. Finally we get one such movie that is R-rated. The character of Hart and the acting of Firth are very strong. This character alone has franchise potential. However, the young recruit and the actor playing him are rather weak. Things are perhaps a bit too formulaic--you get the villain in his giant high tech lair with his wicked side-kick and hundreds of soldiers willing to die for him. The movie is a bit too long and the orchestrated Bond-ripped off music is excessively loud and obnoxious. But nonetheless, Kingsmen is a blast of a movie."
"darosslfc","7","2","7","16 June 2015"," ""Manners Maketh Man""
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is the kind of movie that you watch when you just want to have a good time. <br/><br/>With all the Super Hero movies coming out it is nice to see a movie that takes a bit of the super natural and brings it down to Earth. It takes the Spy genre and makes it something that the audience can relate to. The film tics all the boxes on bigger than life issues with the world at stake, a super villain who's hand hovers over the detonation of it, and a group that acts above the law, with the good of the world at mind, to stop it.<br/><br/>However, what makes this film truly a gem in the genre of Action/Comedy is the relationship between Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and the rest of the cast. He goes through the character arch of a young man trying to find his place in the world. He uses his surroundings to explain his failures, but when given the chance to prove himself he strives to make his mark. <br/><br/>The film does well to keep you entertained with a main character having a different perspective on an environment than the people he's with. The action is top notch with gadgets and fighting scenes. Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman (Kick Ass, Stardust) have scripted another outside of the box film that is clever and entertains. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a film that above all else entertains; and, is well written, with a good plot and strong characters take a try on Kingsman and watch how ""Manners Maketh Man""."

","Brits are famous for their spy(ing) films, and the even the financial and/or human participation of Americans has not generally spoiled them :) Kingsman: The Secret Service is another fine example of quality entertainment where introduction of new faces for younger generation (Taron Egerton, Sophie Cookson) has been giftedly combined of the participation of known and rewarded character actors: Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson (the funniest and most distinctive), Mark Strong, Michael Caine, with Firth and Caine being Academy Award winners! As for the plot, it is rather witty, true, one has to know many previous similar films to make the most of certain lines, events and references, as the film in question is a real ""child"" of multiple films beginning with James Bond at least... But still, no more maze runners and divergents, please, but more quality cinema where humour and action are combined without factitious course of events and leaning on cute young faces only."

","It is my belief that a soundtrack makes or breaks a film. Honestly, where would Star Wars be without John Williams? In this case I think Kingsman would have benefited greatly with a classier soundtrack especially including the end credits. Trading Places was able to bring classical and modern together to make a great movie, so I believe it would have been possible.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I did like the story. It was fun to see Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson in characters outside their normal options and to see how they stretched with these characters. In that sense, I considered this a fun movie."

","This film was one of the most amazing things I've seen this year, possibly this whole century. If you liked Kick-ass or any of Matthew Vaughn's other movies, you'll love it. I strongly recommend this film for any moviegoer. the fight scenes are incredible and make sense, unlike a Michael Bay film or some other spy movies. The story and dialogue are both funny and intelligent and complement the rest of the film well. There are a couple sciences - although I won't reveal any spoilers here - that were a little inappropriate/politcally incorrect that I personally found somewhat offensive that I felt took away from the film as a whole. But apart from these, the movie truly is amazing. Funny, clever, well acted, and really exciting. Also, just a quick note, I thought it was amazing on the big screen, but when I watched it at home on video, the action was a little harder to follow and seemed sloppier that it was in the theaters. All in all, a solid film."

","A 'Our Man Flint' or 'In like Flint' for the modern age. This movie has been compared to 'Kickass' and I totally get that, I loved the 'Kickass' movies, but this is SOoooo way over the top that when it got to the bit where the agent is split (with no blood to be seen), I was reaching for the turn off button. What is this rubbish? But....I kept watching, and was glad I did, the cartoon violence is relentless, and the scene in the church both entertaining and hilarious. The clichés come thick and fast and reference 'Pulp Fiction' 'Bladerunner' 'The Matrix' 'James Bond' and a thousand others. Some of the actors have long outstayed their welcome and it seems that they will do anything for a fast buck, Samuel L. Jackson is just irritating, and does Michael Caine really need the money? However the main complaint is the constant foul language(Hollywood scriptwriters should really be told to lay off the constant 'M*****F****R', and 'F**K YOU' and 'A**F****R', as it is becoming impossible to watch any film without having to endure a barrage of the 'F' word), and the final 'Up the A**' scene was just too much, why did they have to put that in at the end to spoil it? But i was entertained and the girl villain 'Gazelle' played by Sofia Boutella was a great creation and really well done."
"pedrobatistas","9","2","7","2 June 2015"," A violent and awesome comedy. That is Kingsman
","Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) Kingsman: The Secret Service is a new movie directed by Matthew Vaughn, based upon the successful comic book from which takes its name. The official synopsis states the following: ""A spy organization recruits an unrefined, but promising, street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius."" Reading this, one could say that the movie is about the development of a boy in the spy world and it really is, but does this in one of the funniest ways possible. Paying tribute to the old James Bond movies that is influenced by, Kingsman brings to our times some of the characteristics that made those movies into cinema classics. The everlasting charm and composure of an agent, but always keeping a bit of the old-fashioned swag; the megalomaniac, colorful and ever entertaining villain who plots the craziest and almost impracticable schemes; the variety of gadgets (what is a Bond movie without some of Q's gadgets?); fight- sequences, which, in this picture, are simply over-the-top even when compared with those like Terminator, Die Hard or Rambo. That being said, I need to praise the casting. Seeing Colin Firth, who plays Harry Hart/Gallahad, an actor that mainly played ""the good guy"" in movies like Bridget Jones, being an absolute bad-ass, even more than Bond ever was in any of his movies. Then the villain Valentine, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, who is one of most enjoyable characters to see. His lisp (the classic Bond villains always had an abnormality or physical dysfunction), his inability to see blood without vomiting or still his childish behavior (even being a genius) are ""qualities"" that will make you laugh a few times. The soundtrack is other department where the ""Bond Tribute"" was made. In spite of being in just some small moments, I could recognized some of the typical chords that John Barry made famous in the 007 Movies. This film is not for the faint of heart. Kingsman: The Secret Service is a comedy but a very violent kind of comedy. Slang is used often. Watch this if you enjoy films like In Bruges and you'll probably love it. As for me, I had a splendid time."

The cast is great, mr. egerton does a good job as the kid, mr. firth in his typical British style does a great spy. You really get attached to these guys. I have to say I had to get used to the bad guy as played by mr. jackson. Especially the lisp, bit too much.

"chaos-rampant","Null","2","7","29 May 2015"," Fooling with etiquette
","I'm not attracted to anything in particular here and insofar as it moves fast it passes by without much incident, unless you're the type of viewer who in a silly film such as this likes to take umbrage by things like a pretty girl rewarding the world-saving hero with her body.<br/><br/>But that - a princess swooning over her savior knight and yet the scene promises quick sex on a couch and not romance - is part of the deliberate crudeness here, usually noted as irony and amounting to a simple fooling with some etiquette. Here the James Bond film but the supervillain is a lisping nerd, the suave spy maims and kills hundreds in a scene of frenzy etc.<br/><br/>It's such a small difference that I find no subversion in it and indeed quite the opposite, simple convention. This is a British attempt at a superhero comic book using the American language of spectacle to push out British stereotyped traditions in narrative.<br/><br/>So an opening scene of meddling in the Middle east only serves as generic stage to exalt British heroism. A super-secret society of gentlemen spies exists to steer the world into order, above MI6 - which as Brits know has merely been a junior partner of the CIA for decades, though we're not told in the film - and founded back in prewar days, that is in better days when Brits were still dominant. The established order is compromised and gentlemanly resourcefulness shines through it.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this from the viewpoint that it's harmful politics, it's fluff we will leave behind in no time, and only noting what gives rise to the image. Injecting adolescence in the tour and leaving the places visited the same. A Brit saves the world much like in James Bond fantasies - only he's a kid.<br/><br/>(There's an aerial scene here as the kids parachute from a plane, I collect aerial scenes of this sort because they reveal with some purity the aerodynamics of visual imagination in its flight, the gravity of a falling body in space, the currents of that space, the turbulence of camera paths. This one just pales by comparison to work being done on the American side; some exciting work can be seen in Jupiter Ascending)."

You know from the start ""All's well that ends well"" so you don't have to worry even if the Hero falls from the sky without a parachute or faced with a truck load of armed men firing at him, he will emerge victorious.<br/><br/>All in all, expect nothing extraordinary and you will walk home more than satisfied"

","I like Matthew Vaughn as a director, I absolutely loved Kick-Ass, but the trailer for this film didn't seem that enticing to me. It didn't show much of the great action within the film, but rather focused on the ONE scene in which Colin Firth fights with an umbrella, which I thought was extremely lame. Within fifteen minutes of the start of the film, I was really engaged in the movie, jaw dropping when a guy was literally cut in half.<br/><br/>I immediately thought it would be ridiculously fun just like Kick- Ass, and it was! The second act is a typical spy movie training session with a few good twists and turns. The people at Kingsman put the young candidates through hell in order to test their limits and loyalty, which provide some of the best moments of the film.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson makes for a good villain, but with a really annoying lisp that didn't seem necessary for the film. The only reason I can think of for that lisp is to make for a somewhat ridiculous villain who is simultaneously ruthless.<br/><br/>One of the most exciting scenes of the film is one in which a massive brawl occurs in a church, and the fight is done in a few long takes, choreographed to the beat of Free Bird in the background. It is one of the best executed action sequences I have seen in years. Also, the third act is just really ridiculous and fun that you just have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>I wanted to see this movie eventually because of Matthew Vaughn, but I was so wrong to expect less of this movie due to the trailer. The very last moment of the movie is said to be controversial, but I thought it was a great way to wrap up such a ridiculous film. It made sense when it was said in an interview the ending was paying an homage to sexual jokes at the end of James Bond flicks or North by Northwest."

"ferguson-6","7","2","7","16 February 2015"," Fun with Spies
","Greetings again from the darkness. In 2010, writer/director Matthew Vaughn turned the superhero genre on its ear with the hit Kick-Ass. With this most recent film, he has done the same thing to spy-thrillers. We get the well-tailored look made famous by Roger Moore's James Bond, the fanciful and lethal gadgets from early Bond films, the ever-present umbrella (put to new uses here) of The Avenger's John Steed, and the ultra-suave and debonair manners of Napoleon Solo from The Man from U.N.C.L.E. We get all of that in a surprisingly effective and fun action performance from Colin Firth.<br/><br/>Fun is the operative word here. It's clear all parties involved are having a great time, especially Mr Firth going drastically against type. There are two action-packed and pretty humorous (in a demented way) fight scenes. One is early on inside a London pub, and has Firth flashing his particular set of skills against a group of thugs. The other (and even more raucous) fight occurs inside a church and is set to Lynryd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird"". The body count piled up as fast as the guitar licks.<br/><br/>As spectacular as the fight scenes are, the real fun here is in the characters. The old guard of the Kingsmen includes Firth as Galahad, Mark Strong as Merlin, Jack Davenport as Lancelot, and Michael Caine as Arthur. This long-standing group is one part international spy, one part Knights of the Round Table  and these gentlemen are extremely well trained and impeccably well dressed. When one of their agents dies on the job, the recruitment boot camp kicks into gear. Made up of a group of relative newcomers to the movie world, the two most interesting are Roxy (Sophie Cookson) and Eggsy (Taron Egerton). Adding to the intrigue, Eggsy is the son of a former Kingsmen, and has some skills that aren't initially apparent.<br/><br/>Of course, what would a spy-tribute movie be without a colorful villain? Samuel L Jackson plays lispy megalomaniac Valentine, who has a quick gag reflex when it comes to violence. Fortunately his henchman Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) is equipped with razor sharp leg prosthetics and some ultra-crazy fighting skills. We even see Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold  fans of the Mark Miller/Dave Gibbons graphic novel will appreciate the irony. <br/><br/>Firth and Egerton play off each other quite well in the mentor-pupil relationship, and Egerton is clearly set up for the franchise sequels  as is his friend and fellow Kingsman, Ms. Cookson. For those who think the Daniel Craig Bond films are too dark and serious, this provides a flashback to lighter Bond fare (minus the misogyny). Many hot topics are touched on: class warfare, domestic abuse, racism, etc, but mostly this can be taken as a rollicking good time because ""it's not that kind of movie"". It does, however, remind us that ""manners make the man""."

","Went into the cinema with sort of high hopes after watching trailer after trailer on television. I really hoped it would live up to the hype surrounding it. I really like the direct who also directed Kickass in Matthew Vaughn. I did come out of the theatre entertained so in some capacity the film achieved its goal but however there was unnecessary humour through the exploitation of teenage stereotypes which I did not find funny at all. This humour was just not for me, there was other people in the cinema which found stealing cars, saying ""Bruv"" hilarious so it did hit some level of the audience. The humour did take a good turn towards the end of the film which had good moments. The plot line and twists where actually really good some that audience would next expect. I really enjoyed the plot as It had a good story. The characters were semi-likable but not always that great in my opinion. Colin Furth was very good in the movie and so was the lead Taron Egerton but the Villain in Samuel Jackson just became really annoying by the end. But overall it was good cast and solid performances.<br/><br/>I would really recommend this film to friends or family as it was entertaining, okay humour, good actions scenes, and good performances. However some of the humour may only be targeting certain people which could be a issue when the film releases to wider countries very soon. It was also one of the very few times that I have been to the cinema recently that it was near full so Kingsman is obviously doing something right.<br/><br/>I would give the film a 7/10."

"aballyTKD","2","2","8","6 September 2015"," Fairly poor action film aimed at the ""young adult"" market
","This film was picked by my 15 year old son as a family film, suitable for middle-teens up - obviously.<br/><br/>To any parents contemplating renting this film for kids nearly 15 ""because they're quite mature"" I'd suggest caution. This should really be an 18.<br/><br/>How the BBFC could have awarded this offering a 15 certificate beggars belief - without offering any spoilers, the language in the film is rather excessively bad with most sentences containing the F- word, and a couple of variants to do with incest. There is also a highly inappropriate gag relating to anal sex that has a visual punchline at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Disregarding the prolific foul language and surprisingly graphic violence, it's actually a very formulaic teen/young persons' actioner akin to ""Storm Breaker"". Tough inner city underdog wins through to overcome a bunch of snooty Oxbridge toffs and become a Kingsman - some sort of Super Army Soldier/MI6/Ninja agent.<br/><br/>Colin Firth appears to be tired of his career as a softly spoken, typically-English romantic lead and is trying to more street by incorporating a few four letter words into his vocabulary, kicking wholesale ass, and decapitating women with a fire axe. He really should stick to what he's good at. Samuel L Jackson is also at his cringe-making worst (I actually rather like SLJ in pre-Star Wars era) as the camp, lisping super villain of the piece. Even by the standards of ""Snakes on a Plane"" this is not one of his finest hours.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast do their best with what they're given - Mark Strong and Michael Caine will no doubt have been grateful for their cheques for turning up and going through the motions.<br/><br/>Bottom line in my opinion is that it's a slightly below par, adolescent thriller/actioner starring a group of talented actors who for whatever reason (Aging, or early career) need the work - but really should have known better. It's spoiled as a family movie by excessive bad language and somewhat too graphic violence - admittedly without much blood-spatter."

Colin Firth delivers a great performance in both the action scenes and in his delivery of humor. this was the first time I've got to see Taron Egerton in anything. I see a great future ahead of this young man. He delivered the humor, action and storyline like he was built for this part. I would love to see him in a sequel of this movie. Sam Jackson is... well Sam Jackson. He always delivers a great performance in both action and comedy. He was a very fitting villain for this movie. All in all, I highly recommend this movie for anyone that likes spy/action movies ."

","This is probably one of the best stylish action movies that I have seen in recent times. This genre of 'stylish action' has very few providers and I guess many takers.

After having watched Kingsman, I am happy to change the for myself wrt ranking imo. A total eye-candy, and a complete blockbuster. The direction is worth applauding.

"Theo Robertson","7","2","8","5 May 2015"," A Mess But A Matthew Vaughn Mess
","After seeing LAYER CAKE all these years ago I was instantly struck that a new and important director called Matthew Vaughn had arrived on the British film making scene and Vaughn was a name to keep an eye out for , same as Danny Boyle was from a decade earlier. Since then Vaughn hasn't made enough films and the ones he has made are entertaining enough mixing black comedy and violent but live up to the cliché of close but no cigar and KINGSMAN continues the Vaughn resume in the Vaughn style <br/><br/>So what's KINGSMAN about you ask ? How about ""Bond deconstructionist comic book adventure done in a British tongue in cheek style"" ? Maybe not an entirely accurate description but KINGSMAN is a very difficult film to pigeon hole . In feel it's similar in some ways to KICK-ASS but in many ways it isn't similar and I wonder if I mentioned KICK-ASS down to the same production team being responsible for that film ? The story itself revolves a lower working class nobody called Eggsy who lives on a dead end London estate and is recruited by an offshoot of the British secret service to foil the plans of an international villain called Valentine . It's not all that original and the tone of the film isn't entirely successful or consistent but like LAYER CAKE the story itself is a bit of a mess . This is hardly surprising for a film that often veers from meta-fictional Bond or Bourne far fetched globe trotting adventure to a British grief porn kitchen sink drama . What stops it all falling apart is the sense of fun and kinetic energy Vaughn injects in to the film in general and the cast in particular . Any movie that has Firth , Caine and Jackson as the leading lights is worth watching for that reason alone and that trio don't disappoint though Mark Strong's annoying unconvincing Scottish accent is a distraction .<br/><br/>We occasionally hear rumours about a big budget silver screen version of DOCTOR WHO and I wonder if Matthew Vaughn would be the natural choice to direct that quirky , unique and uniquely British show ? And some of the plot turns are so far fetched they wouldn't be out of place in DOCTOR WHO . Colin Firth as The Doctor versus Samuel L Jackson as The Master ! Sign me up for a ticket now , though please no swearing and get Russell T Davies to do the screenplay instead of Jane Goldman Regardless of what Vaughn does in the future he's still a name to keep an eye on and here's hoping he's making films for years to come"

","Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin, whose late father secretly worked for a spy organisation, lives in a South London housing estate and seems headed for a life of crime, and ultimately, prison. <br/><br/>However, dapper agent Harry Hart recognises potential in the youth and recruits him to be a trainee in the secret service. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, villainous Richmond Valentine launches a plan to solve the problem of climate change via a worldwide killing spree.......<br/><br/>The plot could come from any Bond Movie, or even Austin Powers, megalomaniac designs a free SIM card that when activated, causes homicidal tendencies, thus bringing down the worlds population. But when you read it in black and white, it's just too bizarre for Bond, and too dark for Powers, even though when watching this,you cannot help but compare spys.<br/><br/>Vaughn proved with his first movie, he is a competent film maker, and with this, he proves again that he hasn't put a step wrong.<br/><br/>It's a visceral experience, mixing working class with upper class, but once we get into the training, Goldman goes down the predictability route with the writing, so their are no surprises with this aspect of the narrative. The posh boys and Eggsy have the obligatory confrontation, the leader of the posh boys gets his comeuppance, and as expected,MIT isn't plain sailing for our hero.<br/><br/>But that's just a minor quibble in what otherwise is a highly original spy movie, with some awe inspiring set pieces (the church scene is up there with John Wicks Club scene as one of the cinematic highlights of the year), and the characters are brilliantly portrayed.<br/><br/>Firth is brilliant as a bad-ass version of himself, Jackson is hilarious as the pseudo Steve Jobs, and even Mark Strong excels as what only can be described as the films Yoda to Firths Obi Wan.<br/><br/>The controversy of the final 'joke' is justified, and although it's supposed to be a parody of all those innuendo laden Bond final scenes, it falls flat and leaves you with a bitter taste, slightly detracting you from what otherwise is a truly brilliant movie.<br/><br/>So it's well worth seeing, it's so good to see such a daring, original blockbuster do so well, among the ever increasing pond of autonomous blockbusters that swarm the cinemas nowadays...."
"siderite","8","2","8","30 April 2015"," Comic book James Bond
","I have to say that the film entertained me quite a lot. All actors were very good and the direction was almost flawless. If you are looking for the cellphone version of James Bond, this is the film for you. In Kingsman you find the origin story for a young adult secret service spy that then gets taken completely over the top with funky suits, weird gadgets that are used only once, the occasional dry pun and lots and lots of violence.<br/><br/>I think Colin Firth was the right man for the job, as was Samuel L. Jackson as the villain. Probably Jackson just stopped one day and said ""I am just going to have a lot of fun for the rest of my life"". Young Taron Egerton was the main character and he performed well for his relatively short career, but let's admit it: Firth and Jackson made this movie.<br/><br/>The problem with this comic book based film is that it feels just like a comic book. You get the archetypal Harry Potter that discovers that he is the son of special people and he is taken to the magical school for secret spies, destined to fight and defeat the evil man that should not be named, but we know is Sam Jackson. It is a children story, no matter how you take it.<br/><br/>Bottom line: entertaining, but mindless fun. It made me wish for a deep and dark origin story for the likes of Jason Bourne: their recruitment, their training, the real alienation and mind programming, the kills and the failures and their consequences. Alas, it was just a funky JB. Best quote: ""I'll have a Martini. With gin, not vodka, obviously. Stirred for ten seconds while staring at a bottle of unopened vermouth."""
"stephendaxter","9","2","8","30 April 2015"," A great blend of a spy film with crazy OTT action
","Kingsman: The Secret Service was just simply so much goddamn fun. I had heard that it was a fun film but i had no idea just how great it was going to be. This movie was filled with crazy intense action sequences and some more subtle jokes that show up every now and then. The plot of this movie you think is something you have seen before but it continuously surprises you throughout and just when you think you know is going to happen it throws you a curveball. These surprises helped to make the film so much more entertaining. Lets start with the action sequences because they are by far the best scenes of the movie. They are just awesome edge of your seat action sequences that are exaggerated in terms of the violence and gore to make them really unique. The way they are shot is incredible how they don't use conventional shots instead there are some crazy rotating continuous shots that make the scene that much more awesome. <br/><br/>This film did have its fair share of comedy, and i thought it did pretty well to make me laugh. Only 2-3 times it didn't work for me but otherwise the smart and subtle comedy was very effective. And the jokes and bizarre action would not have been as awesome without the incredible cast they got. From the big names such as Samuel L Jackson and Colin Farrell to Taron Egerton and Sofia Boutella they all did amazing jobs in their roles and were so fun to watch. They do a good job at creating an enemy who you know is bad but you cannot resist to love him because of the character itself and the actor playing them.<br/><br/>The main criticism i give this film was that there were a couple of moments that it slowed down a little too much before going into some intense action scenes. The jokes they crack during these scenes and just overall interest in the plot help a little to not get too restless. But they are a minor offence as all of the good this movie does overshadows the bad. In the end, this movie was a great blend of crazy intense action, engaging characters and plot, and a little bit of comedy to add to the fun - 8.9"
"hunter1997","6","2","8","22 April 2015"," The best 60% I've ever seen
","This movie is definitely not for everyone. You might see it as a fun, over-the-top cross between Quentin Tarantino and James Bond, with the best damn ending you've ever seen; or you might see it as a crude, fake-looking mess that has one of the worst endings you've ever seen. People seem pretty split about it. As for me: I'm in the former category. I freaking loved this movie! I can really enjoy a self-aware campy gore-fest like this. But, if you don't like it, that's fine. I can see why some people would be disappointed. Though, this movie is not at all worthy of 1s and 2s. You aren't going to sound contradictory if you give a 6/10 and say you still didn't like it. I can admit that Big Hero Six was a good movie, but I still didn't like it as much, and that's perfectly fine. <br/><br/>So, if you enjoy seeing Colin Firth kicking unfathomable amounts of ass, it's definitely worth seeing. But, if you aren't a fan of over-the-top action and gore, then go ahead and give it a pass."
"charleshenry","7","2","8","14 April 2015"," Very good - could've been so much better
","I won't go into all of the details that so many others have, I'll just give my overall opinion of the movie.<br/><br/>Frankly, this was one of those movies where it felt like the producer and director weren't entirely sure where they wanted to go with it. Is it a comedy, is it a drama, action pic, etc? I'm not sure they knew.<br/><br/>In the end, it felt to me like it was lacking so much, and what was lacking they tried to make up for with over-the-top extras which didn't add to the movie in the slightest.<br/><br/>Yes, it was an ""R"" movie, but when the language ... seriously? It didn't add to the movie at all (took away from Jackson's character with me), and just was overbearing. Add to it the absolutely idiotic sex scene at the end (was she really that pathetic?) and it felt like they didn't know how to end it.<br/><br/>The comedic death sequences seemed extremely childish as well. Maybe they were aiming for a particular target audience ... but the ""R"" rating cuts down on the number of 15- and 16-year-olds in the theater.<br/><br/>The group I was with when I saw the movie all said the same thing - if you're going to have that over-the-top profanity and the gratuitous sex bits at the end, at least spend a moment or two reviewing it so that it adds to the movie and doesn't detract from it. <br/><br/>Without those, this would've been a much better flick in our opinion, worthy of the mid-8's. Instead, a solid 7 for us.<br/><br/>Just my opinion in the end, though."
"georgecoffeynewyorker","9","2","8","9 April 2015"," Great comic, action, Music outstanding, Great scenes by far
","What a film, Kingsman. I never expected it. Great comic and great action. It blue my mind. It was unreal. Music was fantastic. It was the normal music score. E.g The American Anthem was played etc., etc., Plot was a bit hard to understand the first time, I went. From what I could gather, Harry(Firth) highers, troublesome teen Eggsy(Egerton), after Eggsy' father Lancelot is killed in action. So Harry trains him in a series of tests. Then a global danger is imminent. Valentine(Jackson) is creating a SIM card chips, whereby when he activates, people all go Homicidal.<br/><br/>One class scene I'll never forget it. Harry(Firth) is in a Hate group church in the US, whereas they's against Abortion, Unmarried etc., etc.,One woman prevented him from getting out, as he couldn't stand it. I was beginning to get nauseous myself. So he attempted to get out. This woman attempted to stop him, and his reply was class. ""I'm a Catholic whore, currently enjoying congress out of wedlock with my black Jewish boyfriend who works at a military abortion clinic. Hail Satan, and have a lovely afternoon madam"". The Church is against Colored ppl too, let alone Homosexuals etc., The first scene too is class, whereby Harry is wanting to teach some thugs a lesson, and later is passed onto Eggsy(as Eggsy does the exact same thing to Dean(Eggys step father(well boyfriend anyways) ""Manners maketh man."" Do you know what that means? Then let me teach you a lesson"".<br/><br/>Great crossovers were done to. Whereby Eggsy is asked during one of his tests, ""Cute dog, whats his name,"", Eggsy replies ""JB"". Then Arthur(Caine) tries to guess, Jason Bourne(Bourne Francises), James Bond(Bond), when Arthur fails Eggsy replies with ""Jack Bower"" from 24."

","I remember seeing the trailer for this and thinking ""wow that looks stupid"" but as the film got more & more positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. And, it was better than I could have ever expected. <br/><br/>The films strongest point is it's comedy. The film takes every opportunity to make the audience laugh and all the jokes are spot on. The cast were superb, Taron Egerton as the lead was great and I hope to see more of him in the future. The rest of the cast were awesome (Firth, Caine etc) and Samuel L. Jackson plays one of the funniest villains ever put on film, at first I thought it was going to be annoying to give him a lisp but no, it had me rolling on the floor. <br/><br/>If I had any issues with the film, I'd only say that the fight scenes can be a little too over the top & that can be a little distracting at times. <br/><br/>Overall, Kingsman is a great film and I'd even go as far as to say it's one of the best comedies in the last 10 years. Its clearly satirizing the James Bond films but this is how satirical films should be done. Humour, a good story and a lot of heart and memorable characters. There are talks of a sequel and I'm all for that."
"TheReviewer1010","10","2","8","3 April 2015"," Classy, yet brutal
","This is by far the best movie of 2014, and is(at least on my list) in the top 25. Actually, I'd place it before all the old Bond classics. Mostly because of the storyline, which is incredible, the acting is great and visuals astounding. Yet that is not the entire reason. I love the fact that they combine the classiness of a gentlemen spies(Bond-style), with the humor of the rebel youth.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, the acting is absolutely spot on. Honestly I think Colin Firth, known for the soap-musical ""Mama Mia"", would have been a better 007 than those who have tried before him. He act with such grace, and to say the least, class. He and his stuntman should probably be awarded with an Emmy. <br/><br/>Adrian Quinton were also spot on with his acting. He is really likable, and is easily the best guy for the role. He has this rebel-ish look about him, and he sure uses that to his advantage. He presents to the audience a lot of humor and fun, yet he manages to bring some tears out of you at some occasions. Again, SPOT ON ACTING!<br/><br/>The rest of the cast were either OK+ or good. However the super villain played by Samuel Jackson, needs a little bit more credit. His character will probably go down in history as one of the best villains ever. Both in form of character depth, but also the way Jackson played him. <br/><br/>The thing i like the most about this movie, is the fact that the villain's intentions aren't biblically wrong. Global warming is a threat towards the humans, and is also caused by them. Therefore, by playing god, and wiping out most of the human being, he actually manages to rationalize his actions. And he should be able to rationalize that, even if it is kind of cynical. Because he saves the humanity in a sense, doesn't he? At least one could see it from his point of view, and empathize with his mindset and way of thinking. This is actually proved through religion, in form of Noah. Therefore you have to ask yourself, is this ethical wrong? God did it.<br/><br/>Lastly, I want to recommend this movie to everyone, and hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as i did."

"squirrel_burst","8","2","8","28 March 2015"," Funny and violent, I had a great time with this one.
","Kingsman: The Secret Service (2015) Rating: 4/5 I was hopeful, but a bit wary when I decided to go check out ""Kingsman"" but my fears were for naught. The movie has some flaws, but I found it to be an expertly made action movie that also hails back to a beloved era in James Bond-style spy films and features a lot of laughs. AS far as I'm concerned, that makes director Matthew Vaughn 2 for 2 (his previous film being ""X-Men: First Class""). The plot here concerns an independent secret agency, the Kingsman; when one of the members of the secret organization is killed while out in the field, a replacement is required. Among the candidates is Eggsy (Taron Egerton), a thuggish young man who nevertheless has a lot of potential.<br/><br/>In the end, I'm giving this movie a 4/5 and I can tell you exactly who and what is to blame for that missing one star. ""Based on the comic by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons"". I've read a decent amount of the Millar's work, ranging from the excellent ""Red Son"", to the needlessly cruel and ludicrous, but admittedly kind of clever ""Nemesis"". I'd say overall that I'm not a huge fan of his writing because of his sense of humor, which always, for some reason throws in sexual references and acts that I find more awkward, or even disturbing than genuinely funny. Thankfully, when his work is adapted into a film, other cooks in the kitchen have the good sense to exorcise most of the awkward moments (did ""Wanted"" really need a scene in which Wesley rapes an A-list celebrity? No, it really didn't and thankfully that was completely absent from the film). However, I feel the need to mention this brand of humor because the film is mostly devoid of anything that rubbed me the wrong way... except for the second last scene in the movie which contains a sexual reference that I thought was plain terrible. It feels unfair to be so critical, but what would you rather watch? A race in which a runner stumbles at first but catches his feet and then ends up winning, or one in which the runner trips while ahead of everyone and then gets up in time to still finishes first? I'd rather see something improve over time than end on a truly awkward note. The good news is that other than a few moments here and there where the humor feels mean-spirited, the movie is a real joy to watch.<br/><br/>I think the highlight for me has to be the action sequences that pepper the story. In an age when so many pictures have fights that are chopped up so that can make even an old man look like a bad ass, presuming you can tell what is going on, I had been starving to see this kind of camera work. The shots are nice and long, the action sequences are creative not only in terms of the weapons and techniques used, but in the way the battles are set up. Those bone-crunching kicks and punches get you amped up to see more, and the movie delivers with a spectacular ""final boss"" battle. Even when it wasn't a fist or gun fight, the movie had me literally shaking in my seat. My legs got very jittery staring down falls that meant nearly certain death and timers counting down to Armageddon. The stunts here and the high stakes, it's exactly what I was hoping to find as I bought my movie ticket. I really did not expect to see some of the most satisfying action set pieces I've seen since ""The Raid 2"" in a February film.<br/><br/>The next praise I have for ""Kingsman"" is one that's very particular to me, but I think a lot of you, if you think about it will agree. I miss seeing crazy villains. Yeah I appreciate the villains we see in films nowadays, like the special effects extravaganza that was Electro in ""Amazing Spider-Man II"" or the morally complex Magneto in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"", but I think back to some of my favorite bad guys from when I was a kid and you know who I picture? I picture the silly X-ians from ""Godzilla vs. Monster Zero"". What do they want? To take over the world and destroy anyone who doesn't kneel before them. How will they accomplish this? Realistic manipulating of governments and careful management of resources? No way! Crazy evil plots is what I want to see! In addition to being an action film so violent it becomes comedic and a genuine comedy, ""Kingsman"" is also a love letter to those old James Bond movies. The villains in this film rival the classics that I've come to love, like Oddjob, or Jaws, or even some of the one that are so imaginative they don't really make any sense, but sure are cool to see fight bad guys from comic books. When you don't know who you want to cheer for because the villains are so awesome you don't want to see them beaten, you know you have something special on your hands.<br/><br/>""Kingsman"" is a fun action movie. It delivers the action you want to see, it has a story that balances out the zaniness of the classic bond films and the more modern plots we've become accustomed to, it's got a lot of big laughs and some memorable characters. It missteps right before the conclusion, but that's not enough to sink it completely. I enjoyed myself very much and hope to see more of this world in the future.

","After seeing how everybody praises this movie i decided to see it myself despite the fact that i was sure this will be an average film at best after seeing the trailers. Surprise, i was right. <br/><br/>But i believe in giving credit where credit is do and there where some parts that i enjoyed. <br/><br/>The movie used a lot of spy movie clichés but by having the characters mentioning the old bond films in the movie it became clear that all those where meant more as an homage rather than cheap plot lines. This works for the over the top spy equipment as well as for the ridiculous plan of the villain. Also, the scene at the beginning where Harry gives young Eggsy the medal of Eggsy's father was a good excuse to set the story in motion. When Eggsy was calling the number on the medal to get help it didn't felt as convenient as it might could've been.<br/><br/>However, there where also a lot of dumb scenes like the same grenades having completely different timers or the character of Roxy performing the side mission to blow up a satellite instead of Eggsy despite the fact that she is afraid of heights and is also an official agent and Eggsy is not. But i liked that the didn't establish a romantic relationship between those two characters. <br/><br/>Everyone told me that the character of Harry was really cool which would be right, if he had any character. Aside from being a bad ass and a gentleman he has no personality whatsoever and i didn't care when he was killed. <br/><br/>The big problem with this movie is that his has no Identity. It obviously tries to be an action comedy like Kick-Ass, which is equally overrated like this one, but for it to be such a movie the action was too boring and the humor was, for like 99% of the time, not present. Also, while the film tells you that you should not take it too seriously, it falls completely apart at the moment where the villain reveals his plan to save the Planet. By doing this the writers completely reverse the style of the film to press an environmental message in the audiences face instead of staying true to what they are claiming to do. The movie would be a little more enjoyable if the bad guy had a completely generic plan to take over the world because it would stay more true to the campy style of the film. However, the methods he used to achieve his goal where still ridiculous like in some old spy films. <br/><br/>In the end, I'm not mad at this movie because it was exactly what i thought it would be. It's a partially enjoyable spy film that leaves no impression and is quickly forgotten."

Egorton) is certainly the most (or rather the sole) psychologically complex character in the movie because he is the only one undergoing an inner development from a Hooligan nobody to a Gentleman hero.<br/><br/>However, they both are somewhat overshadowed by the lisping Samuel L.

"shreyahuja09","7","2","8","13 March 2015"," A Spy film with no clichés.
","Immersive, entertaining, funny, well-acted but forgettable. Words I use to describe my experience with Kingsman. <br/><br/>A spy movie that acknowledges the various tropes and clichés often associated with the spy genre and then proceeds to break them with minimal effort and often a frenzy of laughter. As Samuel L. Jackson's character Richmond Valentine and Taron Egerton's Eggsy state, ""It's not that kind of a movie"". Which means no convoluted plots, impossibly smart heroes, wooden and expendable supporting characters or illogical situations (except a few).<br/><br/>The latest directorial/scriptwriting/production venture of Matthew Vaughn of X Men First Class and Days of Future Past fame. Sadly, unlike the aforementioned movies as well as Kick-Ass, Kingsman is not as memorable. It fails to find its footing and identity and at every step aspire to illicit the same laughter James Bond does and fails miserably. <br/><br/>Kingsman's overarching plot is one of its weaknesses. It's not particularly original and not well thought out either. So are many if the action sequences, but we'll get there later. <br/><br/>Valentine drives a hard bargain with a sensible speech. He compares human to a virus on the host, the nature. With the current trend of population growth, it can only lead to two outcomes. Either the host kills the virus or the virus kills the host. But in either case, humans die. Unless someone does something to change that. So, after earning billions, Valentine takes it upon himself to save the human species from extinction. To do so, Valentine proposes a biological weapon. Neurological waves emitted from the SIM card his company will give away for free that trigger the aggression centre of the brain in a bid for humans to kill one another and martyr themselves for the greater good. All the while keeping the influential and powerful safe to be a part of the new world. <br/><br/>On the surface it seems A-grade but on going deeper the logic starts to crumble. <br/><br/>The true strength lies in the interactions and relations of the characters. The on screen chemistry and the dialogues. They never failed to charm the audience and keep them drawn into the tale of Harry (Colin Firth), Eggsy and the Kingsman's race to save the world.<br/><br/>The movie does a fantastic job in being fresh. It outright breaks the various tropes and clichés associated to it. The duration of the movie, I kept on applying the various tropes and clichés to see where the movie would slip up. But sadly, when I walked out, I had a hateful respect towards the movie for being original and insulting my intelligence again and again. No obvious double crossers. The villain not missing the clue that Harry Hart is not a billionaire and instead somebody with a much bigger agenda than that of a billionaire. <br/><br/>The lead character, Harry Hart (Colin Firth) having a plot armor giving him a get out of situations free card. The movie outsmarts you at every step. <br/><br/>Expanding more on the characters, the movie does an amazing job of handling its characters the movie took its time to build up the characters. While the movie focuses on Harry and Eggsy's relationship for the first half, it sets up other characters, another Kingsman Merlin (Mark Strong) as the cold test taker and Roxy (Sophie Cookson) the eventual latest initiate to the Kingsman so they can take control of the movie in the second half without it becoming too rushed, messy, unfamiliar or awkward.<br/><br/>In the opening scene of the movie, Harry Hart a.k.a. Galahad and the rest of the Kingsman are interrogating a Middle Eastern terrorist in a fort in the Middle East. Obviously. The terrorist pulls the pin on the grenade Galahad missed and it costs Lancelot's (another Kingsman) life to save everyone. That Lancelot was Eggsy's father, thus the on screen time and relationship of Harry and Eggsy which led Eggsy to the test to replace the recently fallen Lancelot in a botched rescue mission in the mountains. <br/><br/>It would be a crime to not give a special mention to Samuel L.Jackson's performance as Valentine. He acts as the movie's primary villain as well as comic relief. He has a lisp, thinks big, and is a scaredy cat and a joy to watch, all the way till his last scene.<br/><br/>Just like the movie does so many good things, it also has its flaws that sadly cannot be overlooked.<br/><br/>The action sequences were too long and illogical. The movie always tried to be something else, a sci-fi movie (a woman dodging bullets), too James Bond-sy, a martial arts/karate or Matrix style jumping around. They served no purpose other than 'oooohs' and 'aahhs' from the audience. <br/><br/>Another gripe that will detract from the experience is its heavy dependence on stereotypes. Eggsy, single child with abusive stepfather and no aim in life His mother, a victim of low self-esteem. People from Oxford and Cambridge being snobs. Boys being snobby and unfriendly. <br/><br/>All in all, though, Kingsman is one of the most well-paced spy films that has its moments and deserves a watch, well because it is fun and forgettable. <br/><br/>Rating: 3/4"

","Finally took my gf to the theater after hearing positive reviews about it for weeks, and was somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>To start with the movie plot didn't quite connect, at some point it moved too fast and at some point it jumped to conclusions leaving out a lot of details and loose ends untied. Wait, I thought this was supposed to be a comedic action movie? I probably loosed a chuckle in the first 30 minutes of the movie and that was it. Action wise, granted, there were a few nicely made scenes with new perspectives and camera angles, but they did not save me from talking in my head ""is the movie almost over so I can go to the bathroom?"". In addition, you may heard from some that there was a lot of bloody gore, but I didn't like it even though I sit through the two 300 movies perfectly fine, bottom word, unnecessary. Lastly, I don't think I can take another movie with Samuel Jackson in it 24/7.<br/><br/>I usually regard any movie with an 8 or above to be a must-watch, 7.5 for some categories, but there were some really disappointing movies out there lately (The Imitation Game, for example). These movies aren't total disasters, but they weren't cream of the crop either. Overall I think this movie deserves a 6 rather than an 8."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","2","8","4 March 2015"," Panders too much, subverts too little.
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is the type of film that wants to be special, but it's anything but. This isn't another Austin Powers level parody of a beloved sub-genre, for better or for worse. While Bond has added the grit as of late, Kingsman tries its best to emulate it in the action and as a result, it's a film that panders too much and subverts too little. Its idea of what you least expect is a lisping Samuel L. Jackson who serves McDonald's for dinner. Nevertheless, it is enjoyable entertainment if your brain is firmly switched off. It has a nasty habit of plummeting characters into situations that are only really interesting in hindsight of their twists and as a result, they're unsatisfying until the reveal, including the now infamous church sequence. Matthew Vaughn is good at bringing a little bit of Hollywood back home so it is often cinematic though hit-and-miss with its sense of style. The film does do one thing intelligently and that's the illustration of class conflict. But the controversial joke near its end shows the standards its reaching for. Ultimately, Kingsman tries to be a franchise starter without starting with enough of worth. Beats a normal comic book adaptation I guess.<br/><br/>6/10"

","My cheeks are hurting, my ribs are aching and my head is numb, that's how much fun I had with this f**ing awesome film! There isn't really a word to describe how entertaining this experience is, I'll just say that in fact of fun factor it reaches levels that had been missing ever since The Avengers hit theaters.<br/><br/>How can I start describing it when the only thing that I really want to get through is just: go see this film and have a blast. Really, I have been a fan of Matthew Vaughn before people even knew he existed, ever since Layer Cake, which I still contend is one of the great underestimated movies of cinema possibly. The action is clearly the culmination of all Vaughn's experience and it pays off, every single frame pays off. Be it the fast paced scenes, the frenetic ones or most of all the stunning long takes, the action is always excellent. Sequence after sequence my jaw war dropped, most of all the sky diving and the church scene, which I for one did not find in any possible way offensive, were a force to be reckoned with: I challenge you not to go on the edge of your seat in those moments! silently, but clearly pays homage to the likes of Edgar Wright and that makes it all the more entertaining to watch. A big, big highlight of the movie is the music which I found to be spot on right from the opening credits. Taron Egerton breaks through and shows us his potential, which believe me is incredible. Of course the cast surrounding him is flawless, but with names like Firth, Strong, Caine and Jackson that's a given by now. All of the cast is awesome the old and the young, they all craft characters who are interesting to watch, for whom you feel empathy and even do great stunts. Every aspect of the filmaking here is an example of technical perfection and this added even another layer to the film, because other than watching characters interact with great, funny dialouge and kick-ass everywhere, I was genuinely admiring the brilliance of the filmaking.<br/><br/>Because of this I really can't call out the movie for any negatives, per say, it fulfills its job more than perfectly and actually does much more. But, I will acknowledge that a movie that immediately came to mind when thinking of this one was ""Kick-Ass"", in particular the fact that ""Kingsman"" is missing some small things, that made ""Kick-Ass"" instead the gem it is. For example: the story behind this film isn't the greatest I could have asked for, it serves its purpose, but I could have easily seen something slightly edgier fitting in, just like in ""Kick-Ass"" where, moreover, the fact that it had a great story, made it actually, amongst all the madness in the movie, a quietly moving and partly inspiring film. That's not to say that ""Kingsman"" doesn't have good storytelling, on the contrary it has some excellent, balanced and clever way of telling its story, but doesn't have a high enough concept.<br/><br/>Yet, that's really too much bragging for this film, I look forward to seeing it again and if you are still reading this review: what are you doing here? Get up and go have a blast!"
"atlasmb","8","2","8","25 February 2015"," A Fun Ride Through A Heroic World Of Action
","I purposely try not to know too much about a film before I watch it. This film starts out like a typical Bond film, but quickly dispels that notion. The viewer is alerted that this is a film where you can expect the unexpected. After a while, I recognized the comic book origins of the story and allowed myself to just enjoy the world of ""Kingsman"", where style trumps substance.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the references to other films were flying left and right. Some of the more obvious to me (besides the Bond canon) were ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."", ""V for Vendetta"", ""Kill Bill"", and even ""The Princess Bride.""<br/><br/>One of the best things about this film is the photography. The camera is always moving. In fight scenes, it does not film from afar; it enters the fray and traces the flights of bullets, bottles and fists. It moves from scene to scene with a smoothness that is enjoyable, unlike some modern films that feel like they are edited to change camera views every split second.<br/><br/>The film is violent. There are violent characters intent on mass destruction and intrepid heroes who do what is necessary to stop them. But still this is comic book violence, though some may not understand the difference.<br/><br/>The heroes are ""gentlemen"" agents--men of chivalry and refinement, like James Bond distilled to his essence and perfected over the years. <br/><br/>I give this film high marks for its creativity, its style, the scenery and sets, and its action scenes. With tongue in cheek, it takes the viewer on a fun ride and sets the table for future sequels."

","British spies are so cool. They always dress sharp. They act like perfect gentlemen. Every little thing on their persons is some kind of hidden weapon or device. They always defeat the henchmen, save the world from megalomaniac supervillains, and get the girl in the end. With Kingsman, Matthew Vaughn uses the standard British spy movie schtick to distill all the best elements of his previous films: a little bit of the training scenes from X-Men: First Class, a large portion of the ultraviolence and attitude from Kick-Ass, maybe a drop of the hard-hitting drama from Layer Cake, and voila, we have a martini that's far more shaken than stirred.<br/><br/>Even though the film may seem derivative, it's still a total blast from beginning to end. The action is very stylish and incredible; the fight scenes are expertly-choreographed and filmed in a way that shoves it all in your face (in a manner that reminded me much of the way The Raid 2 was staged). As the film progresses, less and less is held back, and the film paints a colorfully brutal picture of the fantasy of being a British spy. A few scenes - the pub fight, the church scene, the fight with the main henchman, and a certain scene involving microchip implants - are incredible on their own and make the movie a must-see for anybody who can handle them.<br/><br/>I thought the story was good and well-told. It wastes little time in establishing a great cast of characters we can relate to and enjoy, going so far as weaving inspiring themes of what being a gentleman really means. The story strikes an excellent pace and it shows exactly everything it needs to for the plot to unfold and reach its incredible climax. It is a very dense and fulfilling tale.<br/><br/>The subtext, unfortunately, is where certain wires are crossed and it can leave some viewers feeling confused. This is a movie that often mocks the conventions of other spy movies (including the original James Bond series), but the film plays out in all the same conventions, making it feel rather hypocritical. Same goes for the violence; the film's shock value should make it appalling, but most of it could be seen as a glorification. Kick-Ass had these same issues as well, but the contrast between tone and content made it more successful at being darkly comedic. With Kingsman, the contrast is not as strong, and it's hard to tell what stance it's supposed to take on these issues.<br/><br/>The film looks sharp, with decent photography and very punchy editing. A few of the action scenes are pretty fast-cut and have some shaky cam, but this is a rare case where I felt the frenetic nature of the scenes worked to the film's advantage. Acting is swell; the whole cast is colorful and enjoyable to watch. There is a ton of unnecessary swearing, but otherwise the script is great. This production uses good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are sometimes good, sometimes so-so. The soundtrack is great too.<br/><br/>Kingsman is more outlandish than James Bond, gutsier than Jason Bourne, meaner than Jack Bauer. It's also colorful and nutty, a bit like 1998's Avengers, but far more successful at it. What makes it work is that it still has loads of style and action, but still tells a decent story. If you can handle the film's extremities, it's well worth the time.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","8","24 February 2015"," Bloody good fun . . .
","It may someday come to pass that when I get around to making a list of the best action movies I've ever seen, The Kingsman: The Secret Service may find itself right there in the midst of other greats like Die Hard, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Speed, Aliens and The Terminator. After the blight of a worthless movie like Taken 3, here is the kind of action picture I've been hungry for, a whip-smart, clever movie that goes where the James Bond pictures won't dare and turns out the kind of cheeky British humor that the ill-fated Avengers adaptation a decade ago aspired to be.<br/><br/>What is contained here is based on a comic book that, I'll admit, has completely escaped me. Maybe that's a good thing, I'm of the opinion that the best way to experience this film is to go in (as I did) completely cold. From here I must get into the plot, so if you want to stop here and pick it up once you've seen it, I'll understand. At any rate, The Kingsman are an underground espionage agency modeled after King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table – even going so far as to use Lancelot and Galahad as code names – their leader is, of course, Arthur (Michael Caine). Housed in an ordinary-looking Savile Row tailor shop, the group operates outside the will of the Queen or the government. So, much like the Men in Black, they remain invisible.<br/><br/>The rule of The Kingsman is that when one of their agents is killed in action, the process of recruiting a replacement is set in motion. That comes courtesy of an opening scene in which one of their agent is killed in the line of duty while trying to rescue a kidnapped scientist (Mark Hamill) setting off the hunt for a replacement which falls into the hands of agent Harry Hart (Colin Firth) whose code name is Galahad. He puts the offer to a street punk named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who lives at home with his mom and abusive stepdad and is in desperate need of a direction in life. He's also the son of a fallen Kingsman agent, so Harry figures he's got the blood for it. During training, the other more well-to-do young recruits snicker at this kid from the slums until he shows that he's adept after several training sequences like the one in which their barracks is flooded at night, and later they are forced to skydive only to be informed that one of them is packing fatally light.<br/><br/>Of course, this wouldn't be a spy movie without a diabolical plot. That comes courtesy of a goofball American megalomaniac named Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson, sporting a lisp) who offers up the technology of tomorrow with the fervor of Steve Jobs. He was formerly dedicated to saving the environment, but discovered that human beings were the problem and is set on offering a cell phone app that will remove that threat all-together by triggering the rage center of our brains. Harry discovers this while attending a redneck church in which the congregation goes completely berserk leading to the film's best scene – an absolutely brilliant ten minutes of pure balletic slaughter as Harry destroys the entire congregation with whatever is handy. It's beautifully put-together scene that deserves comparison with some of the best action scenes in movie history.<br/><br/>The Kingsman: The Secret Service is the kind of movie that a breath of fresh air after all the carbon copies, dead serious retreads and half-baked crime movies. Here's is a movie that references other action movies without winking to the camera and one-ups all the basic clichés of a James Bond picture, up to and including the scene in which Harry has dinner with the villain, and the two trade on their desire to live the life they've seen in all the spy movies, James Bond and otherwise. Valentine even comes equipped with a Bond-like henchman, a gorgeous but deadly Algerian assassin named Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) whose weapon of choice are a pair of razor sharp prosthetic blades.<br/><br/>It is hard to really put this movie into words. It's something that must be experienced – and I can only hope that in the midst of the fury over the dull-as-dirt Fifty Shades of Grey that audiences will discover this little gem. It's the kind of movie that's just plain fun. It's very funny and also amazingly adept at action scenes that you can't say you've seen before. There is no run-of-the-mill here. It is at once a comedy, and then it's a perfect action movie, set to the tune of the kind of very British tone that we Americans have been in love with since ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" was imported in the 70s. It is directed by Matthew Vaughn, whose pen has been responsible for some of the better X-Men pictures. He and his writing partner Jane Goldman obviously had a ball putting this movie together. They've created a fun movie, a great comedy, a great action movie that gets rolling, keeps it's eye on the road, and doesn't stop for anything."

(1) There is a scene in the movie with a mother cutting into a bathroom door with a knife. The 2 year old kid who is in the bedroom to be safe from crazed mum is terrified, and screaming. There is no such thing as a 2 year old ""acting"" to be scared. The parents who subjected their child along with the director should be charged with child endangerment. This scene is so disturbing my 17 and 20 year old daughters were disturbed. (2) There is a scene at the end where a princess being saved tells the young leading actor that if he saves the world, that he can have sex with her in her anus. Again my entire family was horrified. This came out of no where. But it didn't stop there. When he was finished saving the world, he went back to her cell where she was held captive and had anal sex with her and left his video glasses on so the secret agent helper could see. They didn't show them have sex, but he went back to room with a glass of wine and the movie ended with a scene of her butt. This literally is how the movie ended.

","Kingsman (2015)<br/><br/>A huge spy spoof, lots of fun, with all the usual exotic tools and locations. And it includes a spy academy section where recruits perform bizarre and impossible feats. <br/><br/>But not all spoofs are equal. This one is a bit mashed together, ranging from James Bond references (with Colin Firth playing that kind of spy in a suit) to kids being kids (racing cars around or taunting each other like they are in high school). There is a plot, for sure, and Samuel Jackson plays a quirky bad guy with a lisp out to ruin the world via everyone's cell phones.<br/><br/>Things never get slow. Fight scenes are over the top improbable, not in the Jason Bourne way where skill prevails, nor even the James Bond way where cleverness and a couple of gadgets comes to play, but a combination of these with entertaining excess. One woman on prosthetic legs manages to leap, fly, and cut people in half with gymnastic (c.g.i.) aplomb. <br/><br/>The principle character is one of the recruits, played by young British actor Taron Egerton, and for me he lacks screen presence. But we are meant to relate to him, for sure, a troubled kid with immense talent who gets a chance to fix his life by becoming a super spy. OK overall.<br/><br/>Bottom line—a great fun movie for people who already like spy movies. I'd compare it to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" but that movie is far better than this one—funnier, better effects, better spoof referencing. ""Kingsman"" has lots of clever twists, so give it a go. But you might have a feeling along the way that it's all kind of ""stupid"" and a little disappointing. And you might give the parallel, zanier ""Spy"" a serious (and non- sexist) try...I liked it a lot."

","Matthew Vaugh, director of ""Kick-Ass"" and ""X-Men: First Class"" once again succeeds in adapting a comic with ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"". While the film takes a few liberties with the original Secret Service story, the movie ultimately delivers an outrageously fun take on the spy movie genre – one that should appeal to fans of the series as well as moviegoers who are in the mood for cartoonish violence and action. Certain elements might be a little too crude for sensitive viewers but Vaughn's film includes enough crowd pleasing laughs, stylized fight choreography, and slick spy gadgets to make it an easy recommendation for casual moviegoers in search of popcorn entertainment.<br/><br/>Kingsman relies heavily on toying with genre expectations. It retrofits spy movie tropes (gentleman who are super spies, twisted villains, and zany henchmen) with modern filmmaking aesthetics. The core storyline and character outright acknowledge these parallels to humorous affect; though, the film itself is still locked in a relatively stock spy outline (a game of cat and mouse between heroes and villains) paired with the familiar tale of a scrappy young person given the chance to do something extraordinary with their life – assuming they are bold enough to take it. Vaughn's moment to moment execution supplies a constant stream of sharp action, enjoyable characters, and clever pop culture nods.<br/><br/>In fact, while recent James Bond films continue to retrace 007′s signature style, Kingsman presents a hyper-stylized variation that, without question, offers some of the best fight choreography that moviegoers will have seen in the spy genre as of late. The tone can be tongue-in-cheek, and gags are lewd, but Kingsman isn't just a silly spy romp either - there's a heart to the story that, in between all of the blood, explosions, and sexual innuendo, imparts thoughtful commentary on the men behind the suits. <br/><br/>For that reason, Firth (whose name had been thrown around years back as a possible candidate for Bond) furnishes one of his most likable and entertaining performances, in an already illustrious thirty-year career, as Harry Hart. Fans may never get to see Firth don a 007 tuxedo but, thanks to Kingsman, the actor proves he has the necessary charisma and flexibility to lead future action vehicles - often out-Bonding recent James Bond movies.<br/><br/>As stated within the film, a spy movie is only as good as its villains and the combined pairing of Jackson (doing his best Russell Simmons impression) and Sofia Boutella (as his bladed henchwoman Gazelle) are a fun set of opponents for Hart and the Kingsman. Unsurprisingly, Jackson is a scene stealer as Valentine – injecting laughable quirks that punctuate the character's contagious charm and unrepentant insanity. Kingsman also features a strong cast of supporting players – led by Taron Egerton as Eggsy. Even though Hart is the biggest draw of the film, Eggsy is the central figure of the story – as he transitions from troublemaker to a tailored suit wearing hero. To that end, the juxtaposition between the young actor and Firth is especially captivating and, often, heartwarming – providing a unique and layered mentor/mentee relationship that isn't often explored with such care in the spy genre. Rounding out the cast, viewers are also treated to genuinely fun moments from Mark Strong (Kick-Ass) and Mark Hamill (Star Wars) as well as Michael Caine (The Dark Knight Trilogy) and newcomer Sophie Cookson.<br/><br/>Vaughn and Goldman borrow heavily from espionage-thriller classics but through smart genre riffs and hyper-stylized action, Kingsman: The Secret Service manages to provide a clever twist on the spy movie format. Vaughn successfully balances a hefty amount of world-building, humor, action, and character drama into a tight two hour runtime – laying the foundation for a film franchise that, much like its main character, might be a little rough around the edges but delivers where it counts."

I was thinking that it's going to be something like James Bond or like that, but we get a lot more then that.<br/><br/>Based upon the acclaimed comic book and directed by Matthew Vaughn, Kingsman: The Secret Service tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.<br/><br/>So, the story is, by it self, a lot more then usual spy and agent movies. I really like this idea about those sim cards for controlling people.<br/><br/>In this movie, there is a lot of good acting. We have Colin Firth (Harry Hart / Galahad), Mark Hamill (Professor Arnold), Samuel L. Jackson (Valentine) and, of course, Taron Egerton (Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin). All of them did great.<br/><br/>This movie is also funny, I'm not going to tell you the jokes because i'll spoil you fun then.<br/><br/>The action scenes are done well. All of those slow motion scenes are done great and they are in perfect timing. Idea with umbrellas that are multipractic (gun, shield, stunner etc.) is great. In every scene there is something new which, of course, I really like.<br/><br/>This movie has a big potential for sequels but, I don't know how the director and writers are going to use that potential. For this movie, when I read some reviews, I was so exciting and finally, I watched it. It was worth waiting. From now on, this is one of my favorite movies."
"liamvdheuvel","10","2","9","23 March 2015"," ""Manners maketh man"" One of the best films of the year
","I loved Kingsman, but it wasn't a masterpiece in cinematography, acting or a winner of any Oscars (it won't be), but this movie isn't striving for that, this is pure awesomeness. Anyone who loves badasses in suits, ultra- violence, and Colin Firth killing people in the most brutal possible ways will love this movie. The acting is still really good, with a complimentary cast, Samuel L. Jackson's character is hilarious, Colin Firth going from something like The Kings Speech to this is a wonderful breath of fresh air, and he fits in perfectly, Mark Strong also holds his own really well. But the real star is the newcomer Taron Egerton acting as the main character 'Eggsy' in the film, and he shows huge potential, and creates an extremely likable protagonist in Kingsman. Go see this movie if you want a tongue and cheek load of fun (if not quite inappropriate in terms of violence and sexual references: don't bring your kids). Really if you loved the original Kickass, this is a movie for you."

","OK, so when it comes to English action films, we normally find something that makes us roll our eyes and think, really we don't do that but when I started watching this film from the start it reminded me of me and my mates growing up in the streets of Croydon, it all just felt so natural also when it came down to the fight scenes it was all so real with the exception of a few flashy moves but other than that it had a great blend of the way we talk as a common person mixed with the way we talk as an upper class posh person and the transition from street thug to gentleman killer it was excellent. The comedy was your typical English humour which made the film just that little bit more personal to the viewers really made me laugh. 10/10 looking forward to part 2"

","Expect cheeky man whore spies and equally convoluted spy movie clichés? Kingsman: The Secret Service is not that type of spy movie.<br/><br/>Slated for an American release in February amongst the lame romantic comedies and other dud-like films released in the dead of winter, Kingsman: The Secret Service shocks all by being quite a great movie.<br/><br/>Kingsman is the name of the super secret espionage agency that polices the world and England in anonymity and without recognition. Only the most intellectual, moralistic, and talented are able to join this selectively reputable group. And, of course you must be invited and pass their highly competitive and rigorous training program. For this year's recruits, Galahad (played by Colin Firth) chooses Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a rough around the edges hooligan with promise, to represent him amidst the rest of spy- hopefuls. Meanwhile a new 'bad guy' is ready to unleash his evil twisted plan and effectively destroy the world.<br/><br/>We've all seen a spy movie, and if you haven't, you just simply must let me know where you found your rock. Gone are the tactical plot points and character archetypes, and instead Kingsman: The Secret Service is a refreshingly good, novel and entertaining film. The plot is linear, unlike most spy movies of recent time, and it makes for a very clean and captivating film.<br/><br/>What is a spy movie without a protagonist, villain and killer action scenes? Colin Firth makes for the quintessential 'seasoned' spy while Taron Egerton makes for the perfect 'cheeky' anti-hero. Both have amazing chemistry and play well off one another while being engaging enough to continue garnering the audience's attention during solo scenes.<br/><br/>And now, for the action. At first I thought Colin Firth had somehow managed to nonchalantly steal the award for best fight scene in an espionage film and then Taron Egerton showed up, a secondary dark horse in the running. The fight coordination is fast, concise and without flourish but stylized for a flare seemingly unique to Kingsman: The Secret Service.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I was on the fence about this film going in. The trailer looked sick, and Colin Firth has never known to make a heinous misstepbut a spy movie in February that was more superficial and light than its dark and edgy peers? I was happily proved wrong, if you will, and Kingsman: The Secret Service is sure to entertain. I just hope there is a sequel/prequel.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."

","wow so after seeing this i have a lot of positive things to say. The good things were the comedy and action, and those were ripe. On the flip side the special effects were questionable and the story was scrabbled. But setting that aside it is a must see for fans of action and comedy. I urge u to view this film. Also in the movie morals are told. Also lessons about friendship and hardships are put out there. The movie was what i hoped and something more. So even tho its a little overboard its still a decent film. No more should be said then simply wow. Because this movie makes u say wow and other things i have decided against putting down."

","A weekend cinema-outing of this slick UK spy actioner which is a surprisingly excellent revamped Bond-esque espionage genre fare inundated with polished set pieces and beguiling plot twist albeit the whole movie is ground in the same old saving-the-world-from- a-super-villain mode. <br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn has been constantly on my radar as one of my favourite genius in commercial filmmaking, I have watched all his previous four features, from LAKE CAKE (2004, 6/10), X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (2011, 7/10), to my absolute guilty-pleasure treasures STARDUST (2007, 9/10) and KICK-ASS (2010, 9/10). His latest is by all means a thoroughly engaging adventure with unconventional violence and visual gags, which all delightfully surpass viewer's expectation. <br/><br/>So, Kingsman is a secret British spy organisation with agents all suited-up in a refined and old-fashioned cavalier comportment to fight the evil minds. After losing one of their top asset Lancelot (Davenport), the headquarter, presided by Arthur (Caine), decides to recruit a new agent from promising youngsters, one of the recruits is Eggsy (Egerton), an unpolished street kid under the aegis of Harry Hart aka. Galahad (Firth), one of the top Kingsman who is indebted to Eggsy's deceased father, also a former Kingsman. During the boot camp, Eggsy befriends another recruit Roxy (Cookson), as the world is going to experience a holocaust schemed by a billionaire and radical elitist Valentine (Jackson) through his free SIM cards distributed to every corner of the globe. While all the rich and famous are privileged to survive in the new Noah's Ark constructed by Valentine, as long as they are conceded to implant a chip into their brains so that Valentine can have the full reign over them. In general, it is a partisan aggression to counteract the swelling global population which will endanger the entire human race. In hindsight, this execution is the major weak link in this otherwise inventive script, it is far more efficient to annihilate his targets if Valentine can simply detonate the self-explosion program designed in his SIM cards, if he could and should have been a bit more clever and as we all know, the chosen scenario is only to make the movie apparently dazzling for its special effects. <br/><br/>It is a no-brainer that Valentine's plan is doomed to founder in a typical last second endgame to maintain the suspense on the high-point, but Vaugh and his co-writer Jane Goldman gallantly deploy a take-no-prisoners manoeuvre to outrun audience's common sense of ""we don't need to worry about our heroes, as Bond will never die in the movie"", more impressive, it is the work of visual department, from the grand opening aerial shot, the highly-entertaining action-in-suit and swift parkour, to the adrenaline-surging church massacre in a stylish and perfectly coordinated slow-mo technique, and the final game-changing heads-will-explode firework, they are all high-end spectacles can suffice audience of today. Plus the movie has moderately good humour, it salutes without descending into snobbishness when tries to reanimate the nobleman brand of espionage. <br/><br/>Colin Firth finally finds himself in a box-office gainer in the nadir of his post-Oscar bad career choices, and he is great here too, even in the action sequences, he should go on a profitable path as the noble version of Liam Neeson in the middle-aged killing-machine type. Newcomers Egerton and Cookson are genially well-chosen in the rookie plot-setting, but they do not exhibit ample allure to lead in a sequel all by themselves, so I guess some big name can still wait for his casting call. Also Mark Strong takes a hefty task in the game, first as a ruthless trainer, then a valiant pilot, an omnipotent computer hacker, and a professional ass-kicker. But the most indelible character is Sofia Boutella's Gazelle, Valentine's hench-woman, an extremely dangerous double amputee killer. Ultimately the film lifts the bar of our appreciation of heavy-budgeted blockbuster, and sends a defiant message for the cutting-edge industry to emulate."

","'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is...well...exactly what you would expect from a Jane Goldman adaptation of a Mark Millar comic book. It's absurdly violent, devoid of any subtlety in characterisation, insistently profane and – just occasionally – bloody funny. Colin Firth plays a John Steed style spy, recruiting noob Taron Egerton into a troupe of impeccably tailored spies. Rather more restrained than 'Kick Ass', it's okay and you'll probably think you want a sequel – but bearing in mind what the same team did in 'Kick-Ass 2'...you REALLY don't. As a parody of posh super-spy tomfoolery (incessantly referenced in the script), it works. Samuel L. Jackson is amusing as the lisping baddie, sending his usual cool screen-persona up, and the ever-reliable Mark Strong gives able support as the de facto 'Q' for the team, but it is essentially lightweight, disposable fare. Best scene involves a VERY inventive use of 'Land of Hope and Glory', which provoked a round of applause at the screening I viewed."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","9","14 March 2015"," Joyously entertaining - and clearly the first in a franchise
","If you enjoyed the 2010 movie ""Kick-Ass"" (and I certainly did), you'll be joyously entertained by ""Kingsman"". That's no accident since the films have the same British director Matthew Vaughan and the same British writer Jane Goldman (aka Mrs Jonathan Ross). Whereas ""King-Ass"" was a twist on the super-hero genre, ""Kingsman"" is a homage to the spy caper with particular reference to the earlier Bond movies. While ""King-Ass"" was wonderfully violent, ""Kingsman"" at times presents a gore-fest, notably in over the top sequences involving a fight scene in a church and heads exploding to accompanying music.<br/><br/>It is a cleverly constructed work with excitement from the opening seconds, a narrative that fairly zips along, and lots of wry humour. And it deliberately pitches for a wide audience with a host of older familiar stars (Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Samuel L Jackson) plus a raft of new younger talent (Taron Egerton as the working class young buck, Sophie Cookson as his side kick, and Sofia Boutella as his intended nemesis). Sometimes it is all a little too contrived, with the device of a line of dialogue repeated later in a slightly different context used over and over again, but it is all so much fun you forgive such contrivances.<br/><br/>The plan is that ""Kingsman"" will become a franchise and early in the credits a scene sets up the central character for the next movie."

","Well played Mr. Vaughn. Well played. I've always appreciated Matthew Vaughns cinematic style, but the plot is always a tad too unique or doesn't click. Everything seems to click here. The plot is a bit out there, and the good vs. bad animated characters almost play out like a Saturday morning cartoon but it seems to work. Good is mostly good, and bad is evil. The characters are intriguing, the dialect entertaining, and the action is an old fashioned good time. Pun intended when referring to the Kingsman. The movie although predictable in some senses as far as the training for the most part, many things are not predictable. People die. Good people turn bad. And the beat down you always want to see from Eggsy (Egerton) to his mom's boyfriend doesn't ever happen even though he deserves it. There are many things that happen in the movie to keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat and I wasn't really bored for a minute. I was surprised by the rating and wasn't sure what to expect from the R-rating. I expected a barely adult movie that was almost PG-13. Way off. There are numerous profanities used, and lots of blood. It was actually refreshing for there to be a legitimate adult movie made and not just an R-rated movie edited to fit mass PG-13 audiences. The action scene with Galahad (Firth) and the crazy church people.amazing. I will definitely be watching it again."
"Thefilmhead65411","Null","2","9","22 February 2015"," A must see action/Spy film
","Growing up one of my favorite franchises to watch was James Bond. A world based in reality, but with all these over the top gadgets, weapons, cars and villains. The kingsman did an amazing job at recreating the tone of these classic movies while putting this gratuitously violent, original spin on the spy thriller. The Kingsman is a story adapted from a Mark Miller comic book. This comic book tone was that insanely crazy quality that I think set this film apart from other spy franchises. Another aspect of this film I enjoyed, was the wink to the fact that Director Matthew Vaughn New how over the top this film was. The fact that he did this made the moments in this film that felt campy and a little cheesy feel fun while paying homage to the stereotypical spy film. The things I really liked the most in this film were the performances, the villains and the action. it's funny because these aspects if not done right could have made this unbelievably stupid. They stayed with a consistent tone and they really pulled it off. This main character eggsie is played by up and comer Teron Edgerton. This dude is awesome, he did such a good job. Colin Firth did a great job also, playing a mentor figure, and his action sequence is absolutely amazing. It is one of the highlights of the film. You will know what I am talking about when you watch it. Samuel L Jackson is the man, who else can play a sociopathic genius with a lisp and still make it his own.. At first I really did not care for his character but as the film progresses you end up think this villain is absolutely hilarious. I don't think anyone could pull that off as good as him. Besides Taron Edgertons character Samuel L Jackson was my favorite character in this film. I wrote in my marvel piece last week about what makes a good villain. The idea of a villain that thinks they are bettering the world by their actions, creates a whole other layer of evil. As over the top, and as crazy as his character was, this was the of the layer that made him a great villain. The only complaint I have about the kingsman is really minor. There were definitely a couple of occasions were I felt the film was a little corny. I will say this, those moments seem to pass quickly, and I mostly felt this in the beginning 20 minutes, before you really figure out the tone of the film. These moments are there to remind you that this is the tone of the movie. Overall. I really enjoyed this film. It was a total throw back to those over the top, 60's and 70's outrageous spy films that we all know and love. Cool gadgets, good action, it's very, very violent. Teron Edgerton was just awesome he played a good action star while being able to portray a relatable character with depth and substance. I highly recommend The Kingsman: The Secret Service. I give it a solid 8 out of 10. I can't say it enough if you like over the top violence and you like spy movie you will definitely dig this"

","Kingsman: The Secret Service<br/><br/>Remember Agent Cody Banks? That crappy movie about the kid who goes to spy camp? Well Kingsman is like if that movie was good. And completely awesome.<br/><br/>There way be spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Story<br/><br/>This movie is based on a comic book written by Mark Millar. Even though I haven't read the original comic, I can tell that the movie strayed from the source material. Even so, I think it was probably for the best. <br/><br/>The plot of this movie is a basic rags to riches story mixed with a classic James Bond film. The main character Eggsy is a naturally gifted troublemaker who hasn't had it easy in life. Eggsy's father was a member of an ultra-elite super-spy agency.<br/><br/>Years after his father's death, Eggsy is approached by Harry Hart, another member of the same ultra-elite super-spy agency. Harry offers Eggsy the chance to ""join the club."" <br/><br/>After the that, the plot is quite predictable. Eggsy gets trained, there's an over the top charismatic villain with a lisp, and he has to save the world. <br/><br/>Look, the plot isn't the most original or unique.or the most sensible. But the amount of action and entertainment in this film makes up for that.<br/><br/>Side Note: I am a big fan of over the top action movies, and I think action and entertainment in an action film should always take priority over a logical plot. So there<br/><br/>Acting/Dialogue<br/><br/>There were some stellar performances in this movie. Colin Firth played his role of gentleman spy brilliantly. Taron Egerton (Eggsy) was able to play a character that could have easily been annoying. However, I sympathized with his character, and I think his performance really made the movie.<br/><br/>Another actor to note is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays the role of the over the top and ridiculous supervillain.<br/><br/>The lisp really seals the deal.<br/><br/>Action/SFX<br/><br/>In recent years, action movies have been really gritty and realistic. I personally favor old school action movies, with over the top and impossible stunts and fight scenes. If you share my preferences then this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>Action is abundant in this movie, to point where I was on the edge of my seat more then I was relaxed in it. Not only that, but the action sequences are long and intense, not to mention the fact that most of the stunts could never be performed by an actual human being. But that's what makes it great!<br/><br/>Most of the fight sequences are filmed with ""shaky cam,"" but unlike other movies, (*cough* Jason Bourne Series *cough*) the sharp camera movements isn't too distracting and you can actually tell what is going on.<br/><br/>Award Time!<br/><br/>Best Performance: Taron Eggerton<br/><br/>Best Scene: The Church Fight<br/><br/>Funniest Line (and possibly my favorite line in a movie ever): ""I'm a Catholic whore, currently enjoying congress out of wedlock with my black Jewish boyfriend who works at a military abortion clinic. Hail Satan, and have a lovely afternoon madam.""<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Kingsman is probably the best movie that I've seen since Guardians of the Galaxy. I give it a 9/10. It's really good to see a return to the style of actions that I love."

Substantial spy actioner based on the comic book ""The Secret Service"" about England's elite squad to serve queen and country with Firth as a veteran gentleman soldier who recruits young Egerton (in a decent big screen debut) in an open slot of the squad out to stop meglamoniacal genius Jackson (lisping his way into yet another obnoxious over-the-top performance; really needs to dial it down a bit) hellbent on destroying humanity via technology (that old Bond chestnut). While it plays like an ode to the aforementioned 007 (and even nods to America's Jason Bourne with some clever fight sequences adrenalized with '70s soundtrack hits) it does enliven the genre with some nifty nips and tucks (i.e. an Odd-Jobian Asian henchman with a sex change and Ginsu-sharp artificial legs played by the sly, lithe Boutella and to see dapper, mild-mannered Firth kick some serious ass) it does become predictable and old hat in its grande finale of carnage (not a dig but OK, we get it) no thanks to the shoot 'em up screenplay adaptation by young turk filmmaker Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman).

","Kingsman is the type of movie that from the trailers, looks to polarize audiences. The previews are stylish, ridiculous, over-the-top, but potentially fun. The question was, would it pull these things off successfully, or be so self-indulgent as to be depraved of any quality?<br/><br/>Despite fun-font opening titles, Kingsman starts off rather serious. It begins in the Middle East with a group of secret service men prying for information, before their subject proves to be a suicide bomber. One of the men sees this and immediately sacrifices himself to save the group. This weighs heavily on secret service man Harry Hart, an experienced kingsman who should have seen it coming, knows it, and doesn't ever forget.<br/><br/>Harry Hart is played brilliantly by Colin Firth. He's the type of bad ass who will take down everyone in the room, but will be a perfect gentleman right up until, and right after, that very moment. ""Manners maketh man"" he exclaims, just before brutally assailing an entire group of men at a bar. Harry Hart's emotions are just beneath the surface much of the time, but Colin Firth does so well with nuance, that it never feels overdone.<br/><br/>The real star of the show, however, is Eggsy, played wonderfully by newcomer Taron Egerton. Eggsy is the son of the man killed in the beginning, and despite his fashion, manners, and swiftness to throw fists to solve his problems, Eggsy is a very respectable character, because he stands up for himself, looks after himself and his troubled mother, and he's determined to do well when called upon. Though his character can pack a lot of laughs, as he is often wide-eyed about the fancy gadgetry, Taron Egerton takes the role very seriously, making for a very charismatic lead. Eggsy is the do-gooder of bad boys, with intelligence and wit.<br/><br/>The film's plot sets these two lovable characters on a collision course with megalomaniac villain Richard Valentine, portrayed in full-blown theatricality by Samuel L. Jackson in one of his most memorable roles to date. Valentine dresses very flashy, has a ridiculous lisp, and often speaks in simple terms, but is cunning and terrifyingly brilliant. Much like Jackson's performance, the over-the-top nature of Valentine is a facade to fool the world into thinking he is harmless. But as his outlandish plot unfolds- and it is easily one of the most ridiculous villain plots in a movie in a long time- we see how dangerous he can truly be, and the stakes are raised.<br/><br/>And that's why I loved Kingsman. Despite being cool, fun, and full of charismatic characters, Kingsman doesn't let its nature from overriding all the dynamics that make movies so enjoyable: it gives us characters we love to watch and care about, puts them in suspenseful situations. All this is achieved through the strong, but never self-indulgent, performances, led by director Matthew Vaughn, through selectively stylish, non-derivative cinematography, and a meta-script that knows what type of movie it is and pays respect to spy films. It is careful not to cross over into parody territory and allows itself to break the rules we come to expect in the genre.<br/><br/>Still, Kingsman is not perfect. Many of the characters that seem to get Eggsy into trouble are very generic, preppy teenage jerks. The character Roxie, who Eggsy has great chemistry with, gets less and less screen time as the film progresses and by the movie's end, doesn't feel very important in the grand scheme of things. There is also the stereotypical action-movie problem of bad guys who have no aim with their weapons, yet the heroes are master marksmen. This becomes very apparent in the movie's final action sequence, which also starts to drag after some time. There's never a dull moment in the movie, but towards the end I was starting to wonder when it actually would end.<br/><br/>These issues don't bog the movie down very much though, simply because it has too much going for it. There are lots of memorable action sequences; one is a gruesome, hilarious riot inside a Westboro-Baptist inspired hate-group church; another features secondary villain, Gazelle, a lethal amputee whose prosthetic metal legs act as blades that can slice a person in half with ease; another is an incredible skydiving training sequence with a terrifying twist. I was on the edge of my seat. Kingsman is not the type of movie that is going to get any accolades later this year, and while I do think it's a polarizing film, I think far more people will enjoy it than not. It's the type of movie that reminds us why we go to the movies: it gives us characters we can laugh with but believe in, keeps us on the edge of their seat as it continues to raise the stakes, and it never forgets to have fun. Kingsman is the first great movie this year.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Kingsman: The Secret Service is the gloriously fun and outrageous spy thriller I have always wanted. A delightful premise overcomes its hints of cheese fairly quickly, and evolves into a spy drama that evokes a lot of thrills, laughs and pulse-pounding excitement. <br/><br/>Of the cast, there is much to celebrate. Colin Firth is superb as the classy and ass-kicking spy who first introduces us to the world, Mark Strong is a magnificent Q to Taron Egerton's Bond, and Samuel L. Jackson's villain is one of Hollywood's most memorable characters in the last few years. Mark Hamill's cameo was a great deal of fun. The breakout stars, Taron Egerton and Sophie Cookson, are young actors I really want to see more of. And everyone in the film is darn likable. <br/><br/>The violence is refreshingly, a delightful reminder that after the watered down Hunger Games movies, some Hollywood directors still have the guts to be in your face. However, whilst the bloodbath in the church was a magnificent scene that I thoroughly enjoyed watching, the violence against women was a little too much for me. The story is amazing, with a credible villain motive and execution strategy, perfect highs and lows, and wonderfully fleshed out characters. The society of Kingsman are clearly thought out and the training is a delight to watch.<br/><br/>The main thing stopping this film getting a perfect 5/5 review is that tasteless and grossly immature anal sex jokes at the end. For a film selling itself on class, it just blew a lot of its good will. I could easily swallow the rest of the film's minor flaws - stupid exploding heads, easy to spot stunt men - but I have to knock Matthew Vaughn's film down a peg for being so immature.<br/><br/>But immaturity has its benefits, and for 99% of Kingsman's violent and ludicrously entertaining run time, I was loving it. Bring on the sequel."

","This is self aware cinema at its best, with nods toward old Bond movies the way they used to be. Especially with Roger Moore (even though Colin Firth is channelling David Niven's mannerism, the movie channels the Roger Moore era of Bond films more than anything else). The gadgets, the suits, the one liners, the impeccable unflinching gentlemen attitude, and even the perfectly choreographed gory and violent fight scenes, all point to one thing - it's a movie that doesn't simply knows it's a movie, it's a movie that wants us to know it knows. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and the firework's display is an obvious proof of that fact. But like all great movies that don't take themselves too seriously, it does it with all due professionalism. Acting, editing, cinematography and all other aspects of movie making are of the highest calibre. And plot twists are abundant - it's a real eye-feast that might be a start of a brand new franchise.

","This is one of the best, most original movies I have seen in a LONG time. The cast is incredible, the plot is original and very well executed. The story is full or twists and will have you on the edge of your seat. The villain in this movie could hold his own as a classic Bond villain, (minus the seriousness), and the fighting/action scenes are incredible and extremely fun to watch. The ending scene will have your eyes watering with laughter. As awesome as the trailers for this film are, they do not do it justice. They pretty much put as much into the trailers as they could and still get away with it, but the actual movie has so much more to offer than the trailers would let on. I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking to laugh while cringing at the same time. Parents!! Leave the kids at home!!!"

","Loved it! A super secret spy organization, not affiliated with any government, works behind the scenes to keep evil at bay. Headed by ""Arthur,"" and guided by ""Merlin,"" each of the agents who also have Arthurian codenames, conduct their own investigations into the seedy side of evil all over the globe. There are only so many seats at the round table, and so when agent Lancelot is killed, the first active agent in 17 years to die, the Kingsman begin recruiting his replacement from a group of young men and women. Our main character is Eggsy, who is sponsored by Galahad (Colin Firth), a young man who lacks many of the others social graces, coming across as a bit rough on the edges. The young men and women begin a very long job interview that is very rough and potentially fatal to weed out the lesser candidates and find the next agent worthy to sit at the round table. At the same time, Colin Firth's character, Harry Hart, codename Galahad, is tasked with finding out who, and why, Lancelot was killed. <br/><br/>Even thought it was R rated, I did take my two boys (7 and 9) and truly regret that decision. I know it was R...but I thought it was because of the violence and the language. For the most part, I was right. There was only one scene, in the last few minutes of this otherwise awesome flick, that ruined that expectation. I won't go into graphic depiction, but when Eggsy asks the female hostage if he can have a kiss if he frees her, she replies (in the trailer) ""I'll give you more than that,"" and he states, ""I'll be right back."" It's very funny in the trailer...but in the movie, she actually states exactly what she'll do to repay him...and that's where it got awkward with my children. So...if they weren't there, I would have a great time. If that scene wasn't in there, or cut short, it would have been a great time.<br/><br/>I find it hard to figure out if the movie works for an adult crowd, because the action scenes are cartoonish (mostly). There is a bit of blood and gore, but on one occasion, the blood and gore was replaced by pyrotechnics. If you've seen ""My Name is Nobody,"" and remember the scene with Henry Fonda shooting at the Wild Bunch, you'll understand what I mean. There are many references to spy movies and TV shows--James Bond, Bourne Identity, ""24"" and even ""Get Smart."" It's fun, almost a parody...and then it throws out the R-rated stuff. It could have been a much more accessible movie without that one scene...so I don't know why they are trying to limit their audience...weird."
"walkindude_2000","8","2","9","15 February 2015"," Action packed, fun ""popcorn"" movie
","Kingsman is one of those movies that just makes you lose yourself and forget about the world for two hours. It is not quite a spoof of classic spy movies, but it uses some of the archetypes, acknowledges it is using them, then gives them a little twist to make them unique for their use. I think all the actors fit their roles well, and it is refreshing to see Sam Jackson step out of the type of bad ass roles he has been cast in lately. The stop motion wire fighting is top notch, and every time the violence borders on going too far, something is done to lighten the mood a little. I think the only major issue I had is the use of the ""f-word,"" it not only bordered on over use, I don't think it fit all the characters. It could have been well used to differentiate the boys from the--well,from the Kingsman. All in all, a fun ride from start to finish."
"TheChicSpy","9","2","9","14 February 2015"," Every element of this movie is on par from casting to costuming.
","Etiquette has it's place, even in the world of espionage. ""A gentleman with manners waits to be seated and drinks martinis stirred with gin."" That's the sentiment of suave British spy Harry Hart (Colin Firth). His 'Manners make the man' philosophy is what drives him and his highly trained super spies in Kingsman: The Secret Service. He operates out of a tailor shop, sports custom suits, and has the moves of a ninja. In the film, Harry loses one of his agents while on a mission. Many years later, he encounters the misdirected son of the fallen agent and decides to take him under his wing. Apparently, it's just in time when the 'Kingsmen' are faced with battling an unknown evil that threatens to destroy the world.<br/><br/>There's nothing to not like about this film. The idea that ""Kingsman"" releases on Valentine's weekend made so much since to me after watching the film, because I fell in love with it within the first 30 minutes. Every element of this movie is on par from casting to costuming. Firth is superb as the calm, cool, and collected Harry Hart and the fresh face British actor Teron Egerton is believable as a troublesome teen, who Harry gives some much needed direction. The evil forces in this film are also smartly cast, with Samuel L. Jackson as Valentine, a lisping mega-millionaire tech maniac who has his sites on ruling the world. At his side is the stealthy and stoic Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) who gives the term 'blade runner' a new meaning as she flies through the air slicing and dicing anyone and anything in her path, with leg prosthetics that have blades for feet.<br/><br/>But what stands out most for this sartorial sleuth is the styling in this film. The tailor shop Harry runs is actually a front for the top secret headquarters of the 'Kingsmen' and it also contains the ultimate wardrobe arsenal. The fashion includes stylish pinstripe suits and shiny oxford shoes. When the wearer clicks their heels, they don't get transported home, but rather swiftly release a mini switch blade from the toe. The accessories are just as crafty including a see-through, bullet-proof umbrella, a watch that shoots tranquilizer darts, and a lighter that is a hand grenade. How can you lose with chic gadgetry like that!"
"smoidel-537-197497","7","2","9","14 February 2015"," Good movie but too violent
","I'd give this movie a 9 out of 10 if it was not for the gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>This movie has a great script, a great cast, good acting, but needs about 30 minutes chopped to be really great.<br/><br/>This script is fast paced with nods to some of the iconic spy film including of course James Bond. Surprisingly there were also some elements from the one TV show that Ian Fleming did. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. in the 1960s was originally titled Ian Fleming's Man form U.N.C.L.E.<br/><br/>Where the movie fails is the level of violence. Scenes showing necessary violence to advance the plot go on much too long.<br/><br/>Colin Firth was great as a classic Ian Fleming style agent. He would have made a great James Bond. Taron Egerton is excellent as a young man Firth mentors.<br/><br/>Mark Strong who has a ""Q"" like roll and Michael Caine who plays the ""M"" like role in the movie are also excellent.<br/><br/>If you like James Bond or the Man from U.N.C.L.E you should like this movie."

","When I first saw the trailer for Kingsman, I thought it looked completely over the top, yet over the top enough that it'd be a fun and enjoyable movie to see. Boy was I right.<br/><br/>In the movie one of the characters says ""Nowadays (spy movies) are all a little serious for my taste. Give me a far-fetched theatrical plot any day."" Well, the movie basically explained itself right there, and it worked perfectly. A far-fetched plot with highly entertaining action sequences, cool gadgets, and great humor. After three straight 007 movies with what, two gadgets total in them? it was great to see that kind of fun creativity in a spy movie again. Kingsman is like James Bond meets Mission Impossible meets Quentin Tarantino. Who wouldn't wanna see that?<br/><br/>Kingsman goes where most action/spy movies don't attempt to go anymore, and they had a lot of fun with it. It's entertaining from beginning to end and is definitely worth seeing."

There are a lot of cool gadgets! And Colin Firth! Wow.. his style is impeccable, he has a style, very gentleman and lethal. He can really portrait the international spy with suave. And Taron Egerton is not bad. He can play the green spy accurately. The story is not bad, there is a little twist at the end. For the villain, Samuel L. Jackson is spectacular, he can be very entertaining and twisted at the same time. The action is non-stop and original. Overall, this movie is very recommended!!"
"stevendbeard","8","2","9","13 February 2015"," If You Like Bond....
","I saw ""Kingsman:The Secret Service"", starring Colin Firth-The King's Speech, Mamma Mia!; Taron Egerton-Testament of Youth, The Smoke_tv; Sofia Boutella-Streetdance 2, Dance Challenge; Samuel L. Jackson-Nick Fury in almost all of the Marvel movies, Unbreakable and Michael Caine- Alfred in the Dark Knight movies, On Deadly Ground.<br/><br/>This is based on a comic book series called The Secret Service and is directed by Matthew Vaughn-X-Men:First Class, Kick-Ass, Layer Cake. If you like Bond, James Bond, then you should love this one-I know I do and I did. Colin plays a Kingsman, a secret agent that works for her majesty's secret service in London. They work out of a tailor shop- anyone remember The Man From U.N.C.L.E.? FYI: There is a new movie based on that old t.v. show that is coming out in August. Michael plays the leader of the Kingsman and starts up a recruitment drive after their ranks are seriously depleted. Colin sponsors Taron, and all the candidates have to go through some rigorous training and learn how to use all kinds of Bondian gadgets; exploding lighters, guns that shoot different types of ammunition, bullet-proof umbrellas and of course, the blade in the shoe gimmick that was used so well in From Russia With Love. And what would a good spy movie be without a good villain? Samuel plays that part and he has it covered, with a speech impediment-he talks with a lisp-and he also hates violence-he actually gets sick at the sight of blood. Samuel's master plan is to kill most of the population; he thinks thinning the herd will be better for the planet and the eco system. Sofia plays Samuel's enforcer that goes by the name of Gazelle- mainly because of the way she moves and she has prosthetic sharp blades for legs, which she uses quite often-evidently, she has no problem with the sight of blood. There is a lot of humor along with the tributes to everything that is Bond and the music is good, too-I remember hearing some Lynyrd Skynyrd during the church massacre scene. Oh yeah, see if you recognize Professor Arnold, one of the first people that is kidnapped by Samuel. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including some nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes. I am a big Bond fan and really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."

A great see!... the only thing that I felt was really stupid and really bad in the movie... like really really bad... was the FAKE LISP from Samuel L. Jackson aka Valentine. It was really bad acting and a crazy opprobrious preconceived discriminatory view of men that are not as masculine as others... Men who are less masculine in their actions do not mean they have to talk with a silly fake lisp... pronouncing their S's like a TH sound. What silly acting on Samuel L. Jackson's part. The movie got an 8 from me... but Samuel L. Jackson's acting should have a -5. It was the worst acting I had ever seen him perform in any movie.

Usually I avoid all movies with a lot of violence in it and only went to see the Kingsman because I saw an interview with Colin Firth and just could not imagine him as an action star and wanted to see it for myself.<br/><br/>I have to say I laughed through the whole film. It was impossible for me to take the fight scenes seriously, they were so exaggerated that it reminded me of fight scenes in Asterix and Obelix, the only comic books I ever read. <br/><br/>I liked the dystopian message of the film. Control through the little electronic device nobody is able to be without anymore. I can imagine that some corporation will give people free phones and internet access in order to watch their every move and control them.

Anyway, despite how spectacularly absurd the whole thing is, there's actually some pretty good writing and acting in here. Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson in particular deliver some outstanding performances. Lot of people might take issue with how over-the-top violent it can get, so if you're sensitive to that sort of thing maybe pass on this, but personally it didn't get to me that much. There's a scene later on in the movie that nearly killed me with laughter over just how ludicrous it was."
"griffolyon12","9","2","9","13 February 2015"," A Spoiler-Free Review
","At once a slick spy movie in the Sixties' James Bond mold, while also being a satire of those films, Kingsman: The Secret Service reminds me of films like Hot Fuzz in how it sends up the tropes of a genre by making a good movie in that genre at the same time. The Kingsmen are an independent spy organization modeled after the ideals of being a gentleman and protecting others. Director Matthew Vaughn delivers more of what he is known for here, slick visuals, kinetic action sequences, and a fair amount of blood spatter, and yet I found myself not only entertained but emotionally involved as well. A large part of the film's success in those regards is the relationship between Colin Firth's Kingsman named Galahad and his twenty-something protégé, Taron Egerton's Eggsy who goes from a street kid to Kingsman all in the course of a two hour movie. The bottom line is, you wind up liking all of the characters because Vaughn cast the right actors in each of the roles, I mean, Samuel L. Jackson is so charismatic as the Bondish bad guy Valentine that you almost want him to succeed. While had this film dialed down the blood and usage of the f-word it could have easily achieved a PG-13 rating, compared to a lot of other action movies in the modern era, this one is almost tame (key word, almost). Truth be told, none of the gratuity of this film bothered me as much as other movies made in a similar vein, and a large part of that is that the film never really lingers on anything gratuitous, it just kind of moves on with the story, focusing more so on the characters and what's happening with them. So at the end of the day, if you enjoy a good spy movie, or simply an action movie with likable characters and some clever laughs interspersed throughout, Kingsman: The Secret Service will more than satisfy.<br/><br/>I give Kingsman: The Secret Service a 9 out of 10!"
"MisterSaxon","8","2","9","8 February 2015"," Flawed But Fun
","I watched this last night and had an absolute blast with it. Even if you takes Kingsman only at face value and see it purely as a riff on Bond movies, it works incredibly well. Matthew Vaughan brings such verve and energy to his scenes that it's difficult not to be caught up in the flow and I love the little touches, such as the way he uses a snow globe in a London flat to shift scenes to a remote frozen mountain. Jane Goldman also deserves due credit for her script, which is a lot sharper than many others which have tried to do the same thing. I've never read the comic on which this based but, if nothing else, she turned something that a lot of people apparently disliked into something that should have widespread appeal.<br/><br/>I really really liked Colin Firth in this and it's been a while since I could say that about him. I think the surprise factor is another reason why this movie worked so well for me – I was genuinely surprised at how excited I got when Firth showed up on the screen. I will admit to letting out a genuine sigh of disappointment when he got killed and I'm sure I wasn't the only one in the audience. I should have seen that scene coming. It's pretty essential for almost apprentice-mentor story when the mentor is killed and the apprentice must rise to the occasion. And yet I didn't. Or at least I didn't want to.<br/><br/>It's a testament to Taron Egerton that I was as invested in Eggsy's story as I was. Amusingly, there were a group of boys not dis- similar to Eggsy in my cinema row and I initially wrote them off as potential disruptions to my cinema experience. It probably didn't help that the first trailer was for Fifty Shades Of Grey and so they laughed quite loudly at it (which is, well, understandable). But, once that movie began, they didn't make a sound (other than laughing in the right places) and, after it finished, I heard one of them declare that the movie was ""pretty sweet"" (which I assume meant that he liked it). I think that's a good parallel for the movie which suggests we're all so much more than what's on the surface. As a Brit, the discussions on class probably said a little bit more to me than they would to some international cinema-goers. My friend, who saw the movie with me, argued that Eggsy should have been black, which I dismissed because then it would have brought race into the mix and that's a whole different kettle of fish. Eggsy needed to be white to show that he was the same as everyone else in that room, bar the circumstances of his birth.<br/><br/>Also: How great was it to see Mark Hamill back on the big screen, but wielding an English accent? I was oddy giddy about that.<br/><br/>This was actually my first visit to the cinema this year and it was a great way to re-introduce myself to the experience. I have Jupiter Ascending lined up for next week and, if it's anywhere near as enjoyable as this, I can see 2015 being a good year for myself and cinema. As one of my audience members remarked last night, that's pretty sweet."
"jasperjfcs","6","2","9","8 February 2015"," Overall, it's a fun movie
","I've only ever reviewed one movie on IMDb but after seeing this movie I just had to talk about it. I'm a film maker myself. It's my dream to become a famous film director working on superhero movies for all ages in Hollywood. But of course there are kinds of films I don't like. I tend to faint to the sight of gore and this movie had quite a lot in it.<br/><br/>The trailer for this movie is what got my hyped. It looked so badass and fun. It was also a very interesting idea of a movie to me and the trailer music was fantastic. So today I saw it with a few friends and I did have to leave at one point because I felt a bit light headed. I knew the director of this movie directed Kick-Ass and I know what's in that movie so I expected the violence but I read reviews before I saw it everyone says the violence is terrible CGI and I do kind of agree but it's action violence so in a way they make it look fun but the slow motion violence and the points where they take it too far just made me light headed. The kinds of films I do not like are ones with an overload of violence shoved in our faces, constant teenage swearing and deaths that are just so blunt and cold. Lots of movies made like that get the high ratings these days and I really don't understand how people can love a movie with that stuff. If they say they love it cos it's realistic then I think to myself ""My life isn't like this. I don't have sex with people I met a few minutes ago, I don't kill people brutally with sword legs, I don't swear in practically every sentence. How is that kind of stuff loved so much?!""<br/><br/>But anyway, on to the aspects I liked. I really loved the whole idea of a secret service of spies fighting for their country, I loved the fighting techniques (without the ones that result in blood parades) but most of all I loved the cinematography, editing of shots, weapons, costumes and score. I really think that if this got rid of most of swearing to just allow the same amount of profanity in Marvel movies, the blunt deaths, cold people and actually showing the gory violence than I would have rated this movie a 9 or 10. I just think not shoving the violence in our faces and instead suggesting the violence and letting it happen off camera but we still know what has been done like Alfred Hitchcock did in his violent scenes in his films then it would have been much more powerful in my opinion. I would have also preferred the excessive violence that went to far to remain out of the movie. I have a feeling people will call me a sook or a baby or something because I'm not a fan of gut fests so please note this is just my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fun movie and I think I will see it again when it comes out on DVD. 7/10"
"The-Sarkologist","8","2","9","8 February 2015"," Another enjoyable spy movie spoof
","One thing about movies set in London is that they tend to grab a part of me that reminds me of the times that I have visited the city. In a way I feel a stronger connection with London now that I have been there than I have in times past. However, while most of the movie is set in London, we are taken to other places, such as the secluded hideout of the arch villain, though unlike many of the other spy movies that I have seen, Kingsmen does not take you to all that many exotic places (actually it doesn't take you to any).<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, and in fact it is quite enjoyable. The premise is that there is a secret organisation that is not connected to any particular government which enables it to act in the interests of humanity as opposed to any particular nation or political party. The Kingsmen are top secret, meaning that the only time anybody ever hears of them is when they are born, get married, and die. In fact their operations, even the successful ones, do not even make it into the newspapers (though it is interesting that the newspaper that is referred to is The Sun, which I suspect isn't one of those newspapers that anybody should really pay any attention).<br/><br/>As with any spy movie, we have an arch villain with a diabolical plan to remake the world in his own image, and it is up to the Kingsmen to stop him. However this is where their independence comes into play because this particular villain has his fingers in an awful of lot pies. Mind you, even though we aren't supposed to like the villain, this particular one was downright annoying. I guess it was the nature of the film though because while it is not satire in the traditional sense, it is still a spoof.<br/><br/>Kingsmen focuses around a young drop out named Egsy, who happens to be the son of another Kingsman that was killed in action when he was a baby. More recently another Kingsman is killed in action, which opens up a spot, meaning that the remaining ones bring in potential candidates, and thus we have the candidates attempting to pass the tests as a team, and also excelling so that they are chosen. This is where I had a bit of some difficulty with the film because it seemed as if they were trying to cram too much into the film, and it seemed to jump from the plot where they were trying to track and outsmart the villain to the training. It wasn't until the training came to an end that the film actually began to flow a lot better.<br/><br/>As I said, this is a spoof of the James Bond movies, and it quite amusing in parts, however there were problems, and as I said, the arch villain really, really annoyed me."
"alice-authorbooks-ogorma","6","2","9","6 February 2015"," Good Movie, but Horrifying Ending
","Interesting, just there are some parts which are just too much for me.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I'm the sort of person that sees things that other people don't, but the ending is just too terrifying. It has good morals such as it doesn't matter what your upbringing is to make a difference, or that we need to help the earth before it's too late, but the stuff near the end makes you wonder exactly how many people died due to the villain's plan. Also, it's revealed that the British Royal Family (the list says all their names) accept the villain's plan. Just...think about that during the implant scene near the end. On the whole, it is a perfect subversion of spy movies and gentleman spies, but those with a weak stomach might not like the church scenes or the ending."
"PyroSikTh","7","2","9","3 February 2015"," Bloody Hilarious and Hilariously Bloody
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is literally the lovechild of classic James Bond and Matthew Vaughn's own Kick-Ass. It's about a super secret agency that sends spies around the world to take down eccentric and bizarre supervillains that live in mountain bases. They have lighter grenades, umbrella guns, and poison-tipped knives in their shoes, but above all they're also suave, upper class toffs. It's James Bond all over again. However, add in the swearing, blood and ultra-violence, truck-load of black humour, and copious amounts of pop culture references and self-mocking tone from Kick-Ass and you get Kingsman.<br/><br/>The kind of comedy you get here is very dark. If you don't find violence or gore funny, you won't be laughing much. Whether it's the amputee with swords for legs, or implants that cause heads to explode into colourful fireworks, there's plenty to go around. To be honest, I was actually taken quite aback by it all. I know it's Matthew Vaughn (and a 15), but I never expected it to be quite so bold and unapologetic. I mean the opening lines are ""Oh s***, we f***ed up."" And not long after, a guy is cleaved in half. It's unrelenting as the movie goes on as well.<br/><br/>There is a little bit of wit on display as well though. It's not all about the violence. There's a lot of tongue-in-cheek references that almost break the fourth wall, like the recurring line ""It's not that kind of movie."" And Eggsy's choice of dog name being representative of three of the biggest spies in pop culture (JB is the dog's name, and he's asked whether it's after James Bond, Jason Bourne, or Jack Bauer).<br/><br/>If there was particularly a weak point in the movie, it would probably be the CGI. In this day and age there's really no excuse for bad CGI. The opening titles are done in a really imaginative and integrated way, but the CGI used to do it looks really obvious. There's explosions from a brick building, and the bricks crumble, tumble and form into the words of the titles. Then the camera zooms into one of the windows. Unfortunately this scene is rife with CGI that looks like it was rendered in the 90s and just looks plain awful. There's no real effort to try and make the bricks blend in with the rest of the wall at all, and the way they tumble down and form into the words reeks of a cheap video game. It gets better later on, but for an opening, it doesn't leave a particularly good impression.<br/><br/>The other thing that didn't really rub right for me was the split personality of the film. Kick-Ass managed to hit a happy medium between being over-the-top and being grounded. It was horrifically good fun, but also tugged on the heartstrings and always felt completely natural. Kingsman on the other hand, you can tell they've aimed for the same kind of thing, but the mix just doesn't sit right. It's got the language and violence for adults, but the core of the movie feels like Spy Kids. It's over-the-top in the wrong kind of way, which is the point; it's to make fun of those classic spy films, but it just didn't mix particularly well in my opinion. It would be lighthearted, then super violent, then serious and dramatic, and there was no real transition to ease us into the new feel. It didn't ruin the movie by any means, don't get me wrong, it just prevented it from quite being the masterpiece Kick-Ass was.<br/><br/>Kingsman is certainly a very fun movie, full of lots of great actors, old and new alike. It's brave and unapologetic in it's mockery and depiction of violence, and that makes it an extremely entertaining watch, despite it's faults. It's bloody hilarious, and hilariously bloody. I give Kingsman an enjoyable 7/10, and would definitely recommend it to those that enjoy ultra- violence depicted in a lighthearted manner."

","Kingsman the secret service is a movie filled with action violence comedy and so much more its not like James bond movies where most spy movie fans originated their love for the genre its unique and that's why i love it. Amazing performances from Colin Firth and Taren Egerton who was a new comer to Hollywood and this was his first movie. Sofia Boutella was great as Gazelle and the stand out performance was from Samuel L Jackson as the bad guy Valentine who was threatening and funny at the same time kinda like Dr Evil. Overall Kingsman the secret service was an amazing movie with the potential to do some amazing things and hopefully this series will grow."
"allisonkooyman","10","1","3","25 September 2017"," Review
","As someone who is a huge fan of action movies, this is definitely one that i would watch over and over again. When the movie began I was hoping it was going to be another Quentin Tarantino type film. The story is of a young rebel, Eggsy, who is recruited to face multiple challenges in order to be welcomed into Kingsman. Colin Firth did a fabulous job as the mentor of Eggsy. He shows him the ropes and acts like the father that Eggsy lost as a child. All the action and fight scenes are so well choreographed and makes the whole movie on the edge of your seat hoping that none of the characters die or get injured. The shots remind me of ""Birdman"", many of the scenes (especially fight scenes) are filmed in one shot and it takes a long time to execute it. The director also made the lighting bright to show every move the characters were making. Another reason this movie does so well is the story line, the idea behind the story is very strange and different. I love when stories are wildly different. It is more intriguing to watch and learn what happens next. If there was an award to give for best cinematography and story, Kingsman: The Secret Service, should win every award. The writers were not afraid to be bold and the director knew hoe he wanted things filmed and how to show the life of a rebellious and young Eggsy become a fine spy from the teachings and life lessons from his mentor and step in father, Harry (Colin Firth). Personally, the film tops any Tarantino film. I would watch this every time it came on."

","The adaptation of Mark Millar's off-the-wall spy comedy came to life with comedy and action under the brilliant direction of Matthew Vaughn. The film begins with two prologues, one that shows the Kingsman spy group including Harry Hart (Colin Firth) aka Galahad and Merlin (Mark Strong) assaulting a terrorist spy group only to lose a member to a suicide bomber. Another agent Lancelot (Jack Davenport) completes his training during this mission but is killed in the second prologue seventeen years later on a mission in Argentina to save Professor Arnold (Mark Hamill). The deadly Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) sliced Lancelot in half at the behest of her boss Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who is afraid of blood and disgusted by violence. The recruiting process for a new Kingsman begins including the grown-up son of the agent that died years ago, Eggsy (Taron Egerton).<br/><br/>Eggsy is a troublemaker living with his mom and her abusive boyfriend. He steals the car from thugs but ends up in jail needing help. He calls the number on a mysterious medallion and says ""Oxford, not brogues"". He's let out of prison and picked up by Harry who shows him his fighting skills in the pub when the same thugs try to bully Eggsy. Galahad recruits Eggsy into the new process by scaring off Eggsy's abusive stepfather using a microphone in a bug. At the Kingsman tailor shop, Harry shows Eggsy the potential of the secret service agency. Underground, Harry and Eggsy travel across England and Eggsy joins the recruiting process.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","The film Kingsman: The secret service stars Taron Egerton as Egsy, a boy who's father died while training for the kingsman. He then grows up with his mom and stepdad who is a drunk criminal. Partly because of that and other reasons Egsy throws his life away until Galahad picks him up to take part in the same program his father did. Egsy turns out to be one of the best candidates despite not being from a wealthy snob family. When he and Roxy, another candidate, are the only two left they have to shoot their dog and Egsy refuses. By this decision he doesn't become the successor of Lancelot but he later finds out that there is a big plot to be coming, a plot where Galahad died for.

","OK, I need to chill out a bit and stop being too analytical<br/><br/>When it kinda seems to not fit into science fiction, then I tend to be more critical about what could happen in real life.<br/><br/>This film is science fiction all day long and I should chill. I should let what happens in Marvel films happen in this. There is no difference.<br/><br/>Perhaps its the Britishness of it all, and I am British. <br/><br/>Colin Firth is so cool, I could put him in my whiskey glass.<br/><br/>I've seen Mark Strong in better roles to be honest.<br/><br/>The thugs in the gang in the pub don't seem realistic. Seem like nice boys really. Weird film all round from a casting point of view.<br/><br/>A lot of the actors would be in some budget 20K British film foundation production. A lot of the actors would be in a 200M Hollywood production.<br/><br/>Its that strange mix of actors that didn't fit for me.<br/><br/>Perhaps I cant spot a crap American actor and I am just critical of British ones.<br/><br/>I quite liked the Chav Eggsy who plays the main role really. Its kinda through his eyes. Its him you are routing for and I was, so it worked. That was a show stopper if I didn't get that, and I did.<br/><br/>Forget the nay-sayers on the violence. They clearly haven't watched The Walking Dead lol. There is no violence in the film. Its acting people! Fake blood and CGI. No one really died. They took their pay cheque and payed the bills.<br/><br/>I didn't get one thing and one thing only. At the end, when Eggsy is talking to the Swedish princess through the cell door, she makes him a promise which makes him promise to come back. I really don't get why that was left in. Didn't make any sense to the ""Bond gets the girl"" homage to 007. See what you think.<br/><br/>Summary.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it. I will watch the new one too. I think I was confused where it sat. Is it a Marvel film? Is it a James Bond spoof? Is it a James Bond genre? Is it a low budget British film.<br/><br/>Thats where it didn't nail it for me."
"Mohican15","8","1","3","22 September 2017"," Chaotic, funny, fresh, action-packed and highly enjoyable!
","MATTHEW MAKETH FILM! For some one who grew up with Mr. Connery as 007: swaggering around with his Beretta, the iconic ladies man and never daring to swear, I went in to this film, more than a little skeptical but I am very happy to say that I was NOT LET DOWN AT ALL! <br/><br/>Kingsman: The Secret Service is a hugely enjoyable ride and I was hooked from the word ""action"". <br/><br/>Kingsman has a lot of the things we've come to expect from most modern-day films: explosive action, swearing, famous faces, end-of-the-world plans and so on, and though Kingsman does indeed have all those things, what it does is it keeps you gripped from the very start! <br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn's directing on this giant project is brilliant! Choreographing huge, bloody and explosive actions scenes like the devastating Church massacre, end-of- the-world carnage or the NOW famous pub brawl! But as well as putting together some really brilliant action scenes, Vaughn also really gets the best out of his cast! <br/><br/>Every member is on TOP FORM! Colin Firth delivers a brilliant, charismatic and highly enjoyable performance as Agent Harry Hart: a character totally different to what he's used to, and for those of you out there who think all Firth can do is act posh and wear a top hat, YOU ARE WRONG! Firth seriously gets in on the action! <br/><br/>But enough about him, Taron Egerton delivers a very well-acted and authentic performance as Eggsy! Egerton plays the slightly yobbo chav very well but he also plays a character who cares deeply for his loved ones and knows the difference of right and wrong! The only criticism I have about Egerton's character (and this applies to the rest of the cast): and that is that there is rather too much swearing! <br/><br/>Now I know the odd f*** and sh** is sometimes rather funny but the swearing in this film rather goes over the top and there were a few points where I wanted to say ""Oh wash your mouth-out!"" <br/><br/>But this was all minor for a film that really delivered! <br/><br/>Enjoyable, charismatic, funny and authentic performances from the whole cast! The great Mr. L Jackson is brilliant as the lisping megalomaniac and delivers the performance with real zest and really gets his inner Bond villain on! Very enjoyable performances from co-stars too! Strong is great and (as always) delivers a very strong performance! Authentic performances by Sofia Boutella, Sir Michael Caine and Jack Davenport as well. <br/><br/>There is also a hilarious performance turned in by the great Mark Hamill. However, unfortunately his is more of a cameo but still very fun! <br/><br/>The scenes are brilliantly acted out by everyone but obviously this is partly down to the script, courtesy of Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn himself! I can wholeheartedly say that the pair deliver a both funny, clever, and dramatic script! <br/><br/>This film is more of a action-flick in terms of tension and can sometimes feel predictable but it still keeps you hooked from the very beginning! <br/><br/>All these factors propel the film to it's finish, the cataclysmic world VS itself battle and though this is a devastating idea, it is very amusingly uplifted by the soundtrack of KC and the Sunshine band with ""Baby Give it Up""! <br/><br/>So, like I've said: all these factors, combined together, produce a really enjoyable and pretty cool film! Obviously it has it's downs, (the swearing and it being more than a little smutty-the princess!) but I think that the good points, firmly out- weigh the bad! <br/><br/>A real fun and fresh movie! Roll on the Golden Circle!"

"MovieSoup","8","1","3","22 September 2017"," Really good film but bad supporting cast
","Kingsmen is a film filled with loads of funny jokes and great characters. The best thing about this film is how clever and stupid it seems to be. That may sound like a bad thing but let me explain. The film deviates from all spy films by having great jokes like a villain who is scared of blood and hero who is a wannabe gangster which makes it refreshing and clever. The stupidity comes from the ridiculous scenes that are a parody of spy thrillers like James Bond and the Bourne series. These parody scenes work so well with all the clever scenes and the self-awareness the film has with itself. <br/><br/>The film follows spy movie conventions as there is a bad guy who wants to take over the world and the spy is sent to stop him from destroying earth with a virus of some kind. The bare bones are then layered with incredible characters and great, tasteful humour. <br/><br/>All of the characters in this film are great and while I had some problems with the supporting cast I thought all of the main actors did a great job and portrayed good strong characters that all contribute to the plot and move it forward to a satisfactory conclusion. I think some honourable mentions go to what I would call ""the main guys""<br/><br/>Colin Firth as Harry Hart is just such a great casting choice. He emulates a level headed spy who is just great at his job and fights with the class that the kingsmen agency is all about. Firth has not got a lot of comic lines but the action scenes he has are the best I have seen in a film in a long time. The ""manners maketh the man"" scene is brilliant and is so well choreographed that it is hands down the best action scene in the movie with the possible exception of the church scene. <br/><br/>Taron Egerton who plays Eggsy is really good in this movie also. He plays a wannabe gangster really well and we see during the film how he changes into a man who understands that actions have consequences. He has a lot of joke lines in this film and they work in the film so well. Some movies, like Ghostbusters 2016 will stop the plot to tell a joke however this movie has the right flow and a good quality script so that the plot is intertwined with the jokes. Egerton does a good job of acting like a chav turned spy would act. <br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson as Valentine makes this movie for me. Having a villain who is grossed out by blood and violence is an inspired idea and Jackson does great work in this film and actually gave a sh^t about the character he was playing. Valentine has a legitimate reason for killing the population as he is worried about man's effect on the environment and has to save the planet by culling the population. This bit in the plot smells a little bit like Dan Brown's Inferno to be quite honest.<br/><br/>However you soon get over that by how goofy and charismatic Valentine is, with his lisp and his love of McDonalds coupled with a good Dom Perignon to go along with it. The jokes that he has are masterful and I love how he remarks (in the film) that this is not an ordinary spy film. Honestly I think Valentine is the best character in the film.<br/><br/>The supporting characters like Eggsy's mom and the drunk, abusive stepdad are the worst characters in the film. Chiefly because the actors playing them can't act and are very wooden in their performances. Even when the stepdad is being all manipulative and controlling the mom you never really believe in the performances they give and it adds such a different and violently sad tone to this movie that I actually wished they had not had so much screen time. Their parts you can just ignore anyway so it doesn't completely ruin the film but it does take you out of it due to their unrealistic and boring performances. <br/><br/>From a technical point of view I think the movie works well with a lot of great camera work creating some good visuals and decent CGI. There was CGI blood which is never done realistically and in this film there are BAD CG blood moments but they didn't take me out of the film a lot and did not make me enjoy the action sequences any less. <br/><br/>There were some bad camera panning where the camera would pan up and then to the right to show movement of characters from one place to another scene. However this was not used a lot and I can only think it was used in the train scene where Eggsy and Harry go to kingsmen headquarters. <br/><br/>The music in this is used very well as a way of making the audience feel and adding emotion to a scene that needs a little umph. There are some great songs used in this movie and they all make sense in the points of the plot that they are used so well done whoever was in charge of sound in this film. <br/><br/>All in all this film does have a few flaws and bad actors and crap CG blood use but its good points are really good. Great characters and great humour make this a film worth seeing and I advise you to go see it on DVD or download. It is worth it."

","I think this is the fifth movie or so of Matthew Vaughn and he doesn't stops surprising me. With only four movies more, he has already made many different genres and he has show that he has a real ability of creating and filming. And this movie isn't less.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Eggsy (Taron Egerton) a young unrefined boy who suddenly gets recruited by a ultra-secret spy agency called Kingsman, where is father had been working until he was killed. The story is very entertaining and it has some very funny moments that will keep you watching it. (For example the fireworks-head-blowing scene).<br/><br/>Taron Egerton is a newcomer in here but he does it very well. He is able to introduce you in the world of Kingsman like a normal person would you (being like WTF is this?). Colin Firth as Harry Hart is also very good providing one of the most hardcore scenes of an action film in a long time (it involves a church from Kentucky). Samuel L Jackson as the villain Richmond Valentine was also great and very funny with his strange accent and his phobia to blood. And a special mention to Mark Strong, a usual collaborator in many Matthew Vaughn films, who here plays the role of Merlin, one of the main technicians of the Kingsman agency.<br/><br/>The visuals were amazing. Matthew Vaughn is not afraid of showing blood when necessary, but not in a disgusting way, just making us have a good time and he truly delivers it. The scene of Eggsy infiltrating in Valentine's Lair or the pub fight with Harry at the beginning are one of the best action moments I have seen in a long time. And to this you have to add an amazing score created by Henry Jackman & Matthew Margeson, also frequent collaborators, who here create an epic, action-packed, heroic score, with parts with a clear homage to classic spy-action movies, like the pub fight music, as well as it is done in the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn does not stop surprising me and here delivers a very funny, entertaining, violent and crazy spy adventure that you won't regret watching it, I'm sure.<br/><br/>""Manners Maketh Man"""

But I love background stories, stories where guys are legends, someone who deserves to be remembered. Remember John Wick background story? Just like that.<br/><br/>Acting was good, fight scenes even better, but Samuel L.

"cherold","7","1","3","16 September 2016"," entertaining movie that doesn't always know when enough is enough
","Is this a spoof? I can see why it's getting described this way, but Kingsman isn't really all that different from its James Bond source material. Yes, there's the occasional mocking reference to James Bond, but the overall effect is more a slightly cheekier James Bond clone than an actual spoof. It's also not more than mildly amusing.<br/><br/>But it is entertaining, mainly because of some terrific action scenes, some of which involve a woman amputee with swords instead of feet. These scenes are beautifully choreographed and often involve finding imaginative ways to knife and shoot people.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie is a little too in love with this stuff. At a certain point no amount of fancy choreography could distract me from the feeling that I had just seen something similar 15 minutes ago.<br/><br/>The story is a rather messy one involving an evil billionaire fought by a mysterious spy organization made up primarily of lookalike square-jawed upper-class white guys bravely considering hiring a lookalike square-jawed lower-class white guy or a square-jawed upper-class white woman (who isn't lookalike because there's no one in the movie for her to look like).<br/><br/>I kept wondering if the movie would make some sort of comment on the archaic nature of the organization, but since it didn't one tends to assume that the makers see nothing wrong with a powerful, secretive organization of white preppy guys. It makes an interesting contrast with the only important black character being a terrible person.<br/><br/>Outside of that, I didn't really think much about the politics of Kingsman, but reviews like The Guardian's point out that it's pretty right wing overall. But because the movie is about 10% reactionary politics and about 80% stabbing people in the eye (the other 10% is for male bonding and dog walking) it's easy to ignore all that. <br/><br/>For me, the issue with the movie is not its politics but it's inability to curtail its impulses. Watching a guy stylishly kill about a 100 people at once is pretty entertaining for about the first 25 people, and then feels like punishment. Cutting between a big action scene and a suspenseful high-altitude sequence sucks much of the pleasure out of both. The final battle's disco concept is clever but the flashy lights take away from the action.<br/><br/>Still, Kingsman works more often than not, and while it's not consistently great, it has a decent mix of great and good moments and not that many bad ones. So overall, if you want mindless, violent action, this is worth watching."

Well thanks to this movie and the mission impossible franchise I just learned something about myself, I freaking love spy movies. This film is based off a graphic Novel by Mark Milliar and at the time of it's released was getting lots of buzz. Kingsman: The Secret Service tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. When i first saw commercial's for this movie I thought it looked just like some generic bad action movie that comes out early in the year. The film manages to be a blast from start to finish, and for a great action with some the best action sequences i've seen in a while this year, it's pretty freaking hilarious. The story is like any great spy movie but with some fun twists and turns homages to Bond, Jason Bourne and Jack Bower. The best thing about it was the villains plan and when he uses his chips on the people church it gives us the best action sequence in the movie. Samuel L. Jackson should play villains more often because my goodness he is loads of fun to watch as a villain, just don't bring up that movie he was in where he played a villain based on a comic(The Spirit), Colin Firth was pretty damn awesome he's like the badass you want in any movie rolled into Ewan Mcgregor.

"picassomanhdan","7","1","3","8 September 2016"," A good laugh
","I don't really have many thoughts for this film; it's a commercial family film that has garnered worldwide popularity. Yet I would still like to pen down some comments as this film really stands out from other comedy films that experience degrading quality.<br/><br/>Firstly, I love the fact that this film is UK-based. There's something royal, traditional and prestigious about high societies in UK, a thing that US societies could hardly achieve (of course except for The Great Gatsby...). It places a huge emphasis on the part of being a gentleman, a brilliant story telling device. <br/><br/>I would say that the plot is not new: a kid with a deceased dad grows up to be a excellent spy that successfully saves the world. However, the way the story is narrated does much justice to the film's success. The humour intertwined with action scenes and humanitarian aspects harness every angle of the film. <br/><br/>The only thing that I don't quite like about the film is that the objectification of women. Even though it's only to add humour to the film, I would prefer the director break the tradition and bring in a fresh air to the spies films where women do not solely serve as awards for men. Well, it does make a female to become the new Lancelot, but she is much overshadowed by Eggsy anyway. Furthermore, she is depicted as a smart but rather diffident woman."

Those who cannot build substantial characters and plots, substitute with profanity, vulgarity, and weak special effects. I am disappointed that Michael Caine, Colin Firth, and Samuel L. Jackson even gave this script a second glance. I was warned not to spend even $1.50 at the discount theater on this one, but I just have to see if I like a film for myself. I'm sorry I wasted a Netflix choice on this one. Trust me, don't bother."

Truly an insult to the actors' potential; this film is additionally a waste of their opportunity and talent. Ending the film with an anal sex scene between Taron Edgerton's character and a Scandinavian princess who was widowed no less than ten minutes beforehand, Vaughn spits in the face of any who call out his obtuse morality.

He is also surrounded by British thespians Jack Davenport, Michael Caine, and Mark Strong. All of whom give outstanding performances. I had the honor of seeing this movie and I would definitely recommend to others. Young kids should NOT see this movie because it is rated R and full of strong language including the F word.

","I had high hopes for it. The trailers promised a fun entertaining spy story that takes modern Bond's seriousness, and adds a bit of Austin Powers' silly humor.<br/><br/>The fighting were fun and entertaining. Sharp, crisp, quick, and clean. The kingsman showed what it was to be a level above the others. Everybody did great. EDIT: I just found out I've missed a whole sequence of in-church fighting due to Indonesian censorship. Bummer.<br/><br/>The evil plot: out of this world, and yet.. understandable. Sam L.

And he was scared of blood.<br/><br/>The downside: some of the jokes were... well.. unfunny, especially at the end with the *SPOILER ALERT* head explosions and butt f***. The explosions were done as a joke, with every head blowing up in sync and Technicolor to match the fireworks music. I kinda cringed at this.<br/><br/>The offer from Princess Tilde was completely out of the blue. And the fact that young agent Eggsy accepted enthusiastically was very uncharacteristic of the young lead character. I mean, he had the best character and personality among all other cadets and him jumping at this odd chance is very.. unlike him.<br/><br/>Basically the whole thing started off great (save for the cutting in half, I was a bit shocked, but.. I could live with that) and then there was a few shockers in the middle, and by the end it gets a bit random.

"zardoz-13","9","2","10","19 February 2015"," Fifty Shades of Blood!!!
","Imagine putting the James Bond movies into a cinematic blender with the Austin Powers comedies, and you'll see what British director Matthew Vaughn does with his outlandish movie ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."" For the record, Vaughn made his first film as a director in 2004 with the murderous mobster melodrama ""Layer Cake"" (2004) starring Daniel Craig. Three years later he followed up ""Layer Cake"" with ""Stardust."" This imaginative Neil Gaiman fantasy romance bore little resemblance to the gritty ""Layer Cake."" Vaughn didn't come into his own until he adapted Mark Millar's subversive graphic novel ""Hit Girl"" as the Nicolas Cage actioneer ""Kick Ass."" This controversial revenge thriller about a dad and daughter who dressed like comic book super-heroes to destroy a dastardly gangster spawned a sequel. Vaughn's biggest success came with the incomparable Marvel Comics ""X-Men"" prequel ""X-Men: First Class"" about the costume-clad mutants in their youth during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Vaughn has recycled many of the themes and characters from those movies for his adaptation of Mark Millar's graphic novel ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" that features Colin Firth, Michael Caine, and Mark Strong. This uneven but entertaining homage to the James Bond movies provides an overdue departure from the usual formulaic, testosterone laden fare that sacrifices wit and style for realism and gore. Mind you, Vaughn grinds his action gears during the early scenes as he sets up his improbable plot. Happily, he has everything running smoothly for an explosive finale. The big problem that Vaughn had to contend with in launching a new franchise was pairing relatively unknown actor Taron Egerton with veteran actor Colin Firth who rarely plays armed and deadly heroes. Meanwhile, sympathetic heroes and treacherous villains tangle mercilessly in this larger-than-life, hyperbolic espionage escapade that could easily qualify as ""50 Shades of Blood"" for its sensational number of mind-blowing action scenes. Hundreds of thousands of people perish when an evil megalomaniac plans to solve overpopulation by implanting SIM cards into their heads, controlling their thoughts, and converting their cell phones into improvised explosive devices. ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" qualifies as the kind of silly but stout, R-rated saga that might repel squeamish moviegoers.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn and his wife Jane Golden, who has collaborated on every film her husband has helmed except ""Layer Cake,"" have adapted Mark Millar's graphic novel with the same audacious abandon that they infused in ""Kick Ass."" Indeed, they have made some extreme but inspired changes to Millar's narrative. ""Kingsman"" concerns an independent, international espionage agency hidden behind the faÃ§ade of an elite tailor's shop on London's Savile Row that operates at the highest level of discretion like ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E"" television series. This private outfit makes Navy SEALs look like second-rate shrimp. Indeed, if such an ultra-secret organization existed, world peace would be guaranteed. Latter day British knights of the realm with appropriate code-names like Lancelot and Galahad, these dudes cut dashing figures in their globe-trotting missions to preserve peace and solidarity. The cream of their crop, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), ranks as their top agent. He is at his best when he has little more than an umbrella to vanquish the villains. British actor Colin Firth, who plays the impeccably clad protagonist, has been acting since 1984, but he is known largely as a lightweight leading man in romantic comedies like ""Mamma Mia!,"" ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and ""Bridget Jones' Diary."" In 2007, he ventured out of his comfort zone and played an armor-clad knight in the above-average medieval swashbuckler ""The Last Legion."" During one of Vaughn's many impressively staged action set-pieces, Firth devastates a hatemongering Westboro-style church congregation in a no-holds-barred, free-for-all fracas.<br/><br/>As ""Kingsman"" unfolds, Harry Hart's closest comrade, Lancelot (Jack Davenport), dies during a mission but saves Harry's life. Predictably, Harry consoles Lancelot's grieving widow and son. Understandably distraught by her husband's mysterious demise, Michelle Unwin (Samantha Womack of ""Breeders"") wants nothing to do with Kingsman. Nevertheless, Harry persuades her only son, Eggsy, to accept Lancelot's medal inscribed with a phone number and a code word should he ever require help. Seventeen years later, as an underprivileged teen living in the projects, Eggsy finds himself in deep trouble. Our wild, impulsive hero steals an automobile belonging to a gang of loutish British lads who have been badgering him. Commandeering their vehicle for a joyride, Eggsy careens through congested London traffic, driving the vehicle in reverse, with the police following him nose to nose, as he executes several complicated maneuvers. Vaughn excels with suspenseful scenes like this careening car chase. Later, with nobody to help him, Gary 'Eggys' Unwin (newcomer Taron Egerton) contacts Harry. After Harry gets Eggsy out of the clink, he takes him for a tour of a local tailor's shop that serves as a front for Kingsman. Since he feels guilty about the death of Eggys' dad, Harry helps the lad compete with other candidates for the job-of-a-lifetime as a Kingsman. After surviving the gauntlet of an incredible obstacle course, Eggys stands poised to become a top agent who can match wits and swap fists with either James Bond or Jason Bourne. Unfortunately, our hero commits some interesting mistakes before he can redeem himself in the eyes of the Kingsman and save the world.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson steals the show as goofy looking, Internet billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine. Adopting with a quirky lisp, Jackson wears his baseball cap askew like a gangsta. Clearly, Valentine represents Jackson's best performance since ""Pulp Fiction."" Although the tongue-in-cheek Jackson overshadows handsome Harry Hart and his unusual arsenal of weapons, Valentine's number one henchman--perhaps 'henchm'am would be better--is a gravity-defying dame equipped with razor-sharp, 'Flex-Foot Cheetah' blade feet, who slices up her adversaries like deli meat. Nothing can prepare you for Algerian dancer Sofia Boutella of ""StreetDance 2"" when she performs her breathtaking acrobatic feats in a variation on Oddjob and his razor sharp bowler hat from the Bond groundbreaker ""Goldfinger."" Altogether, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" amounts to amusing but polished nonsense."
"aharmas","10","2","10","15 February 2015"," 100% Percent Satisfying: Action Galore
","Who would have thought Colin Firth could play such a suave James Bond type? He displays enough cockiness, looks quite dapper in his custom made suite, and can probably pick up any babes he wished if we had more time in the movie. Jackson also has the time of his life, with his speech impediment villain. In addition to that, we are treated to the training phase of the future spies, and unlike ""Birdman"" where there's nothing funny, this parody skewers the genre, giving us action fan plenty to cheer throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>We have the gadgets, the action scenes, the incredible requests to earn certification and become a member of the select few. We meet the fatherless hero who must prove himself worthy of the recognition and hone his natural talents to be able to save the world. Who wouldn't love the poisonous tip oxfords, the cool pens, key chains, and doesn't that umbrella come in pretty handy before and during a lethal encounter?<br/><br/>In order to give the film more panache, we have to include Michael Caine, who has already graced a few ""Batman"" films with his class, and Mark Strong adds a touch of cerebral ability, as he must prove his resources are after all, important to succeed in this era. <br/><br/>What is most important here is the amount of fun we have throughout the film? Loved the intimate dinner between the two adversaries, the sexy villain who proves to be quite a challenge during the entire adventure, and it is plenty of fun to see some of those selected few get their due, as they find themselves once again worthy of salvation just because they have more money than the rest of the world. Of course, the villain plans are both hideous and hilarious as we see which groups are depicted in the movie. Most of them are one step short of getting into that type of frenzy anyway, so it wouldn't take much to trigger that type of behavior.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is a bit over two hours, but we don't want it to end because it is so much fun. There are films out there that are overpraised because it looks like they're trying to be original as they criticize, satirize, or make a half-hearted and pretentious parody of other genres. ""Kingsman"" is an example that the film makers are able to wink an eye and tell us these types of films are excessive, with just too much of nothing in order to pack it with special effects to hide its creative weaknesses, but this one also shows that you can show intelligent commentaries without dragging or calling too much attention to it. I can't remember how many times I look at my time during ""Birdman"", but I had forgotten I had a watch or a cell phone while I laughed and rooted for the heroes and villains equally, and there were a few unexpected turns which gave me some faith about the simple fact that we can still hope to find some fresh material out there.<br/><br/>We might getting too much of the Marvel universe, with a break needed soon. It is also important to note that originality and creativity and their blend with comedy and action are really difficult when they were done. A good work of art doesn't try that hard to call attention to itself. Instead, it's all there, and it flows naturally on its way to its well-deserved recognition, without the overeager critical support to tell us how great it is, when it really isn't."

"timothymayer","8","2","10","15 February 2015"," Fun Movie To Start Off The Spy Year
","Kingsman The Secret Service is based on a comic book, The Secret Service by Dave Gibbons and Mark Millar. I can't say how the movie compares to the comic, because I haven't read it. I'm told the story differs substantially. It's a fun return to the 60's spy movies where the emphasis was on style, gadgets and cars. It's also a very British movie, which will confuse the American audiences. It's still a lot of fun and I can't recommend it enough. Could've done with out the abundant CGI effects. The prologue has several spies hanging in from a helicopter as they wing into the compound of a middle eastern warlord. One of them is killed in the mission and it's up to agent Galahad (Colin Frith) to deliver the terrible news to his fallen comrade's wife and young child. He gives the widow a medallion. It has the letter ""K"" on it and he tells her to call them if they ever needs anything. When the widow refuses the medallion, he hands to the toddler,reminding him to take good care of his mother.<br/><br/>Forward to the present. The toddler has grown up to be Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) a talented young man with not much of a future. His mom has taken up with a thug and has another child. After getting tossed in a cell for stealing a car from a local tough, Eggsy remembers the medallion he wears, calls the number on the back and asks for help. Suddenly he's a free man and walks out to meet Agent Galahad, AKA Harry, the same man who brought the horrible news to him and his mother about his father's death. Harry is from the John Steed school of British secret agents and looks dapper in a suit with an umbrella. He tells Eggsy about the secret service organization his father and him belonged to. When some of the local hooligans show up looking for revenge over the car theft, Harry takes them all out with combined martial arts and his gadget- enhanced umbrella.<br/><br/>At the same time, we are introduced to the criminal mastermind every good spy movie needs. In this instance its Richmond Valentine (Samuel L Jackson), an internet billionaire who dresses flamboyantly and speaks with a lisp. He's decided his private efforts to stop ecological disaster have been a waste of time. Now he's come up with a new plan: eliminate the source of the problem, i.e., most of the world's human population. But Harry's private secret service organization, the Kingsman, has Valentine in their sites. Will they be able to stop him before he realizes his sinister plan?<br/><br/>Much of Kingsman The Secret Service concerns Eggsy's training. At the beginning of the film, one of the Kingsman operatives is taken out by a anchorwoman of Valentine. Since there are only 12 active field operatives at any given time, each of the other agents nominate a successor. Of course, Harry nominates Eggsy and he moves into the training compound with the other candidates. The training is rigorous and the trainees are informed by the their instructor, and Kingsman tech specialist, ""Merlin"", some of them may not survive. There's unexpected encounters with weapons, potential drowning and a particularly scary scene with a high altitude sky dive. Naturally, most of the other candidates are Cambridge and Oxford snobs, making fun of Eggsy's working class accent.<br/><br/>The actual Kingsman organization is something of a mystery. In the comic the agents simply worked for a branch of the British government. Like Mr. Bond, it was a ""ministry"" always seems to be some shadowy government branch overseen by men in bowler hats. But the organization in Kingsman The Secret Service is an independent organization. Harry takes Eggsy to their headquarters early in the film and it turns out to be a high-end tailor shop, ""The Kingsman"", which has been making uniforms and suits for the British government for centuries. As Harry describes it, the firm was wealthy, but lacked heirs. Concerned if they did nothing, there might not be a British government to clothe, the company decided to put its vast money into toward a secret society designed to serve Britain and humanity. Although, like UNCLE HQ, the outside of the shop may look ordinary, it's the doorway into a vast organization with its own weapons, finances, and technology. Running the show is agent ""Arthur"", played by the venerable Michael Caine.<br/><br/>Another topic Harry occasionally talks about is how gentleman are born, not made. The smart suit worn by a Kingsman is his suit of armor. It's also bullet proof. ""Manners make the man"", Harry proclaims just before he locks the door behind him to deal with some punks. Even when meeting in virtual, the 12 Kingsman agents sit at a table, not round, but rectangular. It's an amusing application of Thomas Malory to the modern world.<br/><br/>Looks like 2015 is the year of the spy movie. Kingsman The Secret Service shows it's off to a good start. www.spysafehouse.com"

","I will say that what made the film rather enjoyable was despite the fact that it was a comical but more violent and bloody version of the James Bond series, but it doesn't take itself too seriously and manages to be a good escape. The film deals with Harry attempting to recruit a new kings men which is basically a new spy after one is killed on a rescue mission. Harry ends up reunited with an old recruit named Gary aka eggy who is the son of a fellow spy killed years earlier on a mission. I will say one of the most enjoyable highlights of the film was Sam Jackson who manages to make the villain valentine rather hilarious with his lisp and funny outlandish wardrobe. It is nice to also see mark us ill make a return to the big screen."

","When ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" was moved to the 'dump month' wasteland of beginning of the year, my expectations for the movie were lowered significantly. <br/><br/>The advertisements for ""Kingsman"", which glamorized a variety of displayed weapons, promised an October release date, but was pushed back by the studio until February. A film can be delayed for a variety of reasons, but the common assumption is that a shift guarantees box-office and critical failures. <br/><br/>Leave your expectations at the theater door. <br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn leads a stellar class in an original and modern interpretation of the spy genre. Similar to his work on ""Kick-Ass"" and ""X-Men: First Class"", Vaughn continues to prove himself as an established filmmaker, especially when adapting graphic novel source material. <br/><br/>The usually stiff and reserved Colin Firth is unleashed as Harry Hart (codename Galahad), a veteran secret agent who emphasizes personal etiquette and style. An enthusiast of Hemingway and Horman quotes, Hart carries the appearance of an English professor, but fights with the brutality of the deadly killing machine that he is. <br/><br/>After a mission in the Middle East is botched and results in the death of a fellow agent, Hart delivers a medal with a contact number to his murdered comrade's mourning family. <br/><br/>The son Eggsy (a star-making performance by relative newcomer Taron Eggerton) grows up and is a reckless youth without job or a future. After stealing a car, and accelerating it into a police vehicle, Eggsy desperately phones the number on the medal from prison. <br/><br/>The Kingsman, with code names from Arthurian legend, recruits Eggsy and other selected youths as potential members of the spy program. <br/><br/>Hart works alongside fellow Kingsman Arthur (Michael Caine) and Merlin (Mark Strong) as both trainer and mentor, presenting the candidates with a number of grueling tasks to determine their qualifications. <br/><br/>The agency finds itself pitted against Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a billionaire tech genius intent on implanting SIM cards inside of people for his own sinister and megalomaniac intentions. <br/><br/>Jackson, having fun with a lisp that sounds like a Mike Tyson impersonation, is the best he's been since his remarkable performance in Django Unchained, and his villain is a testament to the Roger Moore Bond films, when the baddies used to be fun with their preposterously foul intentions. <br/><br/>During the films crowning scene, Hart fights through a Kentucky church overflowing with bigoted rednecks, and blood sprays to the tune of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird"". The graphic visuals are brilliantly choreographed, and makes your jaw drop at how hilariously violent it is. The scene seems to last forever, and that's not a bad thing. <br/><br/>Updated advertisements of the film with the corrected February release date displayed characters standing beneath the splayed artificial legs of Gazelle â€“ the hottie Oddjob to Valentine's Goldfinger. The posters are a homage to ""For Your Eyes Only"", in which Roger Moore stands beneath the legs of his adversary. <br/><br/>The images are a fitting testament in how Vaughn effectively handles his subject material â€“ a loving tribute to a genre that is enjoyable and relevant, without straying far into the realms of parody. <br/><br/>With the Bond and Bourne franchises glooming with humorless realism, ""Kingsman"" strives to make an espionage feature enjoyable again.<br/><br/>The posters of Kingsman are destined to grace the dorm room walls of college kids, thumbtacked next to the likes of Fincher, Nolan, and Tarantino offerings. <br/><br/>With his fifth consecutive excellent film, Vaughn is destined to join these ranks of these applauded and revered directors."
"failio-504-682440","10","2","10","15 February 2015"," Woah.
","......Holy sock puppet in a sausage factory. Just, wow. Without a doubt, this movie is mindblowingly awesome. I honestly don't know how to put my enjoyment of this movie into words, but here goes. From the very opening scene, in which we're treated to a fortress being destroyed by missiles set to the tune of Money For Nothing, to the jaw-dropping scene involving Colin Firth and a hate-group church, to the absolutely hilarious climatic sequence, almost every scene in this movie has had the OTT dial turned up to 11, and that sure as hell isn't a bad thing! Each scene is an absolute blast, combining brilliantly-choreographed fight sequences complimented by slick editing, great cinematography, beautifully off-kilter humour and much, much more. You will be lost for words after all of them, probably with a huge goofy grin on your face. Of course, if the cast didn't look like/perform like they were having a blast then the overall effect of the movie would've been reduced. Fortunately, they do; from Taron Egerton as generally awe-struck Eggsy, to Colin Firth as his mentor, to Samuel L. Jackson as lisp-bearing scheming mastermind Richmond Valentine, to the other minor cast members such as Mark Strong as tech-aficionado Merlin, Sofia Boutella as Pistorious-esque Gazelle, and a very welcome cameo from Mark Hamill as a professor in an unfortunate position, everyone really gets into their roles, managing to at once and really giving the viewer sense that they're having the absolute time of their lives. The soundtrack only heightens the effect of these; they're perfectly fitting, and some pretty great tunes as well (although in the aforementioned church scene, changing the song to Don't Stop Me Now would've blown the awesome level through the roof for me). At 129 minutes, it is definitely on the longer side for these kinds of movies, but fortunately two hours fly by, never feeling dull for one single moment. Kingsman: The Secret Service can best be described as a hybrid of Trading Places and Bond, and it only takes the best aspects of those movies and makes them even more awesome. If you're looking for a great big dose of gobsmackingly silly fun, go here. Only here. No exceptions. This is the one that you need. It's out- f**king-standing."

Def worth seeing it on big screen. All the comparisons to Bond meets Kick-Ass, part Matrix in fighting, makes this the best action movie i've seen since Gaudians of the Galaxy. Like Captain America Winter Soldier, it truly makes you want to go outside and kick some evil butt. Don't though, you might get arrested, just saying i felt after this movie like i did after seeing Cap 2, i wanted to be a spy, try and save the world, and kick some local hooligan's behinds...NOT FOR KIDS!!!!!...a lady actually brought 7 young preteens to this movie for some reason unknown to me. The violence is a little gratuitous, and i wouldn't want any kid to see that. Some unnecessary nudity/sexual innuendo, which is why i didn't give this movie a 10. Like Age of Ultron, my most anticipated film for 2015(screw star wars), this movie has a real feel to the danger humanity faces, one evil genius villain trying to rule the world with through violent means. Both precursors to the Anti-Christ, a real life person foretold in the BIBLE, that will one day try and do what Hitler did, rule the world through destruction of his enemies. That day will surely come, but if you believe in Jesus Christ, that HE died on the Cross to pay the penalty for your sins, you can be saved from the temporal and eternal wrath of GOD, which also, will surely come....please, before its too late, turn to Jesus...HE can and will save you, if you can believe...."

"rgkarim","9","2","10","14 February 2015"," No Secret that This Is A Good Movie
","When you think of Arthur, Lancelot, Merlin, and Galahad you most likely refer to the knights of the round table lore. Well this weekend, director Matthew Vaughn brings to the screen another variation of the classical names in the form of Kingsman: The Secret Service. After seeing the cardboard standees for months before the first trailer I pondered what was in store. <br/><br/>So when the trailer came a calling this is what I, and maybe you, might expect: Insane Action, Samuel L Jackson being himself, Comedic dialog, and hopefully an engaging plot. Probably more, but I have a word limit. <br/><br/>What you get:<br/><br/>1. The team delivered on their promise of action, as Kingsman is loaded with high adrenaline scenes. From the get go things start off with a bang, and quickly transition into shootouts that are custom to the Bond film franchise. However, shootouts in this day and age can't be like the days of wild west, but require some extra edge. Again this movie succeeds, integrating both hand to hand and gunplay into well choreographed bouts of destruction where both villain and hero make their moves. Now you might be thinking, oh great another movie like the expendables, just what the world needs. Not the case my friends. You see, Kingsman does something that is rare these days in which there is a purpose for the action. All the exciting scenes have a purpose in this film and each one is pertinent to the plot instead of just there to add some boom to the mix. Even better is that the action is not restricted to just shoot outs as well. No you're not having an auditory hallucination, the action extends beyond the bullets and bombs. The first half of the film is all about the interview, detailing training without going too extreme. However, just because our recruits are training doesn't mean the world stops, and the rest of the agents are out progressing the story as they try to solve the crime at hand. Regardless, the action is well done and proof that you can still have a decent story with action to support. 2. Samuel L Jackson is still the same man we have always seen: dark and funny. Once again he steps into his bad boy role, only this time dropping the forlorn intimidation for a charismatic homeboy trying to change the world. His delivery of his explanations are hilarious, playful and straight to the point, yet still carrying that edge he is famous for. Adding the lisp to the lines was also a great move, and his role was one of the more enjoyable villains I've seen in a while. 3. Outside of Jackson though, the comedy was strong throughout the whole movie and performed in a variety of ways. The dialog is very clever and quick witted making fun of a variety of cultural trends and themes. Big macs, sex jokes, even clichÃ©d spy movie references, nothing was left untouched by this film. Yet lines can only do so much. Fortunately with the cast they assembled the delivery of the screenplay was executed well. Colin Firth's sarcasm and prestige were excellent media to execute insults and observations. Taron Eggerton's bad boy, hard knocked life approach was perfect for the spy in training and carried a different type of edge that mixed well with the fray. Even the environmental comedy was fantastic, with multiple crashes, punches, and other acts of violence carrying a humor filled twist that had my roommate and I rolling in our chairs. However, the biggest laughs for me come from some of the darker jokes of the film, in particular one event that will have your head exploding with laughter. 4. This brings me to my next point of the movie; you get a lot of darkness to this tale. Audience members will be subjected to people being cut in half, bullets flying out of heads, extreme violence, and racist antics, and I'm still not covering everything. Now you might think this ruins a good movie, but it doesn't, as the darker nature of this film brought suspense into the movie. How you ask? Simple, they are not afraid to push their characters to the limit, even pulling a few surprises like the Walking Dead that may just have you saying ""What the f&(*"". The darker aspects of this movie help round out the film and provide some valuable story plots and action, that a lighter hearted tone might have limited. Nevertheless, I caution for squeamish and younger audience members to check themselves before seeing this film, or they might become haunted or sickened by the inhumane (and sometimes ridiculous) moments. <br/><br/>As my buddy said, Kingsman is a movie that has a lot of qualities and all blended together in a manner that is balanced. The story is laid out quite well, the plot itself engaging and organized to allow for action and comedy to take its place. All of the action had a purpose and was dynamic as opposed to other films of the genre. Comedy wise, again the dynamic nature of it allows lots of jokes and bashing on just about every culture. Vaughn and his team have made a great film that was well shot, well edited, and packed with enough excitement to make the two hours fly by. Yes, the darker themes were not quite expected, and the cursing/ cultural insults were a little much for me at times. However, both my buddy and I strongly recommend hitting this film in the theaters, especially with the dry spell coming up. <br/><br/>My score for this film: Action/Adventure/Comedy: 9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0"

","Had the opportunity to see a Thursday night advance premiere screening in King of Prussia of this movie accompanied by my unofficial fiancÃ©. We both enjoyed it The story revolves around a spy who recruits and mentors a lower class young man for a spy agency called Kingsman. The movie contains references to several spy films and TV shows such as the Bond franchise and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. The tropes of such films and shows are discussed, spoofed, and at one point busted. The cast was excellent and seemed to enjoy their roles. Colin Firth was outstanding as the veteran secret agent who recruits and mentors the protagonist played by newcomer Taron Egerton. This movie has plenty of mayhem including an already famous church fight scene in which Colin Firth's character takes out about 80 people. If you enjoy spy films you will enjoy Kingsman:The Secret Service."

","I could not believe how spectacular this movie was.<br/><br/>Despite it's similarities to X-men first class, Mathew Vaughn crafted a amazing film with better action and special effects.<br/><br/>Colin Firth plays a Bond-like distinguish gentlemen who recruits a new member to his club, Men in Black style, in order to face Samuel Jackson who plays a villain who made billions with technology and has a warp vision on how to use his money to ""save the Earth""<br/><br/>The movie pokes fun on old school style 007 movies while being heavily influence by it. Like Vaughn points out, too many movies are in the trend of trying too hard to be real and Grimm, so Vaughn comes at you with something a little more fun and playful. <br/><br/>I thought it was going to suck cause they released it during the cold instead of waiting for warmer weather, but perhaps it was actually the R rating for words inappropriate for American languages.<br/><br/>And the violence was superb. Well choreographed like it was coming straight out of Hong Kong. Vaughn does some interesting things with the camera movement while the action takes place. Combined with a great score that complements the fight scenes.<br/><br/>Even though his act was more a parody, Samuel Jackson was up there with the best Bond villains, weaving a colorful archetype of a man who thinks he's doing what's best for the world in what turned out to be a very cleaver, over the top plot. Aided by a cool henchmen, with blades on her prosthetic limbs, it makes you wonder what would happen if he went heat-to-head with Roger Moore.<br/><br/>This movie surprised me. The action was top notched, it had an awesome villain, and a cool plot, and it was a humorous parody worthy of Austin Powers. Vaughn took what he learned from X-Men first class, added it to this movie, than dialed it up to eleven. Good Show!"

","The second film directed by Matthew Vaughn to be based on a Mark Millar-penned graphic novel series after 2010's insanely brilliant 'Kick-Ass', 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' maintains the former film's stylish mix of pitch black comedy, ultra-violence and creative narrative twists. <br/><br/>Essentially a send-up of many classic British spy franchises (most prominently 007), 'Kingsman' focuses on a veteran secret agent (Colin Firth) taking on an inexperienced apprentice (Taron Egerton), with both individuals coming up against a diabolical billionaire (Samuel L. Jackson). The plot's been done to death thousands of times before, but 'Kingsman's' unique self-referential humor and willingness to cross narrative boundaries and defy genre clichÃ©s makes it stand out amid a sea of mediocre espionage films.<br/><br/>I was initially worried that Eggsy, the apprentice and the film's main protagonist, was going to be unlikable due to his somewhat arrogant nature, however ultimately Egeton is able to make him a worthy hero by providing the right amount of charm and vulnerability. Colin Firth fits right in as the old-fashioned, gentlemanly Harry Hart, but in some places leaps out of this familiar territory to become a ruthlessly brutal action juggernaut. Samuel L. Jackson is also a terrific watch, with his prominent lisp and aversion to the sight of blood making him a highly unconventional but highly watchable and entertaining villain. <br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, like in 'Kick-Ass' before it, 'Kingsman' is genuinely shocking and brutal in certain stages. At other points, over-the-top, ridiculously well-choreographed violence is fused with the film's morbid sense of humor, providing yet another unique viewing experience from Matthew Vaughn. Like his other productions, the success of 'Kingsman' lies largely in its ability to not take itself too seriously, as well as its tendency to both pay homage to and make fun of the other films that have inspired it's creation.<br/><br/>Even though it's still relatively early to tell, 'Kingsman' will easily be considered one of the best action films of the year."

","Kingsman wants to be a lot of things. A James Bond homage mixed with The New Avengers and a touch of The Man from Uncle. Lets throw in Eastenders as well with scenes set in a council estate pub. Taron Egerton plays the young hero Eggsy and Samantha Janus plays his mum.<br/><br/>Kingsman is an independent spy agency with an Arthurian leaning which operates out of a gentleman's tailor shop. When one of the agent dies on duty, Colin Firth nominates a small time criminal (Eggsy) to be a replacement. Eggsy's father was also a Kingsman once.<br/><br/>All the nominees go through a tough selection process. At the same time the organisation investigates the mysterious disappearance of some celebrities and the actions of a well known philanthropist and cyber billionaire Valentine played by Samuel L Jackson who is concerned about climate change and wants to give away free sims, free phone calls and internet.<br/><br/>Valentine obviously watched that episode of Doctor Who where the dastardly villain used mobile phones devices to control people's emotions.<br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn as with the Kick Ass films uses strong humour and cartoon violence although in this film, the violence has a video game footage look about it. I do think an anal sex gag at the end was misplaced!<br/><br/>The film is entertaining enough, makes you laugh a few times but lacks a lot of originality. Maybe the comic book it is based on is itself been inspired by many other film and TV sources.<br/><br/>In short its a fan-boy remake of a James Bond film from the Roger Moore era. However hearing Samuel Jackson describing spies and megalomaniacs also reminded me of the film Unbreakable which itself was about people with superpowers and super-villains and Jackson had a major role in that film as well."

","Matthew Vaughn has built an impressive career directing smart and fast paced action movies from his film debut ""Layer Cake"" to the eponymous ""Kick-Ass"". Here again, he shows how to stage action sequences like no other. Colin Firth is in top form and dapper as Harry Hart aka agent Galahad who takes on a young hooligan called Eggsy (newcomer Taron Egerton) as his protégé. The film has an excellent supporting cast, with Michael Caine as Arthur, head of the Kingsman service, Mark Strong as Merlin the gadget guy and a deliciously fun performance from Samuel L Jackson as Valentine the films main antagonist hell bent on world domination. The plot of the film does not so much matter as just sitting back and enjoying the madness that unfolds. Stand out scenes include a warm up fight sequence in a pub that first introduces us to Harry Hart and an all out gore fest in a Church that makes the infamous fight scene in ""Old Boy"" look like a high school brawl. There is plenty of tongue in cheek humor to balance all of the violence. Highly recommended!"

"Dorjee_Wang","10","1","4","15 August 2016"," One of the most entertaining movie of the decade
","Matthew Vaughn's third attempt at a comic book series adaptation after Kick Ass and X-Men movie, and it triumphs over anything he has done previously. I watched this movie a year ago, but I haven't come around to review it yet until now.<br/><br/>Granted this movie is not for the oversensitive chaps who go ""Awful!"" at the tiniest bit of dark comedy and violence. It's for the mature audience who enjoy comedy just for the sake of comedy mixed in with uncensored violence. This movie is what the product would be like if the Bond series had mated with Men in Black. It's offensively funny yet full of tight action that'll thrill you. It was one of those movies where I just went ""Darn, this has no flaws"". Many movies have tried to break the barrier between comedy and action before yet none has been as successful as this movie in the endeavor. There's specifically a scene halfway through the way which is incredibly offensive yet quintessentially hilarious.<br/><br/>Now, on to the casting. Colin Firth? Most people know him because of the amount of romcom and drama he has done in his career. So it's hard to take someone like him in a movie like this seriously right? But he is surprisingly brilliant in this movie. His monotonous countenance is a surprising to say the least. Samuel L Jackson's role might nark off some people but his lisp and hilarious philosophy elevates the movie. Taron Egerton is also a surprising young talent who holds his ground against Academy award winners like Caine and Firth. Sofia Boutella's role is ridiculously thrilling and hilarious as well, as a handicapped woman who walks on bladed prosthetic legs, practices capoeira and cuts down men in two without sweating.<br/><br/>As a caveat, I'll warn off people who don't like violence and offensive comedy (AKA black or gallows comedy), this movie is NOT for you. Rather this was tailored made for people who love movies with ridiculous humour and action sequences. One of the best movies of 2015, and undoubtedly the best spy-fi movie of the decade (go ahead Bond fans, lynch me)."

","""Kingsman"" is loosely based on the comic book series ""The Secret Service"" but was adapted by Matthew Vaughn, the man who directed the film version of ""Kick-Ass"" . This production tweaks the Bond formula with some polished style, a lot dark humor and a bit of well-groomed action. As with ""Kick-Ass,"" there's a strong underlying nastiness but also a wicked sense of fun. This can create some dissonance for some people finding it uneasy to laugh at violence at a point and then find out a character they like was killed in the next sequence.

There's a lot of over-the-top and unbelievable action, but it is based on a comic, after all. The movie's eccentric and generally entertaining but marred by fluent F-bombs throughout and an unnecessarily vulgar scene, which tries to be funny (and almost is).

If you like the X-Men or James Bond you'll want to check ""Kingsman"" out, but it's not as good IMHO.

Apparently Eggsy had the potentials, otherwise it would have been even more silly to have him achieve all those tasks without even proper training. The violence scenes were really graphic, like the ones in Kick Ash, with too much unnecessary blood and too disgusting blood scenes.

When one of their agents, 'Lancelot', is killed in the line of duty each of the others must nominate one person to compete for the position. Harry Hart, code name Galahad, nominates Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin; the son of an agent who died saving Galahad. It soon becomes apparent that most of the other candidates see him as a council estate oik but as the training progresses and others drop out it becomes clear that he might just have what it takes to become a Kingsman. While this is happening the Kingsmen work to uncover what Lancelot was doing when he was killed; signs point to American billionaire Richmond Valentine who it turns out has a rather drastic plan to solve the problem of over population.<br/><br/>This is clearly trying to be like James Bond turned up to eleven; in some ways it works; in others it doesn't. Colin Firth does a fine job as the suave Galahad; a character that felt like a cross between James Bond and John Steed but more violent. Taron Egerton does a solid job as Eggsy, Sophie Cookson was good as his friend Roxy and Mark Strong is good as tech-specialist 'Merlin'. As the villain Samuel L. Jackson was rather fun although he was overshadowed by Sofia Boutella who made a great henchwoman; the way she used the swords built into her characters prosthetic legs was certainly memorable. The action was fairly over-the-top in a rather fun way; it is violent though in an early scene a man is sliced in half vertically; if that doesn't bother you the rest should be okay. Strangely the ending which features many exploding heads eschews gore in favour of a firework like effect that felt a bit too cartoony for my taste. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the genre; it skilfully manages to walk the fine line between a 'proper' spy movie and a parody it isn't for the too easily offended though."

","""Kingsman"" is not only a story about a young lad being trained in an ultra-secret service agency similar to Mi6 of the James Bond universe. Kingsman is also about satirizing Bond and other similar action fair. Other films are directly or indirectly referenced in ""Kingsman"", sometimes to good effect, other times with mixed results. So is the film about it's story/plot or its references to other cinematic shoot-em-up films of similar ilk? Rather depends upon how you look at it. For my money, the endless references to action cinema did become a bit overdone.<br/><br/>""Kingsman"" incorporates two plots which become intertwined by the end. The first, and most interesting, is the training of a youth on the eve of adulthood. ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) is the son of a Kingsman who sacrificed himself to save his colleagues on his mission when his son was only a toddler. One of the operatives, code named Galahad (Colin Firth) gives the toddler a medallion. The late father was code named Lancelot. The film then fast-forwards many years later and now Eggsy is near adulthood but not very mature. He encounters Galahad who offers him a spot in a program with other recruits designed to train future kingsmen, in particular to fill the vacant spot of Lancelot. The training program I thought was the strongest part of the film as the coaches/trainers use no-win scenarios to challenge their recruits into finding creative solutions.<br/><br/>The other story involves a billionaire, Richmond Valentine (Samuel Jackson), who has some strange ideas about defeating global warming. He makes endless speeches to both audiences and individuals with a lisp. Also in Jackson's service, as either an employee or slave, is Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) who sports razor sharp blades in place of normal feet. I started to guess when she appeared in scenes without Jackson, an extra or three was going to encounter the business end of Gazelle's ""shoes"".<br/><br/>Underneath Valentine's seemingly innocent philanthropy in which he offers free internet and cell phone service through his network is a calculated plan to eradicate global warming. Trouble is, the plan involves causing people to engage in Godzilla-like violent behavior. He also implants computer chips into peoples' necks in which they become mindless minions in service to Valentine. Eventually, we see a demonstration of Valentine's plot in action when he decides to off the congregation of a church of far-right congregants in Kentucky who make Mussolini and Stalin look pretty democratic. The violence in the church was so over-the-top and grotesque, I found I was not enjoying it and wanted to fast-forward out of the scene.<br/><br/>While I definitely liked the youth's introduction to Kingsman through Galahad, and I thought Jackson made a good baddie, the endless references to Bond-like cinema I thought was overkill. Not only are Bond films and ""Trading Places"" referenced, but there's parallel's with ""2012"" and there's even an indirect wink to the film ""Pulp Fiction"", which also starred Jackson. Also, the combat scenes were gratuitously violent for no apparent reason. This film is billed as an action-comedy, but I didn't find myself laughing when people's limbs were chopped off. When either Galahad or Gazelle rip into their victims, they literally come apart at the seams.<br/><br/>By the end of ""Kingsman"", I wasn't sure what I had seen. Was this a comedy? Kind of. A spoof? Maybe. An homage to action cinema a la the 1960's variety? I guess so. At one point Jackson and Firth talk about those films from their youth, and Jackson even says ""It's not that kind of a movie"". And I think I had to agree. I wasn't sure what kind of movie this was in the first place, and I was still confused by the end."

I went to the movies to watch a cool action film and they sure did not fail to deliver. The fighting scenes were great, specially the infamous church scene, where you they got to try several different moves and their technical skills were on full display.<br/><br/>It wasn't going bad at all (there even was a cute pug pup, points for that). Unfortunately, I had to take at least 3 points out just for the final sequences.

It demands that you look past the superficial and into what really makes a person: as the mentor Harry Hart or Galahad would say, it's not what you wear that makes you a gentlemen. He also quotes Hemingway whilst urging Eggsy to improve and change. But does Vaughn really add much more to that discussion? The young rascal Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is low class from head to toe; the jeans, the shoes, the cap. And his accent and actions speak further too: one sequence has him steal a car and go for a joyride while Dizzee Rascal's ""Bonkers"" blares at us. Another has a long take where he parkours through the government housing to get away from his stepfather's goons. It's impressive to be sure. Would we look at it differently had he be dressed in a suit, and be chased by similarly suited goons? I'm not so sure. <br/><br/>Eggsy is swept up into the world of Kingsman after yet another misdemeanour. He's clearly a fish out of water, judging by his colleague's mockery when prompted over which private school he attends. Yet he excels against all odds as our protagonist should. The world of Kingsman is sleek and stylish; first started in the mid 20th century, it's been clearly modernised to take on ever evolving threats and we are just as impressed as Eggsy upon first viewing that vehicle hanger. <br/><br/>Yet the bigger plot is the more engaging one, a peculiar villain occupied by Samuel L Jackson who speaks with a lisp, wears a purple snapback and is, despite his nefarious intentions, appalled by bloodshed. I am not sure what Vaughn is going for here. In one dreadful scene, he shows up for no particular or logical reason in the Kingsman's own secret front store, and we are supposed to marvel at the tension beneath the pleasantries, but it's a very frivolous and artificial attempt at upping the stakes. Moviegoers have praised this sort of subversion of the villain role, and yet we marvel at the action scenes that are delivered with clear technical prowess. The most talked about scene is of course the one in the Westboro clone church, where Free Bird ushers in a frenzied take-down of 100 or so civilians by Harry. The choreography and shooting style is precise and excellent, constantly roving and tracking to visualise every brutal take-down from the Kingsman agent. And yet, in the midst of it, Valentine looks away with disgust. Vaughn attempts to have his cake and eat it too, portraying the civilians as the scum of the earth and cheering on Harry and laughing at Valentine only for his intentions to be revealed after all the bloodshed. Only then are we in two minds about the whole affair. <br/><br/>Are we poking fun and relishing the parody of the spy genre (as seen with the raunchy jokes, the meta- references to ""that kinda movie"" and the intentionally corny opening titles) or is it an uneven as it is violent? Mark Millar's ultra-violence was portrayed well in ""Kick Ass"" and was appropriate, whereas here it's rather odd. When Colin Firth brutally attacks the goons in the pub, it's starkly contrasted with his gentlemen motivations, but at least we cheer for the good guy. When Taron Egerton initiates the exact same fight at the end of the film, it's rather tiresome even with his noble intentions. There are some good performances (Firth first and foremost, and Cookson is also impressive), some jokes which merit a chuckle (McDonalds, Eggsy's pug, the James Bond martini reference) and some stunning action sequences (I really love the use of Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance Marches, but then again it begs the question, why is this stylised and a an axe to the neck not? Are we going for comic or ultra-graphic?) but overall I'm not sure what Kingsman is trying to achieve. But at least it's entertaining."
"mibmusic-1","6","1","5","20 September 2015"," Worst ever film villain!
","This movie could have been so much better........ Yes the action sequences are really good, and there are some very fun moments in the film. That being said, any action movie is only as good as the villain. The villain drives the story, makes us hate him, fear him, so we will want our heroes to kick his butt and be vested in their story. So when Samuel L. Jackson shows up afraid of blood or he will puke (they only put this in so they can show him puking later), never having killed or even hurt anyone in his life. So far a really weak villain. It gets worse, add to this his tweedy bird meets some famous boxer Lisp, silly silk baseball hat and awful, over-acting and he is now the worst super villain ever. Change this to a straight comedy and it might fly but as an action film? Total fail. I was enjoying the movie pretty much till he would show up again and remind me it's a movie. The Kingsmen themselves are really amazing. The first scene where a Kingsman takes out a houseful of baddies to save Mark Hamill is completely awesome. These Kingsman look invincible, till....... Somehow an invisible (must be) blade runner girl cuts him in half without making a single sound (off camera, don't feel bad, he didn't see it either). Man she is incredible to take out one of these guys, I mean the training they go through to become a Kingsmen is insane. In fact, most of the movie as they recruit a replacement for this amazing agent (who was killed like a lamb at slaughter) we are made to understand the rigors and real extent of a Kingsmen's training and we are saying ""okay, I get it. These guys are the best, trained for anything and anyone."" We believe! And if we didn't, just wait...... to further prove how invincible (almost) a Kingsmen is we are shown a scene where one single Kingsmen takes out 100 people, single handed, at once! <br/><br/>Man he must have the senses of a cat, reflexes like lightning! No one can touch him in all this mayhem, because he is a Kingsmen! Next......this very same Kingsmen for some reason just stands there while Tweedy-Villain just pulls a gun and shoots him in the head. No dodging, no slapping the gun away, no ducking, no grabbing our scary Tweedy-Villain as a hostage. He just stands there and eats a bullet. Huh? What happened? Suspended disbelief is shattered! <br/><br/>How can a wimpy, untrained weenie who never hurt a fly in person for fear of projectile vomiting be able to get the drop on Super-Bond? <br/><br/>I mean this Kingsmen guy was locked in a church with 100 crazy people and he killed all of them! I literally yelled at the TV.<br/><br/>Did that jet do vertical lift with only rear engines? Maybe I'll run that part back ;-)<br/><br/>Of course our trainee is better and faster than any other Kingsmen. He can defeat the slick blade runner girl by letting her tire out from all that brake dancing, and then nicking her with poison while she is busy doing a perfect Bruce Lee flying kick (watch close in that scene, she is looking straight ahead while he cuts her, she is frozen in a Bruce Lee pose). Maybe is she turned her head she might have dodged that one. Wait a minute, those blades that pop out of her feet, where are they the rest of the time when she is just walking? Stuck in her knees? Ouch!<br/><br/>We knew he would win, he had a promise of anal sex with a princess, duh!<br/><br/>OK, if none of that stuff matters; If you can live with that kind of broken storytelling , just sit back and watch some really cool action scenes that are really well choreographed and some crazy, really obvious special effects on a Saturday with some popcorn and a beer. <br/><br/>It could be worse, It wasn't World War Z"
"richuk-98954","7","1","5","15 June 2015"," Kingsman - Funny with good action scenes.
","I thought this movie was great and funny. It had some violent parts so might not be for everyone. It was about a street kid getting an offer from a secret service agent to join there service. He goes through training and then get's sent on a mission. The other people joining the service all came from university backgrounds. It wasn't the best movie I have seen, hence only seven stars out of ten. But it had some good action scenes and a few funny moments. The plot was a bit predictable and I am sure it has been done before. Apart from that the movie was great. It stared some good actors including Samuel L Jackson and Michael Kane. It was worth watching."
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","1","5","15 June 2015"," Bloody good fun
","'Kingsman: The Secret Service' walks a very fine line between parody and homage, never straying too far to one side or the other. Its tongue is certainly in its cheek, but never sticking out toward the audience.<br/><br/>Clearly director Matthew Vaughn was attempting to fashion a spy film that brings back a sense of fun reminiscent of the James Bond films of yore; even going meta on occasion to drive the point home. But even though it wears its absurdity on its sleeve, 'Kingsman' still manages to sneak in a genuine character arc and by the end we genuinely want our heroes to save the day. It's a heck of a balancing act Vaughn has done here."

","""The suit is the modern gentleman's armor. The Kingsmen are the new knights."" Harry Hart (Firth) has just lost his partner and friend. When he goes to tell the wife he leaves a present for his son (Egerton). Years later they two meet up again, this time Harry is a recruiter. Together, along with the rest of the Kingsmen. they must stop the global threat Valentine (Jackson) has set up. Before I really looked at the rating for this I was expecting a teenage Cody Banks type movie. After seeing it was rated R I was confused. The movie is very much geared toward the teenage crowd, but the fact that there are over 100 uses of the f-word take it out of the teenage crowd acceptability. The fact that the movie is about a younger agent takes this out of the older crowd's desire to see this. Colin Firth is very good and this is a different part for him. The main problem is that the swearing and violence push it out watch-ability for the crowd it is intended for. Had the movie been the same without the swearing it would have found an audience. As it stands its in between those that can't see it and those that don't want to. Overall, adding the unnecessary swearing really hurt the movie badly. I give this a C+."
"yansenringo","7","1","5","30 May 2015"," Entertaining!
","This movie is not very promising in the beginning, as it feels like a stupid movie with too many coincidences. A kid with family problem, arrested by cop, have a direct access to contact a very secret service and contact them after years ( what happen with the time when he dealt with drugs, kicked out of the marines, etc??), and the secret service suddenly come in person to bail him out (a secret service is supposed to be busy isn't he? :) ), but OK, so I keep following the movie with lower expectation, but still hope it won't be another Austin Power.<br/><br/>Then the Secret Service (name Kingsman) started to recruit a new guy to replace one agent who died in a mission, apart from the questionable way to find a candidate for the very sophisticated organization, the movie began to be interesting, with new ways of training methods. It shows off the technology, Bond's type of weapon, state of the art facility (underground!), ... and high fashion :). Not to mention peer pressure and friendship to give more dynamics of a military camp and some gentleman values.<br/><br/>It gets more interesting since the villain is portrayed well by Samuel L. Jackson, a genius lunatic who wants to ""save"" the world from ""viruses"" but still save some along with him, with the reference of Noah and his ark. Clearly he is very genius and a strong and balance rival for the Kingsman that it makes the movie interesting, with lots of twists and surprises which will make us like to sit and watch more and more. The last fight between Eggsy (the main character beside Colin Firth) and Gazelle (the main villain beside Jackson) is also interesting and quite classy, not a prolong fight but it shows skill and versatility of both. At the end... Of course the world is saved :)<br/><br/>Thus, this can be categorized as a complete movie, with action, blood, mutilation, comedy, friendship, gentleman, fashion, technology, etc. The story is not really perfect, but it can be forgiven with the aboves, along with the twist.<br/><br/>A good movie to spend a weekend :)"

","A private club of assassins locks horns with an effete billionaire bent on world depopulation, so the club turns to an underdog recruit to see off the beastly chap.<br/><br/>Good acting and pace. Humour is a bit patchy - there's a flash of porn ass at the very end, so clearly Carry On humour just ... carries on. But the final third is a complete riot, from the scene in the church onward - I guess thanks to the director's worship of Hong Kong action films. Colin Firth did his own stunts. LOL. The fights are a bit repetitive in style, although amazing to behold, and it goes full 007 parody in the end. <br/><br/>Overall, though, it lacks the satire of the equally ambitious Iron Sky.<br/><br/>The problem I have is with the politics. This is a real London film - loads of money to deliver a stylish, full-on neoliberal message that Big Men Rule, democracy and liberty are sideshows. The members of the club might as well be sitting round the cabinet table in Downing Street.<br/><br/>At one point the hero says saving Thatcher from assassination was a pity, but Thatcherism runs right through this story. All that east-end stuff? It's a fantasy - a great chunk of London's population has been deported from The Great Wen tax haven in the last 10 years because of neoliberal policies. <br/><br/>At least there are clubbable heroes to save us from ... the corporate club.<br/><br/>Samantha Janus is still a babe.

In this movie everything that this movie began with was abandoned and it took a big turn that was just a little too much.

I liked the performance of the actors, but now how the villain was presented. I mean it should be more serious not a childish villain with the stupid idea of exploding heads.

","From the title alone you know it has something to do with secret agents so before watching better expect some clichés. <br/><br/>Everything in the movie is good, except Harry's/Galahad's death in front of the church. In my opinion, his abrupt death is too difficult for me to swallow the fact. I was convinced that he just faked his death (a usual twist in movies) until the closing credits rolls up I realized he's really dead. Besides that, the ending is also not that satisfying. Too clean. World is saved. That's it. <br/><br/>The antagonist, Valentine, is a joke almost comical. In fact, nearly every scenes in this movie are satirical. Albeit his ruthless disregard to human life, his solution to global warming nevertheless is practical and creative (I mean in this movie, not applicable to real life). Depopulate human via sim card, thus enable to save the earth from being destroyed by the atrocious and ungrateful species living in it. Almost all presidents and royals agreed to deal with him. I say Valentine is not that bad at all, he's just trying his best to save the world, in a different way.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is just another case of saving world from bad guy by the unsung secret agents.

"classicsoncall","8","2","16","14 February 2015"," ""This ain't that kind of movie, Bro.""
","I'll have to preface my review with an encouraging opening remark because I enjoyed the movie well enough for what it was. Others on this board seem to be of a general overall opinion that this was a James Bond genre spy film taken to an extreme level with over the top violence and excessively crude language. Oddly enough, I'm OK with all of that. There was a generous heaping of all the non-stop, violent action that one could ask for, even for Tarentino fans.<br/><br/>So here's where my rant come into play. Sorry, but I just can't help myself when the film invites the kind of criticism I'm about to unleash. I have a big problem with liberal hypocrisy, and it's never been more evident than in this picture. We'll start with the major premise of the villain going in, Richard Valentine, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. No beef with Jackson here. But his main agenda has to do with solving the world's 'global warming' problem. To be up front about it, I don't believe global warming or climate change is a man made condition based on common sense backed up by eons of history in which the planet has gone through numerous ice ages and come out of them without human intervention.<br/><br/>Valentine's prescription for global warming - wipe out a good portion of humanity who are contributing to it. But, but, but - only those who are not part of the elite class like the folks invited to his massive house party. Which is just about everyone on the planet. See, if liberals and progressives verbalized what they really believe, this would be part of their solution as well. We'll start with those pesky Conservatives and Republicans. They're too much of a problem to debate about this.<br/><br/>Next - gun violence. While the entire liberal propaganda machine tries to control gun ownership, there's apparently no problem with making movies in which one of the film's heroes takes out what, twenty, thirty, heck make it a hundred people in a wild melee at a hate church. By the way, that was an exceptionally well choreographed and edited action sequence, one of the best ever. It'll be hard to top, though we know someone will try.<br/><br/>OK, how about the War on Women. Gee, the Swedish Princess at the end of the story sure knew how to reward her 'savior' Eggsy (Taron Egerton). If you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about. I'm not squeamish but it's just too distasteful to describe it here.<br/><br/>How about creating conflict? Valentine's hate-gizmo is just an extension of the mindset the current administration perpetrates every day - white vs black, rich vs poor, men vs women (War on Women, remember), old vs young and so on. So it was genuinely stunning to see the picture at least take a swipe at the current POTUS by having his head blown off when Merlin (Mark Strong) tampers with the controls! Folks, I think you better see this picture before the President has a North Korean reaction to it, know what I mean.<br/><br/>So there you pretty much have it. Like I say, aside from my critical analysis, I enjoyed the picture. Biggest surprise was when Valentine blew away Harry (Colin Firth), almost as unexpected as George Clooney whacking Brad Pitt in ""Burn After Reading"". Tarentino would be proud."

"C22Man","5","1","6","10 May 2016"," Ludicrous in Every Sense
","Matthew Vaughn has proved himself to be a talented and versatile director, touching upon the crime, fantasy and superhero genres with mostly positive results. With Kingsman his focus turned to creating the most extravagant spy spoof imaginable. In its simplest terms, Kingsman is to the James Bond film series what Kick-Ass is to the average superhero film. Every aspect is pushed to its limits in an attempt to create a wild mix of shock and awe. It's brash, crude, ultra- violent, highly stylised and full of exaggerated characters. Where Kick-Ass worked because of its wit and overblown set-pieces, I feel that Kingsman is just too straight-forward and juvenile in its humour to truly succeed despite some impressive features.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty basic as we see down on his luck chav Eggsy join a secret spy service named Kingsman which his father had once belonged to, undertaking training and attempting to stop an internet mastermind from taking over the world. The issues with the plot are mainly to do with its simplicity in that we've seen this type of story so many times. Once you know the beats everything else goes out the window, we know Eggsy will use his skills to be a part of Kingsman and that makes the entire training section (which is a good third) obsolete. You certainly have to admire the film for just how big the plot is and how excessive it is willing to go in attempts to spoof Bond, but a lot of it is tired and predictable.<br/><br/>In terms of its comedy and spoof attempts the film is very mixed. The more straight British humour is always welcomed and Jackson provides plenty of amusement with his over-the-top villain. Plus anything references the Bond series usually stands out too. With that said, there are a lot of puns that just don't work and some of the jokes end up feeling completely out of place. Crude humour can be very effective if used correctly, but I think that the crude jokes are mistimed here and that the film does suffer from becoming too reliant on them at many points. The final joke really does end things on a bum note (pun intended there).<br/><br/>It's hard to fault the cast however. Taron Egerton does a fine job in his big screen debut, handling the comedy with finesse and convincing as a spy in training. Eggsy could easily have been an annoying or unlikeable character so he did well to provide him with such charisma. Colin Firth is excellent as Eggsy's mentor figure Galahad, possessing a smooth charm absent in many of his roles and being surprisingly convincing in the action scenes. Samuel L. Jackson is in top form here with a brilliantly extravagant performance. With a goofy lisp, it's a fun call to the classic early Bond villains with Jackson being engaging and frequently hilarious whenever he's on screen. Mark Strong is good fun as the Scottish technological savvy Merlin. Michael Caine shows up as Kingsman head Arthur though he gets little to do and Sophie Cookson is just okay as Eggsy's sweet teammate.<br/><br/>The film is appropriately stylised and slick looking, reminiscent of Vaughn's X-Men film. It fits the film given its homages to the classic Bond films and other grand spy flicks, though I think the villain's lair could have been more creative. Sadly the score by Henry Jackman and Matthew Margeson is very forgettable, as instead of doing a take on the scores of the Bond or Bourne films it just turns into a generic action soundtrack with little to remember. Despite the films spoof nature there aren't as many references as there could have been and I think the film would have been more fun had it made these clearer. The action sequences are arguably the highlights of the film. They are filmed excellently and with a real sense of flair, with the church scene in particular being delightfully chaotic.<br/><br/>Kingsman is undeniably fun at times and does have some understanding of how to poke fun at its subject matter. The problems I have with it are mostly down to its simplistic plot line and over-reliance on crude humour. It's a story we've seen too many times and it really missed a trick not taking apart the typical spy formula more. Whilst the jokes can work, I feel that there is a lack of wit to much of the comedy and it appears to backtrack to crudeness whenever it's unsure of what to do next. With that said I do find the acting enjoyable with Jackson really standing out, the action is outstanding and the film does have an unquestionable style. I think the potential for a great film was here, but we'll have to make do with enjoying the fun pieces placed throughout."
"lavatch","Null","1","6","28 December 2015"," The First Film in the ""Kingsman"" Franchise
","Based on the comic book ""The Secret Service,"" the blockbuster film ""Kingsman"" enjoyed tremendous popularity in its theatrical release. What is the appeal of this film that may lead to a ""Kingsman"" franchise motion picture with endless sequels? <br/><br/>First, there is the humor that transcends the typical James Bond suave and supremely confident British snobbery. Second, there is Colin Firth, who was perfect in the role of Harry Hart (or Galahad), who is the linchpin in the non-political secret organization of Kingsmen. Third, there is the outstanding cinematography that included well-chosen location filming in the UK.<br/><br/>The film was neither a rip-off nor a parody of a James Bond film. It sought to distill the theme of overpopulation and global warning into a profound social commentary. It was in this area that the film foundered, especially with the cardboard cutout villain character. Although well performed by Samuel L. Jackson, the role was conceived an an over-the-top and nearly farcical character.<br/><br/>An inadvertent revelation from the film is the theme of the loss of basic human values in the twenty-first century. The villainous Valentine was using technology to turn humans against one another in endless slaughter to reduce global population. But a casual glance at our world indicates that it would not take sophisticated technology to create a civilization in this kind of decline. Although the film is a hodgepodge of styles, it nonetheless raises provocative values about our world. Some of the scenes, such as the carnage in the church, were shocking. But are they really much different from what exists in our top news stories?"
"kira02bit","6","1","6","11 November 2015"," Technically well done, although a vein of nastiness makes it stumble
","Kingsman: The Secret Service details the adventures of a young English man, improbably nicknamed Eggsy (Taron Egerton), whose brush with the law ends up with him recruited by secret agent extraordinaire Harry Hart (Colin Firth) to vie for an open slot in the British Secret Service. Meanwhile, villainous billionaire Samuel L. Jackson launches a scheme to decimate the world's population leaving only the greedy elite left standing.<br/><br/>Kingsman is a spoofy take on the old James Bond/British spy thrillers of yore with questionable attempts at being topical and edgy thrown into the mix. Most of the film contrasts Eggsy's adventures in his various tests, while Harry investigates Jackson. There is much that works well here thanks to director Matthew Vaughn knowing his way around an action scene. Unfortunately, the jarring shifts in tone and a streak of unwelcome nastiness running down its center prevent the film from reaching its full potential.<br/><br/>It is fascinating to see typical villain Mark Strong cast in a good guy role and the usually avuncular Michael Caine cast as a nasty snob. Jack Davenport is a handsome and charming actor, so it is a bit annoying to see him constantly wasted in thankless franchise roles. Sophie Cookson's rather generic heroine is nicely balanced by Sofia Boutella as Jackson's vicious henchwoman with lethal blades for legs. It is great to see Jackson eschew the tired tough guy persona as a blood-averse, lisping psychopath. In the central role, a star is born in Egerton, who demonstrates the charm, comic timing and appeal required, and has the hard-bodied physique to make the physical scenes half-credible. The film's biggest strength is Firth in a cheeky salute to prior spy legends – who has a fetish with tailored clothes and manners – always manners! Looking at the preview of Kingsman, it would appear to be a frothy, light-hearted romp through spy clichés. The end result is unexpectedly different and not necessarily in a good way. There are fun segments, but they are often side-lined by psychotically over-the-top brutal violence with people being skewered, slashed, hacked apart or having their heads explode. Similarly, the dialog is littered with near non-stop foul language. All of this serves little purpose given the slightness of the screenplay except a laughably misguided attempt to make the whole endeavor seem hard-edged. It has rather the opposite effect, often taking one out the action and giving them time to realize the preposterousness of what we see.<br/><br/>Attempts to make what we see topical or gritty often border on the offensive. The film adopts a rather cavalier view of the serious problem of global warming. A later scene set in a church obviously modeled on the notorious Phelps Church of Kansas devolves into an orgy of off-the-scale violence and brutality, barely made palatable given the odiousness of the victims. The final test for the Kingsman candidates hangs on their willingness to murder the puppies they were given at the start of training. The film also has the US president going along with Jackson's plot and we get a stand-in who is obviously supposed to be current President Obama – which culminates later with the First Family's heads literally exploding on screen – something which no doubt plays well in conservative circles. These attempts at edginess often seem more crass than clever.<br/><br/>Further missteps abound. As likable as Egerton is, the film only really kicks into high gear whenever Firth is on screen. An accident leaves his character sidelined for too much of the film and then he is almost immediately written out soon after – leaving a gaping hole. For being so smart, the Kingsman make an awful lot of dumb mistakes. When Harry realizes immediately that his cover has been compromised, he still partakes of a dinner with Jackson and ends up swallowing a tracker which leads the villain to Kingsman headquarters. Furthermore, does anyone believe that most of the world's leaders would agree to having a device in their heads that could cause them to explode? The concluding action at the villain's not-so-secret lair is increasingly silly. The heroes' initial plan on how to foil Jackson by taking down one of his satellites seems foolish since even the audience can foresee he will have a back-up and it takes our heroes forever to see a solution staring everyone else right in the face.<br/><br/>Despite some strong action sequences, amusing moments and a great cast, what is one to think when the scenes fresh in one's mind when exiting is that one character just leaned into the camera and barfed straight into the lens (one could say on the viewers) and that Eggsy's final act as an agent trained in good manners is to have anal sex with a kidnapped Swedish princess? Manners, indeed!"

","A very pleasant surprise watching this movie, that I hadn't heard much about beforehand, but this is the best spy/action movie I've seen in a long while. This movie is everything the new Bond should have been and wasn't . Top marks all round, action scenes, the well-acted characters are easy to engage with, storyline although far-fetched has an old style bond kind of narrative to it, as does the tongue in cheek comedy. The baddies are bad and the hero's to be cheered for. It's never going to tax the mind or engage on deeper levels or even end up being a classic, but it's one I'll buy on DVD and watch again. What can I say, watch and enjoy. A second one of these couldn't come soon enough."

","I'm sure you have seen some good and bad reviews of this movie on here. The ones that love it give it 10/10 and the haters are the total opposite and not many in between. I can't fathom those that hate, as surely they would have known what sort of movie they are going to see, so why bother if you don't like this sort of thing? It's like me going to see some teary chick flick (which I hate), then coming on here and bagging it to the hilt. Not sure what these haters expect from a movie with an R rating. I shake my head in disbelief. Movies are meant to be entertaining and engaging and by god, Kingsman is all that and more. It has loads of violence, action special effects and comedy. What more could you want? Do yourself a favour and see it if you want to be entertained. Don't see it if you don't like these types of movies. Pretty simple really."

","When I first saw the trailer for Kingsman: The Secret Service , I thought of it as a Young Adult Spy Kids or James Bond. Don't get me wrong, I had every intention of seeing this movie because A) I like Spy Kids and James Bond, and B) I like Young Adult movies. But after it came out, I realized that this movie is actually rated 'R' which takes it decidedly out of the Young Adult genre. Regardless, it still landed on my ""want to see"" list because of the trailers and the marvelous tech they showed in it.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, the movie is violent. Over the top violent. Like, Kick-Ass and Wanted violent. In fact, it turns out that the screenplay for both Kick-Ass and The Kingsman was written by the same man that directed them, the very talented Matthew Vaughn. And the film itself is based of a comic book series written by Mark Millar, who also wrote both the Kick-Ass and Wanted comic books. (See a trend here?) The film has two different story lines as Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is attempting to stop the evil villain, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) while Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is training to become a Kingsman. Throw in a bad ass female with blades for feet (Boutella), Michael Caine doing his thing, and more spy gadgets than you could shake a Q at, and you have a recipe for success. <br/><br/>The movie is a fun and fast paced run through the spy world, filled with evil villains, spies, and of course spy gadgets. In other words, go see it."
"imim123","6","1","6","28 August 2015"," A Typical Good Movie with a Bad Script
","English is not my mother tongue, please excuse any errors on my part.<br/><br/>I really like the concept of a gentleman spy. The idea that there exists a secret spy society that saves the world from villains while still maintaining the image of a perfect gentleman leaves us infinite imagination space. I hope there will be a sequel to this movie because much more stories can be told about this secret organization.<br/><br/>Another great feature of this movie is the decent actions. Certain aspects of the action scenes were done well and some of the bullet time actions was good. My favorite action scene is the massacre in the church though a lot of people claim that it is revoltingly violent and disturbingly bloody. But I prefer to call it ""the aesthetics of violence"". No where in the world has the issue of media violence been such debated as in our society. From my point of view, there is no necessary correlation between media violence and ""real"" violence. On the contrary, I expect movies to be an outlet for pressure and stress.<br/><br/>The best performance came from Colin Firth. He took his role seriously and played it to the hilt. The personality of the role ""Harry Hart"" is one of several highlights in this movie. Colin's wonderful performance and wholehearted dedication perfectly interpreted the meaning of a gentleman spy.<br/><br/>This movie has many advantages, but its disadvantages are equally notable. The worst of all is the bad script. I expected this new movie might be a innovation, but is still a stereotype. As a throwback to the old spy flick, it fails in many aspects. the concept of a kid taking over for his dad and quasi predecessor is a cliché. The idea of a Swedish princess offering anal sex to the hero is just absurd. moreover, it tells a story about a dotcom genius with an aversion to blood who wants to destroy the world, does this sound familiar? These film clichés are overused in cinemas and it astonished me to see them in this movie.As the movie progresses, the entire of validity of the character's morals were flushed down the drain.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the English jokes always bounce me out of the movie. Granted I am used to American jokes and I get that English humor is a bit different, but I still don't think nuclear head explosion or McDonalds being served on a sliver plate is that much funny anymore.<br/><br/>Once again, I apologize for any mistake in my English."

"thijsky","8","1","6","13 July 2015"," Full of Clichés, mediocre CGI, bad catchphrases and what not. But god, it's awesome.
","I watched this movie because i saw the making of one of the best fighting scenes in the past 22 years. And that is because i haven't lived any longer. Imagine my surprise when i was greeted by some mediocre looking CGI explosions, titles and landscapes in the first few opening minutes. Since mediocre CGI has taken over modern movies i was afraid it would be another one of these blockbuster blow-out movies which will be forgotten in about three weeks (which did turn out to happen, but more on that later) that have come out the past decade. It had a lot of action movie clichés, some toe curling one-liners and a standard action movie plot. ""But why did i give it a 8/10?"" i hear you ask. Well, let me explain.<br/><br/>This movie is just plain awesome. Remember the old days, when an action hero fights one villain and explosions ensue? Where the villain gets too close to the protagonist and battle commences a couple of minutes later? Where there is a villain that genuinely believes in his own purpose and is charming and persuasive, instead of that modern day whiny and sad? Yes, i am talking about the 80's, where some appalling summer blockbusters came from, but where the actual birth of true action heroes was. I wasn't yet born back then, but i genuinely believe that that was wad made a awesome movie. I adore this movie as i did a film like ""demolition man"" when i first saw it.<br/><br/>But back to this movie. It breathes every action hero ever in existence, every villain in existence and every bond-ripoff ever in existence. Of course I had to pull the old JB in here (even the movie mentioned JB) but as i see it, anyone that is used to the sludge that was draining from Hollywoods sewers the past decade only sees that because it is a spy movie with a couple of British leading characters. It shows a rather poor sense of movies if you hold it against this movie.<br/><br/>The only thing that generally annoyed me was that Samuel L. Jackson spoke the entire movie with a severe lisp. I do not know if that's Jacksons real-life problem, or if it a character trait of the main villain Valentine, but it was exceptionally annoying. If it is some kind of physical problem, i am deeply sorry, and i will not say ""what"" one more time. Best villain performance ever, though.<br/><br/>This films has some problems. But it is the old-school bad-*** action that brings it in my ""top 10 of the past decade"" list as a nice second. It has only five spots taken now. And the first is still empty. So i hope this new flow of 80's style action movies keeps coming and gives me my number one. Nice try for the Kingsmen now."

","THE MOVIE KINGSMAN:THE SECRET SERVICE MOVIE IS SUPERB AND THE PLOT IS NICE MOVIE I HAVE WATCH ITS GOOD CONCEPT COMIC MOVIE........................... KINGSMAN is yet another comic book mess, this time about a South London petty criminal who is given the chance to join a private intelligence agency only to find himself fighting against both class prejudice and a mad dot com genius with an aversion to blood who wants to murder most of the population to save the world from global warming. It's amusing to see a film be disrespectful about Obama and AGW but the film is morally repulsive and stupid. It wants to be a silly but fun globe-trotting adventure like old James Bond films but those films had wit, exotic travel, high living and great stunts whilst this film is crude, stuffed with fake-looking CGI, charmless and has stupid jeopardy-free action scenes; I lost count of just how many times the bad guy's goons had the hero in their sights but missed him. The promised Chad to gentleman transformation never occurs - apparently being comfortable with who you are is what makes a gentleman - with the hero starting as a lout and ending up as a lout in a bespoke suit. What really sinks the film though is its lack of a moral compass. I could complain about the crudity of having a Swedish princess offer anal sex to the hero but the real culprit is the way the film mixes comic book sensibilities with hyper-realistic violence. People are tortured and cut in half without a qualm. Worst of all is a sequence in the middle where a (hate) church full of people are driven mad and kill each other in an orgy of improvised and graphic violence which is shot like an action scene as if it is entertainment and goes on forever. If you want to see Colin Firth brutally and repeatedly stabbing a woman in the stomach then this is the film for you."

","Over the years I have seen many spy-thrillers. The more obvious being the James Bond films based upon the Ian Fleming novels. Each James Bond film has a unique maniacal villain with world domination as his main agenda.<br/><br/>This film is no different. Here we have internet billionaire Richmond Valentine(Samuel L. Jackson) who leads a paranoid and selfish existence. He believes the world is doomed by global warming - and the only solution is a worldwide cull. And so, he sets about his plans in gusto.<br/><br/>Then we have hero of the film, young Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin(Taron Egerton) who leads a sad existence in the ghetto. The death of his father gives him an opportunity to join Kingsman, a secret intelligence agency that fights against terrorist threats.<br/><br/>In the film we have the typical gadgets or gizmo's that your average agent needs. We also have the kill sequences similar to the Bond movies, however with updated C.G.I. effects in all their glory. The main factor that makes the film work is that the script is well polished, the action and acting is thoroughly controlled, the cinematography and sound-effects are superb. <br/><br/>Some actors shine more than others, here we have Samuel Jackson and Colin Firth as one of the best. Mark Hamill has a small cameo as Professor James Arnold. I hardly recognized him at all. Just by looking at the end credits did I realize that he was in the film. Taron David Egerton makes a good leap from TV into mainstream Hollywood. <br/><br/>Matthew Vaughan has made some good films in the past like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000) and directing the films Layer Cake (2004), Stardust (2007), Kick-Ass (2010), X-Men: First Class (2011). He has some similarity in style with other directors like Chris Nolan and Paul W.S. Anderson.<br/><br/>Verdict: definitely a good way to pass one and a half hours. But I wouldn't watch the film again. Typical toilet paper film. <br/><br/>You may also like: The 39 Steps 1959, North By NorthWest 1959, Torn Curtain 1966, The Ipcress File 1965, The Odessa File 1974, Firefox (1982), The Fourth Protocol 1987, The Bourne Identity 1988, The Russia House (1990), If Looks Could Kill (released in the UK as Teen Agent) 1991, Mission Impossible 1996. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading this review.

","Despite the hundreds of clichés and no-surprises, this mimic to WANTED was actually ten times more enjoyable than that Angelina Jolie flick. The action is fun, the plot is numb and Sam Jackson's lisp is dumb. But, if you can safely leave your brain at the door, the movie works. Namely because of action Colin Firth and assassin Sofia Boutella. The ""lead,"" Taron Egerton is a ton cute, but his character – basically a third-tier Captain Kirk from 2009's STAR TREK, was so unbelievable from the get-go, it was too-hard of a sell. Overall, it's a fun action piece that works only because on how silly it is and how much Colin Firth gave Liam Neeson a run for his retirement money."
"wolfneck","9","1","6","17 February 2015"," Unwin, Gary Unw..... Sh!
","Early on in the film, Galahad (Colin Firth) asks Eggsy (Taron Egerton) if he's seen Trading Places, Le Femme Nikita or Pretty Woman, as a way to describe their relationship. For those of you who don't know, all those films, simply put, depicts down on luck protagonist(s) meeting a benefactor who brings them to a higher level. Eggsy, upon realizing Galahad's intention, counters with My Fair Lady, a film that has a similar plot to those mentioned, but was in theaters way before the rest. Kingsman: The Secret Service displays this intention by being a spy film that would not fit nicely with today's Jason Bourne or Ethan Hunt, but instead stands beside 1960's Roger Moore's James Bond.<br/><br/>Galahad is a member of the Kingsman, a secret spy agency, who recruits Eggsy into spy school because Eggsy's father saved his life years ago. Eggsy makes friends, gets made fun of and shows calmness and ingenuity when it comes to his tests. Unfortunately, he fails his final test and gets kicked out. However, an evil plan concocted by Richmond Valentine (Samuel L Jackson) leaves Kingsman crippled and Eggsy is required to help save the day.<br/><br/>Plot wise, there really isn't anything original. Richmond Valentine stole 70% of his plan from Hugo Drax (1979's Moonraker) and Karl Stromberg (1977's The Spy Who Loved Me), both of who just happened to be villains in the Roger Moore Bond era. The mentions of My Fair Lady and co. obviously depicts Galahad and Eggsy's interaction and relationship throughout the film. The story of the chosen one who excels, get kicked out and returns to save the day is a plot line that has been in films for ages. You will even see most of the twists coming. (Come on, Michael Caine is obviously not that nice a guy. 4 out of his 5 films post Dark Knight Rises had him play someone whose intentions ain't that pure)<br/><br/>However, I don't think Kingsman was trying to achieve anything fresh in the first place. It pays a huge homage to spy films, in particular to, once again, Bond films. Kingsman feels like MI6, with Arthur (Michael Caine) taking the role of M and Merlin (Mark Strong) taking on Q. Gadgets that can do anything are disguised in everyday objects. The ""Bond Girl"", largely unseen throughout the film, fulfills her role near the end by sleeping with Eggsy, a move that would be completely illogical and came out of nowhere unless she's a Bond girl. Valentine, a character with questionable fashion sense, speaks with a lisp and vomits upon seeing blood, feels like one of those goofy, over-the- top maniacs that Sean Connery and Roger Moore faced during their tenure as Bond.<br/><br/>They also had a phone in the shoe joke (Get Smart) and what appeared to me as musical cues from Austin Powers's Dr Evil? <br/><br/>Yet on the other hand, it is self aware enough to make fun of the clichés present in spy films. ""There is no elaborate traps and even more elaborate escapes from the super spy."" and ""You wouldn't find a cheesy punchline anywhere near this film"" are points raised by characters in Kingsman. As Valentine says in the film:""We ain't that type of movie.""<br/><br/>The fight scenes in Kingsman are glorious, especially those by Colin Firth. To put it in words, the fight scenes are one long take focusing primarily on Galahad using tons of creatively badass ways to kill people. The choreography is beautiful, the blood and gore actually brings you into the action and there seem to be no end to the number of ways you can kill someone. You really have to see it to believe it. Those by Taron Egerton weren't as fun to watch, but he still does a decent job. Kudos to the Black Widow signature.<br/><br/>There are of course minor flaws with the film. The CGI are really horrendous during several points in the film, particularly the fight between Eggsy and Gazelle (Sofia Boutella). That will take you out of the moment. The protagonists makes some really questionable choices. Eggsy clearly would have known the gun he needs to shoot the dog with wasn't loaded. Kingsman already faked out twice beforehand with the parachute and train tracks. They also should have given more for Roxy (Sophie Cookson) to do, being another fully capable Kingsman, but she does well throughout the film<br/><br/>Kingsman is a cross between a spy film and a spy film spoof. Instead of being indecisive and messing up its tone and direction, it manages to achieve a delicate balance between the two genres. You will still keep in mind the lingering danger the characters face while you witness the goofy humor Kingsman exhibits. It really is great fun to watch."
"vistheindian","8","1","6","17 February 2015"," Classic Bond on Steroids
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>After the loss of an agent the Kingsman spy organization start a recruitment process to find a replacement. Harry Hart codenamed Galahad (Colin Firth) believes that a street kid named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) has the potential to be a fellow Kingsman. Meanwhile billionaire Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has plans for worldwide domination that could cost billions of lives. Kingsman is mindblowing, nay, it is mindblasting fun. Director Matthew Vaughn, brings us another comic book movie that is not only well made but reinvents the spy genre with clever satire. This is a throwback to the classic bond films, but with all crazy violence and beautiful action of Kick-Ass. Watch this movie unless you hate having a good time.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>I will confess that when I first saw the trailer for Kingsman I thought it looked a little campy. Then I heard Matthew Vaughn was directing and instantly all my doubts disappeared. This man has proved that he can take a genre that has been done to death and reinvigorate with new life. Kingsman is exactly that.<br/><br/>In this day and age, dark and gritty tones are all the craze when making an action movie. That's fine when done well but most of the time it forces all personality out of the film. Kingsman on the other hand is an homage to old spy movies, filled with crazy gadgets, eccentric villain, intimidating henchman (henchwoman in this case), and of course a wacky plan for world supremacy. This type of film in the wrong hands would definitely have been cheesier than hot pot full of fondue. However, the movie is fully aware of what it is and with the help of some satirical comedy it is able to get away with the absurdity. Then there are the action sequences that were gruesome pieces of art. Best of which was the fight scene at the church. The insane choreography with probably one of the longest chain kills in cinema made my jaw drop. I would pay full ticket price for that scene alone.<br/><br/>Colin Firth is the perfect gentleman, sophisticated, well dressed, with just the right amount of mystery. But if you get on his bad side, good luck because he is going knock yours and half dozen other people's teeth out without breaking a sweat. Taron Egerton is a newcomer to Hollywood but I have a feeling he is bound for more. He plays a character that is clearly a street delinquent, but you can tell deep down he is kind hearted. He transforms himself inspired by Firth's character, and by the end of the movie you are cheering him on with every punch and pull of the trigger. A movie is only as good as its villain, and Samuel L. Jackson was a great villain. He is an internet billionaire genius in his 60's who wears clothes like a teenage hip- hop artist, and plans to kill billions of people but can't stand the sight of blood. What? And yet he is having so much fun playing this character that you can't help but laugh with him.<br/><br/>With Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and now Kingsman, Matthew Vaughn for me has become the best comic book movie director out there right now. Funny dialog (occasionally inappropriate but no harm done), amazingly choreographed violent action, and memorable characters helped revitalize an entire genre with a modern twist. An endlessly fun adventure that I will definitely experience multiple times in cinema.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

","Every year there are a few films that fly under the radar.

I'm talking about films that you just want to sit back and enjoy and instead walk away much happier than anticipated. Kingsman: The Secret Service is the first of 2015 for me.<br/><br/>With the right amount of action and comedy, the director Matthew Vaughn delivers a film that most people of the genre will love. It's very violent and at times over the top.

This leads to bringing the boy to train to be the next ""Kingsman"". But first he must beat out around 10 other candidates. The series of tests that the recruits are put through are thrilling scenes to watch.<br/><br/>The fight choreography gets better throughout the movie including a massive fight in a church and the final fight near the end. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes action/comedy. I would also just recommend it to anyone who enjoys good movies. A solid 8/10"
"kasenero1973","9","1","6","16 February 2015"," Best I have seen so far this year
","The trailer hooked me so good. Every time it would come on, I would need to stop what I was doing to see it all the way through. Usually when this happens, that just means I have set the expectations on a film too high. It happened with Robocop, for example... and the Lego Movie. But this one did not disappoint me at all. I was pleasantly surprised with what the movie ended up being about. And after seeing Mr. Firth fight on both of the Bridget Jones movies, I was so not expecting him to be able to open up a can of whop a-.I have to say, they need to give Mr Jackson more roles like this. He is so good. I hadn't seen such a good action movie in a while. The pace, the story and the action were just perfect,IMO."
"palombo-angelo","9","1","6","16 February 2015"," ""Manners Maketh Man!""
","This movie is without a doubt incredible! I wish that it didn't end, because it was that good! Simply, the action scenes were some of the best I've ever seen, the acting was fantastic, and the characters were awesome. This film focuses on a young boy who has been somewhat of a delinquent his whole life and finally embraces his true potential when he gets the chance to become a kingsman; which is basically an international spy. Every moment of this movie was just great. It is full of laughs and huge twists that will shock you along the way. Taron Egerton, as the star, will definitely be in many more films to come. This movie was amazing, and I'm sure if you enjoy cool characters, inappropriate humor, and classy gentleman who can totally kick ass, then this is the movie for you."
"muons","1","1","7","23 January 2019"," A sorry parody of Bond movies spiced up with senseless mayhem
","Kingsman is a mishmash of 007 (of the cheesy type with P. Brosnan or R. Moore starring), inspector gadget and any of Tarantino's mindless gore-fests. Its target audience is pre-teen white boys. It's not a movie that a normal adult -including those action lovers- can sit through its entire length. Indeed, I was doing something else while watching it with the corner of my eye. Once, my job was finished after 2 hours of TV time -including commercials, I tuned the channel somewhere else, so I don't know how the story ended nor do I care.<br/><br/>A lot of reviewers complain about the violence. It's true that the movie is loaded with senseless blood and gore however, its presentation is so puerile that you can't really take it seriously. Take the 10 min long carnage in the church scene, for example. Everything looks so comically surreal and artificial, that it makes you shake your head instead of cringing and looking away. I don't know why Colin Firth, S. Jackson and M. Cain star in this travesty. One would think actors of their stature would be more selective with the quality of the movies they act in, no matter how much they are compensated for. On the other hand, the two lead characters are so lame and fluffy that no amount of heavy weight actor can put the story on its feet."
"lee_eisenberg","8","1","7","4 July 2015"," James Bond meets Harry Palmer meets ""Trading Places"" meets graphic novels
","Superspy movies are among the most commonly spoofed, but that doesn't weaken ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"". Colin Firth once again gets to play a gentleman, while Samuel L. Jackson's megalomaniac businessman is the neatest character in the movie (and yes, he does use the word that Jackson uses in a number of his movies). And then there's a certain actor known as a certain Jedi. It's clear that they knew exactly what kind of a movie they were making, so they just let it be as outlandish as possible. Not a masterpiece, but funny enough to enjoy.<br/><br/>PS: The song played at the beginning of the movie is Dire Straits' ""Money for Nothing"", which ""Weird Al"" Yankovic spoofed as ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" for ""UHF""."
"CinematicInceptions","8","1","7","25 April 2015"," Action driven and fun. Slightly disappointing story.
","The one word I would use to sum up this movie is: cool. The main intent of the filmmakers was to make an adrenaline fueled action film with awesome fight scenes and gadgets that, while they may be sort of cheap, are great fun to use and see used. The story is nothing special, though you could argue that it makes up for this by parodying other spy movies and world-saving plots.<br/><br/>I'll get the plot out of the way first. Personally, I was disappointed in it because the trailers and ratings it was getting made it seem like it would have a mildly interesting story. I must admit that the way Valentine tries to self destruct humans is different and fairly interesting. I've heard that one of the things that is supposed to drive a film is a ticking clock, but I feel like this and many other recent films (e.g. Winter Soldier, MI 2 and 4, 2012, Avengers, Dark Knight Rises) take this a little too literally and make the entire climax scene based on how fast a certain computer file or whatever can upload. The driving force behind the entire plot is action. Basically every plot element is used to spoof other spy movies or as an excuse to add in a fight scene, though most of the excuses are pretty good and plausible. However, there is a little bit too much seriousness for it to officially be a spoof.<br/><br/>The characters could have been better. Eggsy isn't an award winningly written hero, though you can sympathize with and root for him to an extent. Harry Hart is probably the main character and undeniably has the most depth and he's generally cool besides. Arthur is written with okay proficiency, though he isn't on the upper side of Michael Caine characters. Merlin, while he has little depth, is a very prominent face with an agreeable personality. Roxy I think could have been written better since she got a lot of screen time and was a mentor of sorts to Eggsy but was never really treated seriously as a character. Valentine isn't really an interesting villain since he has little or no motive for his villainous actions, but he is different in that he sees the problem with keeping his adversaries alive when he has a chance to eliminate the danger they pose. His Noah's ark speech bumps him up a level as a villain since it makes him persuasive and charismatic. I really wish the original Lancelot (Jack Davenport) hadn't been killed off in the first few minutes because I loved his character right away. <br/><br/>Of course the biggest element is the action. Most of it involves the use of ultra-cool spy gear like Harry's umbrella. The scene where all of the government bureaucrats' heads explode is a little ridiculous (though if you're a Republican you might enjoy seeing Obama's lid combust into blue smoke in that scene). The fight scenes get a little over the top, but not excessively bloody. Of the movies I've seen, only Desolation of Smaug and The Amazing Spiderman 2 parallel the action choreography of Kingsmen. The church brawl is probably the most incredible raw fight scene in all of cinema (by the way, the people may have fought each other by Valentine's wishes, but something must be said for the fact that they all brought guns and knives to church with them). The training scenes were pretty good, but it seemed like there was a step that got missed in the transition from pretty good martial arts skills to one man wrecking machine level. The way the bullet proof suits are utilized is pretty good, though you might say that they reduce the quality of the heroes.<br/><br/>In terms of overall quality, I guess it gets a B-. The acting isn't exceptional, but it's slightly above average. Visual effects of course gets very high scores. The script isn't great, and goes a bit overboard with it's language. Sometimes that works out fine like in Good Will Hunting where the language feels natural and fits the overall setting, but here I felt like they just threw a few curses in without any real reason behind them. The camera work in the skydiving scene was pretty good, and it wasn't all GoPro cameras. The ominous red used in Valentine's cave added to the serious and spoof atmosphere. Henry Jackman's score was incredible with his intense horns. Lastly, I felt that they used slow-mo pretty well.<br/><br/>My overall rating for this is 8.5/10, but I've decided to round down because I don't think it deserves to be on the Top 250 and is about to move off anyways. If you like action and can sit through a weaker plot for two hours, definitely put it on your list. The satirical feel is present though not overpoweringly prominent. Think more Ocean's Eleven than Mel Brooks comedy. So for all action fans, definitely consider renting or impulse buying."

","Saw this last night and read some of the reviews. Yes, over the top with some of the violence, but know that it is what it was supposed to be. Colin Firth plays the role well and Samuel L Jackson brings a comic villain. The low ratings were most definitely individuals that had expectations of a serious Bond film. I would say this is a cross between Bond and Austin Powers. 80% good and 20% campy. Sit back and enjoy a film for what it was made for: entertainment.<br/><br/>As for the ""sexualizing women"" comments. I didn't see it. One scene, but otherwise they play a strong role as a good and bad individual. But the one scene brings the human aspect into it."

","I really liked this film. It was a mix of the Avengers and James Bond. Not quite as slick all the way through as a James Bond flick but that's what gave it a distinguishing feel. A lot of old-new tech all the way through. A lot of new-new tech as in spy flicks as always too. I liked that. It is the story of an underdog. Also,I have never seen S Jackson in a role like this film. Pretty good. Colin Firth is great. Some of the cheeky humor goes overboard. Quite a lot of lines they use to make fun of other spy film phrases, actions, etc.However,the not so smooth feel of it makes it more interesting, I think. James Bond is not fallible, these folks are. I would have rated it higher,but if felt like so much of the story is missing....maybe on the cutting room floor? I think they needed a bit more to immerse me in the training portion and other sections of the film."
"Diogo-Costa","8","1","7","4 April 2015"," Summed Up Review
","I really liked the movie, it's a very good movie for those who search for a action movie with a little sense of humor. There is also the Eggsy's personality change factor that helps the quality of the film. That ""vintage spy"" style that Eggsy acquires is clearly unexpected early in the film and the young personality of the actor himself turns out to be a fairly complete film. Eggsy becomes a responsible secret agent for but keeping with him the young and rebellious spirit. Also is detachable the great role of Samuel L. Jackson that also manages to be a hilarious villain and a great evil master,with a touch of intelligence and also some ignorance. Definitely recommend the whole community ;)"
"bensclone","6","1","7","3 April 2015"," Kids version of James Bond Rebooted crossed with fifty shades of Grey
","The movie is definitely worth a watch, but it sits in that awkward space between being a little too mature for tweens, (tweens wont get some of the throwback references) and and a little lacking for parents. (meaning, that only the 'new kids on the block' are able to save the world, when, the 'Kingsman' could have used any number of their veteran, battle-hardy field agents with years of experience instead.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is tongue-in-cheek, with good guys easily overcoming multiple baddies, all the while not loosing their cool or British charm.<br/><br/>In addition, the movie ends with the boy getting the girl, just like in all bond movies, and the girl promises that the protagonist will get 'more than a kiss' if he does save the world. When that is developed, the girl literally says that he can put it in here asshole.<br/><br/>Naturally the boy saves the world and the movie ends showing the girl sprawled on a bed, with her bum in the air, without nickers on.<br/><br/>Obviously its all meant in good fun, but for me personally, I would hate for my teen daughter to behave in such a fashion, and found it in quite poor taste. I saw the move while abroad, and truly hope that part is edited out for audiences here in Australia."
"lhunt-9","8","1","7","1 April 2015"," Best of its genre... and it might be a new genre!
","Kingsman is just a little over the top, as it's laced with comic book violence, but somehow, that manages to stay in the background. So, start with a little bit of the Matrix, add in a big helping of ""JB"" (James Bond, Jason Bourne or Jack Bauer, your pick), and finish, maybe, with Mars Attacks and exploding heads (sorry about that part!)... and wrap it up in a Saville Row suit. How does that sound? Samuel Jackson is a smashing (eccentric) bad guy, newcomers Sofia Boutella and Taron Egerton look to be on the rise, and then you have the dependability of Colin Firth, Michael Caine, and a couple of other familiar names. In summary, a suitable evening's diversion. I hope they do a sequel... I have a soft spot for underground lairs and high tech gimmicks, etc., etc."
"wonderland23","7","1","7","1 April 2015"," A movie that tried to innovate but failed...
","Maybe just I went to see the movie with high expectations but despite the good action takes, the plot was just about the same old cinema stereotypes. And the female characters... well, they were not characters, just empty vessels that were given a fake importance on the story, and that was quite disappointing. The movie brought unpredictable twists that surprised an audience that is used to know the whole story by the trailer and guess the end by the first 20 minutes of movie. But, really, those were conjunctures that didn't bring anything new to the structure, I feel like we saw the same Hollywood things, just under a well-confectioned mask."
"nicolechan916","6","1","7","27 March 2015"," A screenplay that verges on the point of trolling, but with cool action scenes.
","The movie started off pretty well, but it soon went downhill when I realized what kind of movie this was. Such troll, would be how I would describe this movie. The jokes are so corny that it just felt too ridiculous. OK, it was quite funny at times but not enough to make up for the rest of the ridiculousness.<br/><br/>The story itself is also a little typical. We have the bad guy, corrupt people in high places, the good guys, and the novice spy who becomes a professional during a crisis. And though I should be glad that this film did not have a typical romantic ending, in this case I will make an exception.<br/><br/>The character of the bad guy played by Samuel Jackson is just so offensive that I can't believe it. First off, he is of dark skin, which wouldn't really have made a difference except that in this case he had a lisp. So on top of being overall racist (black person playing a bad guy), they are emphasizing that racism by giving him a speech impediment (black people can't speak). I am hoping that this is the result of them so subtly bringing to light issues/ stereotypes by blatantly showing it.<br/><br/>The swearing and the gore. Oh my goodness. Really not necessary and adding to the ridiculous factor. I'm not a fan of swearing at all, but in some cases I concede that it actually helps to get the point across. But overusing it is definitely too much. The gore in fighting scenes too was a little much. The fireworks is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Though the gore was too explicit, the action scenes were actually pretty good. In fact, they were great. The camera work, fighting, editing, all worked together to create great action scenes. The music helped too.<br/><br/>There is a lot of big names in this, and they all played their part relatively well, but it does not change my mind about what I think about this film. I am also thinking that a lot of the humour in this film is 'British' so it is subtly but in a blatant way, showing all the things wrong in cinema or the world today. I don't know. Please let it be satirical.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
"firstruleofmethclub","7","1","7","26 March 2015"," While not as good as critics would have you believe, it's still the best film of 2015 thus far
","I saw two films in two days here, yesterday I saw Chappie which I was told I would hate and actually kinda liked, and today I saw Kingsman, which I was told I would LOVE and actually only kinda liked. As much as I try not to have any expectations going in, there's only so much you can do to avoid that. And because its hard to get a gauge on your outside influences, it can be hard to know just how much not loving a movie was because you had it over-hyped, and how much is because its just not your thing. I had the same problem with Gone Girl, and, like Gone Girl, I'm gonna assume it was predominantly the former and not the latter, and bump it up from three starts to three and a half by the skin of its teeth. Now you may have noticed that I said I ""didn't love"" it rather than ""it was garbage"". That's because I liked it, I really liked it and there is a lot you'll carry out from Kingsman that you'll hold on to for a long time. Matthew Vaughn is an absolute goddamn MASTER filmmaker, Colin Firth, Mark Hammil, Sam Jackson, Michael Caine, Mark Strong and Geoff Bell all get to flex their acting muscles here, and that is never gonna fail to get me stoked. You may not have heard of Taron Egerton or Sofie Boutella before, but mar my words, after their performances in this, you're gonna start hearing about them a lot, real damn soon. I'm calling it now, unless they somehow start making some monumentally poor decisions, household names by 2018. I did like Kingsman, and I feel obliged to tell you it earned the right to hold onto the top five box office for over a month, and its appeal is, while not universal, still broad. It may well be the best film of 2015 thus far, but it's also not so glamorous as most would have you believe."

","Kingsman: The Secret Service distinguishes itself as being the first 2015 premiere movie of the year when compared to the other dull films that have been released so far. Matthew Vaughn's use of the same formula that helped elevate the status of X-Men First Class once again hits the mark in Kingsman. The charismatic swagger that both films share really helps Kingsman achieve the status of a new age spy movie. The addition of some witty dialogue, flashy CGI, and substantial casting are just the icing on the big ol' cookie. Kingsman is truly an awesome movie that serves as a surprise since the 2015 movie year is currently experiencing its low."

The movie prefers style to realism, and gags to deep thoughts - which I do not mind at all. It is also meta in many ways, a celebration of the genres that inspired it.<br/><br/>The main flaw in this movie is the villain. In the movie they refer to the Bond-movies only being as good as their villains, and if that was the case with this movie, it wouldn't be that good. Jackson is charming as always, but the character itself is not that interesting. Luckily, the heroes are more than enough to keep you entertained, and the grand plot really does not matter that much.<br/><br/>And wow, Colin Firth really shows a new side of himself in this movie! Another thing: I am a bit uncertain about how the movie tries to convey an anti-elitist message. The main character is not born into luxury, but was it not for his father then he would not end up in the position he ends up in. And he does not seem to mind the privileges his newfound occupation gives him."

","Going into kingsman I had high hopes for a fun film and I believe that I got it in this hilariously fun spy comedy film. This film sees a young chav recruited into a secret spy organisation and with the help of his mentor he must defeat a crazy internet hacker who plans to destroy mankind. Newcomer tara egerton plays eggsy a character that could have been really annoying but he manages to pull off this role masterfully. He has enough charm and charisma to make you care about him and his situation and you really want to see him succeed, plus he is really funny. It helps that they give him a supporting cast that is filled with some of Hollywood's elite, Colin furth plays his mentor and he is like a more violent version of roger Moore's bond. He was funny and likable but this is the best action he has ever done. Samuel l Jackson plays the villain and he was great everything he said was just really funny, they gave the character a lisp and I truly believe that any other actor wouldn't have made this work but he really does make it work. Michael caine is the head of kingsman and he is great as always just like mark strong who plays the trainer of the recruits and he is great in his role too. The story is the one big let down in the film for me though, now I know that this film is all about fun and some people would argue that story doesn't matter but it does. The villains motivation seems crazily over the top and just not convincing at all. Also their is a direction they take half way through the film and I must say that I think it was a bad decision. The script is fantastic with the humour all working for me and hitting the right places. The interactions between characters makes this film feel alive and great. The style has been much talked about but i think it is great and this film wouldn't have worked without it. The action is all awesome ans there is a particular scene in a church that is one of the most memorable action scenes in recent memory.

"PostingandToasting","7","1","7","18 February 2015"," Kingsman: Spies, Villains, and Rock and Roll
","Matthew Vaughn wants you to know that the spy movies today are too serious. They are too dark, too long, and too exhausting. He fancies a time back when spy films had a sense of humor, took chances, and were over the top because, in his eyes, that made them something he feels these films were born to be....fun. It's hard not to agree with him. Some of my fondest memories watching the old Bond films of Connery and Moore were how over the top they were. The cheesy villains, gadgets, and one liners. They made you roll your eyes but you didn't care because you were enjoying the hell out of the movie. Now in in my opinion, the darkness of recent spy films, especially in the Bond franchise, has greatly improved the genre. While the old spy films are fun, they became almost too ridiculous and repetitive to the point where they were just bad movies. Kingsman: The Secret Service is Vaughn's homage to the old spy film. Reminding Hollywood to try to have a little fun once in awhile.<br/><br/>The story really is pretty formulaic throughout the first half. You have a mission from the past where something goes wrong and an agent goes down and that agent just happens to be the father of who will be our hero Gary....excuse me, I mean ""Eggsy"" (Yeah...I don't get it either) played competently by up and comer Taron Edgerton. Years pass and Eggsy has become the young lost soul who can't see to find a place in the world while trying to protect his mother and baby sister from an abusive stepfather blah blah blah. But again, much like those old spy films, you aren't seeing this film for the story.<br/><br/>The film really gets rolling once we get more familiar with Harry Hart, Eggsy's mentor and certified bad ass in one of the very best performances of the early year by Colin Firth. When you think of the casting going into the film, Harry is the most crucial. He is used to embody that old school spy who is one part bad ass and one part distinguished English gentleman. Firth is an English gentleman by nature but the risk of casting him in the role is he is just about the least bad ass type actor you and even HE can think of. You'll read this same thought in any other review of the film but that point really can't be overstated. Any director worth anything can make someone look like they can kick ass with effects and such (cough...cough...Tobey Maguire), but if the actor isn't believable throughout the rest of the film as a force to be reckoned with, then the film suffers. Firth talks the talk of the gentleman and kicks ass as the spy. He is smooth, funny, and blows up the film with his swagger. A performance not to be forgotten any time soon.<br/><br/>The rest of the casting is fitting. Samuel L. Jackson was the ideal choice to play an over the top villain because....well....what hasn't he been in his career if not over the top? Probably my favorite thing about his Valentine character is that I was originally going to write about how it was a little difficult at times to understand what some of the British actors are saying due to their thick accents. Vaughn gives a wink to the audience (especially the American audience) by giving the American Valentine a lisp that makes him sounds ridiculous AND gives him a line calling out the issue Americans have with Brit actors ""You Brits...Y'all talk so funny"". Well played Vaughn. We also get some solid supporting performances from Mark Strong and Michael Caine (playing a real ass hole in films lately) to round out a solid cast.<br/><br/>If you're going into Kingsman: The Secret Service and expecting Skyfall the you're going to be disappointed. Kingsman isn't about being dark and serious with some powerful societal message to go along with it. Kingsman does what Matthew Vaughn intended it to do which was to give you a fun time. It's got violence, comedy, and some great music adding up to a great time at the movies. So turn your brain off for a bit, enjoy the chaos and don't bother trying to hide the smile you'll have when you walk out of the theater....we all saw it."

","This comic adaptation is full of hyper-stylized action sequences, graphic violence and smart humors that thrill the audience to feel unstoppable for 130 minutes of mission insanity. Though with the predictable core story, it does surprise with some plot twists for the second half and director Matthew Vaughn manages to overcome the short with well constructed plot without any drags, exciting old school action cinematography, stylish commercials fun of Guinness and McDonald as well as great electronic mix of scores by Henry Jackman and Matthew Margeson. The performance of the cast is perhaps one of the major factor that the film is extremely entertaining, it gathers four Kingsmen - Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson, in which each of them represent the characters that they are not used to be in other recent films, while it is also undeniable that young potential actor Taron Egerton sparks in his character as Eggsy too. With a super villain, this young James Bond spy genre looks high standard, smart, exciting and definitely the only great film to opt for this Valentine Day."

","Well done although there is no actual Roundtable in the film, this movie is more action based than your typical Bond film which leads me to strongly suspect it was made by mostly Americans besides the actors of course; I reference Charlies Angels for the creatively composed action scenes... tasteful use of CGI and the clever and sometimes ironic use of songs (mostly American) that play over some of the more violent scenes.<br/><br/>The movie pokes fun at the formulaic pitfalls of typical Bond films with some tongue in cheek dialogue and presents some plot twists that really were unexpected from what I gleaned from the trailer; most everyone's back story is explained with the exception of the villains henchwomen whom I would call scissor-legs but the story of how she arrived at her present skill-set is never addressed.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are very well choreographed.. one in particular seems at first to be a single shot until you realize the cut-away scenes of others reactions in satellite locations although they are not the Kung-Fu style I prefer such as in movies like Charlies' Angels or more recently Oldboy (American release) and more along the lines of a Jason Stathem movie but with more violent outcomes.<br/><br/>In all it was clever, comedic, thoughtful and action packed."

","Thrilling, fun, it had that Matthew Vaughn touch written all over it. He made a movie using extremes and opposites. It's classy with a bit of filth in it, funny but also serious, a real adrenaline rush. Kingsman is a well made, nicely paced action film that has the James bond movies flair. They modernized the spy genre and mixed in with a drop of comedy. The action scenes are amazing, beautiful to watch well choreographed and fun. As violent as it may be it wasn't gruesome or tiresome despite the body count. <br/><br/>The actors did a great job but I am commanding Matthew Vaughn for his work, because the plot is not the most original one but its done in such a unique way that it feels original. He - and his team - took everything we've seen, again and again, but added a twist to them. So every time there was a cliché, something we expected, there was a little twist and that made it not quite what was anticipated. <br/><br/>I usually don't like to spoil but one of Colin Firth's aliases is DeVere, which is Vaughn's real name."

","-Kingsmen: The Secret Service (2015) movie review: -Kingsmen: The Secret Service is a modern spy movie that follows Collin Firth, one of the Kingsman, who chooses this kid to be a candidate for Kingsman, while also dealing with Samuel L. Jackson and his evil plan. Basically bond meets Ender's Game. With less training. And more action.<br/><br/>-Kingsman, much like Edge or Tomorrow, takes the elements of its genera and respects them while following them in a still formula manner, but excels at everything about them! -The story is really good. It should be predictable, but so full of compelling scenes and characters that you forget to guess ahead.<br/><br/>-The pace is great because the film feels longer than it is, which is great because I did not want it to end! -The acting is great. Collin Firth, the kid, Sam Jackson, Michael Cane. They all did great. Mark Strong was great, but his accent went from mostly English to mostly Scottish. I was alittle confused.<br/><br/>-The characters are fun and complex, but are also aware of the world around them (like the film) so much that they can reference and joke about the fact that they are pretty much in a Bond/spy film. I would, so why wouldn't Collin Firth? -I loved the music. X-Men: First Class meets Casino Royale.<br/><br/>-The effects weren't great, but I feel like they didn't need to be because.<br/><br/>-.because the action totally makes up for it! Yeah, them fight scenes were either totally boss or hilarious.<br/><br/>-The film is just super sharp and satisfying. It exceeds in most of the elements it puts forth and did not stop entertaining for a minute! -I will say that a downside is probably that Kingsman is rated-R for language. Sam Jackson. It is not too bad, but not light. The film also has a butt and some violence, of which could have been a heavy PG-13.<br/><br/>-Kingsman is one of the best spy movies I have seen. If you don't like spy movies, that's cool. Don't see Kingsman. If you do like action movies, spy movies, or something to see this weekend, Kingsman is. Amazingtastic!"
"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","8","1","7","6 February 2015"," Kingsman: The Secret Service Review
","My Thoughts:<br/><br/>First off I will admit that I loved the comic book Secret Service that this movie is based off of and when I first heard that Matthew Vaughn was making it into a movie I was super excited. I liked his take on Kick-Ass and couldn't wait to see what he did with this comic book. And boy he does not disappoint with this movie. Yes people will notice that there are some changes from the comic book to the big screen but I do not think the changes they made really have that much of an impact on the movie. People are calling this a James Bond movie on steroids and I will have to agree. To me this kind of reminds me back to the older Bond movies that weren't always grounded in the real world like the newer Bond movies have become and I grew up on those Bond movies and love them.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is Samuel L. Jackson he really doesn't change up his acting in his movies but he really doesn't have to cause we just love his over the top style he does. Some people might call me out cause I do have some issues with actors that seem to do the same shtick over and over again but for me Samuel L. Jackson just seems to bring it whenever he is on the screen and doesn't seem like he is beating you over the head with it.<br/><br/>I could talk or type paragraphs on the outstanding cast that is in this movie and everyone hits there mark in this one. Even semi newcomers Taron Egerton (Gary 'Eggys' Unwin) and Sophie Cookson (Roxy) shine in their roles as Kingsman trainees.<br/><br/>I do say that some of the action shoots and how they filmed them had me dizzy at times do to how they were jerking around the camera that sometimes you lost track of what was going on. But with that said the action scenes are over the top and ridiculous fun to watch. If you don't enjoy all that great action then you might as well lose your head.<br/><br/>One thing I will call out that during one action scene they do have the unlimited ammo gun syndrome and I always call those type of things out. The thing I find funny about is that up until that point they were good at showing people changing out their clips and or running out of ammo. But it really doesn't detract for how awesome the scenes are.<br/><br/>Now if you are not into these movies that are not truly grounded in reality then this movie will not be for you, which is sad because you are missing out. With the number of crappy Winter Block movies we are getting this is a shining gem. <br/><br/>My Recommendation:<br/><br/>Hell I am probably going to go watch this movie again, so if I am going to pay for it then you need to go out there and watch this movie."

"pder-87012","6","1","8","6 April 2015"," Fun spy story, but aimed at 14 year old boys
","Actor Colin Firth brings a measure of class to all the movies he appears in, and this film is no exception. Colin Firth plays Harry, code name Galahad in the Kingsman Agency, a sort of secret service that is reminiscent of the old classy style James bond films, but with fun set pieces of almost cartoon violence. It is all a bit tongue in cheek, quietly making fun of itself, or so I felt. Others may disagree. The movie looks to be the launching pad for a movie series starring the young recruit Eggsy (Alex Nikolov)a bad boy with a heart of gold, surely meant to appeal to boys as a clever tough guy, and to girls as a diamond in the rough. Sadly the story kills off Harry about half way through, and with his departure goes the class and better humour. As such, sadly, the first half is much better than the second half.<br/><br/>These movies rely heavily on the quality of the bad guy. After all, how can we display the excitement and daring do of the good guy, without a decent bad guy to battle against? The film planned well, employing Samuel L Jackson to be Richmond Valentine, an evil tech billionaire. Unfortunately this is Samuel Jackson's possibly worst performance of all time. It may not be entirely his fault. His is dressed like a 12 year old from the 1940's, talks with an unbelievable and quite annoying lisp, and his actions are not intelligent, despite the fact that he is supposed to be brilliant. The more his character is on the screen, the worse the film gets.<br/><br/>If there is a sequel, which one would expect was the whole point of this movie, the absence of Colin Firth, and the bad writing that gave us the Richmond Valentine character, should ensure that it is, sadly, terrible."
"mgn7781","10","1","8","6 April 2015"," This movie is amazing
","First of all, look at this CAST: Colin Firth Mark Strong Michael Caine Samuel Jackson Jack Davenport Mark Hamill Along with great newcomers: Sofia Boutella Taron Egerton Edward Holcroft Sophie Cookson Now the plot. It really sounds a little dumb at first, but when you think about it, it's actually very smart. I'm not going to sum it up, because you either already know the summary or you know what the twisted tech genius is actually planning. Also, no spoilers. I talked about the cast before, but let's talk about the performances. By far, the breakout performances are great when holding up to the great heavyweights in this film, such as Firth, Strong, and Jackson. Sofia Boutella is an awesome henchman to Jackson's villain. Yet, th good guys are fantastic too, with Taron Egerton giving one of the best breakout performance I have ever seen, and possibly the best one I've seen in an action film. Sophie Cookson and Edward Holcroft are great as training recruits in the Kingsman facility. Colin Fifth gives one of the best performances of his career in Harry Hart, a veteran agent who wants to repay our main character, Eggsy's father, by recruiting Eggsy in Kingsman. Mark Strong is also cool as tech sidekick Merlin, who directs all the training activities. You could say he's the comic relief, but really, everyone is. I haven't mentioned how funny this movie actually is. I laughed, hard , more than several times during this movie. And part of that is thanks to Valentine, played by Samuel Jackson. He is hilarious in that he I so meta, swears a lot, and has a lisp. Now for the action scenes. These are some of the best filmed action scenes I have actually ever seen, in that the camera follows the actors-yes, the actors- and you can see what's going on. The gadgets are awesome, with a bullet-filled umbrellas and lighters that are actually hand grenades. Now, of course the music is terrific, with a soundtrack that includes ""Free Bird"" and Dire Straits. Same with the score, composed by Henry Jackman. So, what am I trying to say? Go see this movie!"

","Some people may assume the title of this review is an insult, but I would say there are equal parts positive and negative in this. Bond has become a laboured, sombre affair in recent years and though those films are still a quality product there is little fun to be had. Step in Kingsman - a high-octane, largely brainless British spy film that might lack the grit of Bond, but is infinitely more enjoyable. I watched this film with a perpetual grimace of disapproval at the cliché-riddled plot (a global super-villain with a lair; the protagonist being unusually proficient at driving and parkour before any of his training, despite being a no-hoper street youth; the mentor fast-tracking the protégé into a role of prominence against the odds etc...) yet... I carried on watching. I wanted to see what happened next despite the lack of originality because the film is paced well and holds your attention. The fight scenes are unnecessarily slow-motioned almost to a point of bending time infinitely, but they are also violent in a way many films are afraid to be for fear of bumping up their certificate and infringing on the profit margin. The Austin Powers ridiculousness of this movie was cemented in the closing minutes as Eggsy is rewarded for his heroics with the chance to engage in anal sex with a princess while Mark Strong has to watch and keep the engine running. Yep, that actually happens... but in fairness, it actually makes the rest of the film seem palatable in hindsight."

And the movie can be predictable at times.<br/><br/>It's nice to know that the Swedish prime minister is a Republican even though no such party exists there. <br/><br/>The overall plot is kind of lame -- do we really believe all the politicians and elites would go along with such a scheme? I suppose those vacuous ""Occupy Wall Street"" types might. <br/><br/>The one nice highlight is you get to watch Obama's head explode -- perhaps that's why it's rated so high."

","It's hard not to miss the early days of James Bond, when the adventures were colorful, 007 was spryly unserious, and the villains were ready to rupture with their European shaded, cackling madmen personas. Such wondrous cool exploded in the early Bond franchise that it isn't unrealistic to watch ""Goldfinger"" over and over again. Cheekiness goes a long way. But now we have the ""modern"" Bond (introduced in 2006's ""Casino Royale""), who is as sophisticated as ever but is hardly the Technicolor nympho he was in the pre-Brosnan days. He's become a spy grizzled and cynical, more quick to grimace as he goes through the motions, a smirk completely unheard of. I like ""Casino Royale"" and its sequels (""Quantum of Solace"", ""Skyfall""), but I miss the days when British spies weren't always well-oiled machines of slickness — agile, action-packed ridiculousness is much more satisfactory in the long run.<br/><br/>I suppose I wasn't sitting around and waiting for a movie like ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" to come around and sweep me off my feet, but it's the kind of blockbuster needed to invigorate the incessant rut of superhero franchises/gritty action movies. Here is a movie so cartoonishly brash in its thrills I couldn't help but reflect back on ""The Avengers"" and ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."". Cheesy yet impressively tactical, both were 1960s spy shows fully aware they were telling comically insane stories most of the time — but through a competent use of gaudy violence and disco ball flashy characters, silliness became sly while everyones tongue remained firmly in cheek. <br/><br/>""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a parody of sorts, self-aware in its cocktail infused kookiness but ready to pay homage when it comes time to hearken back to the days when Roger Moore was kicking every bad guy's ass as he held an unrealistically sexy woman at close quarters. This film's biggest issue is its violence — while oft comical, there are several gratuitous scenes of bloodshed that hardly match the snickering tone of everything else — but when ""Kingsman"" succeeds it manages to soar; it's a puff of crisp air following the pollution of its staling super-suited counterparts.<br/><br/>With a lively wicked performance from Jackson, ""Kingsman"", like one of its characters suggests, is as good as its villain: exaggerated, bombastic, agreeably oily, though a little too violent. Indeed, the majority of ""Kingsman"" is an amusing take on what the Bond franchise could have been, had 007 been seventeen and let loose in a maze of rated-R obstacles — but sometimes, the film goes too far, a shame when so much of it sits a cut above other modern blockbusters. <br/><br/>My most prominent issue lies in the constant profanity and the sometimes disturbing violence. Though I don't liken myself to the most prudish of people, tonal issues arise through ""Kingsman""'s inability to figure out if it's joking or if it's a bit sick in the head. The fight scenes are astonishingly well-choreographed, haphazardly exciting in their fast-motion dexterity — but somewhere during the halfway mark, the film sours once it sets a mass slaughter in a church. <br/><br/>The scene, finding its setting in Kentucky, serves as an introduction to Valentine's new technology, which causes even the most peaceful of people to become violent with just the click of a button, thanks to their Valentine designed cell phones. Unfortunately, Harry Hart is visiting, ending with him killing every single person in the building. Vaughn, who directs most of the film charismatically, decides that such an act is excusable as long as the people are despicable (think the Westboro Baptist Church) — but the murders are less cutely ""Kill Bill"" and more gory horror movie violent, the acts mostly shocking and not thrilling. The scene ends with a man getting a stake stabbed harshly from the bottom of his face to the top: are we supposed to laugh? Irritating is how much more focus is put into these scenes of gratuitous terror being placed upon innocents while the post-credits sequence leaves Eggsy's beating of his stepfather off-camera. Personally, I would rather my screen violence be justified rather than simply there to be cool. But that's just me.<br/><br/>If my review sounds negative, don't pay any attention: the previous two paragraphs exist as one giant complaint. Fact is, I liked ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."" Taron Egerton, reminiscent of a snarky young Guy Pearce, has serious potential to become a movie star. You certainly won't look at the normally smooth Colin Firth the same way again. And Vaughn (""Kick Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class""), for the most part, gives us a strictly fun action movie, full of terrific lines and thrillingly choreographed brawls. I just wish the film had an understanding that violence has to match tone, and for a movie so ready to charm us, we shouldn't have to buckle up and grab our barf bags right after we gleam during a witty exchange. I wouldn't want to have my martini stirred instead of shaken, now would I?"
"jadepietro","6","0","4","11 July 2015"," Serviceable
","(Rating: ☆☆ ½ out of 4)  This film is mildly recommended.  In brief: A spy film that is shaky, not stirring.  GRADE: B-  Kingsman: The Secret Service is an homage to the British spy film genre  with its sophisticated agents, wry humor, and gadgetry. It sends up the  Ian Fleming spy films but with a harsher edginess and tons of violence.  Matthew Vaughn directs the film with ample flair and style, but his  screenplay (co-written by Jane Goldman) lacks the right degree of  mindless fun and wit. The plot follows the formula of a megalomaniac  wanting to control the world and a secret agency that is hellbent on  stopping him.  The film is very well cast, with the exception of its villain, who acts  more buffoonish than menacing. Samuel L. Jackson plays him, but the  actor never conveys the wickedness very convincingly. Fortunately, the  other actors contribute greatly to the film's enjoyment. Foremost are  its two leads, Colin Firth who handles the action hero bravado very  well and newcomer Taron Egerton as his willing protégé. Mark Strong,  Michael Caine, and Sofia Boutella as the female Oddjob round out the  ensemble.  Kingsman: The Secret Service entertains, but its high level of non-stop  violence is disturbing, especially in a church scene where the body  count reaches absurd heights and skews the film's lighter tone which  effectively is found in films of this genre. Also, the CGI is  amateurish and cheap looking. Kingsman: The Secret Service is based on  a comic book, but comic is not the correct term in describing this  movie. Serviceable is."
"pfgpowell-1","7","0","4","20 June 2015"," Something of a high-wire act, but one pulled off with aplomb. Catch it
","I've seen some good films - some very good films - mediocre films and downright bad films, but I know very little about film-making because I've never 'made a film' or been involved in making a film and the chances of me doing so are rather less than celebrating my next birthday on the Moon. But of one thing I'm certain: in many ways film-making is something of a high-wire act: with all the talent in the world at our beck and call it can, and often does, go horribly wrong. There again it can, against rather steep odds, also come off admirably, and with Kingsman: The Secret Service writer/director Mathew Vaughn (and I suspect his long-term co-screenwriter Jane Goldman also deserves a mention) has most certainly pulled off, with apparent ease, a daunting task.<br/><br/>First, during the height of the Cold War, we had the straight-faced James Bond films (and others were made at the same time presenting the same sentiments) with those nasty Rusky communists as the 'baddies' and the West and apple pie as the 'goodies, although the Bond franchise began to play if more for laughs, perhaps realising just how ludicrous it all often seemed. Similar ventures, though, most recently the Bourne franchise, carried on playing it straight, but shifted the emphasis away from politics to out-and-out action.<br/><br/>Bourne and the rest blatantly catered to the armchair thug in all of us who likes to imagine himself - very rarely herself, I should think - up there with all the smart moves and seemingly inexhaustible energy. Others - Rowan Atkinson, Mike Myers, and just a few months ago Paul Feig with Spy - ditched any pretense of serious intent and simply went for laughs.<br/><br/>Vaughn and Goldman - I do think it is best to see them as a team because an excellent script (I am told) is the sine qua non of great film-making - have tried something far more ambitious in the number of angles the cover. Not only do they give us a Bond character battling it out with an evil villain intent on world domination (or, here, world destruction), but at the same time they choose to send it up but without pulling the rug from under their own feet. They also provide all the quite impossible gadgetry we expect a 'Bond' character to have at his disposal - at one point Colin Firth as the central figure takes his protégé (a very capable Taron Egerton) from Savile Row in central London to deepest Hampshire (I should think) in an underground mini bullet train on a journey of at least 30 miles - now how would that have been secretly built at a cost of billions of pounds? And to cap it all, the film flirts with self-reference, a practice that almost always ends in tears but here doesn't.<br/><br/>Firth, our 'Bond', and a very watchable Samuel L. Jackson as the evil and mad villain, complete with a ludicrous Mike Tyson lisp, even discuss 'the kind of spy film they watched as kids'. But then Vaughn and Goldman ride a coach and four through many of those films' conventions - when he finally meets Firth, baddie Jackson explains he won't spend several minutes outlining why he is doing what he is doing and he shan't, as was the convention, set up the 'Bond' character to die a lingering death from which our Bond would be bound to escape, he simply . . . well watch the film.<br/><br/>But there is even more to Vaughn and Goldman's action-packed spoof than that: they even manage to introduce an additional hero, a very likable lad from the wrong side of the track (Taron Egerton, referred to above) who is set against a gaggle of upper-class toffs and manages to hold his own with aplomb. Portraying the British class system in films and some chipper 'working-class' lad who gets one over the toffs is a high-wire act of its own, but Vaughn and Goldman manage it.<br/><br/>Some reviewers here lambast Kingsman for its violence, and I can't deny that there is a great deal of it - to put it bluntly, an awful lot of people die. But, for this viewer at least, the violence isn't in the slightest bit nasty and gratuitous and isn't sadistically lingered upon as is the habit of some grubby film-makers.<br/><br/>This film, which is based on a graphic novel, gets away with showing it because it is so utterly unreal and. And one scene in which - spoiler alert - the heads of several hundred of the worlds great and good gathered in villain Jackson's lair all explode like some expensive firework display, played to Edward Elgar's Pomp And Circumstance, had me laughing out aloud: it was all far too ludicrous to cause offence and very funny indeed.<br/><br/>Vaughn and Goldman - I still think that although Vaughn directed, both should get equal credit for what we are shown on screen - most certainly pulled off a high-wire act and then some.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly luck was involved (as were several hundred other collaborators - I've just looked at the credit list and yet again reflected on just how their essential contributions are never acknowledged), but luck follows talent - you'll never get anywhere on pure luck.<br/><br/>Catch this if you can, because you are in for a treat. Yes, it is all quite ludicrous, but in the best possible sense."

","This is a fun action movie in the 'Bond on speed' style. Acting is good, story is OK for the genre and the fight scenes are top shelf. But we aren't even 30 seconds in before the first thug pulls out a gun from his pants, with the resulting zoom on a Levi's pocket for a good 3 seconds. The bar is set for the rest of the movie, where the main characters make sure to announce they are enjoying their Guinness at the pub and have front pages from The Sun plastered all over their office (despite playing an intellectual liberal who likely doesn't share a single perspective on anything with that newspaper). Product placement is fine when it is suble, but The Kingsman it is a constant barrage of in-your-face product references. It feels like its one giant viral video campaign since there is a reference to a product every minute or so. It got so distracting after 30 minutes that it ruined an otherwise enjoyable movie for me."

","Kingsman is a spy movie light. It is a small tribute to James Bonds' movies and those like it; meaning the dapper spy with all of the latest gadgets. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously (which is good) and that was supported by the fact that Samuel L. Jackson's character, Valentine, had a laughable lisp.<br/><br/>The Kingsmen are a group of elite English spies. They are extremely secretive and unknown yet they are probably the most effective group of spies and killers on the planet. As members leave or die off they are replaced by qualified spies and gentlemen. This movie is about an unlikely person for the role of gentleman spy getting a shot to prove himself while the Kingsmen try to stop a plot to cleanse the world of people.<br/><br/>There is a lot of unbelievable action, jaw-dropping fight scenes with surprisingly little eye candy. Being that it is a British spy movie I expected the token beauty whom the super spy seduces. That's not to say that they didn't throw in any gratuitous nudity, they just waited until the very end to do it."

Overall it was this kind of a movie for me but one with a bit more realistic effects and nicer performances as far as the cast is concerned. It would be a 6 out of 10 for me but Colin Firth kind of saved it for me. I don't know why on earth he would do such a movie but then again, Piers Brosnan did the other one with the Greek gods (Persi or sth).

","After I saw the rating of 8.1 and various comments, thought that this movie would be extraordinarily good. Period. My own perception of the movie was it was like one of the ""Old"" James Bond movies and then and here and there it became like ""Kill Bill"" but since actions involved gadgets - it resembled spy kids too. It's an entertaining movie - definitely. Many of the actions were unbelievably over the top. Villainy was not exactly fearsome. Some of the actions were kiddies type and some were of Kill-Bill type. Last few scenes where they alter satellites were all of ""Spy Kids"" type and childish. Also the movie lacked depth in gadget showcasing. Controlling satellites and then showing percentage etc...were all like a TV discovery show. But do not get me wrong , the movie is largely entertaining...but the some versions of Spy Kids were also entertaining but kiddies' type. This is definitely not a ""Kick Ass"" type movie - which was a different class altogether. The similarity lies in ""all crazy stuffs and actions happening.."" That is all. But all these apart , ""Colin Firth"" was very good and even better than ""Taron Egerton"".

"Psy33","7","0","6","3 April 2015"," Kingsman Secret Service: Could Have Been So Much Better -Lack of Diversity in Casting Regarding Certain Roles Seems Almost Racist
","For me, the movie was somewhat entertaining but not great. You could see that the producers tried really hard to create a good product and they succeeded to some extent. I would give this movie a rating of 7 out of 10, no higher.<br/><br/>In my opinion the major problems could have been easily fixed and instead of being an OK movie, it could have been a great movie. (It's the difference between getting a C+ or B- on your report card versus getting an A- or an 'A'.<br/><br/>A 'C+' represents the low grade mediocrity and a 'B-' the high grade mediocrity. These producers tried really hard and it showed, so I would give them a 'B-'.<br/><br/>The major problems with the movie were as follows: (1) The casting undermined one of the major themes; (2) insufficient dramatic elements or scenes to counterbalance the comedy; (3) the movie had no soul.<br/><br/>THE CASTING UNDERMINED THE THEME One of the major themes in the movie is the privileged vs the unprivileged or the high class vs those with no class or those who are given special opportunities in life vs those who are not. This being the case, the casting should have included at least a few young attractive visible minorities who were given the opportunity to compete for the position of the new Kingsman. But no, in the movie all of those given the opportunity to become Kingsmen are white and all of the existing Kingsmen are white. So in spite of the privileged vs unprivileged theme, what the movie ends up teaching us is that there is a privileged class and the privileged class remains today and that in order to be part of that privileged class, one has to be white. I don't think that this is the message that the producers intended to send to the audience, yet nevertheless this is the message that they sent. (When producers dabble in tokenism, when they fail to even attempt to reflect the diversity of the world around them, the unintended consequences can include sending such messages to the audience.)<br/><br/>It would have been so easy to introduce a few visible minority Kingsmen both at the older level and at the new recruit/ candidate level.<br/><br/>INSUFFICIENT DRAMA TO BALANCE THE COMEDY The movie has a light feel to it. It is heavy on comedy, yet there is very little drama. The movie does not take itself seriously. So the audience will not take it seriously. Without some dramatic elements, the movie seems unbalanced. Unlike the movie RED, which was a pure farce of the spy movie genre and quite funny, this movie Kingsman is not a pure farce, so it requires the audience to buy in at some point. The movie fails to anchor itself with even one or two dramatic moments, which would help to change a C+/B- movie to an A-/A movie.<br/><br/>THE MOVIE HAD NO SOUL For me a movie has a soul when I actually really care what happens to the main characters and I have made an emotional investment in the movie. If a movie has a soul I will be anxious to see the sequel.<br/><br/>This movie had no soul. It undermined one of its most important themes -the privileged vs the unprivileged- by showing no diversity in either the existing Kingsmen or the candidates/ new recruits. When a movie so blatantly undermines such an important theme, it's hard for me to care what happens to the main characters. Like I said above, one of the messages that this movie sent to the audience was: if your are white you can be part of some of the most privileged clubs in society; if you are not white you are not permitted to apply.<br/><br/>The movie never anchored itself with even one or two dramatic moments that would make me care one way or the other about the main characters."

But it turns out that the whole thing is just a mass murdering machine that will turn everyone into bloody destructive hating killers. <br/><br/>The film as a whole is traditional and doesn't add anything new to the genre. It's your simple spy movie about a villain who wants destruction. <br/><br/>The Comics are by Mark Miller. A guy who created the comic Kick-Ass. So when I watched it, I expected it to be very bloody and gory. But instead, it's bloody. But I feel that It could have been gorier which could have made this film a lot more fun. <br/><br/>I'll just say it without spoilers. The three main actors, well... lets just say something bad happens to all of them. Samuel L. Jackson's Valentine is a good villain. He acts like a child who can't stand the sight of blood. Michael Caine and Colin Firth have some great things to do in this movie and its fun to see Firth kill like 40 people in a white supremacist church.<br/><br/>I can't really say much because I expected it to be this groundbreaking new spy film that would become a classic.

"estebangonzalez10","6","0","6","2 March 2015"," Uneven at times, but it shows a lot of potential for a future franchise
","""There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.""<br/><br/>Kingsman is director Matthew Vaughn's fifth feature film and there was a lot of speculation over this movie considering he had chosen to direct this over the sequel to his highly successful X-Men First Class. He was also in talks to direct the new Star Wars franchise, but Vaughn wanted to adapt Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons' comic book ""The Secret Service"" instead. A comic book I had never heard of, but Vaughn's dedication to the material is inspired by his love for the old James Bond films, and this adaptation plays out as a love letter to those former movies with fascinating villains and a far fetched plot. Kingsman is rich in style and the film is beautifully directed by Vaughn who has always proved his abilities behind the camera. His 2004 debut, Layer Cake, starring Daniel Craig might actually be the reason why he has now become the new James Bond. Vaughn, who had produced some of Guy Ritchie's films, was heavily influenced by him in that first film, but he has established himself now with his own personal style. My favorite film from Vaughn is still Kick-Ass which felt fresh when it first came out and established itself as a refreshing parody of super hero films. My expectations for Kingsman grew when I heard that this comic book adaptation was written by the same person who wrote the Kick-Ass comic because I was a huge fan of that film. However, the idea didn't feel as fresh this time and I had some issues with a couple of violent scenes that took me out of the movie. Kingsman does do to spy movies what Kick-Ass did to super hero movies, but if you saw that film you could expect some of the dark turns and twists that were going to come here. It is very similar in style and some of the characters go through the same fate but it is still fun and entertaining. <br/><br/>Kingsman centers on a British spy organization run by Arthur (Michael Caine) that is trying to stop a global threat from a billionaire tech innovator named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). When one of the spies dies during a mission, the agency decides to recruit a new one. Each one of the spies chooses a young candidate and Harry Hart (Colin Firth) puts his eyes on a street kid named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who shows a lot of promise. The recruits have to go through an intense program under the guidance of their instructor Merlin (Mark Strong). Meanwhile Harry continues to investigate Valentine and try to discover what he is up to as several celebrities and government officials begin to disappear.<br/><br/>The film felt bipolar at times. There are incredibly fun action sequences that are directed very well by Vaughn, but at the same time there are some disturbing violent scenes that take place in a church. The violence is cartoonish, but there are instances where it does feel out of place. I don't know why some of those scenes took me out of the movie because Vaughn is just having fun with the action scenes, but they just felt out of place. The things that did work best for me in Kingsman are the strong performances from Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Firth who play off each other extremely well. The scenes they share together are wonderful and their self referential movie talk is hilarious. Valentine has a lisp which reminds us of some of the physical dysfunctions that the early villains from the Bond franchise had. Vaughn introduces small elements like this as he pays homage to some of those entertaining films. Newcomer, Taron Egerton, also delivers the good as this young street smart kid who is learning the ways of becoming a gentlemen. His scenes with Firth are another highlight of the film. Perhaps the most entertaining thing about Kingsman is the recruiting process the kids have to go through. One of the other potential candidates is Roxy who is played very well by Sophie Cookson. She shares excellent chemistry with Egerton. Mark Strong might be my favorite character in this film and he also gets plenty of screen time. Sofia Boutella also delivers a memorable role as one of Valentine's sidekicks. Kingsman is highly entertaining and has many positive things going for it, but there are a couple of disturbing scenes that felt out of place. Despite this, Vaughn is still five for five and a director I will continue to look forward to.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh described this film as over the top, the clips and trailers I saw certainly looked that way, with good critic reviews as well I was definitely up for it, directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Stardust, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class). Basically secret agent Harry Hart and ""Galahad"" (Colin Firth) is unable to prevent the death of fellow agent Lee (Jonno Davies), feeling guilty he personally delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow Michelle Unwin (Samantha Womack) and his young son, Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Alex Nikolov), saying that if they ever need help, they should call the phone number on the back of the medal and deliver a coded message. Seventeen year later, unknown assailants kidnap climate scientist Professor James Arnold (Mark Hamill), they are led by assassin Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), who has bladed prosthetic legs, and her employer, internet billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), Hart's compatriot ""Lancelot"" (Jack Davenport) is killed in a failed rescue attempt, as a philanthropist Valentine meets various heads of state and VIPs, some who afterwards go missing, he also announces a giveaway of SIM cards, granting free cellular and Internet access. In London, unemployed young adult ""Eggsy"" (Taron Egerton) lives with his mother, infant half-sister and abusive stepfather Dean (Geoff Bell), despite his intelligence and capability he dropped out of Royal Marines training, he now lives aimlessly, he is arrested for joyriding a stolen car, and he decides to call the number on the medal and utter the code word. Hart releases him from prison, then introduces him to the world of the Kingsmen, a secret intelligence agency for which he works for, and which Eggsy's late father worked for, following Lancelot's death the agency are looking to recruit a new agent, Eggsy agrees to apply, he joins a group of other candidates, including Roxy (Sophie Cookson) who he quickly forms a friendship with, the candidates are overseen by senior Kingsman agent ""Merlin"" (Mark Strong), they will be eliminated one by one until the right person is found. Tests for the candidate include, without their knowledge, their room filling with water until they manage to escape, training a group of puppies, with Eggsy getting a small pug he names ""JB"" (after Jack Bauer from 24), and a jump from a plane where they are told in mid-air that one of them has no parachute, those who open their working chutes early are eliminated. Meanwhile the Kingsmen investigate Valentine and his connection with VIP disappearances, Hart tracks down Arnold to get information, but a chip is implanted in Arnold's head and causes an explosion, killing him and putting Hart into a coma for a short time, when he recovers he poses as a billionaire and meets with Valentine for dinner, it is there that Valentine compares the human race to a virus, with global warming being the fever caused, he intends to do something about the problem before it gets worse. Valentine is found to be a member of an obscure hate group church in Kentucky, there Hart finds him and Gazelle conducting a test, a signal is broadcast to his SIM cards, this causes everyone in the church, including Hart, to become uncontrollably violent, fighting a mass brawl breaks out with the people fighting each other to the death, but Hart comes out as the sole survivor, Eggsy, Merlin and Kingsmen leader ""Arthur"" (Sir Michael Caine) watch the chaos via video link. Hart is approached by Valentine, he explains his plan: the signal will broadcast worldwide, using his satellite network, so the human race will be culled, so the Earth will suffer no further damage, leaving only the select few deemed worthy of life, those who side with Valentine with protective microchips in their heads, with his planned revealed Valentine kills Hart with a bullet to the head. Eggsy failed the final test, refusing to shoot his dog, meaning that Roxy became the new Lancelot, but he returns to Kingsmen headquarters, where he discovers Arthur has a microchip and is his convert, he avoids a kill attempt and kills the leader, so he teams up with Roxy and Merlin to stop Valentine and his scheme. Roxy goes into the stratosphere in a high-altitude balloon vehicle to fire a missile towards Valentine's satellite network, while Eggsy and Merlin assault Valentine's mountain bunker directly, tackling the many armed guards. The signal is transmitted momentarily causing worldwide chaos, but the satellite is knocked out, Eggsy fights his way through the security forces, the security chips are detonated by Merlin, with all the heads of those part of Valentine's plan killed as their heads explode, Gazelle and Eggsy fight until she is defeated, and finally Valentine is killed and the world is saved. In the end Eggsy becomes a full Kingsman, he is able to reach out to his mother and offers her a nicer house and a chance to get away from her abusive partner, but he is willing to fight those who will stop him from doing so. Also starring Edward Holcroft as Charlie, Richard Brake as The Interrogator and Theo Barklem-Biggs as Ryan. Egerton is a great choice as the streetwise young agent to be, Firth is cool as the crisp agent, Jackson has a ball as the lisping megalomaniac who ironically heaves at violence, and supporting cast members Caine and Strong are great as well. The characters are all very good, the agents codenamed after the knights of the Round Table is good, the James Bond style gadgetry is fantastic, the outrageous violence does not disappoint, the moments of comedy are funny, and the fight sequences are well executed, it is a terrific fast-moving spy action thriller. Very good!"
"coom-peru","6","0","6","19 February 2015"," Overall a fun movie
","I saw this movie last night, I wouldn't say that it is a great movie by any means but it is one of those fun spy movies like Austin powers, It needs better jokes like Austin Powers but it was fun to watch all the action in the movie. One part that could changed is the exploding heads at the end of the movie, very weird.I have always loved the old British spy movies like James Bond and Sherlock Holmes. This is kind off a funny versions of one of those. It has some gory scene to keep the audience interested and it is very funny to see Samuel L. Jackson with a lisp. I do with there could have been a hot girl to save like there is in the Bond movies, they tried to sneak a girl in at the end of the move but it was too weak and too late for me. If you have nothing better to do go see this movie. Right now the movies coming out are weak and the weather is cold so you might as well go see it."
"petarmatic","7","0","7","17 February 2015"," I mean it is OK, but nothing extraordinary!
","I was surprised to find out that this film was rated 8 out of 10. I would not give it such a high grade, may be 7 out of 10 is more appropriate.<br/><br/>The problem being that I saw so many films like this before, spy thrillers/comedies. I have to say this one brings in refreshment as far as the plot goes. It is very well thought out plot with very cool and sexy ending ;) Acting is excellent. I really liked all the actors who participated and they mostly did an excellent job.<br/><br/>What I did not like was too many aristocratic sets, with leather chairs, fireplaces etc. Too much out of time and date. Times have changed. Somehow it does not fit in the modern world.<br/><br/>All in all if you want to watch a fun film with action and comedy this is a film for you. Otherwise if you are not into James Bond films, you might skip it."
"Joshwilson55","8","0","6","15 February 2015"," Fun Solid Spy Action Comedy
","This Movie was a lot of fun!! Simply said that this movie brings a brand of whit, comedy, and action that few action movies can pull off. This is a modern twist on 80's action movies! Its 007 meets Men in Black meets kick-ass. The action was great it was so much fun to watch the camera work was really fast paced and pretty unique. Matthew Vaughn is really becoming a unique director with a very fun style to watch. Now the movie wasn't perfect some scenes were a little over the top and I didn't love Samuel L. Jackson the acting was a little corny but overall it worked. Taron Edgerton was great and so was Colin Firth. But Overall a good movie and excited for a possible sequel!!"
"dyllon_jeng","7","0","6","13 February 2015"," Nothing more than fun, thrilling, and entertaining
","This film, while it may have its flaws, is a great movie worth watching for thrill and excitement. To begin with its flaws, the movie at times seems a bit choppy and some scenes seem as if they're just placed chronologically for the single purpose of exposition and expanding on the plot. In addition, a few key characters aren't developed as well as I think that they could have been. One final flaw is in a few scenes, it was slightly noticeable that green screen technology had been used, since you'd be able to notice how the background and the characters aren't quite in the same shot. But that's it for the biggest flaws.<br/><br/>As for its pros, the movie as I mentioned is extremely enjoyable with exciting and well-choreographed action scenes as well several instances of funny moments and lines. For the type of film that Kingsman is, its flaws don't take away much from the movie itself, since it is made solely for enjoyment and excitement and not for a perfect script and a completely original story. It's a entertaining film and strongly recommended for anyone just looking to watch something simple and fun."
"adamscastlevania2","7","0","4","10 February 2015"," Not many new ideas, but more than enough fun
","(67%) It doesn't break any new ground, it's very childish, silly, cartoonish; and overall just yet another throwaway action movie. But dear god it's superbly entertaining right from the very beginning to the very final frame. This resembles everything that the awful Avengers (not the Marvel one) movie should have been, with its touches of the Austin Powers movies, and of course the Bond films. If this had been released at around the same time as the poor Quantum of solace movie then it would have been the only case when a part spoof picture would have actually been better than the film being spoofed; but as Skyfall was fantastic then this doesn't get that most rare accolade. The cast is strong, I warmed to the characters, the direction is solid; while the action sequence in the church is worth the ticket price alone. All in all a near perfect spy popcorn movie with plenty of tricks up its tailored sleeve."
"davidgee","7","0","4","5 February 2015"," Double-oh-six-and-a-half
","Co-written by Mrs Jonathan Ross (Jane Goldman) and director Matthew Vaughan, this is a smutty action comedy from the FAST AND FURIOUS school. Megabucks have clearly been spent on the fight scenes and CGI. Colin Firth and Mark Strong are visibly enjoying letting their hair down (Mark of course is bald), although Michael Caine looks as if he's uncomfortable slumming (not for the first time, Michael: we haven't forgotten Jaws 3D, hardly your finest hour). <br/><br/>Taron Egerton, more Bourne than Bond, appears to have been cloned from Daniel Craig. Samuel L. Jackson's lisping zillionaire philanthropist and would-be world dominator Valentine is presumably spoofing Javier Basrdem in SKYFALL. Valentine's female sidekick runs on Pistorius-like blades that are more lethal than Oddjob's bowler hat, of fond recall.<br/><br/>The death toll is like a war movie. The level of violence and the f-word quotient are probably way too high, but KINGSMAN is firmly pitched at the teenager in all of us; it certainly found the teenager in me and my companion, both of us clearly not kids but more clearly still kids at heart."
