"topz-1","10","146","153","20 February 2010"," An insight into the humanity of the inhumane
","Before I start reviewing, let me say something personal: As a German, one can hardly watch movies about the Holocaust, WWII or any related topic unbiased. As I have discovered myself, no German family is without a history related to the Third Reich, almost none are without grave guilt, or at least the fear thereof, and most who say otherwise either lie knowingly, or simply try to evade further inquiry. <br/><br/>Reading some of the other reviews, I realized that for me, the movie conveyed something slightly, but decisively different: It is not so much about understanding HOW people could ever do the things they did, but rather how it is possible, that people we love, and people that have been loved by people we love could be so guilty and so loving, so despicable and lovable at the same time. It is about how we expect the guilt to show up somehow, how we expect to know the killer, the monster, at first sight and say: how could anyone not have seen it? Yet we have to admit sooner or later, that we were wrong, or were we? The question really is: How could I have ever loved someone who did things as horrible and disgusting as Hannah did? And just as much: If I am unmerciful now, having learned of their guilt, is it because they did what they did, or because they disappointed my own belief in their innocence?<br/><br/>At one point, Hanna Schmitz asks the judge: ""What would you have done?"", and I think that therein lies an even more disturbing and unsettling question: What would I have done? What would you have done? How can anyone know for sure what WE would done? It is too easy to think of oneself as morally sound, with a firm belief in what is right and wrong. It's what Germans call the ""mercy of late birth"" - the luxury of not having been in the position to make that choice. <br/><br/>So, what made this movie worth giving the full 10 points out of 10? It is well-crafted, well-played, believable, at times even beautiful. It captures both the fascination Michael feels with Hannah, and his disbelief, even disgust while exploring the ugly truth about her past. It conveys the struggle between our compassion and the reluctance to show mercy against the ones who did not. It leaves the viewer with the same, disturbing questions that have not been answered sufficiently in the past 60 years (nor will they ever be). It does not provide simple answers, but rather raises more questions, left to be unanswered. As Lena Olin's Character says: ""If you want Catharsis, go to the theater!""<br/><br/>Other than providing beautiful, well-toned cinematography, a well-written script, love of detail and convincing performances even by the supporting cast - what more can you expect from a truly great movie?"
"ccthemovieman-1","9","123","135","3 May 2009"," Winslet Impressive In This Two-Movies-In-One Story
","Kate Winslet is just outstanding in this very interesting film that is almost two stories-in-one. The first part is a sexual story of an older woman having affairs with a teenage boy and the second part is her war crimes tale and what happens afterward. The first is a somewhat happy jaunt of a short story and the second is a very serious and depressing story. That's where Winslet really shines. Obviously, she's developed into an an outstanding actress.<br/><br/>The second part is what most people, I assume, will remember about this film. Can ""Hanna Schmitz,"" a Nazi employee (so to speak), who was part of concentration camps, be a sympathetic character? To me, that's what it looked like that's the question the story was asking. The answer may have come in the final minutes of the movie when her ex-lover ""Michael Berg,"" now grown up and played by Ralph Fiennes, confronts a survivor of the camp. That, too, was very intense and interesting scene. Lena Olin is riveting as ""Rose/Illana Mather."" <br/><br/>""The Reader"" was full of quiet, but intense scenes. This is a very thought-provoking film, especially for one that doesn't start off that way but look almost like some soft-porn flick to get our attention. It is anything but that.<br/><br/>For Germans, this film must bring out many emotions and thoughts. Guilt and forgiveness are just two of the issues that are dealt with in this unique film. ""Hanna Schmitz"" turns out to be an incredibly simple-yet-complex person, unlike any I've encountered on film in a long time. You see her in all kinds of light, both good and bad.<br/><br/>Kudos, too, to David Kross' acting as the young Michael Berg. It must be strange for someone his age (barely turned 18) to do the scenes he did with 30-something Winslet.<br/><br/>Overall, a very different and excellent film that stays with you and makes you ponder its main characters."
"The_Film_Addict","10","459","535","8 January 2009"," The Reader is a brilliant, sexually charged, and oddly heartbreaking tale about the complexity of human morality and the lifelong repercussions that result from our actions.
","There's an urgency in human nature to understand. When it comes to the Holocaust, history's bleak, unsettling period, it doesn't matter what book you've read, film you've seen or account you've heard; in the end, your response it halted by its incomprehensible conclusion. How could humanity course its way towards such a violent, destructive path? How could people knowingly send men, women, and children to their impending doom? Most puzzling, how could the world allow it? Even though its been 63 years since the blood-drenched annals of World War II, its aftermath today is still bone chilling.<br/><br/>After a six year celluloid dry spell, Stephen Daldry returns to the director's chair in a brilliant, sexually charged, and oddly heartbreaking tale about the complexity of human morality and the lifelong repercussions that result from our actions. Adapted from Bernhard Schlink's best-selling German novel, ""The Reader,"" Daldry's visual translation is a powerful, emotionally absorbing film that is one of the year's best. It's superbly crafted.<br/><br/>With World War II over, Germany, in 1958, is still recovering. Deep within Heidelberg, Germany, Michael (David Kross), a young pubescent teenager haven fallen ill, is comforted by Hanna (Kate Winslet), a hard working woman who is twice his age. Taken by her generosity, Michael revisits Hanna to offer his gratitude. What begins as an awkward reunion escalates into a seductive, forbidden affair that intensifies when Michael begins reading to the distant, empty Hanna, who is deeply awakened by Michael's spoken literature. Too young to understand love's complicated implications, Michael is emotionally devastated when Hanna suddenly disappears. Nearly a decade later, unable to forget his passionate summer while studying law, he attends a Nazi trail, and to his dismay, hears Hanna's distant voice.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" is a complex film; maybe a little too complex for some. Though the film pertains to Nazism and the ""sins of our fathers,"" in essence, ""The Reader"" is a film that reflects the emotions inside all of us. During a lecture, Michael's professor comments, ""Societies like to think they operate on morality but they don't."" In this cynical age, how far from reality is that statement? During Hanna's trial, she's questioned why she participated in the Nazi party's horrendous war crimes, broken she replies, ""It was my job."" Oddly enough, that seems to be the justification most people use. Surprisingly, though, ""The Reader"" isn't about her exposure as a war criminal, but an exposure on an individual who took the wrong path. She's not a bad person; she's simply made wrong choices. However, when it comes to having involvement in the Nazi's liquidation of the Jews, how ""wrong"" can you get? ""You ask us to think like lawyers,"" cries on student, ""what are we trying to do?"" A distraught Michael replies, ""We are trying to understand!"" But, just who exactly is trying to grasp a deeper understanding: the court or Michael? How can Hanna's past be forgiven? Director Stephen Daldry brings the much needed emotional layer that a character such as Hanna Schmitz desperately needs. Although her actions are beyond unforgivable, strangely, we sympathize with her. Maybe it's her other shameful secret. Maybe it's superb character development.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" is a film that is driven by it's raw performances. In one of her finest hours, Kate Winslet gives the performance of a lifetime. It's a haunting and heart-breaking. David Kross, who's only 18, is impressive as the teenager with raging hormones; it's such a daring performance. Winselt and Kross bring this picture together. Their performances are jaw-droppingly brilliant. Completing the role of Michael, as the tortured grown man, is Ralph Fiennes, who balances Michael's despair through his melancholic emotion when he encounters a grown Jewish woman, played by Lena Olin, who was also at Hanna's trail. Although her scenes clock in less than 10 minutes, Olin, too, is breathtaking.<br/><br/>When ""The Reader's"" credits rolled, I sat quietly shaken by what I had witnessed. It's a film that is impossible to forget. When a grown Michael asks Hanna, ""Have you spent much time thinking about the past?"" Heartbroken, she replies, ""It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead."" She's right."
"Michael Fargo","10","312","368","4 January 2009"," A victim's guilt
","The film is a series of profound moral dilemmaswhile contrived by the author, they are fair questionsthat resonate deeply in the 21st Century: The role of guilt in victims, perpetrators, individuals and collectively, as well as justice, forgiveness, redemption, shame and, of course, literacy and its role in Western thought.<br/><br/>All this is a pretty heady mix for a film, but Stephen Daldry (as with ""The Hours"" ) makes literary conceit play very naturally here. David Hare's screenplay and the remarkable cinematography of the always remarkable Roger Deakins together with a sensitive score by Nico Muhly, this is indeed rarefied film-making. <br/><br/>But the actors are what drag the audience into this story. David Kross is amazing as the young Michael who has to play a range of virginal innocent to wizened and bitter. It's the key role in the film, and we're all lucky he was found to play this role. And the ever confounding Kate Winslet. What an amazing career for this young actress! Running through a list of her credits, she has some of the best performances of the last decade: ""Holy Smoke,"" ""Eternal Sunshine,"" ""Iris,"" ""Finding Neverland,"" ""Little Children."" But here she does something very different. Playing what amounts to a monster, we see that they too are human. Not many actresses could bring this off, but it may be her greatest accomplishment to date. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes brings a continuity to the work David Kross begins, and there's a brief appearance by Lena Olin who commands the dignity the role deserves. <br/><br/>I'm puzzled at the lukewarm reception to this film. I almost missed seeing it. And it turned out to be one of my favorite and the most heart-rending films of the year. All involved should be very proud."
"jaredmobarak","7","16","16","24 January 2009"," Only one thing can make a soul completeand that one thing is love  The Reader
","What is guilt? I believe this is the central question behind Stephen Daldry's new film The Reader. Based on the novel by Bernhard Schlink, the story asks its audience what a true monster is. If you know a secret, one that could exonerate someone from being found guilty of murder, should you help her even though you know she's accepted her guilt despite being unable to stop it? What if that person was someone you loved? There is some heavy material thrown about in the second half of this film, emotions run high and people must make decisions concerning some very dire situations. One thing is for sure, though, once that decision is made, no matter which side of the fence you fall on, some shred of guilt, some feeling of remorse, is inevitably going to follow you around for the rest of your life. This is what we call being human, because as Bruno Ganz's Professor Rohl says, ""our justice is governed by laws, not morals."" It doesn't matter whether something was right or wrong, it's whether it was legal or illegal. Unfortunately our souls don't work that way.<br/><br/>As said, these moral quandaries crop up in the brilliantly paced and constructed second half of the film. The power involved in the characters' actions all weigh heavy on those they touch. Perhaps the weight would not feel as palpable without the events of the first act, but either way, that portion of the film is too light and innocuous. We learn about young Michael Berg's, (a wonderful turn by David Kross, who is the true star of the film), affair with an older woman named Hanna Schmitz. This woman is very troubled and in a state of constant flux where her emotions are concerned. She loves Berg, but can never quite allow herself to fully commit to that feeling, her past continuously nagging at the back of her head, remembering what it was she used to do with those who read to her. Kate Winslet's performance as Hanna is quite good, but like the film itself, doesn't come into its own until the second act, when all the secrets finally become uncovered.<br/><br/>It is a good beginning, the unabashed love of a young 15 year old and his first sexual partner. He becomes her orator of stories and partner in romance, but they both know it could never last. School would be commencing and Berg would see the young girls his age, ever comparing them to Hanna, and her manifesting his feelings with her own jealousy, knowing that she must let him go  this time sending herself away rather than those she ""befriended"" of her past, those she sent off to whatever fate awaited them. Whether this violation became so deeply rooted in the boy, I'm not sure, but when he goes off to law school and crosses paths with his first love again, this time as she awaits charges of Nazi war crimes, he is torn on what is morally correct. It becomes his obligation to let the truth come out, despite the activities she partook in during the Holocaust. According to the law, he must divulge the information for justice, but his moral compass may not be able to do so.<br/><br/>The story truly is wonderfully acted and directed, pulling at the audience's emotions and engaging them throughout. However, while the second half is the most intriguing and resonant, it also contains the one activity that I found abhorrent. Now older, Michael Berg is played by Ralph Fiennes, a lawyer, recently divorced and with a daughter. His journey back home, to his mother that has all but given up on him as a distant figure unable to open up to those that love him, becomes one of returning memories. Discovering the books he once read to Hanna almost two decades earlier, the guilt of what he didn't do makes him set upon a mission to right that wrong. But the way in which he does so is really quite wrong to me. He seems to condemn her for what she did still and only creates cassettes of stories to send her to assuage his own selfish need for forgiveness. He never appears to care about her, because if he did, he would have made different choices in that courtroom years before. Berg shows the selfishness that followed him the entire story and really got me thinking that maybe he was a worse human being than Hanna. It's an interesting dynamic to be sure, one that subverts the somewhat ""touching"" conclusion the filmmakers seem to want to attempt.<br/><br/>The Reader is an interesting look at German guilt and the people's need to place blame on others for the Holocaust in order to somehow absolve their own indifference of doing nothing when they themselves knew what was going on. One of Berg's classmates gets the whole issue correct in a little tirade about the absurdity of the trial. Here they all were, guilty themselves of knowing what went on in the thousands of camps, yet putting on trial only six women because a survivor, (interesting to see Lena Olin play a mother and daughterthe beauty of a film spanning decades), wrote a book fingering them. Just as Germany needed to place blame, so did Michael Berg. Rather than put it on his own shoulders though, like Hanna eventually selflessly does, he decides to side with the masses, sitting back silently and then trying in earnest to deal with his eventual guilt, not to apologize to the person he let down, but to somehow forgive himself. It is quite the despicable act and I'm not sure if that was the filmmakers' intent, however, that is the lasting impression it left on me."
"hopek-1","10","206","243","9 January 2009"," A thoughtful and plausible examination of guilt.
","Very well acted and presented and a faithful representation of the main points of the novel on which it is based. This film encourages us to look closely at very difficult issues surrounding the atrocities of World War II. I am at a loss to understand why so many critics have been so damning of it. Perhaps it is too subtle for them to understand. It seeks to outlaw the false and intellectually lazy theory to explain the holocaust, namely that the horrors were committed by monsters. In its place we are offered contextualization, not as excuse but as explanation of how quite ordinary people were able to do extraordinarily dreadful things. We avoid these uncomfortable facts at our peril."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","96","111","17 June 2009"," Never underestimate the power of guilt
","Kate Winslet, I absolutely adore her, she's my favorite actress of all time. I still can't believe that she hadn't won an Oscar, her first nomination was in 1995 with Sense and Sensibility. Finally after 14 long years, she finally won the coveted award with the movie The Reader. I finally was able to see this movie the other day and it blew me away, I'm still debating if this really was my favorite Kate Winslet performance, but once again with a strong cast telling a powerful story, The Reader was definitely one of the best films out of 2008. So many holocaust films have been made, it's hard to make another that stands out, but we really haven't had a story where the Nazi guards were on trial. A lot of people debate if this movie is trying too hard to push sympathy on Kate Winslet's character, but my love for this film is to just show that they were human as well, hard to believe, but that our mothers, sisters, friends, whoever could have done something so shameful.<br/><br/>Michael Berg in 1995 Berlin watches an S-Bahn pass by, flashing back to a tram in 1958 Neustadt. A teenage Michael gets off because he is feeling sick and wanders around the streets afterwards, finally pausing in the entryway of a nearby apartment building where he vomits. Hanna Schmitz, the tram conductor, comes in and assists him in returning home. The 36 year old Hanna seduces and begins an affair with the 15 year old boy. During their liaisons, at her apartment, he reads to her literary works he is studying. After a bicycling trip, Hanna learns she is being promoted to a clerical job at the tram company. She abruptly moves without leaving a trace. The adult Michael, a lawyer, at Heidelberg University law school in 1966. As part of a special seminar taught by Professor Rohl, a camp survivor, he observes a trial of several women who were accused of letting 300 Jewish women die in a burning church when they were SS guards on the death march following the 1944 evacuation of Auschwitz. Hanna is one of the defendants. Stunned, Michael visits a former camp himself. The trial divides the seminar, with one student angrily saying there is nothing to be learned from it other than that evil acts occurred and that the older generation of Germans should kill themselves for their failure to act then. But Michael is conflicted on what to do, if to speak out on Hannah's behalf on some of her innocence in the murders or keep quiet. <br/><br/>This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen, it was so incredible and just heart breaking. One of the things I respected about the film was the way they handled the awkward ""love story"" between Michael and Hannah, she's older, he's younger, but it's not even a perverted thing, so strange to say that. I don't know how to put it exactly, but their connection was real and in some sense they both needed each other. If you have the chance to see this movie, I seriously suggest that you take it, the powerful performances really make this film captivating. The story is so heart wrenching and painful, but was told so well. Kate now finally has the award she's deserved for so long and pulls in a terrific performance with The Reader.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Buddy-51","9","17","18","23 May 2009"," Powerful Holocaust drama
","Like all works of art that endeavor to ""illuminate"" the Holocaust, ""The Reader"" ultimately finds itself looking for answers where none can be found. Yet, the beauty of the film is that it seems to acknowledge the impossibility of its task. Thus, rather than trying to resolve all the issues it raises, the movie simply lays them out before us, trusting that, in the final analysis, we will be able to come to our own conclusions about what, if anything, it all ""means.""<br/><br/>Though it is set in a number of different time periods, the story proper begins in 1958, when a 15-year-old German boy by the name of Michael Berg is seduced by a 38-year-old woman named Hanna Schmitz. For a summer, the two carry on a secret, illicit affair, wherein the woman introduces the boy to the joys of physical love, while he reciprocates by reading the classics to her between bouts of passionate lovemaking. Flash forward to 1966 when Michael, now a university law student, discovers, much to his horror, that this very same Hanna who meant so much to him in his youth is actually a former concentration camp guard currently standing trial for war crimes. The story goes even further ahead in time as a now middle-aged Michael keeps up the relationship by sending his personalized recordings of books to Hanna as she serves out her time in prison.<br/><br/>There has been some criticism leveled against the film that it aims to cast a Nazi mass murderer in a ""sympathetic"" light. Yet, what ultimately comes across in the story is not how ""likable"" a person Hanna is but how sadly tragic. Like all fine drama, ""The Reader"" goes beyond the two-dimensional stereotypes of heroes and villains to examine the complexity of human relationships and the messiness of the human condition. The movie keeps us emotionally off-balance throughout. Even in the early stages of the courtship, we are torn between our attraction to the characters as individuals and our revulsion at the difference in their ages. Hanna is particularly enigmatic as she embraces a child two decades her junior yet seems to find some strange fulfillment in him that goes beyond the obvious physicality of their relationship. Despite the touchy nature of these scenes, we get a feel for what brings these two very different characters together at this particular moment in time.<br/><br/>As the story moves on, the screenplay confronts many of the thornier issues surrounding what exactly happened in Germany in the middle of the Twentieth Century, questioning how so many ""average"" people could, at best, have turned a blind eye to the events that were occurring, and, at worst, have allowed themselves to become complicit in the mass atrocities. There's a beautifully incisive scene in which a young law student confronts his professor, demanding to know how the man has been able to live with himself for all these years, knowing that he did not do everything within his power to try and stop what was happening. In that brief, shining moment, we get a sense of what it must have been like for the people in Germany in the decades following the war when so many, Hanna included, simply turned their backs on the past in an effort to move on with their lives.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most complex character in the story is Michael, who, as he ages and learns more and more hidden truths about his first love, must come to terms with the fact that the woman he thought he knew on the most intimate of terms may, in fact, be an unrepentant mass murderer. Yet, love is not something that can be turned on and off at will, and it takes Michael decades to figure out just how best to deal with the moral dilemma raging in the very depths of his soul.<br/><br/>Michael is played first by David Kross in the period from 1958 to 1966, and then by Ralph Fiennes in the time thereafter. Both are superb, with Kross, in particular, delivering a performance of such delicacy and sensitivity that he sets the groundwork for what Fiennes is called on to do later in the film. And, of course, Kate Winslet, in the role that won her an Oscar, demonstrates yet again why she is one of the screen's great actresses.<br/><br/>Kudos must also go to screenwriter David Hare, who has adapted Bernhard Schlink's complexly structured novel with integrity and taste, and to director Stephen Daldry and cinematographers Chris Menges and Roger Deakins for the sumptuous look they have achieved with the film. Together, these fine artists have created a work that challenges the intellect and roils the emotions."
"alexkolokotronis","10","183","240","28 January 2009"," About As Unbiased and Objective As Any Form Of A Medium Can Get
","The Reader is one of my favorite movies from the year 2008. It is incredibly complex in the way you react to the characters of the movie. It carries many emotions from sensuality to anger all the way back to that of sympathy and resolution. Many moves advertise themselves as unbiased and fair but nothing gets close to that like The Reader which is able to build sympathy for a character you would never think you could feel towards.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was phenomenal. Especially that of Kate Winslet who draws out many emotions from whoever is watching. She plays an ex-Nazi guard who has an affair with a 16 year old boy played very well by David Kross. Her bitter, cold attitude, random behavior as well as her past history seems unjustifiable and deplorable. Yet you can do nothing more than feel empathy and compassion towards the shame and humiliation she feels about her one well kept secret. In the course of her affair she ask for one thing, to be read to. From this do you see the humanity within her. Ralph Fiennes also gave quite a nice performance as an older Michael Berg who looks back on his life and then later finds a way to open himself up through his time of self reflection and sudden realizations towards life. David Kross plays the younger Michael Berg whose performance was undoubtedly a very good one, maintaining his presence in not letting himself being totally overshadowed. Overall the performances are very deep and will keep you thinking long after you have seen the movie.<br/><br/>The directing and writing also was very key to the emotions felt in this movie. Every scene had to be done precisely and consistently to feel genuinely touched rather than feeling falsely drawn in. Stephen Daldry did that under his great subtle direction. The writing by David Hare allowed actors such as Ralph Fiennes, David Kross and of course Kate Winslet to give such stunning and deep performances and take the film to another level.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be very compelling in many ways. The emotions felt here were not cheap gimmicks but that of feeling true sympathy and forgiveness towards what we would normally describe as something wrong, shameful and reprehensible. I can't remember another film that made me feel these emotions for a character especially after learning one startling secret after another. This film succeeded in ways that almost movie would likely fail in, it did not come off as generous or light but as remarkably fair as a film or any type of medium can get shedding light on both sides of the spectrum. This is a film that is amazingly thought provoking and will bring out the humanity within all of us and should not be missed."
"catmmo","9","14","15","15 May 2009"," A Good Film
","I read the book this movie is based on about 10 years ago, and as I watched the movie, it came back to me. I am not a Nazi sympathizer - very much NOT so - but at one point during the trials when Kate Winslet's character (Hanna) asks the judge, ""what would you have done"" kind of sums it up a lot. By reading the book beforehand, there is a lot more insight that perhaps the movie doesn't clearly give. From the beginning in the book it seems obvious that Hanna is illiterate and so later she on more apparent that she could never have possibly written the reports she was accused of. <br/><br/>Why she allowed it to happen that she got put in prison, one does not really know. Was it to help with the guilt she felt for what she knew she had done even if she did not write the reports? <br/><br/>Whether this story is really true or not, it's an interesting look on the other side to the Holocaust. Hitler did not just enact a huge amount of genocide, he also brainwashed even his own to a certain *ideal* and it was an obey or be killed. Orwell's 1984 is a fantasized yet so true of this way of thinking. <br/><br/>Please read the literature and books and everything you can find on the Holocaust. The brilliant minds we lost during that time will never be recovered."
"aharmas","10","123","173","5 January 2009"," What Did We Learn?
","Stephen Daldry knows how to tell a story, knows how important it is to  make each of those characters relevant and indispensable, more  importantly, emotions are finely portrayed, but it is the cerebral  quality of his work that both impresses and irritates the audience.  Somehow, he let go of his control and made ""Billy Elliot"" exuberant and  glorious, with each note and emotion spilling out of the screen. His  restraint might have lessened the impact of the dark nature of the  tragedy in ""The Hours""; somehow the balance continues in ""The Reader"",  a powerful testament to the complexity of humans and their  interactions. In ""The Reader"" learning occurs, consequences, origins,  and motivations are carefully explored and analyzed, leaving out some  of the mystery for us to decide. Choice is key here, and some choices  are carry a bigger weight than others.  The marvelous Kate Winslet, who should be honoured for the quality of  her work, with as much recognition as it is humanly possible portrays  the central character of the story, a woman whose life might have been  shaped by unfortunate events, mostly undisclosed to us, and some of her  own genetic makeup. We, as the lawyers and the students in the film,  get to evaluate the evidence and choose to make a statement to justify  hers and our own ethical standpoints. It is the intricate and deft  interpretation of Hannah that anchors the story. Although, the story  follows Michael and their relationship from his teenage years to the  devastating conclusion, the film succeeds because Winslet is able to  show every bit of the confusion, rationale, and emotion that her  character possesses. She seems cold and detached, but as we look, we  discover that there is more to her than we can see from the moments we  see her on the screen. Hannah carries secrets inside her soul, somehow  keeping herself alive, surviving, living an austere existence that  hypnotizes, seduces, and repulses those she encounters.  Michael is seduced by this mysterious woman, and his own future is  shaped by those moments they spend together. What he doesn't realize is  how big of an effect their time together will have on his life. Their  early scenes are powerful and presented with a strong sense of realism  and brevity. They're probable the best of the film and might have to be  reviewed to understand how key they are to the further growth of  Michael's life and reactions to others. Winslet does not say much, but  her manipulations provoke her desired effects.  As their paths diverge and meet, their relationship changes as one  observes the dramatic turn of events that brings them together again,  and how Michael's actions have dire consequences for both of them. It  is during this period that we think we begin to see how relative  everything: what is moral and immoral, logic and emotional, simple and  complex. Highs and lows are hit again, as we become more involved in  one of the most powerful and dramatic moments of their lives.  In the final act of the film is when Winslet and Feines do some of  their most outstanding work ever; she even surpassing her masterful  turns in ""Revolutionary Road"", and ""Eternal Sunshine"". Every gesture,  every look, every enunciation add details and shed light to who they  were, are and might become. It is subtle work, haunting, and  bewitching, the work very few people are able to do.  ""The Reader"" reaches its amazing conclusion with a couple of scenes  that might break whatever little strength we might still have left.  ""The Reader"" isn't an important work, but it is a work that should be  recognized by the quality of its work, a finely tuned and produced  piece of cinema by people who recognize how magical, powerful, and  intelligent films can be."
"editor-131","9","10","11","11 February 2009"," A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, a good book & thou. It's not what you may think
","""The Reader"" isn't about the Holocaust, about Auschwitz, about German collective guilt or the guilt of complicit or evil individuals, even though it features a World War II war crimes trial. It is not about a love story, though there is a beautiful, sexy love story depicted in it. It is about the transformative power of art, in particular, in this case, literature. And literature, a teacher at one point in the film says, is centrally about the control of informationthe protecting, the withholding, the selective disclosing of information (whether by characters in the story or by its narrator). If we accept this thesis, literature is crucially about secrets, and ""The Reader"" is largely, primarily about the harm keeping secrets can do. When Michael (Ralph Fiennes) decides, after all, not to visit Hannah (Kate Winslet) during the trial he is observing as part of his training as a young law student, to press her to disclose to the court the information that would partially exculpate her from the worst, false accusation against herwhich could lessen her sentenceit is hard to figure. But it makes sense if we understand, as above, what the film is about, and see that he has decided to let her harm herself with her pridefully protected secret just as she so deeply hurt him by her refusal to admit the same secret to him. That's why he later doesn't write to her along with sending the tapes. Why, when he asks whether she thinks about the past, he doesn't mean their past, but her own guilty history. Why he is not more tender in that visit. In sending her the tapes, he thus clearly is not re-enacting a lover's tender mercies. He is offering her an avenue to her own richer partaking in the kind of exploration of human moral experience, questioning of choices and, ultimately, self-examination that literature presents opportunity for. And, one surmises, it worksadditionally prompted by the emotional distance evinced and moral query posed during his final visit to herwith the sad but perhaps just twist represented by her subsequent, final choice. He later unburdens himself to his daughter, as, earlier, the lifelong emotional distance he has held himself in in the protection of his own deep secret has earlier been revealed to have harmed her (among others, we must assume), and his relationships with her and them."

","We don't know. We think we do but we don't. We make decisions or sometimes decisions are made for us but we think we've made them. Then suddenly, there we are. We can't be certain how we got there or where we will be when everything settles but we do know that we are alive. Some experiences are life altering and we can run from them or embrace them. Staying to see them through though can bring incredible bliss but also tormented turmoil. We just never know. One such experience was had by a young Michael Berg (David Kross) and is chronicled in Stephen Daldry's THE READER. How could he know that when he pulled into an alley to be sick that he would meet the woman who would shape his entire life? How could he know that getting close to her would pull him the furthest he's ever been from himself?<br/><br/>Of course, when you're a sixteen-year-old boy and a woman who looks like Kate Winslet disrobes in front of you in the privacy of her bathroom, how much thought really goes into the decision that has presented itself? However little it is, it is certainly less than is warranted. This is especially true in West Germany of 1958. This is a Germany that is uncertain how to proceed, how to be its new self in the eyes of the world and the eyes of its very own future generations. Winslet plays Hanna Schmitz, a compassionate woman but also abrasive and stern. Winslet strikes the perfect balance between directness and desire in Schmitz, making her complexities part of her appeal. She is a good fifteen years older than the young Berg and she knows much better than he of her country's history. What he knows, he has read in books, been taught in school. What she knows, she lived first hand. So when the two come together, naked in each other's arms, the meeting is as redemptive as it is passionate. Berg is just happy to be in love and having sex but Schmitz is washing herself clean with the youthful vigor of Germany's tomorrow.<br/><br/>The summer ends and so does the affair, as one would expect. Just when it would seem that the two would never meet again, life steps in to ensure that past decisions, perhaps made in haste, can come to see their consequences. Berg has grown some and is a college man, studying to be a lawyer, when he catches sight of Hanna Schmitz again. Their latest chance encounter is far less exciting though as he sees her on a class outing to a courthouse. Schmitz is on trial for crimes against humanity for her time as an officer in the Nazi party during the Second World War. Berg's memory of his first love would now become a question of his own morality. How could he love someone who was now accused of such atrocities? How could he be so intimate with someone he apparently never truly knew? And yet, now that he knows her past, does he really know how her past came to be? After all, what is the face of evil? Is it Hanna Schmitz or is it something incredibly bigger than her?<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is the future of Germany. He plays Berg as an adult. His life is orderly, very clean, crisp and cold. He made decisions that made him the man he is and he can never say whether they were the right ones or not. What he can see is that we all make decisions that either hurt or harm other people and that the atrocities committed by his past generations are not as far outside the realm of understanding as he might have originally thought. More importantly, redemption is not that far either."

","This isn't meet-cute. Fifteen-year-old schoolboy Michael Berg (David Kross) first encounters his 36-year-old future lover Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) by throwing up in her doorway. It's a dismal rainy day in a German city in 1958 and he has taken ill on the way home from school. She cleans him up and accompanies him to his family. He turns out to have scarlet fever, and is kept at home for months. Once he's well again he goes back carrying a bunch of flowers to thank Hanna for her kindness, but realizes he's turned on, and bolts in embarrassment while she's bathing. Eventually Michael returns and happily loses his virginity. A regular ritual of reading, bathing, and lovemaking develops between him and Hanna. He reads to her; she bathes him; the sex is mutual. She is a tram conductor with a harsh manner, and several huge secrets. She seems to be using Michael, but she's also enjoying him mightily, and he is reaping enormous rewards, though his affair puts pressure on his relations with family and schoolmates.<br/><br/>Bernhard Schlink's original The Reader was an international bestseller. A lawyer and judge who writes, Schlink departed from his usual detective stories with this novel that becomes a meditation on Nazism--the denial of the surviving participants and the incomprehension of Germans like Michael who were born in the aftermath. Michael's feelings toward Hanna become much more complicated than simply those of a youth introduced to love by an older woman--as complicated as the feelings of Germans about the demons in their modern past. As for Hanna, she seems to understand nothing and to be more concerned about how she appears than what she has done.<br/><br/>The book is in three parts. First there is the love affair of the schoolboy and the tram conductor, which ends abruptly and painfully when Hanna suddenly disappears. In the second part it's eight years later and Michael is a law student attending trials of Nazis with fellow students and their seminar teacher, Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz). One day the young man is horrified and riveted to learn one of the defendants is none other than his long lost Hanna. She turns out to have been an SS guard at a satellite of Auschwitz and she's on trial with five other women for allegedly allowing several hundred prisoners to burn to death locked inside a church. This trial paralyzes Michael. He has never gotten over his first, interrupted love idyll with Hanna. Now he is filled with guilt for having loved her but also a sense that he should help her when he realizes he has information that might lower her sentence.<br/><br/>The last part, thirty years later, consists of several brief visits by Michael, first to Hanna in prison, then to the posh Manhattan flat of a Jewish woman, Rose Mather (Lena Olin), who was at the trial. She was one of the survivors and wrote a book about her experiences that was used in evidence. This provides a kind of coda.<br/><br/>Schlink's novel is neat and arresting, a page-turner that conceivably makes you think. Its Holocaust issues are cunningly intertwined with a sensuous--and rather peculiar--coming-of-age story told by a sensitive man still struggling to understand his experience and his country's. I read the book with interest, but found it a bit contrived. This together with Stephen Daldry's previous choice to film Michael Cunningham's The Hours shows a weakness on the English director's part for stories that are a little too clever and schematic.<br/><br/>This time the screenplay by the British playwright David Hare does damage to the book by altering its chronology, chopping it up and muddling the original linear three-part structure. Hare has said in interviews that the interpolated device of Michael's telling his story to his grown daughter was necessary to make sense of his voice-over. (That,however, is debatable.) Having settled on this device, Hare felt obligated to keep interjecting the mature Michael, played by Ralph Fiennes, at points throughout the film. The omnipresence of Fiennes' glum face undermines the sense of the young Michael's eagerness and, later, shock and confusion.<br/><br/>Fiennes as Michael revisits a cosmetically aged Kate Winslet as Hanna three decades later when she is about to be released from prison. Michael could never bring himself to visit her, but sent her tapes of himself reading the same books he read to her during their affair. Fiennes is a cold fish, hard to relate to the lively and sweet personality of young David Kross.<br/><br/>The film is hampered from the outset by its use of the outmoded artifice of dramatizing a story that takes place in another country and another language and yet having everyone speak English, with several of the main characters played by Brits (Winslet, Fiennes) putting on German accents. Bruno Ganz speaks with less of a German accent than they do.<br/><br/>There is much of interest in this glossy production, beautifully photographed on location by two of the best DP's in the business, Chris Menges and Roger Deakins. Ganz's professor is an ambiguous, subtle characterization. But since the drama of the unfolding story has been destroyed by breaking it up into pieces, the only thing that remains alive and beautiful and strange are the love scenes between Kross and Winslet. There is good chemistry between the 18-year-old Kross and the 34-year-old Winslet, and their nude scenes are bold and intimate. It's only when the machinery of what Schlink and the filmmakers are trying to tell us about German guilt and denial goes into action that things begin to be clunky and cold. Unfortunately, that is a big part of the picture."

","David Hare wrote one of my favorite female characters in ""Plenty"", Meryl Streep brought her to life in the most extraordinary way. Here, Hare writes another power house female character. It doesn't have the intellectual aspirations of ""Plenty"" but there is also a form of mental illness in his character. Kate Winslet is magnificent. Her early scenes with the wonderful David Kross are filled with compelling, contradictory and totally believable undertones. My misgivings are to be pinned on Stephen Daldry, the director. His sins as a filmmaker start to become a sort of trade mark, visible and palpable in the moving ""Billy Elliot"" and the shattering ""The Hours"" I can't quite pinpoint what it is but in ""The Reader"" that element is more obvious than in the other two. Maybe it has to do with loftiness. There are moments so frustratingly long and slow here that he lost me in more than one occasion. In any case, the cast makes this film a rewarding experience. Besides Kate Winslet and David Kross. The tortured Ralph Finnes has a couple of wonderful moments as well as Bruno Ganz and Lina Olin in a dual role."

","If you have not seen the movie or if you have not heard to plot synopsis please take my word for it, this movie is powerful, it may shake you to the core. It is about hard choices and how we deal with them. Now please stop reading.<br/><br/>p l e a s e<br/><br/>Hanna's secret, that she is illiterate is so crucial to who she is. We tend to understand why she acts as she does, but one of the central and pivotal decisions in the movie is Michael's decision to do nothing about his knowledge of that secret. Pay back for the hurt that she has caused? I do not think so. It is more a decision to honor her startling choice of responsibility for 300 deaths over revelation of her secret. there is no doubt that Hanna also bore guilt for the deaths. She is seemingly the only honest person in the courtroom, telling the truth when all have lied. It is only about herself that she lies. Michael could have confronted her, could have revealed the information to the court in several other ways, certainly through his professor he could access the right people, but he keeps Hanna's secret for her and suffers for it even more than he had before.<br/><br/>This is a story of honest and proud people trying to remain true to who they believe themselves to be. She does not intellectualize her decisions, ""I was a guard."" ""You can't let prisoners run loose!"" It never occurred to her to ask why these people were prisoners but one look at her life and we see that she too was a prisoner. This does not absolve her of her guilt, but it does explain her actions. Unlike the other guards she understands too late that there was another way and for that she accepts responsibility.<br/><br/>But even more than the admission in court, her decision to send Michael to New York produces the most compelling scene in the movie as the agent of the guard confronts the victim and survivor. It is heady stuff and though the victim is sometimes criticized for being cold and bitchy, how else could she be when a stranger brings such news and an apparent plea for forgiveness. And what seems like a cold inquiry, ""What was your real relationship with that woman?"" turns to be the source of redemption for Michael, he finally admits to another his secrets, in the scope of things they are not big, but they have weighed on him for over 30 years by that time.<br/><br/>One last thing, the strange sad, beautiful gift of a tin. It was the wrapping that was more valuable than the gift.<br/><br/>I did not always understand the motivation of the actors, but in the end their unexplained motives play out as in real life leaving us the viewers to pick up the pieces and move on."
"MartinHafer","9","5","5","24 June 2011"," The most morally neutral film I can ever recall having seen.
","This is a very strange movie in that there are MANY moral dilemmas and situations that clearly are unsavory--yet the film takes a completely neutral stance in presenting the plot. I am sure this offended some but it did make for a very memorable film. As for me, I am still not sure what I think about this strange style of film making.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a 16 year-old boy being seduced by a much older woman. The morality of this and their subsequent affair never seems to matter---it just is. During this time, the older woman (Kate Winslet) was often quite moody and the boy's welfare really didn't seem that important. Also, she would force him to read to him before they had sex. Why is an important part of the film--and frankly, though it was apparently supposed to be a twist, I figure this out immediately. However, this didn't spoil the film.<br/><br/>One day, Winslet disappears. Exactly why you really don't know. The boy grows and is now in law school. As part of one of his seminar classes, he and the class go to court to observe. The case involves some Nazi war criminals--and it turns out Winslet is among the defendants. And, the fact that she had other 'readers' finally makes the young man realize why. Winslet (this is NOT much of a spoiler) is illiterate. Yet, she is so ashamed of this, she is willing to accept a much longer sentence to hide her illiteracy. And, during her long incarceration, the ex-lover (now played by Ralph Fiennes) makes it his life duty to record book after book for her to enjoy while incarcerated. There's a bit more to the film than this, but I'll leave it up to you to see for yourself.<br/><br/>The movie has some excellent acting, though I did wonder why the leads were played by non-Germans--while some other major characters were German-speaking actors (like the Swiss-born Bruno Ganz). I wonder why they didn't just have Germans in all the roles. Perhaps they thought it was more bankable with Fiennes and Winslet. The moody music and direction were perhaps the best part of the film, however---very evocative and well done.<br/><br/>As for the plot, I cannot completely reconcile myself with the fact that the film appeared to possibly condone or was indifferent to evil. Sexual exploitation of a teen and the holocaust are BAD....REEEEAAAL bad! And that made me a bit uneasy, as I enjoyed the film and the odd plot. Also, I felt that it was a shame there was so much nudity, as I would love for teens to see the film--it would be great to show them to instigate discussions and provoke exploration.<br/><br/>A weird and unique film. Hard to really describe and one you may enjoy but also one that may prove too challenging--as I could really see this causing some viewers to become angry, depressed or too emotionally taxing.<br/><br/>By the way, was it just me or am I right that it seems that Fiennes' character wasted his life? And, interestingly, Fiennes also starred in the excruciatingly dull ""The English Patient""--another VERY morally ambiguous film about the Nazis and moral choices."

Jean-Pierre Habicht, professor of epidemiology and nutritional sciences at Cornell.<br/><br/>Eight million of the eleven million childhood deaths a year could easily be prevented. That's because almost 60 percent of deaths of children under 5 in the developing world are due to malnutrition and its interactive effects on preventable diseases.

A voice from the audience shouted, ""Why didn't you speak out against these crimes when Comrade Stalin was committing them?"" Khruschev looked up from his speech and asked loudly, ""Who said that?"" A long silence ensued after which Khruschev observed, ""That is why."" <br/><br/>When you see ""The Reader"", ask yourself why you are doing nothing about the holocaust which is happening every year to the poorest children of the world.

Unbeknownst to Michael, he is coming down with scarlet fever. He is throwing up in an alley on a very rainy day when Hanna, the tram conductor, stops to offer him a warm place to rest until he feels better. Hanna also cleans up his vomit from the pavement. Hanna believes in orderliness and cleanliness. This penchant for order is apparent from the beginning of their relationship and these traits lead her to offer Michael baths and to bathe herself as well and as the movie progresses the motherly Hanna and her son-like friend begin to explore the attractions which flow from such erotic circumstances.<br/><br/>Both Hanna and Michael are full of hidden passions. Michael could have been a Heydrich in Prague, had he been born 15 years earlier. He is clearly 'officer material'. Hanna, on the other hand, is a working class woman born 30 years earlier into a society which would tell women that their highest aspirations could be fulfilled by staying in the kitchen with the children when they weren't engaged in taking in a church service. with the family. Education was unnecessary. Both Hanna and Michael are intelligent and attractive. Both are turned on by the doors which are opened to them by great literature. Both are also social products of their own German culture, with its various and sundry facets of puritanical, psychological repression, including a kind of reserve which leads to the peculiarly German goodness of keeping one's mouth shut in public about things political, things which the authorities have well in hand. Hanna's fear of exposing her own illiteracy and Michael's fear of public condemnation as a young law student at speaking up for Hanna in a court of law are the stuff of tragedy. <br/><br/>Sound familiar? <br/><br/>Even after many steamy sexual encounters, Hanna is shocked by passages in D.H. Lawrence's LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER, telling Michael that it is the equivalent of smut and that he should stop reading from it, almost as his mother would have. But clearly, Michael is not attracted to Hanna because she is a mother replica--Oedipus, no. One has only to compare and contrast Michael's screen mother with Kate Winslett's Hanna to know that.<br/><br/>However, it is 'klip und klar' that Hanna loves Michael and he loves her but, unbeknownst to them both when they are together, their love runs very, very deeply. They might believe that they will get over their summertime romance as time goes by, but the reality is that such love does not die, no matter what happens: there are no conditions for it.<br/><br/>There are elements of Fassbinder's ""Ali, Fear Eats the Heart"" and ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"" in ""The Reader"". ""Sophie's Choice"" also comes to mind. See this movie and be prepared to cry for humanity because as Thoreau observed, """"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them."" Methnks this is especially so in cultures as deeply built on the authoritarian personality character structure as the German one is."

","Kate Winslett's performance as Hanna makes this film a memorable experience. Her vacant stares are anything but vacant and will haunt you long after you have left the theater. The subject matter is much more than just an affair with an older woman, albeit this love affair impacts the young man throughout his life. It is more a morality play and a philosophical question of German guilt.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz, who plays the professor, actually includes Karl Jaspers' The Question of German Guilt as required reading for his young law students, including Michael Berg, Hanna's lover. The professor also requires his young law students to attend a trial for low level guards from the concentration camps.<br/><br/>While watching the trial scenes, I tried to make a decision as to what I would have done if I were in Berg's position. It is not an easy question. I guarantee you will be torn apart by this film.<br/><br/>The young Michael Berg, David Kross, gives a stunning performance. And Ralph Fiennes, as usual, gives the performance he should, reserved, yet multi-layered if you look deep into the philosophical questions this film poses.<br/><br/>It is based on a book by Bernhard Schlick, adapted for the screen by David Hare, and directed by Stephen Daltry. I highly recommend this film.<br/><br/>One last thing, on a personal note, I fell in love with Bruno Ganz in the Wim Wenders film Wings of Desire and I am still in love with that man. So sexy."
"ikanboy","8","18","25","3 January 2009"," A nice tale which let's the viewer come to his own conclusions
","The story is a simple one, with a twist. A boy has an affair with an older woman, who one day abandons him without a word. A quiet, sensitive boy, in post WW2 Germany. Finding him retching outside her house she takes him in and cleans him up. When he recuperates and comes to thank her, the relationship becomes kinetic.<br/><br/>He is educated, she is not. He is innocent, she is not. They make a trade. If he'll read his books of literature to her, she'll please him sexually. He learns little of her, and she doesn't offer much to him, except her body. When he pleads for more, she berates him with: ""you mean nothing to me."" It is a prophetic remark that shows us more of her, but little else is forthcoming, and when he hesitantly asks her if she means it, she seems to grudgingly back down. As it turns out this exchange may be crucial for the boy's, and our understanding of her character.<br/><br/>A few years later, when attending a war crimes trial for a class, he is stunned to see his former lover as one of those accused. She was a guard at Auschwitz. The young man is devastated, but holds his silence to his friends. He decides to visit her in jail but backs out. Then he realizes that he has evidence that can change the course of her trial, but continues to keep silent.<br/><br/>It is his silence that makes up the core of this movie, and it is it's unraveling that is left to the audience. Is his reason simple or complex? Is he acting out of cowardice, malice, or a sense of justice? As a man (Ralph Fiennes) he one day decides to send her one of the books he used to read to her. But not the book, rather a tape he has made of himself reading the book. He had realized in the trial that the one thing he knew about her, was the one thing that might have given her a more lenient sentence: she is illiterate. How this could have been a mitigating factor I won't divulge.<br/><br/>Using his tapes and looking at the books she teaches herself to read, and starts to write to him, but he never responds, continuing his silence, and yet continuing to correspond to her as a ""Reader."" What are we to make of him? Or her? My take on it, is that she was a simple, concrete soul, used to taking orders, and able to separate herself emotionally from her job, yet remaining shallow in spite of all the fine literature she is exposed to. She ends up being able to read, but never able to fathom. She comes across not as callous, but as vapid.<br/><br/>He on the other hand comes across as a weak man, unable to grapple with the paradox of loving a ""monster,"" who he never knew as a monster. Unable to offer much except that which he can do at a distance. He is not callous, but is, like his erstwhile lover, emotionally hollow.<br/><br/>Winslett is haunting, and emanates pathos. The boy David Kross is winning as a winsome lad. All in all the movie held up well and was engrossing, but I could have done without the final scene with Lena Olin, who plays a victim of the holocaust, imperiously, and unsympathetically, and the scene seems to have had only one purpose: to allow her to get in the pregnant line: ""you can learn nothing from the camps."""
"J_Trex","8","13","18","31 December 2008"," Bizarre yet compelling drama on the banality of evil
","Kate Winslet's portrayal of Hanna Schmitz, a former Nazi death camp guard living in Berlin in 1958 and working as a trolley car conductor, is one of the strongest roles in her impressive acting career. Somehow she was able to create a character that the audience could feel some degree of empathy with, despite her having worked in Auschwitz, selecting prisoners for extermination. To her, it was just a job, like any other. She had no education (she was illiterate). She befriends a young high school student, Michael Berg, and they carry on an unlikely love affair. Before they made love, Hanna insisted that Michael read to her, thus the title. She weeps as Michael reads Homer and laughs to Mark Twain. A complex and fascinating character, she lived her life from day to day, with her past buried safely behind her. That is, until a death camp survivor published a book which included details about Hanna's past, resulting in a public trial and the sordid details of her past are retold in court.<br/><br/>The story is narrated by Michael Berg, as told through a series of flashbacks, beginning with when they first met in 1958. While Hanna Schmitz's character is played by Kate Winslet for the entire film, Michael Berg's character is played by 2 different actors, David Kross plays young Michael Berg and Ralph Fiennes as the adult. While Kate Winslet steals the show, the movie is putatively about Michael Berg. More's the pity, since his character is not all that appealing. As a callow youth and as an equally callow adult, he doesn't seem very engaging (as an adult, he is too busy to attend his father's funeral). This is the movie's biggest flaw. Kate Winslet is in a supporting role when she should be the main attraction.<br/><br/>The plot is complicated, and the heavy use of flashback narrative doesn't help things. The movie begins in the present, flashes back to 1958, into the 1960s, with a flashback within a flashback to 1944 (as re-told in the court proceedings), and then into the 70s, 80s, & 90s. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie despite the plot simply to watch Kate Winslet's study in the banality of evil. It's one of the great and memorable performances of 2008."

","It's not really difficult to be complimentary about this movie. Wonderful direction, quietly engrossing, great performances from all. Nice to see Bruno Ganz turning up too. There is something amazing about a film which successfully spreads itself across decades of people's lives, and this film is certainly successful in that respect. Really makes you think about the roles we play as humans. Are they really of our own making? How much power do we truly have in terms of being caught up something much, much bigger than one can even imagine? Probably the best thing that Ralph Fiennes has done in a while; Kate Winslet's star is obviously very much in the ascendancy these days, and I hope that we will be seeing a lot more of David Kross - a fine young actor."

","The most heart rendering, touching, disturbing and yet immensely beautiful movie of the year. I can not remember when last time I was so much moved by a film. Only another movie coming in mind called Monster's Balls. I don't know why I am comparing these two movies, apparently nothing similar but perhaps somewhere vast intrigues of human mind and its dilemmas, the complexity and overall hands of destiny bring the character of Halle Berry with Kate Winslet and Billy Bob Thornton with Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>The human pride has collapsed dynasties in histories. The Reader takes you to a journey of what human pride and fear of being ashamed can bring down on us, perhaps life long imprisonment to someone just to keep the secret; to someone else it perhaps brings rotting in the agony of repent and living a life worse than death. <br/><br/>This movie poses many glitches of relationships. Accepting love as of any situation is the key, listening to heart and be bold in love is another. Why did young Michael could not meet Kate during trial? Why didn't he save her? Was it his own fear of exposing an apparently socially unaccepted affair or was it the respect towards his once lover's secret what he bore although his later life. Can someone just be convicted of guilt even the then law and order compelled her to do the job? When Hannah asked the judge ""what would you have done if your were in my place?"" not only makes him and the juries to silence but also brings the question before us, what would we have done if we were born during Nazi regime and sent to camps as guards? Could there be a choice? What will be her alternative? So many questions...I was dumbfounded with numerous questions of our social structures and be-wilderness of human natures. And overall sometimes people think they can find their ways in lives but never tries to understand what their hearts want. Is it his weak nature or is it moral dilemma to protect somebody who is convicted of felony? But then who is responsible <br/><br/>I am sure when you watch this movie you will face similar questions. If Kate Winslet doesn't win Oscar for this role then it will be injustice to this beautiful actress who portrays her character with so much subtleties and nuances that I have seen rare in recent past. Same applies to the character of young Michael by David Kross and nonparallel Ralph Fiennes as the elder one. The expressions of this English Patient actor are marvelous. But it is no doubt a Kate Winslet movie all in all. A wonderful creation by Stephen Daldry and exceptional cinematography.<br/><br/>I thought Slumdog was the movie of the year but then that was a loud movie. The re-fineness of the Reader is very exceptional, sets it miles apart from other movies. It is in that genre of movies that tell complexities of love and its non-confluent ends, or you keep on thinking was it not supposed to be like this. Would it be made more beautiful when at the last scene Ralph Fiennes finally opens up his closed heart to her daughter? I don't think so."

The one rule in that list that pertains to this movie is: ""The actions and decisions of sane or flawed characters in a movie must make some sense in a real way"". In this movie they do not.<br/><br/>Here are two questions that I'll ask and you tell me the honest answer. Question 1: Would you keep a secret hidden that although embarrassing would make the difference between a 4 year prison term and possible life in prison? Question 2: If you were studying law and had information that could radically change the outcome of a trial would you withhold it?<br/><br/>My guess is that 99.9% of people would say no to both questions. In this movie, the other choice was made for both.<br/><br/>This alone destroys the credibility of the film's premise, but there is much more. Here's another question: If you had a love affair with a much older women while you were 16, would you eventually take your daughter to her grave site and recite every gory detail, promising her a ""big surprise"" before doing so?<br/><br/>I could go on but you get the point. The basic premise of the movie IMHO is brilliant, that is, ""how could so many people do such inhumane things to other human beings while thousands of others knew but did nothing"". The gigantic problem with the movie is the question was pondered while multiple characters in the movie did implausible things.<br/><br/>This movie could have been brilliant; sadly it is anything but."
"abhikthakur-1","6","3","3","28 January 2012"," Complex!
","The Reader is quite a complex movie. One can call it a romantic-drama but there are other complexities that make an interpretation of this work difficult.<br/><br/>At the heart of these complexities is the protagonist Hanna Schmitz played by Kate Winslet. She lives in her own world and own interpretations of things around her. She has a secret which she has managed to hide throughout her professional career. This secret affects a lot of things- including her romantic liaisons and her ignoring inhuman and dastardly ideologies and practices.<br/><br/>A few other undertones are also present. Notably, the fact the people get attracted to those who seem to have what they themselves cannot have. This possibly explains 36 year old Hanna's affair with the 15 year Michael, a student who can read! Although this decision, along with the other decisions she takes in her life, isn't the best one- the poor introverted lad remains pained for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Perhaps that is what this fast paced and nicely edited movie intends to convey- that while this character is indeed flawed; but so are life's most general characters. This possibly explains the collective madness people in different times and different places seem to go through. Although such characters may not deserve sympathy per se, they still deserve it simply by virtue of their being human beings. Milgram experiment and 'Banality of Evil' also point in the same direction.<br/><br/>And for the actors, it is actually the 18 year old David Kross, playing Kate Winslet's young lover Michael Berg, who steals the show and impresses one the most. Incidentally, Kross looks a cross between Keaneu Reeves and Heath Ledger. As for Kate Winslet, I'm not sure what the various judges saw in her performance(pun intended!) to hand over so many awards! I saw the move only once- may be I missed something..."

","Based on the novel by German writer Bernhard Schlink, The Reader (Der Vorleser) tells a story about a passionate affair between a 15-yr-old student and a 36-yr-old woman in the 1950s, post WWII Germany. Hanna Schmitz is the mysterious lady working as a tram conductor who loves to be read to by young Michael Berg during their trysts. Their affair lasted a summer and as intense as it started, Hanna left just as suddenly without a word. The next time Michael saw Hanna is 8 years later, in a courtroom where she is the defendant of a war crime trial and it is then where he finally finds out her secret she has fiercely guarded her whole life. <br/><br/>The director, of 2 Oscar-nominated films: Billy Elliott & The Hours, Stephen Daldry has once again highlighted the complexity of the main characters in this film. Revolving around Golden Globe winner Kate Winslet's portrayal of Hanna Schmitz, Kate's ability to create an image of a stout German lady is pretty impressive, packaged together with a German-accented English and she also bares all, both literally and creatively, in this film. David Kross, the newcomer as the young Michael Berg, is the true-blue German who in turn had to learn English to be able to act in this film and Ralph Fiennes does a fine job portraying the older & perpetually-troubled Michael, who couldn't forget the past that had created such a great impact to the rest of his life. <br/><br/>The Reader's premise surrounds the moments when Michael reads to Hanna every time they meet, mainly from works of German literature like The Odyssey, The Lady & The Little Dog and even The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. It lightens up the pace a little bit with a touch of humour and also when it links significantly towards the ending of the film. The trip to the concentration camp is poignant and hits home the cold reality of the effects of the Holocaust; the people who worked in it, and the people who died in it. In this film, we get to view it from the point-of-view of the people who worked in it. To them, it's just work in which they have to be responsible in their assigned duties and if it involves selecting a group of people to be sent to the gas chambers, they will do it with diligence. The question posed to everybody else is: 'So what would YOU have done?'<br/><br/>Containing flashbacks of the past and present, the film is intermix with Michael's memories of the affair in 1958, his law student times 8 years later & to his present life in 1995. Unfortunately, the pacing of the film is slow and the plot's main twist was revealed too early on in the film and so it killed the whole build-up to Hanna's 'secret'. Also this being a German story by a German writer based in Germany but shot in English with English actress (Kate Winslet) & actor (Ralph Fiennes) somehow just doesn't seem convincing enough. As compared to the book itself, the inner struggles of Michael especially during the trials are not shown in its full strength to prove his guilt of betrayal to Hanna.<br/><br/>Overall, watch this film for the effects of post-WWII on the people left behind, to appreciate the changing years and landscape of Germany and most of all to experience award-worthy Kate Winslet, David Kross & Ralph Fiennes acting skills."
"DeeNine-2","10","5","6","16 April 2009"," Exquisitely done, deep and emotionally draining
","BEWARE OF SPOILERS.<br/><br/>There is a certain segment of the German mentality that is Hanna Schmidt. English Kate Winslet captures the intent of novelist Bernhard Schlink in her interpretation of the character. Hanna was an ordinary but proud woman of discipline who always did her duty, a woman without the ability to separate herself from what she knew was right and what was wrong, but a woman who was able to hide from herself what she did that was wrong.<br/><br/>She seduces fifteen-year-old Michael Berg. She finds him doubly useful as a reader of great literature. She knows it will not work. Of course how could it? She indulges herself but, being strong and proud, is able to divorce herself from him emotionally when the time comes, as it must. When he reads D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover to her, she is genuinely offended at the open sexuality, but we viewers are taken back since what she is doing with 15-year-old Michael Berg is on the screen and naked before our eyes.<br/><br/>In a sense this is the somewhat familiar story of the young man of station and potential had briefly in his youth by the older woman who has neither station nor potential. They take advantage of one another for the time being, both knowing that they will move on. But young Michael is not fully aware of this old story because his station in life is, although above hers, still rather modest, and being fifteen and knowing a woman for the first time, he is in love as much as--or even more than--a fifteen-year-old can be.<br/><br/>She is short with him and selfish because she knows she will be tossed aside and so instinctively knows she needs to get something now. She calls him ""kid"" and consumes him, as would be the case in such a relationship. Yet there is his ""reading."" He has a talent for it and he enjoys reading to her. At one point she instructs him, reading first and then making love.<br/><br/>What is love? Hanna Schmidt does not know. And so her character is triply flawed. She has low self-esteem, hiding her illiteracy from all. She is removed from her feelings because of the past. That is how she has coped. What she has done she knows on one level was something horrendous; but on another level she only took the job at Siemens. What else was she to do? She was a guard. She had to guard the prisoners, otherwise there would be chaos. This is her defense. This is her belief. And finally, she cares for young Michael as she cares for herself, as one might care for valuable livestock, but she neither loves him nor herself. For again ""What is love,"" as Tina Turner once had it, ""but a second-hand emotion""? At the end we see her, an old woman in prison being visited by the adult Michael Berg. She has put out her hand to him, and he, being human, has touched it. But he has withdrawn his hand. And now they stand and she leans, ever so slightly toward him to be hugged perhaps, to be touched for perhaps the first time in decades. But he does not respond. He cannot.<br/><br/>This echoes back to an earlier scene when he, as a young law student suddenly finds himself observing her trial. He realizes that she is taking the blame for the deaths of the Jewish ""prisoners"" because she would rather do that then reveal that she cannot read or write. It is interesting that young Berg realizes the truth of why she liked to be read to only then. And so he thinks to save her by letting the court know that she could not have written the order that condemned the prisoners to death. And so he makes an appointment to go to the prison and see her. But as she waits for her unknown visitor to arrive, he suddenly turns away. What he realizes, one speculates, is that there is nothing he can say to her or to the court that will change anything. Whether she wrote the actual order or not really doesn't matter. The others get off with lighter sentences, but all of them are equally guilty of whatever it was that was that allowed the German psyche to allow the holocaust. And too Berg is not clear about how he feels. Here is a woman he once loved who now is revealed as a monster. Yes, she is a monster, but strange to say almost an innocent monster.<br/><br/>It is curious that Berg so deeply loved her that he acquires her trait of emotional distance. He learns he can only sleep alone. His marriage fails. He is not as close to his daughter as he would like. And finally he is not able to help Hanna when she is alone in prison. He cannot bring himself to respond to her letters. And yet he reads to her. Hour after hour after hour he reads the classics into a microphone and sends the tapes to her to listen to in prison.<br/><br/>I wonder how this was received in Germany. There is such a guilt that hangs over the generations after the war. I wonder what they think of the humanization of a certain familiar mentality. And I must add that this mentality that follows orders and does its duty to the exclusive of its humanity is not something special with the Germans of that era. It is a human trait that is expressive of a human type that can be found in any society.<br/><br/>This is a deeply moving film, exquisitely written and directed and wondrously acted, especially by Kate Winslet.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","Extremely disappointing post-World War 11 film in Germany. A totally undeserved Oscar win for Kate Winslet. She, as others in the past, got the compensation award for previously losing the coveted award. Surely, Meryl Streep in ""Doubt,"" and Ann Hathaway in ""Rachel Getting Married"" gave far better performances.<br/><br/>As for this movie, most of the story could have been told in 40 minutes or so. The best line of the movie in my opinion was that Jewish people don't have to worry about illiteracy. How true that is.<br/><br/>Winslet was often droll here. I expected her to breakout at some point but that never occurred. The prosecuting attorney was without emotion here. Remember Max Schell in that kind of role in ""Judgment at Nuremberg?"" <br/><br/>David Kross deserves acting kudos for his role as the young man caught up in a sexual romp with Hannah Schmitz, (Winslet)<br/><br/>Both Kross and an older Ralph Fiennes play the role of Michael Berg. I was expecting to hear at some point that Berg was Jewish. After all, it is a Jewish name.<br/><br/>While it is true that their romance took place over one summer, the film is missing a steaminess. When he discovers what Hannah has done, Cross keeps his head down as if he is ashamed to have been associated with her. After all, he never visited her in prison.<br/><br/>Let us never try to make Hannah a compassionate person because she was illiterate. As the Nazi guard, she knew exactly what she was doing in the selection process. In addition, this illiterate had her victims read to her before they met their cruel fate. Was she trying to exploit her young lover in the same way?"

","Okay, now I've seen the two simultaneous Winslet movies. Both are celebrated. Both seem to understand Kate's gift as an actress  that she is one of those rare players who can convey what a character does and also, via another channel, what she thinks or rather what motivates what she does. Its what I've called folded acting, with that second layer being a direct communication with the audience that annotates the first.<br/><br/>Its a specific sort of openness, and usually a filmmaker asks her to be obviously open. Both of these men, understanding this, have asked her to do the opposite. She is instead, obviously closed, using that second channel to convey that the channel is there but much is hidden.<br/><br/>Both of these films are amazing on this count. Its a new development in film acting in the 50 years or so since folded acting first emerged.<br/><br/>But otherwise, oh, what a difference in the two films. The ""Revolutionary"" one is made by her husband apparently just for this one effect. There is no narrative structure, only a stunt. The music is the main character there.<br/><br/>This film is wonderfully structured. It as rich in narrative facets as she is, each reinforcing the other. Seeing the two close to each makes me wonder why it isn't obvious<br/><br/>The film starts with us being told that literature, great literature is about hidden information. Then, throughout, we have the thread of the law, both referencing classroom and trial genres except for the focus on what is not revealed. This is folded into the very literature itself that is denied this woman, except in three circumstances: one we hear about and two we see.<br/><br/>And THAT is folded into love, its unrelenting yearning that can gnaw, its sex (obsessively, Germanically clean) and its idealistic romances. Both Chekhov and Homer as the templates. Wow, what care!<br/><br/>Its a matter of all choices having been discovered and not made. About what daughters do not know. Lena Olin has a career high here playing two generations. Her portrayal of the daughter is profound. We never really understand what happened with her: her mother was the only survivor of a specific situation. It seems that the daughter was born after the war and wrote a book about her mother's plight, never escaping the story.<br/><br/>Its all about observing, observing in every dimension and the power of looking even when you cannot seem to see.<br/><br/>At the end, there is a remarkable contrast between Hanna's stark cell, indeed everything in Germany we are shown as stark, and the opulent home of the daughter. There, she reminds that illiteracy is not a Jewish problem  this is after literature has been conflated with life.<br/><br/>There is a pretty, sexy law student with whom our lad sleeps. She may have become his wife and that one evening the origin of the other daughter. She is played by the same actress who was the Plum Girl in ""Perfume,"" the original womanscent.<br/><br/>The role of a certain church is deliberately kept ambiguous. It may in fact be the church that we visit twice. We never really learn what happened there, and its significantly shrouded. That will always be hidden.<br/><br/>The same fellow who made this also made the similarly deep ""The Hours"" and the execrable feel good trailer trash ""Billy Elliot."" Go figure.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"Turfseer","5","13","22","19 February 2009"," More atonement than drama
","'The Reader' begins in West Germany in 1958. Michael Berg hails from a grim-faced German family and is ready to sow his adolescent oats. Hanna Schmitz, former SS concentration guard now turned streetcar conductor, brings Michael back to her apartment after he's not feeling well. Hanna gives Michael a bath and before you know it she's playing sex therapist to the impressionable teenager. The affair lasts a scant month or so but on screen it feels like an interminable couple of years.<br/><br/>While Hanna is tender showing Michael new sexual positions, she is unable to control those flashes of temper (foreshadowing the revelation of a very nasty past!). Michael ends up reading various classic novels he's been reading at school to Hanna and she hides a deep dark secret that she is actually illiterate! One day Michael comes over to Hanna's apartment and she's disappeared.<br/><br/>Flash forward to 1966. Michael is now a law student in Heidelberg. As part of a class trip, he attends a war crimes trial and finds Hanna in the docket, accused of unimaginable horrors as a Nazi concentration camp guard. Initially, Hanna denies she's the ringleader of a group of female guards responsible for an atrocity where they prevent a group of Jewish prisoners, locked inside a burning church, from escaping. Prosecutors insist that a document ordering the atrocity is in Hanna's handwriting. Hanna won't give up her dark secret of being illiterate and falsely confesses, taking the rap for her fellow Nazis. It costs her big time: a sentence of life in prison.<br/><br/>The first half of 'The Reader' is slow-moving, the erotic scenes are repetitious and there's no central antagonist unless you count what's going on in Michael's confused mind. In a slightly more interesting second half, we meet an all grown up Michael (played by a grim-faced Ralph Fiennes). He's alienated and cut off from his emotions evidenced by his inability to bond with his daughter. Obviously he is still troubled by his relationship with Hanna even after all these years.<br/><br/>So Michael decides to record the famous novels he used to read to Hanna in the old days on cassette tapes. Soon, Hanna is devouring the tapes and over the years finally learns to read comparing the tape narrations to books she's taken out in the prison library. Hanna writes to Michael but he won't write back (even though he still has feelings for her the idea of writing to a convicted former SS guard is something a good German should not do).<br/><br/>Finally Hanna is about to be released but she has no family to help on the outside. Will Michael come and help her get set up with her own apartment? After initially balking, Michael changes his mind and meets Hanna in the prison cafeteria where he informs her that he's taken care of the apartment. But Michael asks her in effect does she feel any remorse for her actions as a Nazi? All she can that she is happy she's learned to read. As for the atrocitiesthere's nothing she can do about it now. Michael isn't happy with the answer but he'll still help her. But Hanna must pay the price in terms of the audience. No remorse = the need for some kind of punishment (Nazis must be punished!) So what does she do? On the day of her release, Hanna hangs herself. But she leaves a makeshift will, donating the rest of her cash to one of the Holocaust survivors, a woman who testified against her at the trial.<br/><br/>In the best scene in the movie (and most truthful) Michael visits the Holocaust survivor in the United States where he informs her of Hanna's wishes. She doesn't want Hanna's money and tells Michael if he wants drama he should go to the theater and not dwell on concentration camps where no positive life lessons can be learned. Still Michael suggests donating the money to an illiteracy campaign and the Holocaust survivor won't stand in his way.<br/><br/>Flash forward to 1995. Michael has overcome his demons and he's ready to tell the whole story of Hanna to his daughter as they pass Hanna's headstone in a church cemetery.<br/><br/>Although the Reader is not a very dramatic or even good movie, it still is fascinating because its main focus is on the whole issue of German guilt. The movie is based on a novel written by a German writer, Bernhard Schlink, who is grappling with years of guilt feelings over the Holocaust. He's saying in effect, 'Hey, we Germans aren't that bad. Can you forgive us?' Schlink (and the Reader's screenwriter, David Hare) present two characters that don't mince words (the aforementioned daughter of the Holocaust survivor at the end of the movie and a young law student who points out that Hanna and her co-defendants are scapegoats since there were thousands who went unpunished).<br/><br/>But while Schlink can face German responsibility for the Holocaust, he can do so only up to a point. His guilt leads to such confusion that Hanna is presented as a tragic figure, done in by ignorance. During the trial, it was her compulsive need for order that prevents her from allowing the prisoners to escape (however more typically, Nazis on trial would say they were ""only following orders"").<br/><br/>'The Reader' gives the wrong impression that Hanna was somehow not responsible for her actionsthat somehow by being ignorant, deep down she wasn't a bad person. In this way Schlink and Hare sugarcoat their antagonist. The vast majority of Nazis were not illiterate, ignorant peoplethey knew exactly what they were doing and they, along with the German people, followed Hitler with gusto.<br/><br/>The generation of post-war Germans don't have to apologize for 'the sins of their fathers' nor feel guilt. They merely have to study history with clear and detached eyes in order to make sure things like this never happen again."

","Kate Winslet deserved the Oscar she won for her role as Hanna Schmitz, who snares a teenage lover, Michael Berg (David Kross) and later emerges as an accused war criminal, sentenced after a trial to life in prison. Michael, then a law student, observes the trial throughout. Fast forward. The boy whom Hanna bedded, now an adult (Ralph Fiennes), acts after a long delay on a key issue he recognized during Hanna's trial and did nothing about, though it might have brought Hanna a much shorter prison term. Hanna is illiterate and could not have written the report on the crime which she and other female guards committed. Her confession in open court that she wrote the report is all that separates her from the other guards who receive significantly shorter sentences. The younger Michael does not tell the court that Hanna cannot read or write, but the older Michael begins sending Hanna tape after tape after tape of things he had read to her during their summer of love-making and much, much more. From the tapes, Hanna learns to read and learns to write. She is no longer illiterate. (I'll omit the ending. No reason to spoil it for those who haven't seen the film.) <br/><br/>Hanna's reason for not defending herself in court -- shamed by her illiteracy -- is comprehensible (barely). The reason Michael, the law student, gives for not disclosing the truth to the court, is that he should not violate her desire to keep her shame private. But the actions of the adult Michael are difficult, if at all possible, to comprehend. It must have taken him many months, perhaps a couple of years, to record all the books he sends her and why does he do it? Memory of a distant love affairs? That scarcely seems a satisfactory motivation. Guilt at having failed to rescue her from her own lie? That isn't a sufficient explanation either. Still in love with her? No reason to think that's the case.<br/><br/>What we are left with then is a superb piece of acting in service of a film that, ultimately, fails of its own weight. That failure does not affect young David Kross's excellent acting during his love affair with Hanna, but it undermines the character of the law student that he later becomes and it leaves Ralph Fiennes without a sturdy foundation for his turn as the older Michael. As a result, despite Kate Winslet's outstanding performance, I was disappointed by this movie."

","Diane and I watched this moving, confronting film yesterday and we both felt its disturbing combination of innocent guilt (can there be such a contradiction of terms?) and commonplace evil. So much is illuminated in the last part of the film; so many questions answered and so many moral issues raised during the film's trial that a person like myself left the theatre with fascinating moral dilemmas jumping over each other and made The Reader an extremely satisfying viewing experience. To me, the most memorable scene took place at the trial when the prosecutor asked Hanna (Kate Winslet) why she did not open the door of the burning church when she knew that a fire was sweeping through the building. Hanna, when questioned by the trial judge and asked why she did such a thing, replied that it was the proper thing to do; that she was an SS guard and that to let the people out of the burning church would have meant chaos and as a guard she could not allow that to happen. Hannah Arendt perfectly described the moral situation that the Hanna of the movie found herself in and she described it as the banality of evil. To quote her, ""The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil"" and isn't this precisely the situation that Hanna Schmitz found herself confronting? After this startling revelation, the viewer must deal with the confronting personal trauma faced by Fienne's character, Michael Berg; should he tell the court of Hanna's illiteracy (a personal problem she has lived with her entire life) or keep her secret and see her spend her adult life behind bars while her fellow SS guards continue their lie and escape justice?<br/><br/>The Reader is an intellectual, severe movie that people should see without fail."

","This jewel of a movie delivers a rich and subtle moral message about the legacy of the Holocaust. It is a story about two people from different generations in Germany whose lives intertwine over the last 4 decades in the 20th century. Their relationship begins with an unseemly but wholly believable love affair between Michael, an intelligent, winsome, privileged 15 year-old, and Hannah, a 33 year-old trolley car attendant who's interior life is never made available us. We know her only in what we can glean from the outside. Tho she is worn and hardened, Winslet's physical beauty combines with the opacity of Hannah motives and Michael's youthful innocence to excite powerful sensual, erotic and complex tensions. We know Hannah from the beginning as a poor, lonely and emotionally remote older woman. Though illiterate, she loves good literature and shows unpolished intellectual complexity. From her first interaction with Michael, we know she is capable of acting out of human compassion. All this reminds us that her life might have been very different, if only . . . In contrast, Michael has more gifts, but despite his seemingly good family, his intelligence and winning nature, his whole life (like that of his generation) is haunted by this relationship and its effects not just his life but through him, his daughter's life as well. <br/><br/>The affair lasts only a summer and though it dominates the 1st half of the movie. Over the next 40 years, they directly interact only twice in brief encounters, but Michael's whole life is shaped by this affair and metaphorically parallels the lives of Germans born after the horror of Nazism but indelibly stained by that history and their familial connections to those who lived through it. For we next learn that in the 1960's Hannah is charged along with other former SS guards of committing Nazi war crimes. While the story is told without heavy-handed moralism and only glancing reminders of the horrific historical events, viewers will be disappointed if they expect the rest of the movie to offer some resolution in the lives of these characters or if they think even a qualifiedly sympathetic view of Germans is morally intolerable in any work that touches on the Holocaust. For the full power of this movie is only apparent if the audience puts itself in the shoes of the main characters, and in the process sees them not only symbols of the German generations but expressions of our own frail humanity. Hannah's and Michael's lives are inextricably intertwined as are the lives of pre & post-war German generations. Tho they are Germans, they are, like all humans, trapped in the circumstances of our lives, the conditions that make us beneficiaries or prisoners thru complicity in the accidents and historical circumstances within which we are born and shaped, circumstances outside our control. Yet if we have any decency, we recognize and take moral responsibility for all our choices, whatever circumstances our choices place us in. If before her trial we wondered what Hannah might have been, we must also wonder her motives in leaving Michael, in fleeing from job promotions, in her love of literature and especially in her actions and choices at the trial. The power of this movie comes in making this imaginative identification with both Hannah & Michael, then reflecting on all the questions implied by the choices they make in their lives. that are left for us to puzzle about in each and every scene of this movie."

","Without the masterful acting by Kate Winslet, The Reader would have been a mediocre film overall.<br/><br/>It is a touching story of a woman trying to hide from her past, only to realize that death is the only way to atone for the cruelty she has committed as a former Nazi prisoner guard.<br/><br/>The storyline is simple and to be honest, I don't think the nude scenes are even necessary at all. The bond between the older woman and an under-aged (Michael confessed of being 15 year-old later in the film) can be expressed aptly without having to be explicitly and substantially depicted in the many sexual encounters. I think the script can be improved and trigger more empathy in the audience if the kindness nature of Hannah can be described more vividly. The script prefers to show the more sensual, sexual and yet inquisitive nature of the central character. Then again, all these can be made more balanced, with a little touch of adjustment to the overall emotional repertoire of the character.<br/><br/>This film is lucky to be supported by the many good acting throughout the film, including that from minor roles such as that of the American girl/woman who survived the fire and Holocast.<br/><br/>I find it difficult to grade this film. For Winslet's acting, 10/10. No doubt about it. I find her acting is much stronger than Angelina Jolie's acting in Changeling, which is somehow wooden. Jolie certainly does not have the range of emotional acting ability as Charlize Theron, Kate Winslet and Meryl Streep. For the script, I would give it a 3/10."

However, I have to agree with some of the other writers in this post that Stephen Daldry failed to create an engaging movie considering all the material he had at his disposal. Every director and screenwriter given the task of adapting a book selects a number a scenes from the book. Rarely do they have the luxury of following the book by rote. But Daldry/Hare chose to illuminate areas of the book which should have been left to the book. The power of Schlinks's book is it's love story. Michael Berg's discovery that the love of his life was once a monster. His tormented imagination over the years, and Hanna's involvement in the crime. History and German guilt are interesting subjects in books, but they don't often materialize into passionate themes on film. We want to be shown the passion and the crime, not lectured to."

","""The Reader"" is full of interesting ideas, but it suffers from lacklustre execution.<br/><br/>The central question at the heart of the story is whether or not we'll ever be able to distance ourselves enough from the Holocaust to understand how it was allowed to happen. Categorizing every person who played a role in it as a monster is easy and it provides an emotional catharsis, but it also prevents us from learning from history. After all, not every person who worked in a concentration camp was evil -- many of them were just people doing their jobs without any of the historical context we now have. And if we disregard them as something inhuman, we won't be able to know how to prevent something similar from happening again.<br/><br/>This question plays out in the story of Hannah, a former concentration camp guard (played by Kate Winslet), and Michael, played as a young man by David Kross and as an older man by Ralph Fiennes. Hannah and David have an affair before David knows of Hannah's past, and comes across her again years later when he's a law student and she's on trial as a war criminal. David must reconcile his loathing of what Hannah did with the fact that he knows she's not a monster. Hannah's real shame are not her crimes, but rather the fact that she never learned to read, and the film's best moments come in the third act when Michael, as a way of expiating some of the guilt he feels at not coming to Hannah's defense when he knew information that would have helped her case, records himself reading some of Hannah's favorite stories and sends them to her in prison.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" is a solid piece of film-making, but it has that ever-so-slightly-embalmed quality that comes when a director and writer feel the need to be too respectful to the source material. It's sombre and tactful and always feels more like a filmed book than a movie. It never comes cinematically alive. It boasts good performances, especially from Winslet and Lena Olin, who has brief dual roles as mother and daughter concentration camp survivors. And it has one all-too-brief thrilling sequence in which Winslet's character decides to spend her time in prison learning to read -- just watch Winslet's face as Hannah recognizes the word ""the"" for the first time. Otherwise, it's the kind of movie to admire rather than fall in love with.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","This is cerebral - not surface stuff - not light entertainment.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" forces you to examine life from perspectives you may not wish to visit, but if you love movies you will put this in your vault.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet is phenomenal and the other actors are superb - celebrating the genius of the director, the screenwriter and the author of the novel.<br/><br/>You can watch this film just to appreciate the editing, or just to appreciate the cinematography, or just to appreciate the acting. The aftertaste will make you watch again, for the bulk of the iceberg - it keeps getting bigger...<br/><br/>To paraphrase from ""As Good as It Gets"" - if you write movie reviews, ""The Reader"" will make you want to be a better writer."
"JimS_8686","4","21","42","21 February 2009"," Overrated Oscar-bait Garbage
","After having seen The Reader, I found myself in a state of shock, amazement, and disbelief that the same film I had just wasted 2 hours of my life on had been recipient of so many awards, as well as having the seemingly unanimous admiration of film critics lavished upon it.<br/><br/>The lovely and talented Kate Winslet stars as a secretary for a high-ranking Nazi Officer who years later will end up on trial for her role as an accomplice for many of the heinous crimes committed by her despicable low-life employer.<br/><br/>What ensues is an odd mix to be sure: a statement on Pro-literacy, an art house period piece, soft-core titillation, and a Holocaust/WW II epic. It unfortunately fails with all four.<br/><br/>In the film, Winslet's character carries on a torrid affair with a young man. Capitalizing on the well-known fact that Winslet is not shy in front of the camera, there are several explicit sex scenes featuring a fully nude Winslet - as is the case with countless previously released films in which she stars. I am no prude, but Winslet appears to be long past the point of being typecast in this type of role. Nothing wrong with that, but it has now reached a point where if she appears in a film in which her breasts are not bared, people in the audience may be asking for their money back.<br/><br/>Winslet is most certainly a fine actress, but the abundance of praise she has received for her turn in ""The Reader"" is mind-boggling to say the least. She has given far better performances in just about everything else I've seen her in.<br/><br/>Without question the sole motivation for any studio greenlighting material such as this are for Oscars. As a film fan and Oscar telecast viewer, it is rather disappointing to see the clout of Big Hollywood producers strong-arming the Academy year after year so exercises in mediocrity like ""The Reader"" monopolize the nominations in big categories. To see superior films such as ""The Wrestler"" and ""Gran Torino"" get snubbed in the top category is a real shame for movie fans.<br/><br/>Time would be much better spent reading a book for 2 hours than seeing this garbage.<br/><br/>Three stars for Kate, one star for Ralph Finnes portraying the boy as an adult, ZERO for the film."

","Stephen Daldry hit the nail on the head for his interpretation of the novel. His choice of location, cinematography and casting were spot on, which enabled him to deliver a well depicted version of the novel.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet and David Kross were the backbone of the film, as they portrayed Michael Berg and Hanna Schmitz, respectively, as they were written in the novel. Ultimately, their chemistry and interplay was particularly electrifying and makes the audience really feel for their characters. Surprisingly, Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the older Michael Berg was a major let down, as he did a poor job in emphasising the pain and suffering that the character goes through.<br/><br/>The court scene is another disappointment. Although it is depicted as written in the novel, the scene would have been strengthened if the film makers had shown flash backs of the events surrounding the Holocaust, which was the major event of this film.<br/><br/>The film is worth watching, but it is no masterpiece."
"dbborroughs","7","7","11","22 February 2009"," Good but not great
","Good film about the relationship of a young man who meets an older woman with whom he has an affair, little suspecting her past or how it would effect the rest of his life. Multi-Oscar nominated film is a good little drama, but one that has left me scratching my head as to it's best picture nomination.(Equally bizarre is Kate Winslett's Golden Globe win as a supporting actress when she's on screen a large chunk of the film) While I do like the film, I don't love it. I found it often as distant as the lead male character becomes. For me the problem that David Hare's script often reduces the inner conflict of the hero by having him speak not from the heart but the head. Basically, the dialog is much too clunky and it under cuts much of the rest of the emotion. Its not one of David Hare's better works (I'm a huge Hare fan and rarely has his dialog ever just sort of laid there like a dry text book). Its a good film and I do recommend it, but as as best picture contender I would discount it as not quite in the league of the other four nominees. (I'd give Winslet the edge on best actress)"
"richard-1787","7","20","40","31 December 2008"," A good second half
","The first half of this movie, which focuses on the relationship between a young man (16 or so) and a middle-aged woman, is beautifully shot but pretty empty. It is as if the talent behind something like a Merchant-Ivory film (minus the script writer) had grabbed the first story that came to hand and filmed it just to keep busy. It's beautifully done, but apparently pointless.<br/><br/>Then, once the trial starts, the movie gets MUCH more interesting. Kate Winslet gives a truly first-rate performance as a very difficult character whom we only come to understand over time. This second half held me.<br/><br/>Yet, after it was over and I discussed it with the person with whom I had seen it, I found weaknesses as well as strengths. Michael, the young man who has an affair with Hanna, is studying law and guilt, but he really never has interesting things to say on Hanna's involvement. His conversations with his professor could have been much more interesting and better written.<br/><br/>In the same sense, Hanna's preoccupation with order and fear of chaos, which play so important a role in the second half of the film, could have been developed in the first half. As could have been her shame over her ""deficiency."" <br/><br/>Not the great movie some critics seem to be hailing it as, therefore, but still worth a viewing, especially for Winslet's truly impressive performance."
"wolftab-1","3","18","36","18 February 2009"," The Reader Was an Emotionally Manipulative Snoozefest
","Former Nazi SS officer learns that reading is fundamental. That should be the tag line for The Weinstein Brothers Oscar nominated film: The Reader, featuring Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes. It is the story of an emotionally constipated man, Michael Berg (Fiennes), who cannot open up to anyone and it is all because of an affair he had with an older woman, Hannah Schmitz (Winslet) when he was 15 and she broke his heart. The affair was torrid and in between sex romps, the boy would read to the woman and it acted as a kind of aphrodisiac for her. The affair lasted one summer in the late 1950's in W. Germany. The film than moves on to the meat of the story, when several years later, the young man goes to law school and he is taken on a field trip to see a trial of former SS guards from Auschwitz who are on trial and it turns out Hannah is one of the guards on trial and he is shocked. With Hannah's fate in the balance, will she make a decision to protect her pride rather than her life. Michael has information that could affect the outcome of the trial and will he use it to protect his long lost love. These are the supposed harrowing questions that we should be made to care about. But I for one did not.<br/><br/>I was bored watching this film. There's no guts to it. The courtroom scenes were slow and contrived. Too much talking. I can only say Director Stephen Daldrey is to blame. Film is a visual medium afterall. I can go on but I'll just finish the review discussing the acting. I was uninspired by Kate Winslet (who is a very good actress) and after all the Oscar talk about her being a shoe-in to receive the Oscar for Best Actress for this performance, I couldn't wait to see ho much better it had to be than Revolutionary Road, which I believe she should've been nominated for instead (also a boring film by the way). I felt she didn't really believe in her character. Her accent was uninspired and at times she would give a glimpse of emotion but it was fleeting, particularly one scene in the courtroom. Granted this is a provocative role, especially with the sex scenes with the young Michael but her character, like Michael is stunted emotionally. I didn't feel she had much going on underneath to make her stoicism palatable. Neither did I find Ralph Fiennes (another excellent actor) performance all that good either. Actually, the only actor I enjoyed watching was Lena Olin who plays a Holocaust survivor. Bruno Ganz who plays Michael's law professor was equally disappointing. I usually like Bruno's work, but I felt like he was indicating and forcing his lines. So, we have a pretty sound cast, in a wasted effort. The whole film feels contrived and emotionally manipulating due to its subject matter. Once again, we have a film that forces German guilt on to us. I have a strong feeling about this, after vacationing in Berlin last spring and seeing how much the Germans still berate themselves for the war. The nation should be prescribed Prozac in my opinion. The Holocaust was a tragic, horrible and an unthinkable blight on humanity , but the fact that substandard films about this subject continue to be revered by the Academy virtually every year grows tiresome to me. The fact that The Dark Knight or even The Wrestler was passed over for The Reader is ridiculous. I am hoping Meryl Streep or Angelina Jolie gets Best Actress next week."

"sq8188-162-458059","9","2","2","6 June 2019"," What would you have done ? She asks
","Crime,guilt,punishment and redemption (or lack of it) are weighty subjects. They all came together in Stephen Daldry's adaptation of Bernhard Schlink's book of the same title. It started out aimlessly, looking much like a story about boy coming-of-age with an older woman. By the movie's end it is not about that but how we deal with guilt. Hannah, the older woman, carries a wartime past that explains her hardened exterior and distance. Sensing the boy,Michael, is wanting more out of just sexual relationship, she abruptly moved away. Flash forward to years later Michael, a law student, sees Hannah again, in a courtroom trial where Hannah is on trial along with half dozen other women for being camp guards, aiding and abetting the Holocaust. This is a fresh angle among Holocaust dramas. We are witnessing ordinary people, not to be excused, followed the herd, even it was churning toward evil. To what degree are each one responsible ? It can't be ""just following order"". Post-war German guilty and retribution is on display. Hannah and her cohorts are charged with not freeing the prisoners while their shelter - a church, was burning. Hannah did not defend her action. Michael struggles with a secret which could have helped Hannah, but he chooses not to go forward. The great Roger Ebert drew this parallel - both Hannah and Michael rejected the chance to do good, and are living with that guilt. It is also important Hannah does not get rehabilitated in the end. Such ending would have pleased the masses but casts nothing about penitence and atonement. Hannah accepts and carries her punishment. Michael carries his guilt differently, in personal relationships and enduring painful history. The book cleverly uses readings of literature as common vehicle linking Michael and Hannah together. ""Read to me first, then we make love."" says Hannah. Many find the first half of the movie in which there is much puppy love/sex the high point. I can understand that because the latter half strikes a completely somber and serious tone distinctly different than the first part. However it draws for me a more powerful conclusion as we are thrusted into facing the difficult subjects of generational guilt and self-condemnation."
"TheMovieDiorama","8","2","2","25 February 2018"," The Reader is a perfectly constructed drama that feels extremely understated.
","This is an interesting one. Often regarded as an ""Oscar-bait"" film due to its subject matter and focus on acting. I never believe this term to be a detriment, in fact it evidently shows here because I thoroughly enjoyed this. A young boy has an affair with an older woman during one summer, she disappears after a promotion which is soon revealed to be a guard at a concentration camp. I shan't say too much in regards to the story, but this is very much what I call a ""story film"". We have a beginning, middle and end which are suitably implemented into a straightforward accessible narrative. Evoking themes of love, truth and reconciliation, I found this to be an endearing and sentimental story without the need of overacting and melodrama. I find that Kate Winslet often overacts, to a point where I dislike her. However, here she gives undoubtedly her best performance. Why? Because it's nuanced. No massive outbursts, no overly animated scenes. It's just her talking and taking control of every scene. Her subtlety and fragility is what captivated me. The character she portrays is shrouded in mystery and is psychologically intriguing, particularly as it is revealed she is unable to do a certain thing which all of us take for granted (I shan't say). Whereas David Kross and Ralph Fiennes' character, both may I just say were extremely competent, brings the heart and soul of the story. Love is a powerful emotion, one that cannot be fabricated or falsified. Ultimately, I believed in the relationship between these characters despite the events that take place. Loved the musical score as well, suited the film brilliantly. I did find the ending was slightly underwhelming, I would've liked it to be more impactful. Certain scenes did drag on however the pacing overall was fine. There is a lot of nudity, no idea why but the two main characters are always naked. Literally. The Reader might be too safe in its subject, but you cannot deny it's still a captivating watch and adequately moody."
"jjolla888","8","2","2","3 July 2013"," the real message got lost in a poorly executed last third
","This movie was faultless for the first two thirds. It lost its focus at the end and it felt like the opportunity to finish as a masterpiece was lost.<br/><br/>Because of this, the most important message in the story seems to have passed most viewers by. It was being played out in the court scenes when we learn that (perhaps due to ignorance or lack of education) the prison guard was unable to recognize that it was more important to save lives instead of performing her job. Of course, this was not some sort of excuse being offered ... but what was unfolding before our eyes was that the (highly educated law student) kid was in that courtroom performing effectively the same crime.<br/><br/>By not speaking up when he should have, Michael Berg misjudged how to act as a human. His actions not just improperly sentenced Hanna Schmitz, but allowed some real criminals to go free. The irony in this situation was pure genius. Of course, the genius was in the book - the movie did a good job of bringing it to the non-readers.<br/><br/>We get to learn that the author of the original book believed the Holocaust was not just the fault of the Nazis .. rather the whole of the German people were to blame, perhaps a societal structure with an inherent inability to be moral or to assume responsibility for their actions. We see Hanna as a metaphor for the old Germany and Michael that of the new.<br/><br/>It was a real pity the movie floundered around in the last third or so, and diluted this, and other, powerful messages. Nonetheless, it is still a movie you must watch. What a shame it didn't quite hit the home run that it deserved."
"badajoz-1","5","2","2","3 April 2012"," Far too literary in style but useful about German guilt over WW2
","The main themes are about German guilt over WW2 and the Holocaust going down through the generations, so we flip about between the present and 1958 and years in between. Everything is bound up with whether Germans of all generations can face up to what happened and what they did. So, after an hour of nude sex scenes between a young boy (15) representing the postWar generation and a much older woman (about 36) who obviously lived through the war (done before in so many films, eg Summer of 42, the Graduate etc) with the usual clichés of bathing scenes (to wash off guilt), she leaves suddenly - the result being a dysfunctional character (brilliantly acted as a young boy by Kross, but mournfully miserable as usual by Ralph Fiennes) who has to find himself. But he finds out that his one time lover was a Nazi Concentration Camp Guard when he attends a War Criminal trial. He is able to save her from a long sentence and discusses it with his Law Professor, but that theme disappears. But he supports her in prison, but as she is about to leave he manages to get her to face up to her guilt. Cue more guilt and tragedy, only to be cauterised by his being open with his daughter - the next generation (groan, groan). Yes, you guessed it - far too pleased with itself for its over literary adaptation, mannered stylistic approach, with metaphors for actions and guilt barely disguised in everyday happenings. Kate Winslet looks suitably haunted though not old enough to look like Fiennes' mother! But it was a sucker for Weinstein with Oscar written all over it!!!!! Some good acting but far too pleased with its' own portentousness. And we did not need Kate with her kit off so often - not required for the storyline!"
"DanDV","5","2","2","30 March 2011"," Non-formulaic, but not to be admired much either
","The Reader is an interesting non-formulaic story, with a complex character (Hanna Schmitz) played by Kate Winslet. Though, as some characters mention in the movie, it seems there's not much to learn from the experience of watching it.<br/><br/>Consider the protagonist: admitting illiteracy is more shameful than admitting participating in mass murder? And why didn't Hanna learn to read on her own after she met Michael, or before that anyway? Another note: Hanna's justification of why she let the 300 prisoners die in a church that caught on fire is not that she was told to (which would be explainable by Philip Zimbardo's experiments on abuse of power under duress from authority figures), or that she'd be prosecuted herself, but that... there would have been chaos if she let the prisoners free. Good role model for schizophrenia perhaps.<br/><br/>What might be learned from this movie is summarized in this quote by the old law professor:<br/><br/>...Societies think they operate by something called morality, but they don't. They operate by something called law.<br/><br/>...8000 people worked at Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been convicted, and only 6 of murder.<br/><br/>...The question is never ""Was it wrong"", but ""Was it legal"". And not by our laws, no. By the laws at the time."

","I was deeply touched by the film's primary message, that, although there were countless evil leaders within the Nazi regime, there were also those misfortunates, like this illiterate woman, who were victims, certainly by their own choice, but more for reasons that point to their own survival.<br/><br/>Having no education, however, does not make one unable to feel, as witnessed by this woman's love for literature and for a 16 year old boy, no matter what some might think about her contributing to the delinquency of a minor. After all, how many of us today got our start willingly in our teens? Being illiterate can, and in this case, did, create for Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) limited options for employment. And so she went for whatever door opened to her, not knowing where it would lead.<br/><br/>I keep asking myself why Hanna didn't admit to her illiteracy when prompted to show a sample of her handwriting by her prosecutors? Was it embarrassment, or was she willing to be a scapegoat in order to keep the other women guards from a possible death sentence? Was illiteracy, in that day, on the same scale as an unpardonable sin? I saw in ""The Reader"" that one can love another as God loves us, without reservation, no matter our iniquities. Love forgives, and covers a multitude of sins.<br/><br/>In this film, however, only the very select reaped what she'd sown."
"danjakubik","10","2","2","9 March 2010"," A powerful, authentic and compelling drama
","First of all, I'm surprised and disappointed by the weak reviews this film received from a significant number of critics. In my opinion, ""The Reader"" was, by a small margin, the best Hollywood film of 2008. ""Milk"", 2008, is also excellent, however, I felt ""The Reader"" was a little more powerful and the entire cast gave exceptionally good acting performances, especially newcomer David Kross, as the young Michael Berg, besides the obvious powerful performance of Kate Winslet, as Hanna Schmitz. I considered ""Frost/Nixon"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"", all from 2008, to be very good, but not excellent films. The five films mentioned here were the five nominees for the Best Picture Oscar of 2008. The feel good ""Slumdog Millionaire"" won the Oscar for Best Picture.<br/><br/>The story is based on a German novel of 1995, and concerns the remembrance of a long ago summer love affair between a 15 year old boy and a 32 year old woman. This story point apparently was objectionable and distasteful to many critics. I disagree with their perspective. Of course, the behavior of Hanna Schmitz, in the story, is wrong and immoral and could be considered statutory rape. For this offense and the later, more serious offense committed later by Hanna Schmitz, I found myself surprisingly sympathetic to her plight during and after her trial. The story, as depicted in the film, spans 34 years of the life of Hanna Schmitz. ""The Reader"" was shot mostly in Germany, where the original story of the novel takes place. I was impressed with the emotional authenticity, weight and honesty of the film. <br/><br/>Director Stephen Daldry, with his stage background, does an excellent job obtaining the best possible performances with all of his actors in the film. Daldry certainly knows how to tell a story with significant and authentic emotional impact. The courtroom trial is dramatically authentic, powerful and emotional. There is some raw sexuality in the summer lover affair and it's done with admirable restraint and grace.<br/><br/>Though Kate Winslet has given some very good to excellent acting performances before this film, which include five Oscar nominations, I felt this was her most compelling and powerful acting performance ever, since her feature film debut in ""Heavenly Creatures"", 1994. This performance in ""The Reader"" represents her sixth Oscar nomination, so it was certainly her time to finally win. <br/><br/>Winslet has received six Oscar nominations for acting in only 15 years, which is certainly impressive. Most actors and actresses do not even receive a nomination during their entire acting career. Since 2004, it became apparent to me that Winslet was an especially gifted and promising film actress. I have thought of Winslet as ""The Great Kate"", since 2004. With time, I believe it is certainly possible for her to reach Meryl Streep's amazing acting achievement of 16 Oscar nominations. After Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet is the film actress I hold with the highest esteem, respect and admiration.<br/><br/>Besides Winslet's great acting performance in ""The Reader"", I was most impressed with newcomer David Kross, as the young Michael Berg. As a native German speaker, he not only mastered the English language, he proves himself very genuine and sensitive with his acting and has an authoritative voice, in this, his third feature film. I will be watching for future film performances of his, as he appears to have a promising acting future."

When I heard about Kate Winslet playing a Nazi, I thought ""What the hell?"" Kate Winslet is British. What the hell is she doing playing a Nazi? anyways, Winslet is fantastic as Hannah Schmitts. I also liked David Kross as the younger Michael. You didn't see much of Ralph Feines' Michael. That's why I mentioned David Kross. I think The Reader is somewhat sad in a way. Because of not having one ability, her life is ruined. Also years after their affair she is still in love with him and he's moved on is kind of sad also.

I didn't find it boring for a single second, it's a very interesting film about the Holocaust aftermath in Germany. Surely the film would have had extra affection if the characters had spoken in the German language, but the performances are all around so good that I quickly forgave them for making Bruno Ganz speaking English. Anyhow, Stephen Daldry does have problems keeping a film spanning from the mid 50ties to the mid 90ties well constructed all the way through, there are a couple of missteps (as what's actually the thing between Michael (David Kross/Ralph Fiennes) and his family?) but in retrospect it's Kate Winslet's fine performance and the odd romantic situation that lingers. Great work from cinematography and production design captures the time-traveling with great visuals."
"blanbrn","9","2","2","15 February 2009"," A passionate and steamy love affair that last in memory even when times of guilt and the arrival of truth is discovered.
","""The Reader"" is without a doubt an emotional love story that spans thru time and memory as it shows how it can affect and shape the life of one young man. This type of film may not be everyone's cup of tea, yet I for one found it's themes of love, along with the hot and sexy steamy love making scenes, rounding out with the trial after war time that arrives at painful guilt and truth discovery to be compelling and interesting, as ""The Reader"" is just the type of film to draw the complete attention of a viewer. To add to that the performance of Kate Winslet the lead lady of the film is portrayed to perfection as her role of an older lady who's clearly a seducer is a real treasure to watch.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" which was based on a novel is set in postwar Germany and it chronicles the life of one Michael Berg(Ralph Finnes)from the tender age of 15 till his life up in the mid 1990's. Starting with Michael being ill he meets Hanna Schmitz(Kate Winslet)one day as after Michael is helped home and upon his recovery he again journeys back to see Hanna. Yet he will discover that Hanna is twice his age, yet despite his tender age of 15 Michael is drawn into a very hot and steamy passionate love affair with her(I must say the love scenes were well done and Kate shows plenty of skin). Michael being a schoolboy and Hanna who works as a train ticket conductor keep their physical romance a secret, yet Michael discovers Hanna has one passion and that is she loves for him to read stories and poetry to her(Oddly enough Hanna herself is illiterate)and this skillful fun only deepens their passion for one another. Then the film shifts one day as Hanna leaves causing Michael to be heartbroken.<br/><br/>Eight years later while Michael is a law student observing the Nazi war crime trials, he will make a surprising discovery as sitting in the courtroom back in his life is Hanna who's on trial as a defendant for war crimes. Hanna does not defend herself even though she feels she done nothing wrong you as the viewer really wonder about it if she feels any guilt or not. As it goes on Michael's feelings of the past become more and more intense as memories of love and passion never die even in hard and harsh times of guilt and regret.<br/><br/>Really this film was well directed and paced by Stephen Daldry as it really is a haunting epic about how even the truth and guilt intersects with love proving memories can stand time from generation to generation even though it's impacted by war crimes. Overall ""The Reader"" is clearly a watch in my opinion for the messages and themes it sends out like love, passion, coming of age, regret, and most of all proving that everyone has memories and that nothing can stop anyone from remembering good times like passionate love even though it didn't last. Also with the performance from Kate Winslet the film is even much more memorable for her bold and brave performance as her characters risk taking style was one to be remembered."
"surajchew","8","2","2","7 February 2009"," A love microcosm - metaphor of post-war Germany
","This is a non-linear narrative of a relationship between two incongruous protagonists, aged a generation apart, set in post-WWII Germany.<br/><br/>Over the summer of 1958, fifteen year old school teenager Michael Berg (David Kross/Ralph Fiennes) fortuitously through an illness entered into the lonely non-abstract world of Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet), a thirty-six year old tram conductor, who carried a tightly kept life-long debilitating personal secret. She bartered sex that satisfied his youthful lust for his lively literature reading sessions that colored her world. He fell deeply in love while she remained rather nonchalant and mysteriously disappeared from his life one day without a trace.<br/><br/>Eight years later, as a law student observing a court trial of ex-SS guards, Michael was stunned to see Hanna as one of the defendants. In the ensuing court room drama, her personal secret was threatened with exposure. It was then that Michael realized what it was and the enormous sacrifice she was prepared to bear by assuming the guilt of others in order to preserve it.<br/><br/>Shocked by the revelation of her horrid past, tinged by fear of social ostracism for his association, yet still captivated by his love for her, and constrained by knowing that she was unwilling to reveal her secret, he was unable to find the moral compass to intervene in her favor during the trial.<br/><br/>During her years of incarceration he found comfort in continuing his reading sessions copiously but remotely through the medium of tape recordings. It was this long and dedicated labor of love that eventually enabled her to overcome the 'albatross around her neck'. She in turn indirectly provided the catharsis that liberated him from the torment of his covert relationship for most of his adult life. However, don't expect a happy Hollywood ending! <br/><br/>Based on Bernhard Schlink's novel, now a standard text in the German school curriculum for understanding the country's history and the first German novel to top the New York Times' bestseller list, the microcosm of Hanna and Michael, weaved into the country's tumultuous post-war soul searching, was a complex set of metaphors for a country grappling with the truth, meaning and reconciliation of its past emotional and moral morass.<br/><br/>The innocent naivety of the immediate post-war generation was shattered when they discovered the crimes perpetrated by those whom they loved and cherished. They had to come to terms with the past, struggle to comprehend its meaning. Michael's emotional turmoil following his awakening to her secret and past history represented what was exactly happening in his society.<br/><br/>The personality traits of Hanna could be portrayed as being reminiscent of Hitler's Germany. Yet there was much humanity that seeped through that facade - her unsolicited act of kindness to Michael's illness which was the genesis of the liaison, her thorough emotional immersion in his readings, her rapturous response to the church choir, her attempt at reconnecting with him near the end, and her final remorseful acts. We could not hate her. Liberation from their respective debilitating secrets conveyed a positive metaphor for the country's future.<br/><br/>""You don't have to apologize to anyone!"" ""Nothing comes out of the camps."" ""Love completes the soul."" ""Society thinks they are guided by morality but in fact they are following laws."" ""Why don't you start by being honest with me?"" These are examples of many dialog pieces that were laden with meaning beyond the context of the narrative."

","I have heard the first half of 'The Reader' was misunderstood in relation to the second half, or overall story. I also felt the same way during act one. In fact, it was hard to look past the numerous sex scenes and full frontal nudity from both male and female. But, alas, I believe it all came together to fully show how completely messed up this woman, Hanna, (Kate Winslet) made Michael's (Ralph Fiennes) life. What's odd, and is very little attention is paid to the (no spoiler here) pedophile Hanna is. We definitely live in a very contradictory society when it comes to sexuality. It's generally okay for two women to be in a relationship (and usually rooted on,) but it's an abomination for two men and it's a mortal sin for an adult male to have sexual relations with an under-aged female (or male) but it's barely even mentioned  or poked fun at  if it's an adult female with a boy. I will probably never understand this and it's relevant in this film as, if it's mentioned, it's hardly an issue when Hanna seduces and steals Michael's youth  and eventual life. Overall, it's a beautiful, if disturbing, film, with great performances from Fiennes and definitely Winslet. Not to try and reveal anything, she is truly a monster, and Winslet deserves an Oscar (and Globe) for such a powerful look into her demon she seems fine with sweeping under the carpet. Young Michael, (David Kross) the victim (in more ways than one) seemed to try his best; I give him kudos for effort and the ability to bear all. Little can be said about the plot, without spoilers, but it's definitely a must-see film about potential war crimes, and the victims that stack up. Even when the war's over."
"kyanberu","9","2","2","19 January 2009"," Monster or Victim?
","The Reader tries to tackle questions as broad as What is truth? What is justice? And, more narrowly, who should be singled out to pay for a nation's collective guilt? But the key question confronting law student Michael Berg (David Kross) is respect for Hanna Schmitz' (Kate Winslet) privacy versus the truth needed for justice.<br/><br/>The film, directed by Stephen Daldry and based on a work of fiction Der Vorleser by Bernhard Schlink, touched on stereotypical elements of the German psyche such as an excessive need for order and approval by superiors and helped to explain why good Germans became Hitler's willing executioners. Reader is a very good movie thanks in part to the acting of Winslet and Kross (younger Michael). This is nothing against the acting of Ralph Fiennes (older Michael), but the defining scenes of the movie involved the younger rather than the older Michael. At times the film moved slowly as Daldry kept the camera on Winslet or Fiennes as if to give us time to try to decipher what secrets were in their minds. Would the film have been better in German with sub-titles? Perhaps, but I think Winslet and Fiennes made convincing enough Germans.<br/><br/>One scene is reminiscent of Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft in The Graduate, but under the freer standards of 2008 versus 1968 the film goes on to show the culmination of their encounter. Is this a good thing or not? Perhaps The Graduate's bedroom scene suggested the contrast between jaded experience and unsure enthusiasm better than The Reader showed it in living color. The Reader also presents a reflection of a theme from Sophie's Choice (a great book, but a not-so-great movie) from the point of view of the prison guard rather than the prisoner.<br/><br/>Another sub-plot deals with the reason six low-level female camp guards were tried for war crimes 21 years after the war's end. A survivor of the camps had published a book singling out these six. Such a book could have been a source of renewed anti-Semitism as Germans asked why the survivor is reopening old wounds by going after women who were only following orders. But Daldry brings this sub-plot to a meaningful close. In a difficult encounter that takes place in New York in 1995, Fiennes and the survivor (Rose Mather, played by Lena Olin) try to come to grips with forgiveness, absolution and responsibility.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, we are left with two questions: Was Hanna Schmitz an unfeeling monster who felt no remorse for her part in the murder of 300 human beings, and who used (and statutorily raped) 15-year old Michael Berg for her own pleasure? Or did Kate Winslet convince us that Hanna was a victim: a naïve young woman who believed she was only doing her duty for the Fatherland and engaging in a harmless, mutually pleasurable relationship with Michael Berg? And what about Michael Berg? Was he always destined to be an amoral attorney who never acknowledged the guilt of his parent's generation, including the guilt of Hanna? Or was he the victimnever able to enter into full relationships with others because of his youthful affair with Hanna?"
"DICK STEEL","8","2","2","17 January 2009"," A Nutshell Review: The Reader
","After the recent Golden Globes, I'm sure many were scratching their heads why Kate Winslet was put up for a Supporting Actress award, because if she's not the lead actress in The Reader, then I don't know who is.<br/><br/>Based on the book by Bernhard Schlink and adapted for the screen by David Hare, The Reader tells of the sexual relationship between a boy and his older lover during a summer in post WWII Germany that had been kept under wraps, and the aftermath of that relationship after some trying circumstances involving sudden departures, unexpected reunions, and worse of all, denial because of confusion in wanting to do what's right.<br/><br/>Directed by Stephen Daldry, The Reader tells the story of Michael Berg (played by David Kross and Ralph Fiennes as the older man) and his sexual awakening under the tutelage of Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet with an accent), a tram conductor whom he met one day when he was sick. Soon after he's back at her place more frequently like a horny schoolkid given a head start in sex education, who thought that his reading to her the classics of works from Charles Dickens to D.H. Lawrence was kinky foreplay. Rated R21 for full frontal nudity (male included) and what have yous, but it's all quite tastefully done without the need to gratuitously exploit the scenes.<br/><br/>The first half dealt more with the physical nature of Michael and Hanna's relationship which slowly transforms to an emotional one, albeit peppered with issues because of their obvious age gap, and for her, in being a cradle snatcher. We know little of her past as well, which will be revealed in due course, but so long as it's not made known to her lover, their tiffs (as with all couples) become more pronounced and reconciliation becoming more difficult as well. She disappears one day, leaving Michael heartbroken, and it's not until much later during a trial that he finally learns more of her. Not an ideal situation of course, as it presents a chock load of questions to which there are no clear answers.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet deserves her awards thus far for her portrayal of a woman hiding what she deems as a shameful secret, and it's not about her romance with Michael at that. She gives her Hanna an air of innocence despite the severe crime against humanity in which she was implicated, all because to her it was a job, and has to be done right, and duties discharged professionally. Winslet brings through her exasperation really well, and slowly we see her steely resolve and innovation in correcting her deficiency. The make up department also deserve credit for their work on her, and adds an extra dimension to her performance.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes on the other hand has limited screen time here as the older Michael Berg, but managed to add gravitas by linking both past and present together. His role is to carry the sense of guilt over, as well as to seek some redemption and forgiveness of his past. His short scene opposite Lena Olin wrapped that up quite nicely. David Kross naturally steals the show as the protagonist, who in his youthful exuberance and defiance at first deemed his relationship under wraps to be perfectly novel, until like Adam's biting of the forbidden fruit, he finds himself surrounded by controversy that he's unable to handle, and a tinge of shame that his promising future will be on the rocks should his illicit affair be made known.<br/><br/>Kross had shown this change of attitude perfectly. From that innocence of a wide eyed boy toward getting to the candy shop every day, preferring to forgo hanging out with his immature peers for the arms of a mature woman, to discovering that growing up also meant change, and wistfully wanting to be back with his peers. He doesn't know whether to do the right thing, or weighing the consequences, prefer to keep mum, deny, and let another go through persecution alone. His failure to understand and grasp his reading to Hannah, and worse, that act being associated in what was deemed to be a heinous crime, seemed to all condemn his silence even further. While Ralph Fiennes had that excellent scene opposite Lena Olin, here David Kross has plenty opposite Bruno Ganz who plays his law lecturer.<br/><br/>You know that Oscar season is here when movies like these start to make a beeline for release dates from now until February. The Reader is recommended for its well thought story, as well as its wonderful cast to bring to life a tale of romance, guilt and redemption."
"markgorman","7","2","2","4 January 2009"," sensitive treatment of a difficult subject
","I watched this riveting movie without prior knowledge of the book which it is sourced from by Bernard Schlink. Some reviewers had implied that it is hard to follow given a complex flashbacks plotting device but neither I nor Jeana had any difficulty in keeping up.<br/><br/>It's very good. Kate Winslet's performance is, in my view, a career high and the young Michael Berg, played by David Kross, puts in an outstanding turn as Winslet's young (underage) lover, before the part is taken over beautifully by Ralph Feinnes. Lena Olin has only a very small part at the end of the movie, playing the daughter of a Holocaust survivor but her role is fundamental to the film's denouement and she carries it off stunningly.<br/><br/>I'd rather not spoil the plot by revealing the key central twist which you can see coming, but it is very effective and takes the third act of the movie into a new, and unexpected dimension. The first act is essentially a seduction and the second, a courtroom drama. All three are paced slowly but carefully. In lesser hands this film could have gone so wrong in so many ways but the acting is supplemented by great writing (David Hare - well, what do you expect) direction (Steven Daldry) and Cinematography (Roger Deakins whose last brilliant movie was No Country For Old Men). Indeed the movie is nominated for best film, writing directing and supporting actress at the Golden Globes. Quite rightly in my opinion.<br/><br/>It's very moving and given the nature of Winslet's role it's a tribute to her and the production team that you sympathise with her throughout, even though she clearly would not find universal favour.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10."
"fablesofthereconstru-1","6","10","18","3 January 2009"," The day the lawyer cried
","Those Jews, first they kill Jesus Christ, then they kill an illiterate German woman's self-esteem with their ability to read. In Jerry Lewis' ""The Day the Clown Cried"", a circus clown is employed by the Nazis to leave the Jewish children laughing all the way to the gas chamber. Since Lewis allegedly owns the last print of this lost film, people can only read about it. But readers don't need to actually see the film before making up their minds about the tastelessness of Lewis' enterprise. The reader knows what went down in the death camps. He uses his imagination. That's why Michael's visit to a concentration camp in ""The Reader"" strikes me as a moment that creates dissonance within the narrative. As a young law student, Michael Berg(David Kross) had the bloom knocked off his first love in the most dramatic way possible; he learns that his older lover was a Nazi guard in the women's camp who made the female prisoners read to her before they were gassed. In the same court hearing, Hanna(Kate Winslet) and the other guards are being charged with the willful murders of three-hundred Jews, when none of the women opened the doors during a camp fire. As a reader, like the readers in the audience, Michael forms the concentration camp, and the fire in his head. A reader converts words into pictures. In ""The Reader"", Hanna is never placed in the context of her Nazi party heyday; her crimes are merely rendered through oral history, a court record. Because we never see the hapless woman in uniform, the film seems to neither exonerate, nor vilify, her Nazi past.<br/><br/>In the film's most extraneous scene, as aforementioned, Michael tours a concentration camp, which has the unintended effect of siding with Hanna, by its implication that the audience is just like her; they're non-readers who need everything spelled out for them. Since Michael(Ralph Fiennes) shows kindness towards a war criminal, the filmmaker is obliged to acknowledge the six million Jews who perished during WWII as a counterbalance against favoritism, by showing Michael's guided tour through hell. This is overcompensation, however. Overcompensation for what exactly? The filmmaker conducts an act of unconscious illiteracy, in the filmic sense, when he misjudges his protagonist, who as a reader, already understands the evil inherent in the words spoken by the court magistrate, concerning Hanna's role as a guard. This scene is for the audience, exposition for exposition's sake. When Kate remains silent about her inability to read or write, choosing to claim authorship of a report about the fire she didn't write; likewise, the filmmaker's intended audience is illiterate by not reading the concentration camp scene as a means of permission to find Hanna a sympathetic character, despite her affiliation with the Nazi party. Nobody wants to admit that Hanna is actually more likable than Rose Mather(Lena Olin), a holocaust survivor who wrote a memoir about her concentration camp experience. Rose seems so far-removed from her survivor past, she comes across as one of those profiteers that Tova Reich wrote about in her novel ""My Holocaust"". The audience feels obliged to embrace Rose's thorniness as Michael tries to make amends with the holocaust survivor on Hanna's behalf, but the film is not calibrated in favor of the Jewish victims. Hanna is the victim. The non-reader relates with the Nazi, their partner-in-crime, against the Jew, the person who can read and write. <br/><br/>The day the lawyer cried in ""The Reader"" was not because three-hundred Jews died in a fire. Michael cries when his Nazi lover writes back to him. It's hard to recommend a film which manipulates a segment of the audience into identifying with the vulnerable side of evil incarnate, and ignoring evil's nature altogether."

The film is beautifully shot, locations are in complete relation to the story, and watching the face of David Kross look at Winslet is a treasure to behold.

","In 1995, in Berlim, the lawyer Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) recalls his adolescence in 1958 in Newstadt, West Germany, when he was fifteen years old (David Kross). While walking on the street, he becomes ill and the thirty-six year-old stranger Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) helps him to go home. Three months later, in summertime, he is recovered and he pays a visit to Hanna to thank her kindness and they immediately begin a secret affair. Their encounters always begin with Michael reading a book and then going to the bed with Hanna, until the day Hanna vanishes, leaving the teenager brokenhearted. In 1966, Michael is a law student of the Heidelberg Law School and his class goes to a trial of Nazi war crimes. For Michael's surprise, he finds that Hanna was a former S.S. concentration camp guard and is being accused in the courtroom of several crimes. Michael lives a dilemma: should he disclose a secret that may save Hanna from a life sentence?.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" is a good movie, but never for an Oscar nomination. The story is predictable and falsely moralist with the despicable attitude of Michael in court, hiding the secret that could have saved Hanna from her most severe accusation. In my opinion, Kate Winslet is presently one of the best contemporary actresses after Meryl Streep, but she could never win an Oscar performing a German character without speaking German. That is one of the major differences from a great number of Europeans and non-Europeans actors and actresses, the skill for languages.One exception is the fabulous Meryl Streep that not only learned a Polish accent but also learned how to speak German to make ""Sophie's Choice"". Kate Winslet deserves an Oscar for her magnificent filmography, but never for ""The Reader"", which is another movie about the Holocaust, the favorite theme for nomination in Hollywood. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Leitor"" (""The Reader"")"
"jwkelly-1","Null","6","10","8 February 2009"," Too long and unfocused
","This movie is based on a novel, with a screenplay by a well-known playwright. I didn't read the novel, but maybe it did a much better job of explaining the actions of the characters in the movie. Maybe it had a little suspense, too.<br/><br/>The movie is split into four different time periods, or four different acts. In the first act a teenage boy in postwar Germany falls in love with an older woman. He reads to her and they have a lot of sex. There is very little tension or suspense in this act. There are many dull and unnecessary scenes at his family dinner table, and many dull and redundant scenes at a lake where the boy swims with his classmates. This act could have been eliminated and suggested during the rest of the movie as the ""backstory"".<br/><br/>The second act has the boy in school where his class goes to the courtroom and attends a trial at which his former lover is accused of being a Nazi war criminal. This is the interesting part of the movie, where the moral dilemmas are presented. The woman is convicted to many years in prison based on a report that she could not have written because she was illiterate. She does nothing to save herself because she is ashamed of being illiterate. The boy has two decisions to make -- will he visit her in prison and convince her to defend herself, and will he address the court and attempt to reduce the charge? He decides to do neither. What a weak and unsympathetic character.<br/><br/>In the third act the boy is now a man, still obsessed with the woman in prison. He records books on tapes and send them to the woman. In prison she listens to the tapes, borrows the books from the prison library, and teaches herself to read. She removes the shame of being illiterate and is proud of her new ability. When it becomes time for her to be released, the prison calls the man and convinces him to help her make the transition back into society. This time he does the right thing, finds a place for her to live, and visits her in prison. But then he also asks her a question that makes her feel guilty for the atrocities committed in the war, and she kills herself. At least I think this is why she commits suicide. Honestly, I don't know.<br/><br/>In the fourth act the man is older and reflecting on his past. This act is split into many parts and interspersed throughout the movie as a framing device. The man tries to reconnect with his daughter. This has nothing to do with the real story, and could have been eliminated from the movie. Also, he takes a box belonging to the dead woman to a survivor of the atrocities. Maybe this is supposed to give some sort of redemption to the the man and dead woman, but it falls flat. Like the first act, this one could have been cut with no great loss. The real story was in the middle two acts, where the decisions were made (or not made).<br/><br/>The subject was good and the acting was very good. But with so little conflict in the movie, it was far too long."
"lor_","Null","11","22","8 December 2008"," Powerhouse acting by Kate & Co.
","Kate Winslet shines in The Reader, adaptation of the 1995 novel by Bernhard Schlink, who attended and did a q&a at the recent preview I attended. I'm guessing Kate, adapter David Hare and perhaps co-star Ralph Fiennes will earn Oscar noms for this powerful film. Schlink indicated that Kate was his first choice for the role, and even name dropped that he was glad that Nicole Kidman was not chosen due to her pregnancy affecting the scheduling. I concur -Winslet is virtually perfect as the former concentration camp guard whose illiteracy is the key plot point in this dramatic examination of the issue (per Schlink) of reconciliation of the First Generation Germans (living through WW II) with the Second Generation (his), who grew up in the Fifties and were not made aware of the horrors and guilt of their parents until a decade or two later on. Not wanting to include spoilers that will lessen one's enjoyment of the picture, I will limit my descriptions of content, and instead forecast great things for David Kross, who has the movie's largest role as the young title character, falling in love with significantly older Kate and reading great novels to her before they have sex. Casting Kross (who turned 18 during the filming) in a part calling for a 15 year old was very helpful to avoid the usual Hollywood practice of casting much older actors unconvincingly in juvenile roles (generally due to fear of backlash from prudes a la that resulting from the recent Hounddog with Dakota Fanning or more obviously Pretty Baby with Brooke Shields). Fiennes plays the same role as a grownup, in scenes alternating between the two time periods: '50s/'60s and '80s/'90s. Lena Olin is also exceptional in a dual role as a Concentration Camp survivor and her daughter. My only fault with this film is easily dismissed: I wondered throughout why it wasn't made as a strictly German film, with German director, dialogue and actors a la the highly authentic recent hit Lives of Others or similarly structured Margarethe Von Trotta opus Rosenstrasse. But of course this was a big production aimed at a wider international audience, courtesy of the Weinstein brothers and the producers Sydney Pollack and Anthony Minghella (once scheduled to direct), the latter two having sadly passed away before the film was released: the film is dedicated to their memory."

The country, which in the 1930s was ""raised from its knees"" (expression coined by V.Putin pertaining to contemporary Russia). This euphoria of newly acquired power and toxic demagoguery of a bunch of psychopaths, which was eagerly soaked by a population hungry for self-respect and ""stability"" (another of Putin's propaganda terms) twisted the usual (tenuous as it is) moral fabric of the society and desensitized the whole country. <br/><br/>How the characters acted appears to be natural - albeit not approvable by hindsight and conventional morality.

David Kross shows his true potential playing Michael Berg - I see a prominent future in his acting career. It is very rare when a movie can move you in such a way as The Reader does. You get lost in the story and the characters. There is not one thing that I would want to change about this film. I have never had such a strong reaction to a movie. This movie shows the significance one person can have on another - even if it is only for a brief period of time. The affects an individual can make on another can be tremendous, and tragic. The love, the pain, and the heartache are all expressed with extreme care in this film. Stephen Daldry should not go without applause, as well as all the actors. This is a movie that will stand the test of time, and teach us of true human individuality, morals, and nature.

","Using post-war Germany as its settings, The Reader is a fascinating exploration of guilt, responsibility, love, shame, the power of the past and the loss of innocence; it's a very complete portrait of Mankind, with its darkness and light, its love and cruelty.<br/><br/>Fifteen-year old Michael Berg (David Kross) meets Hanna Schmitz. A relationship develops. For Michael it's entering the world of sex; but for Hanna it's the birth of something more special. For the time they spend together, Michael is obliged to read aloud to her. During a summer they live a strange relationship of sex and literature. Then she moves away without notice.<br/><br/>Year later, Michael, a law student, travels with his teacher and colleague to witness a trial in which six female concentration camp guards are being judged. Hanna Schmitz is one of them. This is only the beginning for Michael of discovery which will change the way he saw the innocent days when he read to Hanna.<br/><br/>I've come to expect nothing short of technical and visual excellency from the collaborations of director Stephen Daldry and screenwriter Richard Hare. Billy Elliot and The Hours were two amazing dramas in which human relationships were at the center of the action, and The Reader is no different. Kate Winslet pours everything she has into the secretive, weary-looking Hanna. It's a great performance (but not my favorite) by this generation's greatest actress.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes unpredictably also gives a great performance, standing in as the older Michael Berg, whose reminiscences are the bulk of the story. He's a man obsessed with the past, unlike Hannah, for whom ""the dead are still dead."" David Kross is also good. He portrays a fairly innocent kid who slowly discovers the cruelty and unfairness of the adult world. He sacrifices everything for the afternoons with Hanna: friends, family. His feeling of betrayal is quite visible in the courtroom scenes.<br/><br/>It's also worth mentioning the joint cinematography of masters Roger Deakins and Chris Menges. It's pretty easy to spot which scene was shot by whom, so different are their styles. But even their differences work for the movie's benefit, with Deakin's bright colors in the outdoor scenes contrasting with Menges' dark interiors.<br/><br/>The Reader was one of the best movies of 2008 and well worth watching."

","What can say about this film ,this film is an great adaptation of the book The Reader.<br/><br/>There's an urgency in human nature to understand. When it comes to the Holocaust, history's bleak, unsettling period, it doesn't matter what book you've read, film you've seen or account you've heard; in the end, your response it halted by its incomprehensible conclusion. How could humanity course its way towards such a violent, destructive path? How could people knowingly send men, women, and children to their impending doom? Most puzzling, how could the world allow it? Even though its been 63 years since the blood-drenched annals of World War II, its aftermath today is still bone chilling.<br/><br/>After a six year celluloid dry spell, Stephen Daldry returns to the director's chair in a brilliant, sexually charged, and oddly heartbreaking tale about the complexity of human morality and the lifelong repercussions that result from our actions. Adapted from Bernhard Schlink's best-selling German novel, ""The Reader,"" Daldry's visual translation is a powerful, emotionally absorbing film that is one of the year's best. It's superbly crafted.<br/><br/>With World War II over, Germany, in 1958, is still recovering. Deep within Heidelberg, Germany, Michael (David Kross), a young pubescent teenager haven fallen ill, is comforted by Hanna (Kate Winslet), a hard working woman who is twice his age. Taken by her generosity, Michael revisits Hanna to offer his gratitude. What begins as an awkward reunion escalates into a seductive, forbidden affair that intensifies when Michael begins reading to the distant, empty Hanna, who is deeply awakened by Michael's spoken literature. Too young to understand love's complicated implications, Michael is emotionally devastated when Hanna suddenly disappears. Nearly a decade later, unable to forget his passionate summer while studying law, he attends a Nazi trail, and to his dismay, hears Hanna's distant voice.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" is a complex film; maybe a little too complex for some. Though the film pertains to Nazism and the ""sins of our fathers,"" in essence, ""The Reader"" is a film that reflects the emotions inside all of us. During a lecture, Michael's professor comments, ""Societies like to think they operate on morality but they don't."" In this cynical age, how far from reality is that statement? During Hanna's trial, she's questioned why she participated in the Nazi party's horrendous war crimes, broken she replies, ""It was my job."" Oddly enough, that seems to be the justification most people use. Surprisingly, though, ""The Reader"" isn't about her exposure as a war criminal, but an exposure on an individual who took the wrong path. She's not a bad person; she's simply made wrong choices. However, when it comes to having involvement in the Nazi's liquidation of the Jews, how ""wrong"" can you get? ""You ask us to think like lawyers,"" cries on student, ""what are we trying to do?"" A distraught Michael replies, ""We are trying to understand!"" But, just who exactly is trying to grasp a deeper understanding: the court or Michael? How can Hanna's past be forgiven? Director Stephen Daldry brings the much needed emotional layer that a character such as Hanna Schmitz desperately needs. Although her actions are beyond unforgivable, strangely, we sympathize with her. Maybe it's her other shameful secret. Maybe it's superb character development.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" is a film that is driven by it's raw performances. In one of her finest hours, Kate Winslet gives the performance of a lifetime. It's a haunting and heart-breaking. David Kross, who's only 18, is impressive as the teenager with raging hormones; it's such a daring performance. Winselt and Kross bring this picture together. Their performances are jaw-droppingly brilliant. Completing the role of Michael, as the tortured grown man, is Ralph Fiennes, who balances Michael's despair through his melancholic emotion when he encounters a grown Jewish woman, played by Lena Olin, who was also at Hanna's trail. Although her scenes clock in less than 10 minutes, Olin, too, is breathtaking.<br/><br/>When ""The Reader's"" credits rolled, I sat quietly shaken by what I had witnessed. It's a film that is impossible to forget. When a grown Michael asks Hanna, ""Have you spent much time thinking about the past?"" Heartbroken, she replies, ""It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead."" She's right."

","The Reader Imagine yourself as a 15 year old school boy infatuated by a middle aged attractive woman. And then imagine that your infatuation then becomes reality and you have an affair with this very woman. As the story unfolds and the woman moves away your next discovery becomes startling. You discover that the woman you fell in love with, is part of the biggest atrocity of the Second World War. The Reader is a very accomplished film, thought provoking and brilliantly acted. <br/><br/>For the first time in many years there are great actresses up for Oscars. Angeline Jolie for The Changeling, Meryl Streep for Doubt and Kate Winslett for her portrayal of Hannah Schmitt. Where Winslett edges the competition is how she manages to display an aloofness and naivety, that makes you feel a moral dilemma as the story unfolds. David Kross is superb as the young Michael as is Feinnes as the older Michael. But where the film is to be commended is where the lesser parts are equally delivered as powerful. A scene where the student questions his Law Teacher by saying ""This trail is a diversion- There are 6 people on trial that are guilty and they are only there because of a book that was written"" He goes on to add that the Nation was guilty there were thousands of camps, thousands of guards at Auschwitz and everyone knew about them, our parents, our teachers and they are all as guilty for not doing anything about them. He infers that the Nation are putting 6 people on trial as if to absolve themselves of the crime. The next great scene is the survivor who says to the older Michael  ""Don't go to the camps you wont find the answers there, they are empty. We never went there for therapy they weren't Universities we were clear what it was we had to do"". What she is inferring to, is that those that are punished for their crimes are treated humanely and have the opportunity to get something from their crimes, whereas it was clear they had nothing and were going to get nothing and all they could do was try to survive. There will be many who say  Not another film of the holocaust-(If you can get the Frontline 55 minute movie which was made directly at the time of the camps being liberated then you will have no doubts it happened). But it is a necessary film to make and where this film should deserve and get high praise is in the way it is told. Where this film is so brilliant is if you know nothing about the plot or what the film is about because then you find as I did you will be shocked. It would be fantastic if the film received best film Oscar which I doubt or indeed best Director because as a film that is up there with the best. The central point of the film is that Winslett is illiterate and so The Reader is the young Michael and later the older Michael and those that were in the death camp. If the film achieves two things highlighting that we must never forget the Holocaust and illiteracy is something that we can do something about. Then it will have achieved more than the actors, actresses and Director could hope for, whether they win Oscars or not."
"hall895","7","4","6","22 January 2010"," Sympathy for the devil
","The Reader is a film which for the first half of its running time goes to great pains to make sure the viewer sympathizes with the character of Hanna Schmitz. Nevermind the fact that Hanna, a woman in her mid-30s living a quiet life as a tram conductor in Germany in 1958, is carrying on an obviously inappropriate love affair with a 15-year old boy. And in actuality there is not much love at all in this supposed love affair, this is pretty much all about sex. Well, sex and reading as Hanna makes her young lover, Michael Berg, read to her before they get down to business. The reading angle is curious to say the least but that will make sense in time. Anyhow we watch as Hanna seduces the young, innocent Michael. And watch and watch and watch again as this movie certainly doesn't skimp on the sex scenes. And despite the nagging sense that this relationship is obviously wrong the film makes no bones about the fact that we're supposed to feel empathy with Hanna, to be on her side. And then just like that Hanna disappears. Eight years later we see her again. But now Hanna Schmitz is on trial. And we learn her dark secret. Hanna Schmitz was a death camp guard, responsible for the deaths of countless innocents. Are we still meant to have empathy for this woman? It's a lot harder now that's for sure. If we pity her maybe it is because of her other secret, the one she keeps hidden as she finds it to be even more shameful than her death camp atrocities. Sorting out our feelings for the complex character of Hanna Schmitz will not be easy. And we're just watching the story, Michael Berg is living it. His coming to grips with the truths with which he is confronted is what it seems this movie is ultimately all about.<br/><br/>This is a movie which asks a lot of questions to which it appears there are no comfortable answers. Most centrally, once we learn the truth about Hanna's horrible past should we not be repulsed by this character? She is pure evil, isn't she? Or was she just, as she rather coldly explains it, doing her job? After spending so much time embracing Hanna is it so easy, for us and for Michael, to all of a sudden perceive her to be some sort of devilish monster? There is no doubt that the story this movie has to tell is a unique and thought-provoking one. And with Kate Winslet playing Hanna you know you can count on a thoroughly professional and powerful performance in the key role. Perhaps even more impressive than Winslet is David Kross in his portrayal of young Michael. We expect Winslet to be brilliant, we also expect that she may thoroughly overpower and overshadow her young counterpart. Many young actors, matched against one of the leading actresses of our time, would have been completely in over their head in this thoroughly challenging role. But Kross holds his own. Ralph Fiennes bookends the film with his portrayal of the older, adult Michael and it almost seems as if he is in an entirely different movie than everybody else. He's there at the beginning, he's there at the end and he has a moment or two sprinkled in the middle but wherever he is there's a sense that in his scenes things are somehow a bit off. No fault of his performance which is fine for what he is given to do. But this movie belongs to Winslet and Kross. As the story plays out these two performers create characters you can't help but feel for. Even if in Hanna's case you ultimately find yourself questioning what exactly it is you should be feeling. And truth be told Michael will not be found to be faultless either. Maybe he doesn't always do the right thing. Sometimes though it is not crystal clear exactly what the right thing is.<br/><br/>There is no denying that this is a powerful film. And Winslet and Kross are certainly excellent in it. Perhaps it doesn't all come together as well as you might hope. The flashback structure doesn't always work perfectly. The pace does drag at times. And when the movie finally comes to its end there's a bit of a sense of anticlimax. It's as if the movie has reached its natural ending point but there's still another scene to be tacked on, a scene which makes sense for the story but by that point all the drama has really played itself out. But for whatever flaws there may be along the way there is no doubt that the story this movie tells is a fascinating and powerful one. And that story makes the movie well worth seeing."
"DonFishies","7","4","6","17 February 2009"," Not great, but nowhere near as bad as it is being made out to be
","Like almost everyone, I was stunned on January 22 to find that The Reader was nominated for Best Picture. Not just because it was in and the likes of The Dark Knight, Gran Torino and Revolutionary Road were out, but because it seemed like the nomination was almost out of nowhere. Controversy about the nomination brewed, but obviously, nothing is going to change it. So with an intrigued mind, I went in expecting the worst movie ever made about the Holocaust.<br/><br/>A young Michael Berg (David Kross) is ill, and is helped by a woman named Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet). She is young, but is about double Michael's age. He recovers in bed for months, and goes back to Hanna to thank her for her help. Shortly after, the pair begin a lustful affair that lasts only for a summer. Years later, as Michael sits in on a trial against female Nazi guards, he is shocked to find Hanna among the group.<br/><br/>The film does a fairly adequate job jumping between this core story and the older Michael (Ralph Fiennes) remembering it and the fallout that came afterwards. He acts almost as a narrator, but more of an outsider looking into what his life was and became as the years went on.<br/><br/>To say the film is a Holocaust film is not accurate. Sure, Hanna goes on trial for being a Nazi guard during the war, but outside of these scenes (and minor, haunting scenes in Auschwitz), the film takes place almost entirely in Germany well after the war. It is obviously easy to classify the film as a Holocaust film, but it spends more time dwelling on everything that came after than it does even mentioning the events that transpired. It is an intriguing angle, and one that does not come around too often in mainstream cinema.<br/><br/>But the crux of the film is in the love story between Michael and Hanna. Seeing these two lovers passionately making love is at once just as beautiful as it is creepy. Director Stephen Daldry and the masterful Roger Deakins use very soft angles to express the feelings these two have for each other. And even with the immense amount of nudity, it is very tastefully done. A lot of time is spent lingering on the naked, imperfect flesh of both actors, and it helps to express the emotional hold these two have on each other.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it never seems to be explained why the pair gets together in the first place. We understand some of the motivations, but we never have a clear idea why Hanna would risk so much by having an affair with so young a man. In fact, the first scene the pair has that involves their love is jarringly unbalanced. It is powerful enough to evoke an immediate response, but just seems bizarre later on. Their relationship is vaguely acceptable (albeit slightly disturbing), but it hinges on so little that you wonder why these two have such a strong emotional bond. It almost seems weird to think, but with so much time spent on these early scenes, you would expect a bit more to be discussed and explained, as opposed to merely leaving it to the vices of Michael's older mind, remembering the majority of it as it happened.<br/><br/>Another unfortunate thing is the lack of development in Michael and Hanna. Their backstories are never really explained before they meet each other, and the most we learn about Hanna other than her ""secret"" is the bit about her being a Nazi guard. And even then, we learn very little of what she did, or why she did it. We get no explanations about what lead up to Michael's illness, nothing on how he ended up in law school, and even less on the events of his adulthood. We merely get mentions and vague ideas to help establish who he has become. These two are clearly well written characters, but not enough to make the audience feel like they were truly developed. There is too much of an enigmatic side to both characters that one will never feel satisfied with what is covered (even if it would have dragged the film out longer than it is already).<br/><br/>Relative newcomer Kross is fabulous in his role. He helps hold the film on his shoulders alongside Fiennes, but he delivers the bravest performance of anyone. Sure, Fiennes is great and very subtle in his role, but he is not the powerhouse that Kross is. Seeing him develop from a teenager to a young man is an exercise is astonishing, and seeing his emotional range makes me wonder why we have very little American actors that can pull off similar feats. He just seems to know exactly how to tap into Michael's psyche, and knows just what darkest depths this character feels he has gotten himself into. Watching him question his ethical judgment merely through facial contortions is worth a review all in itself. He has sadly gone underrated through the awards circuit, and it is really a shame. I can only hope he keeps it up with work like this.<br/><br/>Winslet is just as great as you have heard. Much like in Revolutionary Road, she is a character going through an existential crisis plagued by tragedy and heartbreak. She plays Hanna very coldly, only letting the audience in at a few points. She wants us to feel the character's pain, and she wants us to see her as the confused individual that she is. Her performance is strong, and her emotions even stronger. But she lacks the will to make this as devastating a portrayal as in Road, so it seems rather eerie that the Academy picked this role instead.<br/><br/>It's not great, but The Reader is not as bad as most have made it out to be. The story just needed to be as strong as the performances.<br/><br/>7/10."
"collex","7","4","6","17 January 2009"," A good movie, but the book must be better.
","First off, let me start by saying I never read the book, or know it existed before seeing this movie. I will comment on the title at the end of the review.<br/><br/>The story of The Reader is a troubling but fascinating one. Even if you are very open-minded, the tough and sight of an intimate relationship between a 15-years-old boy and a 35 years-old woman may disturb you. I know it did for me. But this uneasy feeling is what is good about the movie: it makes you think.<br/><br/>The second part of the movie is more about the back-story of Kate Winslet character in World War II. And this is here that the movie shows its biggest flaw: you have a hard time understanding the underlying motivations of the characters. Not because their actions don't make sense, but because their motivations are so complex and out of the ordinary that you have a hard time deciphering them by seeing only faces. This is why I think the book must be better: in a book, you can inside the head of a character, which you can't do in a movie (Being John Malkovich aside) The actors must be praised for their performances nonetheless. Kate Winslet had a tough role and played it with brio. She highly deserve her Golden Globe, and probably even an Oscar. David Kross must also be praised because he had the toughest challenge of all: you're first English-speaking role, you're not even 18 and you must play in a sex scene with Kate Winslet? I know I wouldn't be able.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes, however, disappointed me. He seemed like a daydreamer, too soft-spoken, too slow. In contrast to his best-known role (Amon Goeth and Voldemort), he seemed extinguished.<br/><br/>All in all, a good movie, with some flaws due to the nature of the story. Go see the movie and, if you like it, seek the book, you maybe even more satisfied."
"Red-125","7","7","13","27 December 2008"," Kate Winslet is a wonderful actor. She can't carry an entire film.
","The Reader (2008), directed by Stephen Daldry, is a coming-of-age movie that begins in postwar Germany. The film stars Kate Winslet, who is one of the great actors of our time. She turns in another excellent performance in a difficult role. Ralph Fiennes does his usual workmanlike job, and Bruno Ganz and Lena Olin appear in supporting roles. Olin has a great scene near the end of the movie; Ganz appears to be walking through the film without really noticing where he is.<br/><br/>The film deals with the question of German guilt, and also with the complex relationship between the characters played by Winslet and Fiennes. (There's also a subplot about Fiennes and his daughter, but that never goes anywhere.)<br/><br/>Given all the fine actors, and the plot potential of this movie, I was expecting a truly memorable film experience. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The film plods along, with a fair amount of histrionics, but not much else, until it gradually winds down and fades out as the credits start to roll.<br/><br/>Winslet is talented and beautiful and Fiennes is talented and handsome. I'd like to see them together in a film that doesn't hinge on a ""mystery"" that's not all that mysterious."
"JamesHitchcock","5","9","18","6 February 2009"," So it is possible to make a bad film about the Holocaust
","The last three decades have seen a number of films on the subject of the Holocaust, including some very good ones. I can think of two masterpieces (Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and Polanski's ""The Pianist"") and one near-masterpiece (Pakula's ""Sophie's Choice""). The recent ""Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"" is no masterpiece, but it does at least occasionally bring some fresh insights to its grim subject-matter.<br/><br/>""The Reader"", by contrast, shows that it is possible to make a bad film about the Holocaust. In the early scenes, in fact, it does not seem like a Holocaust film at all, more like a German version of ""The Graduate"". In the West Germany of the late fifties Michael, a teenage schoolboy, meets, and is seduced by Hanna, a thirty-something tram conductress. The film's title derives from the fact that, after their love-making sessions, Hanna likes Michael to read to her, normally from literary classics. It eventually becomes clear that Hanna herself is illiterate and therefore unable to read these books for herself.<br/><br/>We next meet Michael several years later as a law student in his early twenties. As part of his studies he attends a war crimes trial. Several female prison camp guards are being tried for their part in an incident in which a group of Jewish prisoners were burned to death after the church in which they were sheltering was bombed. It is alleged that the guards failed to unlock the doors to allow the prisoners to escape. To Michael's horror he recognises Hanna as one of the defendants.<br/><br/>Of the three main actors I thought that the best was young David Kross, who plays Michael in his teens and twenties. The older Michael (from his thirties onwards) is played by the 46-year-old Ralph Fiennes, which rather alarmingly suggests that Michael has aged by about thirty years in the space of a decade between the mid-sixties and mid-seventies. Fiennes always seems rather too gloomy and saturnine, and this is not one of his best performances, certainly not as good as the one he gave in another film from last year, ""The Duchess"".<br/><br/>Kate Winslet's Golden Globe has aroused some controversy because it was given in the ""Best Supporting Actress"" category, thus allowing her to be nominated for, and win, another Golden Globe for ""Best Actress"", this time for ""Revolutionary Road"". There seems little point in having separate ""supporting"" categories if the system can be manipulated to allow actors to be nominated for leading roles. In the case of ""The Reader"" the role of Hanna is obviously a leading one; indeed, given that the role of Michael is divided between two different actors, it is the biggest one in the film.<br/><br/>Technically, Winslet's performance is a good one, and she copes well with the difficult challenge of playing the same character as a relatively young woman, as a middle-aged one and as an elderly one. On an emotional as opposed to a technical level, however, I found it an empty one. There is no sense of any inner life, of why Hanna behaves as she does. Neither Winslet nor the script ever makes it clear why Hanna volunteers to work as a concentration camp guard or why she seduces a teenage schoolboy. There is nothing to explain her extraordinary demeanour at the trial where (unlike her co-defendants) she freely admits her crimes, without it ever being made clear whether she does so in a spirit of contrition or of defiance. Hanna even claims, falsely, to have written the official report into the deaths of the prisoners, thereby persuading the Judge that she was in command and leading to her receiving a heavier sentence than the other defendants. In fact, Hanna's illiteracy means that she could not possibly have written the report, but she refuses to mention this fact to the court. Again, no explanation is given, except possibly that she regarded illiteracy as being a greater stigma than being convicted as a war criminal.<br/><br/>There is a similar emptiness at the heart of the film itself. Because of the enormity of their subject-matter, films about the Holocaust need to make an important statement about the human condition if they are to avoid the charge of exploiting suffering for the sake of sensation. There is nothing in ""The Reader"" which helps explain why the Holocaust took place or why seemingly ordinary people like Hanna took part in it so enthusiastically, and nothing of any significance about post-war Germany's attempts to come to terms with its past. There is some good acting, especially from Kross, and director Stephen Daldry invests the film with a suitably wintry bleakness. Intellectually and spiritually, however, this is an empty, barren film. 5/10"

It isn't honest enough to be straightforward soft-core coming-of-age porn, or to be a hard-hitting, revelatory Holocaust movie. Rather, it's a clunky and silly film that attempts to graft the one onto the other and succeeds at neither. ""The Reader"" brings the viewer in, and then teases him, with a half hour of almost uninterrupted simulated bodily functions, combined with nude bathing. It's all a great big, high school literature class metaphor about the washing off of guilt, dontcha know. Then ""The Reader"" devotes its remaining hours to scenes of well-dressed, attractive young Germans sitting around asking and declaring, ""Who's guilty? Aren't all our parents guilty? I hate my parents."" Overlaying every boring, banal, scene and vapid line of dialogue with ponderous, self-important gas, ""The Reader"" ultimately succeeds at neither serious discussion nor eroticism.<br/><br/>From top to bottom, the cast is first rate. David Kross is achingly poignant as teenager Michael Berg, who, in the 1950s, loses his virginity in an affair with Hanna Schmitz, a 36-year-old, former SS concentration camp guard. Kross is both intimately human and vulnerable and also larger than life and every bit the compelling, big screen movie star. In that he reminds the viewer of the young Peter O'Toole. May Kross have a long and bountiful career.<br/><br/>In the ""deleted scenes"" reel on the DVD, there are three fine scenes that could have served as centers of three fine movies. In the most gripping, Thomas Thieme is a truck driver who gives Kross a ride on a backwoods road where a large horse is transporting logs. Thieme is repulsive, terrifying, and also clearly human and in need of understanding. In another deleted scene, in a conversation with his professor (the always brilliant Bruno Ganz) an attractive German boy admits that his father was an SS guard. In a third deleted scene, a prisoner painstakingly learns to read in a prison cell. That these three fabulous scenes were deleted, while endless scenes of nude bathing were kept, informs you of the filmmakers' eye on the box office.<br/><br/>In the DVD commentary, the film's director Stephen Daldry, CBE (Commander of the British Empire), script writer David Hare, and novelist Bernhard Schlink smugly pat themselves on the back. Wearing professorial clothing, tweeds and nubbly sweaters, these graying white men express how mah-velous, perfectly mah-velous it is that they've made such a big, fat, profound film that will finally get people to engage in some serious thought about the Holocaust. Significantly, they never mention a single other of the, by now, millions of works of art that got to the topic before they did, nor do they ever address their pimping out Kate Winslet's &^%*s to make their contribution to the body of Holocaust lit stand out.<br/><br/>Check out the IMDb discussion board for ""The Reader."" Most threads are devoted to such deep and heavy topics as clinically detailed examinations of the tautness and firmness, pendulousness or sag of Kate Winslet's #*&^'s, the straightness or curvature and length of David Kross' %$#^*, the specific acts that the characters engage in, and what bodily orifices are employed.<br/><br/>This review is not a protest against erotica; it's a protest against BS. This review isn't even a protest against the disturbingly burgeoning subgenre of Holocaust porn. In fact there is a brilliant, scathing, unforgettable scene in ""Schindler's List"" where Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) menaces his Jewish slave, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) as she bathes in a cramped basement. That scene is so powerful and unforgettable because it has two things ""The Reader"" completely lacks: psychological insight – the viewer knows exactly who Goeth and Hirsch are and what their relationship is to each other, and, thus, complexity and depth, and stylistic sophistication – Goeth does all the talking. He imagines Helen's replies.<br/><br/>Look, there is worthy art out there about the Holocaust. Read Elie Wiesel's ""Night,"" Borowski's ""This Way to the Gas;"" Rufeisen's ""In the Lion's Den,"" see ""Schindler's List,"" ""Europa Europa,"" ""The Gray Zone,"" ""Shoah,"" or ""The Shop on Main Street."" There's also really good soft-core porn out there, much of it free on the internet. ""The Reader"" gains nothing, and says nothing, in its pretentious, but commercially shrewd, attempt to combine the two genres."

","""But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading."" Gertrude, Hamlet<br/><br/>Kristin Scott Thomas in I Have Loved You So Long has competition from Kate Winslet in The Reader for best actress of the year 2008. The Reader has competition from Boy in the Striped Pajamas and Defiance for the best Holocaust film of 2008.<br/><br/>The real winners in this sample of high-profile film competition are those of us who love good movies. The message is also that similar themes abound this year as filmmakers are in concert about the issues most important to a populace reacting uncharacteristically in a recession and war year by preferring more serious films at a time when escapism would have been though to be the operative guide.<br/><br/>Set throughout the major decades of the twentieth century, The Reader tells of 15-year old Michael Berg (David Kross) having a three-month affair with the older Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) and viewing his life as an attorney who meets up with her again. Although the older woman-younger man motif works well when it moves apace, most often it lingers like long takes from the adolescent idyll, Twilight. The difference is, of course, rewarding nudity and physical and emotional connection not given to that vampire lightweight.<br/><br/>When Reader gets to the trial, it picks up considerably from its languid pace although never reaching the potential of drama and insight such a setup should offer the playwright, David Hare. Bruno Ganz as the law professor is a welcome part of the denouement.<br/><br/>It's Winslet's movie throughout, and she retains a stoic innocence consistent with her character. Ralph Fiennes as the older Michael never impresses me because, with the exception of his brutal turn in Schindler's List, Fiennes frequently plays variations of the most soulful-eyed depressive on the planet. He's very good at the role. As the title implies, reading is a motif that ties the major sections and characters together nicely. It is as good as you will see about the romantic aura of literature from Homer to Rilke and many writers in between.<br/><br/>""Call me a fool; Trust not my reading nor my observations . . . .

","This movie didn't impress me at all. It's too mushy, and I must say politically hurts my feelings. If I had survived the Holocaust, I would be deeply disappointed and insulted. I cannot say that the actors didn't give their best, but I definitely wouldn't choose this film into top 5 for the Oscar. It's predictable and what I cannot stand is the stupidity of the main female character. Being illiterate doesn't necessarily mean that you're unaware of your actions. The victim is definitely not a victim, and I cannot sympathize with her illiteracy nor embarrassment for being that way, which is the main goal in this movie. The mistakes she did were shown as secondary, almost irrelevant compared to her reading disability. The only reason I gave a five to this movie is because the actors did quite a good job, otherwise I'd give a much lesser grade. As for Kate Winslet winning the Oscar for this role, I think that Meryl Streep should have won the Oscar for her performance in ""Doubt""."
"Lejink","4","5","9","7 April 2009"," Tough read...
","I wasn't convinced by this so-serious drama which mixes prurience, rites of passage and a study in Nazi-war-crime guilt into an unconvincing whole, unleavened by so-serious acting, praised beyond its station in my opinion.<br/><br/>The prurience comes from the first half hour when ailing young German schoolboy, Michael benefits from the kindness (and then some) of a middle-aged female Hanna Schmitz who lives alone in a city centre flat. After his ""Mrs Robinson"" moment, it's no time at all before they're bath-deep in a physical relationship, during which Kate Winslet barely keeps her clothes on and reveals a predilection for having literature read aloud to her before the sexual act.<br/><br/>The rites of passage element then takes over as sensitive Michael finds pretty young female classmates and students chasing him, causing him to sever his connection with Hanna, although we're at least spared an overblown separation scene (I don't doubt there'll be an excised scene in the DVD extras).<br/><br/>The film then changes tack again as Michael, years later and now a legal student who on a very coincidental ""work-experience"" visit to a courtroom trial, is astounded to see his old paramour in the dock as the accused ringleader of a group of female ex-Nazi concentration camp guards accused of complicity in the preventable deaths of Jewish prisoners on their watch. Hanna and her Nazi-sisters, you could say!<br/><br/>The film concludes by jumping forward yet again as the now adult Michael who we learn has never properly gotten over his feelings for the by now life-imprisoned Hanna, tentatively re-connects with her although it's never in doubt that we're going to get a downbeat ending here.<br/><br/>My criticisms are that the film failed to hang together in a narrative sense relying on too many fantastic coincidences to keep the plot moving forward. It's inexplicable for example that a guilt-riddled Hanna, seemingly living a hermit-like existence on her own, could seduce and enter into a physical relationship with a 15 year old boy. I've already commented on the coincidence that brings the two together for the ending and also found fault in the too obvious symbolism of Hanna using her adored books as a stepladder to her own destruction as she nears the date of her release.<br/><br/>The acting is deadly serious but I would hesitate to praise the players. Winslet gets to look pained and strained pretty much all the way through and shows her artifice too easily. It seems that Ralph Feinnes has no range beyond haunted and tortured while the young lad playing Michael pretty much exhibits zero charisma. The cinematic rendering of late 50's Berlin does seem realistic, but I was further put off by the jump-around time-frame employed and the overuse of background music in almost, or so it seemed, every scene.<br/><br/>Finally, I will comment on the recent vogue in making movies almost apologetic to Nazi collaborators and employees (c.f. ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas""). Here I felt manipulated to sympathise with another ""only obeying orders"" retired Nazi guard who incidentally shows not one scintilla of remorse for her actions and who then casually seduces an underage teenager into the bargain. The director may argue that this wasn't the sole aim of the movie, but for me this viewpoint too greatly distorted my viewing pleasure and while I'm obviously in the minority going by the average score of this movie, not to mention the Academy's recognition, have to state that I found the whole a cold, vaguely offensive and certainly overrated piece of cinema."
"dierregi","4","6","12","16 March 2009"," Cold hearted
","This is a very cold movie and dangerously close to a hollow and fake one, like the typical Oscar fare. My problem with it is that it is very difficult to sympathize with either one of the two main characters and the other players are just shadows moving in the background. <br/><br/>Much was written about the early sex scenes, which are beautifully lit and bring to mind soft-porn movies rather than anything linked with the holocaust. Because of the way the story is presented - a torrid affair between a boy and an older woman - everything that happens afterward tastes fake. Sure, there are some pretty serious questions hanging around - German guilt, personal choices, etc... - but eventually it all boils down to a couple of unpleasant, cold-hearted people who do not care much about others and little about themselves. <br/><br/>Hanna is a little bit more believable as a character, as the uneducated, brutal creature who just obeys orders and does not think about the past or consequences. The boy Michael is a stereotype of the cold German, and on top of that, his actions are totally illogical. First he is supposed to be in love with Hanna, but does nothing to help her (due to German guilt I guess, but still unforgivable, especially coming from somebody who chose law as his profession). Then, after many years he is again ""nice"" to her, but refuses any direct contact and finally, when it is conveniently too late, he decides to come clean and confess. <br/><br/>Of course people behave in illogical and inconsistent ways, but I found his behavior really too much of a mess. Kate Winslet as Hanna is good, but again, this role is possibly the most unsympathetic, distasteful and ambiguous she ever played. I'd rather see a good comedy any time than a pretentious, made-for-the-Oscar movie like this one."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","4","7","8 March 2009"," The Enigma That Is Hanna Schmitz, A War Criminal
","The man who gave us the down-to-earth 'Billy Elliot' and the phenomenal 'The Hours' is back with a dark story about a woman and the mysterious motivations behind her actions. Stephen Daldry (one of my favourite directors) is a master storyteller. His films have a unique treatment that is sincere but somewhat complex. It is clear that the man puts a lot of heart into his films as he seems to devote attention to everything from actors, soundtrack, cinematography, sets to the smallest of things. He has an eye for visuals and almost every frame, while beautiful to look at, appears very authentic.<br/><br/>'The Reader' is no exception to the above mentioned points. This time it is the versatile Kate Winslet who gets the opportunity to work with him and the result is a magnificent performance. While Fiennes, Olin and especially Kross are good in their roles, Winslet marvelously captures Hanna's coldness, manipulation and fascination for reading. Note the glow in her eyes, how they light up when she is being read to and when she finally begins reading and how she manipulates Michael with sex (as for her sex itself does not seem to mean much more to her than physical pleasure). Winslet also skillfully displays the enigma that is Hanna Schmitz. After all, both Michael and the viewer wonders who Hanna is.<br/><br/>Why was she so cold and distant towards Michael? Did it have anything to do with the fact that she couldn't read and he could? We notice that Michael isn't the same anymore after discovering the truth about her past and he too is not able to form any close attachments until after Hanna's suicide (which is evident in the scene with his daughter). Why did Hanna contribute to 'killing' the children who read to her? Was literacy the primary motivation? The fact that they could read might be what drew her closer to them but she may have envied and resented them for the same reason because she herself did not know how to read. Perhaps her lack of guilt during the trial had to do with pride and guilt. After all she does reason that it was just a job. Perhaps she felt undeserving of absolution which is why she did not show guilt (as a result of which she got a harsher sentence than her partners in crime). Perhaps deep down she resented herself because she did not know how to read. By the end of the film, it is apparent that she does feel remorse. After her suicide she does leave money to Ilena. What motivated the suicide is questionable, just like everything else about her life.<br/><br/>'The Reader' is like a complex puzzle that is both fascinating and intriguing. It is an excellent movie for discussion and one that warrants revisiting. Perhaps then I'll be able to uncover more about this intriguing character or, instead, find more questions."
"dfranzen70","7","4","7","24 January 2009"," Unsatisfying execution boosted by Winslet
","The Reader, starring Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes and set against the backdrop of the Holocaust, is at times tiresome and plodding, offering a unique plot (boy has affair with older woman, finding out later she was a Nazi guard) and a strong performance by Winslet and very little else. Its main problem seems to be that it simply doesn’t know what it wants to tell the viewer, what lessons it wishes to impart. As a result, its identity shatters into the proverbial million little pieces, each less interesting than the last.<br/><br/>Michael Berg (David Kross) is 15 and on the verge of falling under two spells: first, scarlet fever, from which he recovers in a few months, and then Hanna (Winslet), the older woman who helps him when he becomes ill. It is from this latter spell, though, that Michael never recovers; he feels the impact of their short, summer affair until the end of the movie (forty years later).<br/><br/>As romances go, it’s pretty sweet for the teen: he gets to sleep with a sexy older woman who desires only one thing (other than his sinewy body, of course): for him to read to her whatever trips his fancy. It’s a symbiotic relationship; he’s happy to have found a kindred spirit and ecstatic - pardon the term - to find an outlet for his hormones. She, on the other hand, is happy for his company and to hear him recite works of classic literature.<br/><br/>But as all affairs do, theirs ends abruptly, with nary an explanation, and that’s the last young Michael sees of Hanna, until he’s in law school years later, and as a field trip he’s in the very courtroom where a group of female, ex-Nazi guards is being charged with war crimes. Lo and behold, one of the guards is Hanna! The story is related in flashback through the memories of the adult Michael, played by Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes is a fine (ha) actor, of course, but it seems he’s always stuck with these repressed, completely controlled roles. Distant, Michael’s called in the movie, an emotional cipher. Michael attempts, for decades, to come to grips with two dilemmas: why did Hanna leave him, and is her alleged Nazi past true? For me, I didn’t much care about his first dilemma; of course she left him, because she’s like twice his age and he was the clingy, controlling type. I was more concerned with the latter dilemma, because the trailer leads you to believe there’s some dispute about that. But this isn’t a courtroom drama. It’s more of a romance melodrama with serious undertones about the choices we make and the responsibility we marshal. The suggestion is made in the movie that the German people are looking for someone on whom to pin the blame of the Holocaust, and who better than guards following orders? Really, the film has just one thing going for it, although it’s a doozy: Kate Winslet, who electrifies the screen even when she’s not on it. Her vulnerable, conflicted Hanna is nurturing and distant, just as Michael would turn out; we can only guess at her true feelings, but Winslet is so talented that with a mere glance she can turn our perceptions on edge. She is this film, inside and out, and the fact that she also gets naked doesn’t hurt matters.<br/><br/>The Reader perhaps overreached its goals, whatever they may be. It admirably tries to give us a main character who is not noble and good of heart in all things, but it fails to give us a solid reason to care about the proceedings other than as if we were being read a tale set in a faraway land in a distant time."

I just saw it and i am almost speechless.<br/><br/>OK, i cried several times.<br/><br/>And yes i love Kate Winslet.<br/><br/>Im still a bit emotional but ill try to be rational.<br/><br/>The Reader is a love story. A love story against maybe the most grim circumstances it can be in. Or end up i should say, cause the first half of the movie takes up the character building, the evolving of the love. There is quite some nudity in that part, but i didn't find it out of place. It's supporting to the love, as it should be.<br/><br/>The acting is great, specially Kate with her beautiful facial expression. It's never boring. It just took me and dragged me in more and more. It ends in a secret that is not to be told. While Kate aka Sarah finds herself in a difficult position. It turns into a morality movie, while the love keeps into the story, adding to the tension.<br/><br/>This is the first movie i have seen that portrays the people that were actually camp guards in WW2, as human beings that thought they did right. It's not all black and white as we are so desperately willing to see it. (B & W... ?) <br/><br/>Im sorry, i can write a whole book about this, but whats the use?<br/><br/>We will make the same mistakes.

"judasgospel2","6","4","7","23 January 2009"," a German drama ruined by English actors
","This is just another drama exploring the jaded topic of German guilt and redemption. Compared with some recent German films (e.g. Der Untergang, Die Weller, Baader-Meinhof Complex, and The Life of Ohers), this British made film based on a German theme lacks authenticity from several angles of view: <br/><br/>1) Kate Winslet's fake German accent is unbearable to listen to. Foreign accent is only applicable to a person who lives in another country. The fact is that Hanna Schmitz was a German woman living in Germany, why would she have to speak a foreign language to her fellow-countrymen in her own country? If the film is intended for English-speaking audience, English language should be spoken naturally as the story unfolds naturally. By adding German accent only make the film seem more contrived. It defeats the purpose.<br/><br/>2) Kate Winslet did a good job acting a simple woman with tough exterior and a soft heart. But because of her falsified accent, her acting became wooden and stilted, lacking spontaneity. Especially in the love-making scenes, both actors were slow and awkward, showing no passion at all. If you think this is the German style, then you should see ""Baader-Meinhof Complex"" which will give you a real picture of how Germans make love.<br/><br/>3) Ralph Fiennes, though beautifully acted as a mature deep-thinking person, bears no resemblance to the young Michael Berg at all."
"preppy-3","2","8","18","10 March 2010"," Very well-acted but slow, depressing and pointless
","This is about a 15 year old German boy named Michael Berg (David Kross) who,in 1958, starts an affair with a woman named Hanna (Kate Winslet) who is old enough to be his mother. They lose touch and it jumps to 1966 where he is studying law. He discovers Hanna is on trial for being an SS guard at concentration camps. He's destroyed and this leads to discussions on who is guilty and who isn't. She's sentenced to life in jail. Then it jumps to 1980 where Michael is now played by Ralph Fiennes. For no discernible reason that I could see he gets in touch with Hanna. Then the movie slows to a crawl and just drags out the last half hour.<br/><br/>OK--the acting is superb. I can see why Winslet won the Oscar for this (even though I found her better in ""Revolutionary Road"") and Fiennes is just great but this movie is slow, dreary and ultimately pointless. The nude sex scenes between Winslet and Kross are about as unerotic as you could get and their relationship just doesn't make sense. The trial scenes in 1966 are interesting but the discussions on guilt and who is guilty go on endlessly and get repetitious quickly. After 90 minutes I thought the movie was over but we get another 34 minutes that is deadly dull and completely pointless. This is one of those movies that has ""We're trying to win an Oscar"" written all over it. It's slow and somber and full of weighty issues--but that DOESN'T make it a good movie. If it were interesting I would have no problem but it isn't. The movie makers seem more interested in the nude sex scenes between Kross and Winslet than anything else. A boring and depressing movie. It gets a 2 for Winslet and Fiennes alone."
"Otoboke","Null","11","27","8 January 2009"," Dubious and unremarkable.
","There's a rule in cinema that pretty much defines whether or not a story that centres on romance or love manages to engage its viewers in the manner in which it hopes. The best examples of such movies carefully warm us up to the individual characters and then slowly bring them closer and closer until we can't take it anymore; we will them on to find happiness within each other. The Reader, which ostensibly for the first half at the very least- can be described as a romantic drama, can be compelling watching, but only outside of its romantic interests. Hindered with lukewarm chemistry between the two leads and divulging in the obvious facets of a relationship with acute abrasiveness to the point where all subtle nuances are lost, the movie fails to establish its core with any resonance beyond its more obvious façade. As such, The Reader exists as a mostly dubious and unremarkable affair that only ever mildly engages, preferring instead to bore through laborious and dry characterisation than to compel through dynamism and chemistry needed to establish the central theme of love.<br/><br/>For all intents and purposes, Bernhard Schlink's story (upon which David Hare's screenplay is based) is a tale divided into three distinct movements or, acts. Of course, most stories are of this design, yet the problem here is that Schlink, or rather, Hare makes his divisions all too obvious and fragmented to watch unfold. The seam that ties these three stories together are in place- two lovers and their tale of fleeting romance that lasted but a summer- yet the lines that separate them draw far too much attention to themselves than need be. The result is a story that can draw you in, only to perplex you moments later when you are whisked off to a different point in time. Furthermore, as is usually the case, there are acts here that are obviously stronger than others, and one can't help but feel that maybe there was a decent enough story to tell in just the first of the three. Yet indulging in a tale that transverses a series of decades, The Reader feels jarring in its approach, telling a story that has the potential to be gripping and moving, and yet never takes off thanks to its jittering and turbulent structure.<br/><br/>Despite the feature's many technical problems that detract from the entirety of the experience however, there nevertheless remains a select array of elements that succeed in drawing you in. The first and foremost of these lies in the movie's aesthetics department, utilising soft, complementary photography that gives the film a sense of otherworldly realism that is always interesting to watch. Playing along beautifully in the background is the score penned by Nico Muhly, who up until this point has stuck mostly in Hollywood's back garden, so to speak. Muhly's score often complements the visuals in ways that echo the tranquil moments and the much more dissonant scenes built upon tension and conflict with much needed depth. It's a shame then that much of this inevitably goes to waste on a script that fails to establish character and performers who although delivering by the book renderings worthy of a look in for those interested in Oscar noodling- never come off the screen, failing to go beyond their caricature personas and truly touch the viewer.<br/><br/>Taken as a whole, The Reader can be seen as a simple, lukewarm attempt at telling a story of love in all its complications- it also doesn't help that one of them was a guard for the SS. In this context, the movie can charm, but only with a timid sense of poignancy hinted at every half hour or so. The remainder of the feature then can't help but cave under the weight of such contrived pretensions from the director and his cast; we are told there is love here, and we can smell it somewhere off in the distance, but unfortunately that small glint of romance never reaches full climax, crescendo or even resonant motif. Instead The Reader bumbles along for the good part of two hours, middling in and out of mawkish clichés to the point where we honestly don't care where the characters go. Too much scope, with very little development or focus on the smaller aspects of what makes a love story compelling in the first place, The Reader is a troublesome, albeit slightly interesting story (historically speaking) that simply doesn't do enough to make it anything worth remembering.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","6","13","4 January 2009"," Brilliant
","Reader, The (2008) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>In post-war Germany a 15-year-old boy (David Kross) has an affair with an older woman (Kate Winslet) and falls in love but weeks later she disappears without a trace. Years later the man is in law school when he goes to a war-crime trial and sees that the woman has been brought up on charges. What follows will effect his life through adulthood. A few weeks back I said Slumdog Millionaire was my pick for the best movie of 2008 but that has now changed as this film will take the top spot. I expected a great movie walking into this thing but I never imagined how beautiful and touching a movie experience it would turn out to be. The film deals with a lot of ugly situations and has some downright heartbreaking moments but I love movies with great stories being brought to life with great acting. Hopefully the Oscars will treat this film very kindly because it's certainly in a league of its own. The film's basic story has the adult (played by Ralph Fiennes) looking back at his first sexual relationship and the effects it had on his life and especially his estranged relationship with his own daughter. I think a lot of what happens to a young boy will have a major impact on his life and I think that's the greatest thing about this film. What happens to be boy starting with the affair and leading up to the trials make for some very compelling drama. I'd say this is a brilliant coming of age story but I'm not sure if that would be insulting the film since there's so much more to it. The film also does a great job with its rather frank sex and nudity scenes. There's quite a bit of both but the film is very mature about it considering the age of the two people involved. The subject of the age is never mentioned as the film just treats it as one thing that happens among many others. Both Kross and Winslet were very brave in terms of their sexuality but their brilliant performances are the key here. I expected a great performance by Winslet since she's perhaps the greatest actress working today but Kross stands right there with her through the entire film. I think Kross' performance is the real key here as we're seeing all this stuff from his point a view and it's up to him to sell the story and the emotions behind it. The actor handles the awakening of his sexuality brilliantly and he's even better during the trial time scenes where his judgement is going to have a major impact on several people. Fiennes is brilliant as well in his supporting role playing the adult . He has couple emotional scenes, which I won't ruin but his acting inside the jail cell might be the greatest I've seen from him. This is a pretty depressing film from start to finish but that's often the case when you deal with a subject matter like this one. Director Daldry does a masterful job handling the different time periods and putting them all together. The story jumps around from decade to decade but all of this is handled with a problem. In many ways this is a love story and on that level I think the film hits a grand slam and turns out to be a true masterpiece without a single flaw."
"Benjamin_Cox","9","3","5","18 August 2009"," One of the best films of 2008 that's utterly captivating - 88%
","I've been let down before by DVDs that promised much but delivered very little, the most recent example being the decidedly average ""Duplicity"". Who hasn't? But honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this. Yes, Kate Winslet finally got her Best Actress nod from Oscar for her role but I was expecting another ""Training Day"" - a meaty and very talky drama with all the crying and monologues that Hollywood's finest could muster. But this is so much more than that. It's thought-provoking, emotive and full of the heartbreaking characterisation that typifies Stephen Daldry's work.<br/><br/>Berlin, 1995. A middle-aged Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) reminiscences about a long-ago love affair with a mysterious woman called Hanna Schmitz (Winslet). As the pair spend more time with each other, the young Michael (David Kross) finds himself reading to Hanna more and more before she strangely disappears, leaving him heart-broken. As the film progresses, Michael continues to remember the next time he saw Hanna - on trial for war crimes during the Second World War's Holocaust.<br/><br/>It may be too Oscar-friendly for some but both my new wife and I found ""The Reader"" to be a superb movie. Once the story begins, it's difficult to tear your eyes away from the screen as its loaded with so many talented and flawless performances that it is utterly believable. Winslet may have got the plaudits but Fiennes and Kross particularly are just as brilliant. What separates this from other war-based love stories is the rare opportunity to see the aftermath of conflict from the defeated side. Most Hollywood war films are excessively glamorised and heavily focused on the Allies. Mercifully, this isn't - it's dirty, grubby and anything but glamorous. The tipping point, for this viewer, came when Kross is walking between rows and rows of stolen shoes taken from Jews executed in the camps only for the camera to move and zoom out to reveal a staggering number of identical cages, equally stacked. This is one film, like ""Schlinder's List"", that really hammers home the horrors of what happened during those dark days but crucially, it also deals with the collective conscience of a nation struggling to understand how they could be capable of shocking inhumanity.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" may have raised eyebrows with its explicit sex scenes (which aren't that gratuitous, to be fair) but it should have been talked about as one of the best films of last year. It's not easy to watch at times, largely due to the strength of the performances on show. A lot of films will be described as ""thought-provoking"" but in this case, it is true - my wife and I spoke at length after the film finished about what we had seen, even discussing why the characters made the choices they did. I have never known any film to do that with this viewer or my wife but it perfectly demonstrates why ""The Reader"" is an essential film and one of the best war-based love stories I've ever seen. First class film-making."

","When I first watched The Reader, I said, ""Here we go again, another World War 2 movie rather to bash Germans and the Nazis"". How I was wrong, this movie was speechless. By sides the fact that a young boy was ""dating"" a woman twice his age, The Reader shows what Germany was like after World War 2 and what people did to survive. Hanna, the young boy's lover, was a Nazi guard for Aushwitz and was put on trail for war crimes. There's a problem though, Hanna can't ride or write. She couldn't do other jobs because that would require reading and writing so she becomes a guard. I like this part of the movie because it showed that not everyone who was a Nazi joined because they hated everyone.<br/><br/>Another interesting point in the movie was the war crime trials. Guards were sentenced two, three, four years while the higher ranks got the death penalty. Hanna, ashamed that she couldn't read and write, she allowed the other guards to blame her for the hundred of deaths under her control. Sadly, she was given life in prison. I've learned a lot from this movie, and I would suggest having some tissues set aside for the tears."

","THE READER in the form of Bernard Schlink's masterful book made an emotional impact on those who read it. And for once the book to film version holds nearly as much agony and beauty as the original. The screenplay is by David Hare (whose transformation of 'The Hours' was so worthy) and it captures not only the dialogue of Schlink's novel but fills in the silences with well-constructed added commentary. Stephen Daldry ('The Hours', 'Billy Elliot') directs with great sensitivity to not only the narrative story but to the myriad metaphors that fill the quiet spaces in both the novel and the film. <br/><br/>Michael Berg (David Kross, a significant discovery!) lives in Berlin, falls ill with Scarlet Fever, and is given shelter from the rain and cold by a stern appearing Hanna (Kate Winslet). When Michael recovers from his illness he returns to Hanna's flat to thank her for her kindness and there begins a strange and beautiful love affair between a virginal shy lad and an older but obviously emotionally flat yet needy woman. Despite Michael's family's disdain for his absences away from home, Michael surrenders himself to the passion of love and Hanna softens as she pleads for Michael to read to her. Reading and sex become exchanges for this rare couple until Hanna disappears. Michael discovers her some ears later when Hanna is on trial for war crimes (she had been a guard in the concentration camps). Hanna allows her guilt to override reality in confessing she had been the one who had written the orders for the extermination of Jews - this despite the fact that Hanna is illiterate, a fact known only to Michael. <br/><br/>While Hanna is imprisoned Michael (now Ralph Fiennes) records his reading of books to send to Hanna and during Hanna's twenty years of confinement she learns to read and write because of Michael's efforts and gifts. Once Hanna is scheduled to be released from prison and the prison matron convinces Michael to be in charge of the aging Hanna, the story takes turns and the ending is so gently painful that sharing it would ruin the impact for those who have neither read the book nor seen the film. <br/><br/>Winslet, Kross, and Fiennes are excellent in these very difficult roles. Their performances are enhanced with the supporting cast that includes special cameos by Lena Olin and Bruno Ganz and some other fine German actors. The mood of the film is gray except of the isolated moments of bliss Michael and Hanna share and the atmosphere is well balanced by the musical score of Nico Muhly. This is a film worth viewing repeatedly, there are that many layers of meaning to glean from this cinematic triumph. Grady Harp"
"laura_macleod","Null","3","5","16 January 2009"," An important movie theme that needs to be told - Kate can carry it
","It is about time that we had movies about the Holocaust that give the perspective taken from the ordinary German person's dilemma. This adaptation is sensitive and needed a very mature cast to carry it off and it has succeeded. Kate Winslet is magnificent and she is so real and human in this film - she becomes German - she is totally believable. A relationship with a 15 year old is not an easy thing to convey - both actors are mesmerising. Their relationship was beautifully portrayed, every detail of the lifestyle, the atmosphere of the time they lived in , the age difference, the sexuality, the family relationship, the peer group and also the pain of the older woman and her history plus the innocence of the younger man - PERFECT! The reason I cannot give this beautiful film 10 is because they did not age Michael enough when he has already moved on and become a law student. He looks the same as when he was 15 and it does not quite convince - the fact that he chain smokes is not enough to convey age. There was a major miscast with his girlfriend at college because she looked like Kate Moss and it was distracting - she was too contemporary looking. Whoever was responsible for the casting in this film made some crucial mistakes. Ralph Fiennes was wrong for the wrong of the older Michael. He was convincing in his style because he could convey the uptight Germanic type but in fact this interpretation perhaps was not correct - Michael showed signs of passion in youth and originality - surely that would have continued into middle age? I do not feel Fiennes captured the essence of Michael and that was a shame - he was too 'wooden'. It needed to be more open and feeling; in that sense he seemed more British in his emotions and stiff upper lip characteristics. I think Fiennes is a great actor so he cannot really fail, but more was needed.<br/><br/>The ending of the film was very moving and Winslet was amazing to the end. I think this is a very very good film."

","If Kate Winslet, who won a Golden Globe for this performance, does not win the Oscar for the same role, then there is no justice in the world. She was absolutely incredible in a role that had her go from predator, to victim; from seemingly oblivious to the magnitude of what she did, to someone willing to take blame that wasn't hers to avoid embarrassment.<br/><br/>It is extremely hard to critique this film without giving away the magnificent plot, so I will try my best to avoid anything that would do that.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz played a law professor that was critical to enjoying this movie because he made us think about the role of the individual, of the collective, of society, of everyone in the horrible massacre that was the Holocaust, and also makes us think of our role in the massacres that are going on around the world in Darfur and Iraq. Are we responsible by doing nothing? Can we really say we do not know what is going on? It was pointed out that there were 1000 concentration camps. Every German knew. What was their responsibility? What of the responsibility of the 52 million Americans who voted for Bush in 2004 knowing what was happening in Iraq and Guantanamo? One cannot avoid the comparisons, although the Jews had it far worse.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes put in an incredibly good performance, but nothing compared to Winslet. She solidified her acting credentials in this amazing film."
"p_radulescu","7","3","5","5 January 2009"," Love/Hate/Guilt
","The movie seemed to me a bit spoiled. Something was kind of missing. Hardly to say what.<br/><br/>Two extraordinary actors. Kate Winslet as Hanna: she found the perfect key for such a difficult role. It is an extraordinary achievement to render the same personage, behaving each time the same, each time on a totally different plan.<br/><br/>Each plan is made perfectly credible by Kate Winslet, while she remains always the same Hanna.<br/><br/>Then the kid, the fifteen years old boy. A young German actor (David Kross), who played superbly his erotic awakening, a male who's more and more proud and sure of himself, while remaining actually a kid. Just amazing, how this young actor could maintain the duo with Kate Winslet without being overwhelmed by her.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes did not convince me, to be honest. Maybe I'm wrong, I would understand his creation better at a second watch.<br/><br/>Immediately I started to look for the book, Der Vorleser. I found it the same evening and I didn't leave it from hands up to the last page. I read it again, after that: as I didn't want to leave the story from myself.<br/><br/>What makes it so impressive, this novel? It's presented as largely autobiographic, and it is really written with passion, as the author wanted to get finally free of his obsessions. Of course, it is impossible to get the real autobiographical elements, and, after all, once a book is written it becomes a fiction: it is about its own universe, different from the universe of the author.<br/><br/>What is this book about? Is it mainly about Hanna, the woman who had become an SS criminal because she was trying to cover a secret she was ashamed of?<br/><br/>Well, no. It is mainly about him, about The Reader, Der Vorleser (the German language is here more exact: The One Who Reads Aloud, more precisely The One Who Reads Aloud To Be Listened). He is the main character, the book is about his reactions toward Hanna. It is about him discovering through Hanna his erotic awakening, then about him discovering the secret of Hanna, and so, through Hanna, discovering the banality of evil.<br/><br/>Let's make here a short break: it is a book about the problematic of the Holocaust; what makes it original is maybe not the fact that Hanna is not a victim but a perpetrator; what makes it a great book is that it speaks forcefully about the banality of evil. Hanna did not commit her crimes because she was hating Jews, or because she was believing in any of Nazi ideas; she was simply trying to cover her stupid secret and any other aspect was unimportant for her. As simple as that!<br/><br/>But this is not the only greatness. There is another one, overwhelming: his coming to terms with Hanna.<br/><br/>A complex of love/hate/guilt is crossing the whole story, from the beginning to the end. He loves Hanna, he hates her, as he is horrified by the evil. So love/hate, while the guilt, I mean his guilt, is ever present. At the beginning an unclear Freudian complex, at the trial the guilt that he loves a criminal, in the end the guilt that he cannot stand firmly on her side!<br/><br/>The solution the hero finds in himself, to read aloud book after book and to send the cassettes to the prison, to be listened there by Hanna, this is really overwhelming: someone could be a horrible criminal, but she or he remains a human being and keeps always the right for human dignity. Someone could be a horrible criminal but she or he remains a human being, and a human being is fragile; so she or he always needs someone else to protect this fragility."

That film presented elements of gritty northern British realism but filtered everything controversial or meaningful out, leaving us with empty images.<br/><br/>This film ticks all the boxes with high production values, sumptuous cinematography but makes the retrogressive step of having its actors speak with German accents. We're thus treated to Kate Winslett as ze stereotypical bad German who must obey zer orderz.<br/><br/>An issue around how empathy and imagination, being able to imagine yourself in someone elses shoes, can be tied in with literature, being able to read...these issues are never explored. The act of reading, of imagining. If you are illiterate, as is Kate Winslett's character, does this mean your thought processes are more concrete, that you are more susceptible to carry out the kind of atrocities perpetrated by Hannah? Because you have limited capacities of imagining? <br/><br/>A film on this subject must require more effort on the part of the viewer. Otherwise it is a disservice to the memory of those who perished in the camps."

It's about the 15-year-old boy who starts this love affair with a much older woman. He meets her again during his law studies and understands that everything was false. From the beginning of the affair and also from the past. That leads to consequences for his future life.<br/><br/>There are many interesting questions about guilt here.

"bob the moo","Null","4","8","20 February 2009"," An OK film with interesting aspects and good performances but lacking in the total delivery
","The Awards season always generates buzz and also means the sudden release of lots of worthy and good films all at about the same time. Of course this doesn't mean that all of them are good and just because some have hype for acting reasons does not mean that the film itself will be good, vice versa and so on. Coming to The Reader, the viewer already has pressure on them  the film is one of these contenders for awards, it has some heavy-weight performances and it is about a typically worthy subject in the Holocaust. The pressure to be overwhelmed and deeply moved by it is there for all to see  some say films will make heavy plays for Oscar but they do the same for the audience. The reality is not always so (both for the Oscars and for the audience). With The Reader the film is very much on the back of the actors and I left with the impression that that's all it had in its bag.<br/><br/>The story is a reasonably interesting twist on the Holocaust drama as it is seen in retrospect through a case convicting those who worked at the death camps, with a focus on Hanna. We meet her via the teenage Michael and for the majority of the film we know nothing more than her love of being read to and their sexual relationship. It offers the potential for exploration of guilt, of personal responsibility, of morality in the face of a mob mindset, of forgiveness  all of these are here to be had and the cast suggested that the script must really do this, hence their involvement. The thing is that the film doesn't manage to do this to any significant degree. The first half of the film spends far too long on the relationship between Michael and Hanna, because it has nowhere near enough to do with it and it ends up slightly dull as it goes along.<br/><br/>The second half is the guts of the film where secrets come out, things are confronted and issues are on the table for moral debate, whether within the characters or in the group of law students who seemingly exist to allow this debate to occur. Here is where my doubts over the film manifested themselves in proper, if slight, disappointment. The second half, you see, is interesting. That's it. Interesting. It is not challenging, it is not impacting, it is not moving and it is not thoughtful. I honestly no idea why it failed to really punch home on any of these because at times the concept and the characters make it feel like an open goal of sorts. It is a disappointment when all's said and done but thanks to the cast it does still engage to a point.<br/><br/>Everyone is good. Winslet gets the praise and rightly so as hers is a difficult and complex character. That she gets so much out of it when the material does want to explore her very much as part of the narrative is to her credit. Kross works alongside her very well, with a strong performance that matches her in so much as the material needs him to. Fiennes is a good future character and I liked what he did despite having the challenge of remoteness from the majority of the film and also little screen time. The problem is that everyone is good enough to make me yet again be bothered by how the script is not better so that they may have had more to work with.<br/><br/>The Reader is a big worthy film with big worthy names giving big worthy performances. Problem is that it doesn't do half as much as it should with the subject. The concept is fine and the cast deliver it with all they can but yet the material fails to deliver a really thoughtful piece full of debate and impact  the way it is set up suggests it was going to be all about this but instead it is only an OK film with interesting aspects and good performances but lacking in the total delivery."
"Karl Self","3","6","14","9 November 2010"," Wrong on so many levels
","Recently two German movies (Jud Süß -- Film ohne Gewissen and Goethe!) were summarily scolded for not being historically accurate enough. The critics that agreed should better steer well clear of ""Der Vorleser"", which ploughs through complex issues such as sexual abuse and the Nazi dictatorship like an icebreaker through a box of Ben And Jerry's. In a nutshell: in the 1950ies, a 15-year-old boy who looks surprisingly like a 25-year-old underwear model, begins a sexual relationship with a sexy older woman. As it turns out, she's illiterate and lets the guy read to her -- strictly the classics, of course. It's one of those sexual- sensual scenes that chicks go all mushy over. When her employer is about to find out that she's illiterate, she runs away from the job and her lover. Years later, the boy is fully grown into a law student and meets his lover again, this time she's tried for having been an SS guard and having let 300 prisoners burn to death. Again, she doesn't want to let out that she's illiterate (and therefore couldn't have written an incriminating report) she is being sentenced to prison for life. Twenty years later she is about to be let go, and her former lover -- who knew all the time that she was innocent but for some reason did nothing to free her -- accepts to take care of her (pretty creepy lack of responsibility on the side of the authorities there), but there is a sudden turn of events ...<br/><br/>As it is, the movie is a flood of sensual images stapled together by a ludicrous and highly irritating story. Possibly the book was a lot better because you can be much subtler in writing."

"pere-25366","9","2","3","24 August 2016"," An unforgettable and moving read
","There is something extremely dangerous about internalizing the shame or embarrassment a person might have. They can act stoic, sure, but eventually what they tried to suppress will come back to them and at that point, it becomes all the more difficult to finally confront those demons when it does. ""The Reader"" shows us just how damaging such secrets can be, not only for the person keeping them, but also to whom they're keeping them from.<br/><br/>Its story is told in three distinct parts by Michael, including flashbacks that begin at the time when he was a reserved 15-year old kid, falling ill, being helped by and setting eyes on Hanna for the very first time. Their ensuing romantic relationship is a complex one - enigmatic but endearing, abnormal on paper but validated by the fervent, undeniable lust they show for one another. The conflicting forces of their bond are, in a way, what seemingly draws the two together. Below the surface, however, it would appear that their vulnerability plays an important part in it as well.<br/><br/>The film is not unpredictable per se, in that certain elements of the film, like Hanna's feelings towards Michael, are viewed skeptically due to 1. The inherent peculiarity of their situation and 2. Winslet's extraordinarily nuanced demeanour. Our consciousness of the situation allows us to more clearly analyze and understand it and so we are granted the time, amidst their time together, to ponder the psyche of each individual. This element, of its subtext being masked by a rather straightforward situation, makes ""The Reader"" all the more thought-provoking and powerful.<br/><br/>The direction and writing also play an integral role in bringing out the humanity of its characters. The shift in tone, beginning with its brevity and high pace, then gradually slipping to a more pensive, poignant feel, effectively divides its story into its own distinct parts but manages to flow seamlessly by the weight of its characters emotions that seem to never relent and so humanely evolve. This is thanks to masterful performances by David Cross, Ralph Fiennes and, of course, Kate Winslet.<br/><br/>The story of Hanna Schmitz is reflective, regretful and truly heartbreaking, as we watch her being slowly swept away by the uncompromising ugliness that stems from keeping her own her secrets. Perhaps confessing to her shortcomings may serve as the proverbial key to her freedom, but it is ultimately her shame which has imprisoned her for life. And in that sense, she can never truly be freed, only endure what has irreparably damaged her for so many years."

","My first impression was to be surprised about the opening credits: Germany in the 60s? What can be interesting to tell at this time? <br/><br/>Then, it was a poor love story: the couple only met to have sex or to read. Never we are told they appreciate each other for what they just are. <br/><br/>Next, it's the dreadful twist about the holocaust: now that we had time to grow feelings for Kate, we learn that she was a guard in Auschwitz and that she is persecuted. With that dirty trick, the story becomes then a sort of disturbing justification of her crimes, a hypocrite rewriting of history as Americans like it: The point of view argued here is that the Germans who worked in extermination camps weren't killers but just workers. Thus, the real evil was only the famous Austrian and his peers. As my favorite writer, PKD, wrote it and as I have already written for ""Schindler's List"", the first criminal in Holocaust is the German people: when you design gas, camps, when you build barracks, chambers, when you put in a train or drive it, select prisoners, when you lock people in a church, you participle in a crime. You can't hide behind work contract, orders, and threats because the humanity in you commands you then to disobey them all. I understand why the original book pleased so much to Germans who lived during WWII: it tells them they are innocent in spite of they have the bloodiest hands in the world. If not, if they aren't responsible, who is? <br/><br/>After this shameful argument, the movie reaches more interesting water when it speaks about illiteracy but it's too late and too little. <br/><br/>Finally, the movie closes on the traditional clichés of American people: the Jewish family is ultra wealthy and it seems totally inaccurate. <br/><br/>With 5 nominations for Oscars, I'm not finally surprised as I learned to understand that the Academy is pretty delirious in their choices (see for example, ""a beautiful mind"" for another rewriting of facts that has been awarded)!"

","Whereas most viewers praise the performances of well-known and appreciated actors, Winslet, Fiennes, the truth is that is the performance of David Kross as Michael that holds the whole picture together and it is mostly through his eyes that we get to know the story. This must have been a huge weight on the shoulders of this young actor but you wouldn't guess it in his fine performance. He is truly the discovery of the year and I find it amazing that his role has largely gone unnoticed. Still, if the film is loved by many, it's due to him as much if not more than the other co-actors. I hope to see more of this fine young actor in the future."
"Philby-3","8","2","3","31 March 2009"," An adaptation that adds something
","Salman Rushdie, in an essay on adaptation, remarked ""Something is always lost in translation; and yet something can also be gained."" This film adaptation from Bernhard Schlink's novel directed by Stephen Daldry, previously known for ""Billy Elliot"" and ""The Hours"" loses some of the depth of the novel, but at the same time Kate Winslett brings alive the central character of Hanne, the former SS guard in her thirties who has a brief affair with Michael the narrator when he is 15 years old far more vividly than Schlink was able to in the novel. David Hare's screenplay follows the novel fairly closely, but Kate Winslett, often by body language alone, is able to tell her character's story so as to make her understandable, if not forgivable. David Kross and Ralph Fiennes, the two actors playing Michael, who grows up to be a stiff legal academic (boy, do I know the type) also do a remarkable job.<br/><br/>The more stringent critics would say that nothing can be said in defence of Nazism, but they rather miss the point. Schlink and the movie makers are trying to explain why people can behave in such a terrible way, not to excuse what they did. Are the critics saying that Hanne should not have been portrayed as a physically attractive woman? Because she is attractive we can more readily accept that the narrator, at 15, will fall in love with her. He is, of course at that stage completely unaware of her history. He does not even notice that she cannot read. Later, when he knows the full story he is indeed consumed by guilt, but it his not the affair he is guilty about, but his failure to help her, his betrayal in fact.<br/><br/>This segues into the larger question of how can the post-war generation of Germans come to terms with what was done by many of their parents. Neither Schlink nor the film makers have an easy answer to this. Schlink writes ""Whatever validity the concept of collective guilt may or may not have, morally or legally – for my generation of students it was a lived reality."" It did produce a generation who were anti-Nazi. Schlink again ""It converted the passive suffering of shame into energy, activity, aggression."" As to losses in translation, the most irritating change was to recast the linear structure of the novel into flashbacks, which added nothing and made the story harder to follow. Some of the earlier scenes with Ralph Fiennes as the older Michael don't make much sense. But Kate Winslett carries the day with a gutsy and convincing performance."
"garethgrey","9","2","3","27 March 2009"," Torturingly Frustrating but Beautifully Brought to Life
","The film works such a contradictory web around the viewer. We are left with a heavy feeling of frustration as Hanna (Kate) condemns herself to a life in prison because she is too proud to admit that she is illiterate. Her performance is excellent, and her character's feelings of embarrassment towards what she considers to be her deepest character flaw are ever-present. Hanna is so perpetually unable to see that her greatest flaw is in fact her pride. Ralph's character, Michael's, greatest flaw is his love for her, he too condemns himself to a life in jail, as he never moves forward, or finds someone else to love, but instead continues to remain in a distorted relationship with her, which is kept alive through the tapes he sends of novels which he reads aloud. He is not in jail, but may as well be as his love for Hanna is the only thing that sustains his tormented life. He himself is torn between loving Hanna, and hating the corrupting effect that she has had on his person. His performance, however, was quite bad. His unhappiness was beautifully portrayed, but his accent shifted back and forth between German and British all too easily. The director did a fantastic job in allowing each scene the time it needed to take an emotional effect on the viewer, we feel as though we are in every room that the characters are in, in terms of space and the time (Post WW2 Germany). The film very subtley comments on the sense of humanity inside each individual, even those who have been put into positions, in which they've had to do terrible things."
"kos-27","9","2","3","21 March 2009"," ambiguous drama about guilt
","I have to write about this movie because I read so many comments on Hanna being a monster. Nobody is a monster in this movie. The message of the movie is: We are all neither good nor evil, we are always a mixture of both. The world is not a black and white place, it's not even gray - it's multicolored. And if anyone sees Michael only as an innocent victim, what about not telling  anyone about Hanna's secret? His statement could have saved her life.   <br/><br/>Both protagonists  though in a totally different way - suffer from the same very human character flaw: They both have a secret they want to hide by all costs because they are ashamed of it. In order to hide this shame they both do things that are wrong. Their actions are somehow always human and understandable. (Whoever thinks he's above it suffers from an illusion.) They both eventually get eaten up by guilt and their lives take the course of their consequences.   <br/><br/>This movie is a dark and ambiguous story that upsets our values of morality showing victims as possible culprits and culprits as possible victims. The question of guilt is not being easily answered here. This movie won't help you understanding life better but it will make you think about life and maybe your personal guilt.<br/><br/>On one side there is the law - our justice. But there is a second justice system within each of us: We judge and punish ourselves more appropriate than any court of law could ever do. Sometimes our own morality is even more radical and cruel than the one of the ""law"". When we judge ourselves, we often get ""life"" or even a death sentence - with no possibility of parole.<br/><br/>Even though I read the book and knew the story I was deeply moved by this movie. I did not give it a ten only because in my opinion the movie only partially succeeded in showing the devastating impact that Michael's first love experience had on all his upcoming relations."

"honorhorror","7","2","3","21 February 2009"," The Reader is not loud, but has its moments
","The entire movie is complex, multi-dimensional and needs time to digest. It's about the consequences of an affair and the underlying sin/guilt of the affair and the past. 33-year-old Hanna Schmitz had an affair with a 15-year-old boy Michael Berg. 10 years after the end of this summer affair, Hanna was trialled for mass-murdering 300 Jews in the concentration camp. Berg witnessed the whole trial, but was ultimately reluctant to meet Hanna personally. The court sentenced Hanna to be imprisoned for the rest of her life, after Hanna confessed her responsibility as a camp guard of sending women to their deaths. When Hanna was in the jail, Berg couldn't let her go in his memory and kept mailing special presents to her......<br/><br/>At the very conclusion of the movie, the audiences were able to see the immorality/guilt/sins of Hanna comes partially from her illiteracy. But in the trial, in the very law process which decided the fate of her, it's the consequences of the guilt that mattered. Throughout the movie, Hanna always looked confused and conflicted. In the affair with the ""kid"", aka young Michael, she infected Michael with such confusion and conflict. Lately, in the year 1988, when Michael had returned the tin of money Hanna preserved for the Jew victim who accused her, this flow of confusion had come to a conclusion. The movie can be divided into 2 perspectives, the guilt's and the victim's. Hanna was reviewed by Michael in both perspectives so he had the most mixed and conflicting feeling for Hanna. In some sense, Hanna, the immoral senior woman who seduced Michael into an affair with her, had destroyed Michael's marriage and integrity of family before he had both. So Michael, a victim to her, blamed her for dumping him. On the other side, he sympathized with her in the trial because the trial nonetheless aroused people's hatred against Hanna, who was actually illiterate and shouldn't have been sentenced so harshly. In Hanna's perspective, she took an interest in Michael maybe because Michael was considered an reincarnation of the victims in the camp. She made Michael do the same thing she asked the prisoners to do--to read books for her. Their connection, the reading of the books, had become the only connections again, when Michael began to record the reading of the books he used to read to her. It's actually not hard to understand her suicide in the end, since she doesn't have much to live for, and she couldn't face Michael again. There are of course more than one explanations to all of these, when you consider the movie't not trying to tell a flat story but rather a 3-dimensional one.<br/><br/>The movie had a lot of sentimental moments, and tried to discuss the topic about what's the proper criteria of guilt. Should people be prosecuted for real? Does the legalistic system rise people's rage and hatred rather than comforting the victims? It probably took the position that used to belong to The Dark Knight in the best picture Oscar nominations. We can tell this movie is somehow made directly for winning Oscar, so why not give it a chance?"

We are soon transported back to 1958 as our character is seen as a young teenager getting violently ill in the rain. He is assisted by a woman who takes him to her apartment and before a whole lot has transpired they have begun a sexual affair, an affair that both parties keep secret. We move forward eight years hence when our hero is a young law student witnessing the war crimes trial of several minor SS guards. The woman that taught him about sexual love is one of the women in the dock.<br/><br/>As difficult as it is to sum up in under 100 words what this film is about, it is just as rewarding to the patient viewer. It covers a wide range of issues and has something important to say about a wide range of subjects, from The Holocaust to adult literacy. From lustful sex to repressed memories. Kate Winslet is absolutely stunning as a woman who ages forty years before our eyes. Every performance rings true to some extent and that is no easy task given the depth of the lead.

"MOscarbradley","10","2","3","4 February 2009"," One of the most intelligent multiplex films in an age
","I suppose I should have expected more from ""The Reader"" than I actually did. After all, this was the same writing and directing team, (David Hare and Stephen Daldry), who had done such a superb job in bringing Michael Cunningham's 'difficult' novel ""The Hours"" to the screen. Perhaps it was the subject matter, (a May/September romance, both in terms of age as well as in duration, with the Holocaust thrown in for dramatic backdrop), or perhaps it was just the publicity afforded Kate playing older and dowdier than she actually is as if deglamourizing a glamorous actress in itself amounts to 'acting'. I should have known better. Hare, Daldry, Winslet and Fiennes don't do second-rate or hand-me-downs. ""The Reader"" is superb.<br/><br/>I haven't read the original novel but you might say that it, too, is 'difficult'. The film certainly deals in weighty themes; guilt, forgiveness, retribution, redemption. It is primarily a love story and it covers a period of years. As with ""The Hours"" it moves back and forth in time. It has a conventional beginning and end; it's the middle that is off-kilter. The Holocaust does indeed form the background but it is not used flippantly or as mere window-dressing. This is one of those rare commercial movies to talk about after you see it. It is a movie to discuss and argue over, one which engages the head as well as the heart and it certainly does engage the heart; I was moved to tears more than once, (and not in a sentimental way, either).<br/><br/>The story is simple even if the themes are complex. A 15 year old boy has a brief but very passionate affair with a woman who helps him when he takes ill in the street. After a few months she leaves him. During their affair she asks him to read to her before or after sex, anything from Tin Tin to Lady Chatterly which, despite having seduced a 15 year old, she finds distasteful. The boy goes on to study law and a few years later he sees the woman again only now she is a defendant in a war-crimes trial. It is at this point that the film takes off; issues that might have seemed black-and-white become fudged or more complex. The film deals, not just with feelings and emotions, but with intellect as well. There is a good deal more here than meets the eye.<br/><br/>As I've said I haven't read the source novel, which was originally written in German, but the script seems to me a superb example of the art of writing for the screen in balancing the obvious emotionality of the subject with the kind of deeper themes the subject engenders, while Daldry's direction is a model of restraint. As for Winslet's much vaunted performance, she really is extraordinary. This really is a 'difficult' part. The woman is superficial in so far as she reveals nothing of her character, at least initially. She is a tabula rasa and it is left to us to fill in the blanks, (although I think an audience will cop on quicker than the boy does). And it's not just a case of playing dowdy or wearing make-up that ages the actress beyond recognition. It's in how much of the character Winslet reveals, and in stages, to the audience. It's in the physicality of her emotions and not in her appearance that Winslet's performance rests. She deserves every award she has won and more.<br/><br/>The boy is played by a newcomer, David Kross, and he's fine in so far as it goes, but faced with more seasoned performers he seems a little out of his depth. In later life he is played by Ralph Fiennes; it's a small part for Fiennes but he's as good here as he's ever been in anything else I've seen him do. Fiennes is a master of reticence and silence who can convey more with a look than most actors can with a whole page of dialogue. Perhaps I would have been more impressed with Kross' performance had a lesser actor than Fiennes played him elsewhere. There are also fine cameos from those fine actors Bruno Ganz and Lena Olin.<br/><br/>By now, you may have gathered I think very highly of ""The Reader"". a film which treats its audience with the same intelligence as those involved in its execution. In an age of multiplex fodder, for this we should be truly grateful."

Her young meal ticket though comes in the form of Michael Berg, a secluded teenager she meets in a side street in caring for him cause of an ailment. Eventually, Hanna's pedophile storm stars erupting when she starts having passionate sex with him on a routine basis. You don't have too read much into the fact that Michael does not mind that whatsoever. Hanna does fixate for Michael to read her novels and books; call it a foreplay literary fetish, but if it helps getting Kate Winslet into bed with you then it's a well read out plan. OK, enough! Hannah's temporary cradlerock adventure does fade when she deserts her apartment and also Michael for an employment promotion. Michael eventually reconnects with Hannah (and no, not on Facebook) years later as a law student when he witnesses a Holocaust S.S. trial which Hannah is one of the defendants. ""The Reader"" also shows a much older Michael in recent past time reminiscing on his ""Hannah-Barbaro"" experience, and in trying to open up resolving chapters in order to help the troubled older Hannah. Speaking of chapters, I will let you (the reader) visually read the remaining plot line chapters of ""The Reader"" in order for yours truly not to play the part of the antagonist ""Reader Spoiler"". Winslet's performance is worthy of all the accolades it has received. David Kross and Ralph Fiennes also delivered authentic performances as the young & older Michaels respectively. Writer-Director Stephen Daldry did demonstrate the post Holocaust doldrums in ""The Reader"", but his readiness on the narrative was primarily fixated on the impact that hiding a disability can have on people's lives. ""The Reader"" does include some inconsequential scenes that could have been read out of the film, but it is still a powerful film which you should read into. **** Good"
"klaus-harald-klaus","10","2","3","23 January 2009"," Beautiful movie adaption of a beautiful book
","First off I loved reading the book. When I read the book I was about 16 years old, we read it in German class. None of my classmates really liked it, they were all just laughing about its sexual content, but to me, it was a brilliant book. Mainly because I used to have a friend named Hannah, so I always had to think about her when reading the novel. I looked into the book deeper than my peers. To me it was an interesting story, not just about sex and the Nazi regime, but about justice and love. The tragic ending made it even better to me and I remember as if it was today, that before turning the page, i knew the outcome and it brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>To the movie: I think the movie adaption is very good. The actors play their role in a very believable way. It is as fascinating as the book, even though it was (of course, as every movie) shortened and some aspects that we decided in class were important, were left out. Nevertheless is it a touching story and just like the book it is absorbing. As always, the movie isn't as good as the novel. I believe many people agree with this general statement, no matter which book and which film. But this time I was very astonished how good this adaption really was. It is, even though some parts are missing, very close to the book and it has the same impact. It will make you think. This movie is definitely worth a watch."
"dj_xand325","7","2","3","22 January 2009"," 'The Reader' is powerfully executed and stunningly acted yet the lack of a vivid message unquestionably brings down the film
","'The Reader' is a sentimental and heavy journey through the complex relationship between a young man (Michael) and an ex holocaust guard (Hannah). Their relationship begins to consist of odd sexual pleasure to pleasure deriving from the sharing of literature or rather the reading of it. As the film progresses, the two slowly drift apart yet their universal love for literature and furthermore, Hannah's illiterate yearn to be read too supports their rather ominous relationship. Hannah is condemned for life imprisonment due to her actions in Auschwichz, while Michael continues to develop his law career until 20 years later when an astonishing sequence of actions lead to a poignant conclusion.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet's performance was truly praise-worthy, also her leniency in getting undressed and showing a bit of flesh was admirable. Some of her scenes shared with Michael (Ralph Fiennes) were very erotic, yet not in a tasteless way, Daldry shot it in a way to present love and compassion. The erotica wasn't used for the sake of producing just a reaction, not at all.<br/><br/>While this film was powerfully performed, almost masterfully directed and daring on the eye, the film's quality was dragged down by its definite failure to provide a vivid message or any redeeming value. I left the film disillusioned and extremely usure of what I had just seen or what the director has wanted me to see. Not in a good way like 2001:A Space Odyssey but in rather, an annoyingly confused way. I was watching the film yearning for a poignant meaning to this well-presented story, I was waiting for a moment of reflection, questioning or rather simply some type of way to stick all these actions in the film together. Yet instead I left the film mentally frustrated. I do love a film that involves thought, but I feel this film either doesn't have the capacity or has too much capacity for me to enjoy thinking about or to even decipher the meaning of it.<br/><br/>Daldry's 'The Reader' is a film of huge quality, but the lack of any wider contextual edge truly lowers my opinion of it.<br/><br/>Oscar wise, best picture? Definitely not, best actress for Kate Winslet? Maybe.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"gary-444","9","2","3","8 January 2009"," A Literate, Powerful Joy
","A tremendous two hour journey, skilfully produced by the late Anthony Minghella and wonderfully acted by the two central characters, Michael Berg and Hannah Schmidt, played by Ralph Fiennes and Kate Winslet. Fiennes excels as the law student who enjoys a youthful summer romance with a bus conductress, Winslet, who subsequently is revealed as an Extermination Camp SS Guard. A compelling, moving, story is told around subject matter littered with moral bear-traps. Director David Daldrey, whose finest hour to date has been ""Billy Elliot"" handles the subject matter with calm authority, the screen play by David Hare, whose natural home is play writing, produces dialogue of conviction and weight, without sounding worthy or self important.<br/><br/>Although two hours long the plot is simple, Berg's idyllic summer romance with Schmidt ends suddenly, and he next sees her on trial for Nazi War Crimes. The temptation to explore what makes ordinary people do bad things is resisted. Instead we have a simpler tale, of a repressed, illiterate woman, doing her best to survive herself during the war who finds herself at the furnace of evil. Her actions are neither justified, apologised for or fully explained. You make a judgement ""as you see fit"", the advice offered to berg when he takes Schmidt's financial legacy to a Holocaust survivors daughter.<br/><br/>The visceral power of the early sexual relationship is powerfully portrayed with David Kross playing a young Michael Berg, this, and her appreciation of having fine literature read to her dominate the opening scenes. During her trail for war crimes, Schmidt offers an ignorant innocence which condemns her. And although her subsequent self taught literacy apparently saves her, it also condemns her as well. Equally, although the cerebral berg enjoys a career as a lawyer, he too is emotionally repressed by the emotional maelstrom of that early affair from which he never recovers.<br/><br/>Some minor irritations are present. All the actors speak in English, barely a German word is heard, and Winslet and Fiennes effect a light cod German accent. Consequently German authenticity is somewhat compromised.Mindful of the fact that the author of the original book is German ,and it is set entirely in Germany, I think that some concessions to the local language would have been accepted by an English speaking audience.<br/><br/>If the screenplay is seen to favour Schmidt a little too sympathetically, a superb closing scene in which Llana Mather receives Bergs bequest more than corrects the balance. In a stunning cameo performance, actress Lens Olin, immaculately turned out in stark contrast to the wrecked and wretched Schmidt, refuses the money and informs Berg that there is ""nothing"" to learn from the camps. Not in an educational , but nihilistic sense. It is her that she suggests that Berg should do with the money ""as he sees fit"". Itself, a metaphor for how we too should see this fine film."
"Chris_Docker","7","2","3","4 January 2009"," Thought-provoking, but not as philosophically penetrating as it needs to be
","Can you recall being read stories as a child? Warm and tucked up. In your bed. Feeling safe, secure, loved. And that wonderful, strong, all-knowing adult giving you undivided attention? You don't have to do anything. Wonderful tales race before your eyes. Lose yourself in the prince as he slays the dragon. Or the princess awoken with a kiss. When we awake as adults, we maybe re-create that security for ourselves. We read to get to sleep. We read to our own children. We enjoy worlds and emotions that give us respite from the hard business of living. Why not? I wondered if Hanna (Kate Winslet) had ever been read to as a child. A hard life shows on her face. She lives in a tiny apartment in Berlin. She gets by. But, more importantly, Hanna cannot rebuild her world through a half hour escape in a novel. Hanna cannot read.<br/><br/>The Reader brings together familiar enough story lines  the seduction of a young boy by an older woman  the trial of a former SS guard  guilt  self-sacrifice  love found, then lost. But the emotional punch is delivered by mismatching our sympathies to the characters. The people we love turn out to be deeply flawed. But if we hold that against them, are we doing so to make ourselves feel better?<br/><br/>Hanna has sex with young Michael, shortly before his sixteenth birthday. We are encouraged to just accept it. Any analysing over whether it was 'wrong' or screwed Michael up emotionally can be done by those diehards in the cafe after the film. More pertinent at the time is their genuine affection, the superb acting, and the imaginative love-making between an extremely buff Michael and a rather fit-looking Kate Winslet. Winslet/Hanna is the constant transformation throughout our film. She is harsh, convincingly Germanic, and ages convincingly from her thirties to her seventies. It's a make-up job that almost rivals Kidman's Virginia Woolf in director Stephen Daldry's earlier masterpiece, The Hours.<br/><br/>Hanna is brutally honest with herself about almost everything. Except one thing. She is deeply ashamed of being illiterate. She hides it from Michael, who nevertheless senses it. He makes a habit of reading to her. Everything from Homer's Odyssey and Tolstoy to comic books and back again to Chekhov. We realise how important it is to her: she announces to him that he will read to her before making love, not afterwards.<br/><br/>Michael continues schooling to become a lawyer. Hanna is offered a promotion from her bus conductor job  to work in an office. This is a disaster  as she can't read. She throws a hissy fit at puzzled Michael and breaks up their affair. Later, when we learn she had once accepted work as an SS guard instead of a step up in her old job, we can secretly suspect the same reason.<br/><br/>Although Hanna is guilty of terrible crimes in the past, our sympathies are not so much with her victims. The one survivor has written a damning book and patently done rather well for herself. Elegant and tall in contrast to the haggard and drawn guards on trial. Those indicted are a handful out of tens of thousands. Symbolic sacrifices. Their incarceration allowing the silent others to feel sanctified. Germany righteously punishes its own. Jews are avenged. Justice is seen to be done. But we see Hanna's co-accused gang up on her. She confesses to something she could not have committed. A personal surrender, an over-redemption.<br/><br/>Michael doesn't announce a truth that would mitigate her sentence. He is too ashamed to be connected to her. He disguises it as 'respecting her wishes.' Like Odysseus secretly observing Penelope, he stays incognito. Michael's 'respectable shame' becomes the shame of humanity, unable to forgive, whatever the cost.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes, as the older Michael, is well-cast. Although the opening scene of The Reader recalls Constant Gardener (white collar chap with nude woman wandering around apartment), Michael is more of a throwback to the slimy characters that Fiennes specialises in.<br/><br/>At this point I differed from my viewing companion on the film. She declared it one of the saddest films she had ever seen. While I could not get it out of my mind what a slimeball Michael was. We both agreed it was fundamentally a love story. But for me it was marred by an increasing sense of cynicism. Catharsis for whom? As the emotional valence ratchets up scene by scene, I feel sucked into a sick psychopathology of characters whose stunted development was hardly a matter for theatrical wallowing. And while Winslet ages forty years in the course of the movie, Michael simply has two ages played by two actors. At one point  amid the dizzying flashbacks and forwards  I had to believe Fiennes was twenty years younger as he was wearing a jumper instead of a tie.<br/><br/>David Hare has done an admirable job with the screenplay. But the philosophical questioning of attitudes to people who helped the Nazis is hard to portray with cinema's broad brush. In The Hours, Hare (and Daldry) had both the genius of Virginia Woolf's ideas and Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer-winning modern take to work from. With The Reader, Bernhard Schlink's semi-autobiographical novel has generated a film that is thought-provoking rather than yielding insight. Hanna's illiteracy is his metaphor for modern understanding of the Holocaust. We weren't there. We can't understand. ""What would you do?"" Hanna asks the judge, not rhetorically, but wanting an answer.<br/><br/>And what would you do, if you couldn't live with what you've done? Even if you felt you'd had no choice? And if even the healing fantasy world of fiction is finally denied you? The Reader is a story that puts nothing to bed."

","The setting is Berlin in 1995: Michael Berg, a coldly introverted lawyer who's never open with anyone, recalls his youth when as a teenager in 1950s West Germany (the aftermath of WWII still fresh in the minds of many) he crossed paths with an older woman who became his lover, but it's not until years later that he discovers she was a former SS guard at Auschwitz. As an adult, he has yet to fully come to terms with the affair and how it drastically affected the trajectory of his life. Sensual, atmospheric drama vividly captures the mood and essence of a specific time period, and packs an emotional wallop with the expectedly haunting revelations of the Holocaust, along with fully realized characters whose morally ambiguous actions shake them to their very core. Absorbing and thought-provoking, with (not surprisingly) fantastic work from Winslet, a riveting and complex performance from Fiennes, and a remarkable, praiseworthy showcase for Kross who comfortably holds his own as the young, naïve version of the same character. ***"

","The Reader is really 2 movies is one, essentially:<br/><br/>The first is about a boy who, despite being 15, starts a sexual relationship with a woman(played by Kate Winslet-aka Rose in Titanic) over twice his age. Their relationship consists of 3 things: sex, bathing, and reading. The affair lasts a summer, and they don't connect afterwards. This covers roughly 45% of the movie.<br/><br/>The latter section sees these 2 meet again after the woman is given a life sentence for aiding the Nazis in the Holocaust.<br/><br/>Knowing her true heart-that she wouldn't WANT someone killed, the boy(now a grown man played by Ralph Fiennes) finds the books he read to her as a boy and records them unto cassette tapes for her to listen to.<br/><br/>Of course, many details follow, but these summaries are a quick basis without being spoiler heavy-I hope this didn't give too much!<br/><br/>Like I said, this movie is entertaining from start to finish. If I had to pick one flaw, it would be that the dialogue was a bit quiet, but other than that, there's nothing I'd complain about!<br/><br/>While some scenes are more engaging then others, there is never a scene in The Reader that doesn't grab the attention of the viewer.<br/><br/>However, I should tell you: if nudity scenes offend you, this movie is NOT for you! Kate Winslet is nude often, and the 15 year old has his share as well.<br/><br/>Usually excessive nudity bothers me(see my review of The Wolf of Wall Street), but this movie uses it for showing the immorality of the situation, and not used just to be there.<br/><br/>If you want a romance movie that is very entertaining, The Reader is the book, er, movie...to pick up!<br/><br/>Note: I recommend this for ages 16-17 and up."

","5 February 2009. Easily one of the best movies of the year, ""The Reader"" brings new life and spirit to ""The Summer of 42"" (1971) and brings a heavy substantive heavy weight to ""A Love Story"" (1970). Kate Winslet is magnificent in a performance that defies reality and drama, portraying a complex character that radiates with both loathing and compassion. Except for two and maybe three irritating wrinkles, ""The Reader"" is on perfect display using effective flashbacks and editing to bring the life of two people interweaving back and forth in drama that plumbs of the depth of legal philosophy, first love and romantic love, of war and moral responsibility, of being proud, and taking risks, suffering consequences, redemption, and regret.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" in an early scene raises a bit of a confusion as to the tram compartments and taking of tickets when first we meet Michael Berg as a boy and Hanna Schmitz apparently doesn't interact with him even though she punches tickets. However, to more confounding points that are never clearly articulated consist of Mr. Berg's decision on whether to help Hanna or not at her trial and Hanna's own decision not to reveal her disability - such omissions provoke incredulity and require some assumptions and beliefs that may or may not be realistic, dragging movie, however, slowly and briefly.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this epic period piece that covers almost an entire lifetime, brings to light the idea of storytelling, oral tradition, suggesting ideas to the meaning of life. This movie both informs, entertains, provokes our thought, and touches our heart and soul in deep ways. A memorable movie. Nine out of Ten Stars."

","The Reader (2008) is a very interesting film, unlike any other I've seen. The story focuses on Michael Berg, played by Ralph Fiennes and David Kross (younger Michael). It's about him and Kate Winslet's character, Hanna. When Michael was 15, he meet Hanna and they began an affair, an affair that consisted of sex and reading. Michael would read to Hanna and then they would make love. They did this for a summer and then Hanna left. A few years later, Michael was in law school and was witnessing a trial, a trial that involved Hanna. We learn things about her past through this trial. One thing that I absolutely love about this film, is the acting. The acting is so unbelievably great, especially on Winslet's part, who I believe is one of the greatest actresses Hollywood has ever seen. She delivers such a deeply raw performance, we as the audience feel everything she feels, the same goes for Fiennes and Kross. I just want to give special recognition to Kross, because I absolutely adored him here! Even as a young actor, he gives a very skilled performance. I also liked the writing, it's very well done.

In these 124 minutes, we get to see the first love of young Michael, the difficulties a teenager goes through when dealing and understanding someone from the opposite sex, especially an older woman. We also get to see the enthusiasm, anxiety and passion that this first love makes him feel, like nothing else in the world mattered, only her.<br/><br/>I went through a roller coaster of emotions throughout the movie. I felt in love, devastated, afraid, pity. A lot of things (good, but mostly bad) happened between Michael and Hanna during the years, but, somehow, a little flame of love and caring remained untouchable, even if they did not show it to one another.

Through these tapes Hanna learns to read and writes to the extend that she can form a small sentence and send it to Michael. Those scenes are exceptionally executed with tenderness and LOVE. Even a three word sentence of Hanna written to Michael brings tears to our eyes.<br/><br/>Michael is shown torn between hating Nazi criminal and his romantic love interest - Hanna. <br/><br/>The last scene of Michael and Hanna meeting each other after almost 40 years face to face is extremely heart-breaking. <br/><br/>Without saying much Kate personifies her LOVE by screaming through her eyes, body language and hidden emotions that she wants to be with her LOVER Michael who is unwilling to help her beyond a point. This realization leads Hanna to commit suicide.<br/><br/>Hanna's character screams at us as audiences for empathy and sympathy and all credit to the master-class performance of Kate Winstel for it - incredibly portrays an Oscar winning role.<br/><br/>Apart from these two main characters - other roles are passe. The movie is adapted from the novel by the same name written by Bernhard Schlick who is himself a lawyer and author. <br/><br/>The Direction by Stephen Daldry is excellent.<br/><br/>A must watch<br/><br/>Overall my rating for the movie is 7.5 out of 10."

It is also a pleasure, as always, to watch Ralph Fiennes perform. <br/><br/>The characters are all unlikeable, none of them really having any likability to them, they do not have definable traits. Michael Berg is the main character that guides this story, but there is not a single thing about this two dimensional being. He is established at the beginning as a man who had an affair, and there is not much scope put in to him beyond that, making it almost impossible to evoke any sort of compassion for his character, and even Hanna never truly grabbed me. <br/><br/>The film also paints the Holocaust in a very strange light. While it is not idolising it in any way, it does not create an image of how horrendous these events were either. The director seemed to try his best to shed some light on these events, which just makes it unsettling, as we all know there is no positive outcome. <br/><br/>Well acted, but nothing more.

","Post-WWII Germany: Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, law student Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) re-encounters his former lover (Kate Winslet) as she defends herself in a war-crime trial.<br/><br/>The film raises the question of whether we should judge someone by the law or rather ""the laws of the time"". And there is a big difference. Of course we know that killing is morally wrong, and those who sent people to death in World War II were morally in the wrong, even if they were only following orders.<br/><br/>But were they legally wrong? One could argue not. That is a difficult topic. Like the women of this film, those at the Nuremberg Trial were tried and convicted under laws invented after the war. Laws written by the winners. This makes one wonder: is it right to put someone on trial for something morally wrong, even if it was not legally wrong? And who should decide the laws? Had the Axis won, they could have just as easily declared it illegal to drop atomic bombs on innocent villages and then try, convict and execute Harry Truman.<br/><br/>Right and wrong is no easy topic."
"VickiHopkins","8","1","1","14 May 2014"," An Affair of Generational Differences
","First off, I will admit I did not read any reviews or synopsis of the movie beforehand. I hit play in total ignorance when I recently streamed it online. Yes, it's a bit shocking that a woman, who was probably in her early 30's, had an affair with a 15-year old boy. However, had I turned it off, like so many disgruntled reviewers, claiming it was nothing more than a sickly and vile movie about pedophilia, I would have missed an intriguing story that turned out to be quite a surprise.<br/><br/>I will give a few insights as to the story, without spoiling the ending. It starts out with Ralph Fiennes, who plays the adult version of Michael Berg reminiscing about the past. Set in 1958 post-WWII Germany, it tells the story of a teenager who is helped by Hanna Schmidt, a young woman, when he becomes ill with Scarlet Fever. After his recovery, he returns to thank her, but to his surprise she seduces him and an affair ensues.<br/><br/>Hanna is a woman that at first you really know nothing about, other than she enjoys two things with Michael - sex and the fact that he reads books to her during his visits. Strange as it seems,they fall in love until one day she mysteriously disappears without a word and breaks his heart.<br/><br/>Fast forward to Michael's days at university as he studies to be a lawyer. His professor takes the class to sit in on the the war crime trials. To his surprise, Hanna is a defendant, along with a group of other women, for her participation as a guard at a Nazi concentration camp. Day after day he attends the hearings, listening to the crimes she committed during the war and then realizes something about Hanna that no one else knows. The fact could lessen her sentence, but Michael cannot reconcile the horrors of her actions in helping to kill the Jews. What he knows, he keeps silent, and her sentence is life in prison compared to a paltry four years for the other women involved in the same crimes.<br/><br/>The movie is one of conscience as the younger generation deals with the guilt of the older generation and the crimes committed to humanity in WWII. Michael takes a sobering visit to Auschwitz to see for himself where she worked as a guard. Hurt and brooding for the woman he once loved, he makes the choice not to help her avoid her punishment regardless of the secret she has held from everyone, which Hanna refuses to admit to even at her trial. Her shame regarding that one fact is greater than the shame of being a guard during the war and her participation as a murderer.<br/><br/>In the end, the story reverts to Michael as an adult and the guilt and feelings he has wrestled with throughout his life regarding Hanna. The movie is an interesting and thought-provoking story that reaches far more than the risqué first half of an older woman having sex with an under-aged boy. David Kross looks very young in the part, but the sexually explicit scenes were not filmed until he turned 18 years of age.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a sobering movie regarding love, morality, secrets, and consequences of one's actions, this is a good flick. It touches the lives of those who participated and those families who were victims. Kate's achievement in winning an Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA, and many other awards for her portrayal of Hanna are well deserved.<br/><br/>Interesting post note on this subject, I did a Google search wondering how long the war crime trials lasted due to the timing in this story. To my surprise, I stumbled across an article in the Independent from September 2013 regarding Germany's continued prosecution. Even now they are pursuing former guards at concentration camps, stating that arrest warrants would be issued for, ""40 men and six women suspected of having worked as guards at Auschwitz."" Some of these men and women are now in their 90's, but the trials continue."

","Okay, I'll admit it; Kate Winslet is my favorite actress of this generation. So, I might be a bit biased towards her, but I try not to be. Yes, she is incredibly beautiful, but she is also incredibly talented. She becomes the characters she portrays. I believed her as hopelessly romantic Marianne in ""Sense and Sensibility"", as insane Ophelia in ""Hamlet"", as quirky Clementine in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Now I believe her as cold yet passionate Hanna Schmitz, an older woman that has an affair with a much younger man while hiding dark secrets from him. Watching the film I believe Winslet is German, and I also believe she is capable of the crimes she is accused of in the film. She is sharp and cold in her encounters with other people, yet we still can sense warmth hidden inside. Winslet is absolutely brilliant in her portrayal and she finally won an Oscar for it. (She was nominated 5 times before her win, further proof of her abilities.) But I don't want to take away anything from the other actors. Ralph Fiennes is great as the older Michael, but it's David Kross that hold his own against Winslet. His portrayal of both the innocent and maturing Michael is truly great. <br/><br/>I've read some reviews that complain that this is just another Oscar baiting Holocaust movie. I'll agree that it does lack some of the emotional punch that other films had that year, perhaps this was something that was lost in the translation from the original book. But to discount this as just another Holocaust movie is not fair; it is a movie that poses complex questions about ourselves and about our secrets. We all have them and often we go out of our way to keep them. Do we hide them so that we can belong? Or do we hide them out of pure shame? In the film one character keeps a secret that hurts another, the other character keeps a secret that hurts them self. Why? And why did I care so much for someone that was so cruel? These are some interesting questions and the film left me wondering about human nature and why we do the things we do and feel the way we feel. I can always appreciate a film that makes me ponder such things."

"stephparsons","7","1","1","24 May 2013"," Powerful, moving, 'coming of age' movie
","A powerful and, dare I say, moving story of a boy's coming of age and first sexual and romantic involvement with an older woman. Set in Germany, the film moves between 1950s and the 1990s. A young man, Michael Berg (played by David Cross) reads voraciously to the woman of his obsession, Hanna Schmitz, (played by Kate Winslet), in between lots of sex, and awakens in her a love of the written word; she however is illiterate. After her abrupt and unexplained departure, Michael is forced to get on with his life. Some years later, as a law student (now played by Ralph Fiennes), he sits in on a trial of Nazi guards, one of whom is Hanna Schmitdz, the woman he met at 15. She is one of a group of 6 ex Auschwitz guards trying to defend themselves against heinous war crimes. Michael is shocked and disgusted to see his former lover in such a setting and, even though he holds the knowledge that could absolve her, remains mute throughout the proceedings. Consequently, Hannah is sentenced to 20 years in prison. At some point during her incarceration, Michael begins to send her tapes of stories he used to read her. This brings some light into her life and eventually she teaches herself to read. At the end of her sentence, Michael is the only 'friend' Hannah has and is summoned to help her when she is released. He is prepared to sort out the practicalities she will need for life on the outside but his resentment prevents any further kindness or involvement. The story does not have a happy ending but Michael tells Hannah's story to his daughter which serves as a cathartic process for both of them. The movie was well done and I liked the fact that is wasn't obvious in its themes."

","Last week I saw Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.. Steven Daldry has this quality of telling the story from quite a number of angles.. But the story loses its pace somewhere in between.. The reader is a movie that tells the story of Hanna Schmitz(Kate Winslet) and Michael Berg over a long period.. The movie starts off showing Michael preparing breakfast and it goes backwards where Michael met Hanna for the first time.. Hanna took him home where he was detected with fever.. He came back to Hanna when he recovered where the affair begins and the affair goes on and on and on... In between the affair Hanna expresses her likings to read books but she likes being read to rather that reading herself.. Michael reads her ""The Odyssey,"" ""Huck Finn"" and ""The Lady with the Little Dog."" Despite the bond they shared Hanna disappears from Michael's life one day.. The story moves to the point when Michael is seen in law classes. The professor takes Michael to live court sessions where he sees Hanna is being trial-ed for murdering 300 lives during Nazi war crimes.. There Michael discovers the reason of Hanna not reading books herself.. Because she is illiterate.. He sees Hanna admits all the murders in order to keep the secret that she does not know how to write.. Hanna is imprisoned for life and Michael becomes a lawyer with a unsuccessful marriage and a daughter.. While in prison Michael sends Hanna recorded tapes of all the novels that helps Hanna to past time.. She used the tapes to learn reading and writing that helped her to write letters to Michael.. However Michael does not reply to her.. At the time when Hanna was to be released from prison Michael was her only contact.. Then we see the first confront of Michael and Hanna after the date Hanna disappears.. Michael told Hanna that he has got an apartment for her and a job that upsets Hanna because she expected that Michael would keep her with him... She did not see the Michael that she wanted to see which killed all her intentions to live and that made her commit suicide leaving a will for Michael.. She instructed Michael to give her money to the girl that survived the Nazi fire.. Michael does as she says.. The last scene shows Michael taking her daughter to the grave of Hanna and telling her the story of theirs... <br/><br/>A movie showing Nazi war crimes, illiteracy, a secret and intense love making needs a better treatment.. the relationship between Michael and Hanna never increased emotionally.. The story jumped from subject to subject.. the only thing that held the movie together was the performance of Kate Winslet and young Michael(David Kross).. Kate was good throughout the movie..

","The Reader is a film based on the 1995 German novel of the same name by Bernhard Schlink.It stars Kate Winslet,at her finest role to date, together with Ralph Fiennes and Michael Kross.It was written by David Hare and directed by Stephen Daldry.The movie serves as the last film for producers Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack, who both died before it was released.<br/><br/>The story is a haunting period drama concerning the relationship between a 15-year-old German boy and a mysterious woman twice his age, and the way that it grows doubly complex when the man re-encounters the woman years later and discovers a shocking truth about her past. <br/><br/>The film opens on the character of Michael Berg in middle age -- cold, remote, and emotionally withdrawn.Then it moves back in time to 1950s Berlin, where ailing teenager Michael has fallen ill with fever, and is discovered in the street by Hanna, a woman in her thirties. After Michael recovers, the two immediately lapse into a torrid affair and Michael falls prey to the confusion of his own burgeoning sexuality. Their liaisons are often marked by Hanna's request that Michael read to her. Later, when Michael returns to Hanna's flat and finds it deserted, her absence becomes an emotional blow for which he is completely unprepared, and indeed, scarred for life. <br/><br/>The film then moves forward in time by eight years. Michael,who is now a law student,walks into a courtroom and comes across Hanna,one of a series of Nazi prison guards being tried for murderous war crimes during World War II. As he watches her on the witness stand, memories of their past experiences together bring him to the point of realization concerning a startling, long-buried truth about Hanna and Michael knows that if he divulges this information, it could modify the prison sentence handed out and dramatically alter her fate. <br/><br/>The performances of the actors were highly commendable.Kate Winslet's portrayal of the illiterate and complex Hanna was just beyond description.It was definitely the finest performance of her career.Winning the Oscar Best Actress award was definitely well- deserved.The other actors/actresses were also great as well.<br/><br/>As for the story,it was a holocaust movie with a deep,twisting dive into a dense tangle of thorny moral,ethical,situational and emotional issues.Aside from that,it also touches on underage desire that converges with perverse passions. Overall,it is one excellent and outstanding movie."

Hanna being of a first generation apart from the holocaust events and Michael a young man growing up in the next generation coming to grips with his forbearer's legacy of shame.<br/><br/>The story is tightly focused on the lives of Michael (David Kross/Ralph Fiennes) and Hanna (Kate Winslet) as they first come together out of a chance meeting then quickly become impassioned lovers. During this hidden relationship Hanna is reborn into an innocent youthfulness while Michael is becoming a man. As the story progresses we find the bitter details of Hanna's past coming to surface at the same time Michael is educated about the worlds history and heritage that is a part of his past as well being a descendant of the same shame of the previous generation.<br/><br/>The novel by Bernhard Schlink is closely followed by the screen play by David Hare. Together the acting of Kross/Fiennes and Winslet set with direction of Stephen Daldry give an exceptional movie. The use of no voice overs and excellent editing further engages the viewer into the emotional tides of Michael and Hanna. Lighting and score also play as powerful characters themselves supporting the moods of the actors. The Reader is set between several time lines that are artfully traveled through by the editing techniques of Claire Simpson (awarded for Platoon and 9).<br/><br/>At times you will equally love, hate and pity Michael and Hanna.

Similar in structure to SOPHIE'S CHOICE another WW2 aftermath moral dilemma with time shifts and character revelations, THE READER is a completely absorbing and thrilling drama with superb casting and excellent production values. Made on a modest budget and with new comer David Kross' pivotal performance as the teen in love with older woman with a vile past (Kate Winslet) THE READER establishes itself strongly with a heady mix of sex and secrets. The scenes at the lake with his teen friends realising he is up to something are also evocative. A similar but more ghastly film was the 1971 film THE NIGHT PORTER with a role reversal and disgusting fetish. If you see it you can see the identity swap and the cruelty of attraction. THE READER has a sunny lead teen and a cold femme balance. The moral dilemma is not to be revealed but witnessed as you see the film for the first time."
"ifasmilecanhelp","9","1","1","24 March 2011"," Incroyable beautiful and sad movie, raising a lot of questions
","Incroyable beautiful and sad movie, raising a lot of question about guilt, justice, cowardice and self honesty. As I'd never seen before a movie in which Kate Winslett was acting, I didn't know that she is... absolutely breathtaking ! Fantastic actress, in a part that must not have been easy to play. As true compliments can I write about David Kross, the young lover of Hanna. And Ralph Fiennes, still having a smaller part is not left behind. The whole movie is incredible, and for whom would know me, all the stories about what happened in Germany during last WW2, usually bother me a lot and don't interest me. Of course I don't deny anything of the horrible things, but on my tastes, there are just too many films dealing about the Holocauste... So I'm fed up with them. And as soon as I read a synopsis telling about this topic, I usually just pass straight by. But his one is eventually a superb exception. As I am a ""reading lover"", the tittle retained my attention, so I came upon to read a little more about the movie. After having seen a trailer, it convinced me to have a deeper look on i, and many comments here on the site gave an indication of how good should be the movie. So my comment is to say : no regret at all ! The movie is so sad, that I'm not sure to see it again, but nevertheless I could strongly recommend it to anyone who likes drama. The atmosphere in so right, no false note. About the story, for sure I just cried as I understood that the male protagonist Young Michael Berg was not going to say what he knew, what would have pleaded for her defense and final sentence. True what did Hanna was out of mind... a shame ! But not to say the truth from former Hanna's lover was almost more horrible, because he did it consciously. I hated him, I mean his cowardice... just let's say the director followed just the most dramatic possible scenario. And yes, for the intensity of the drama, it's the right choice. I really disliked this part, but it is so well filmed and acted, that now I can smile and laugh of it... I'm still in the movie :-)<br/><br/>On my opinion, Hanna was part of this large majority of the German who did unbelievable and insane things, but once they really realized what they did and were part of, were deeply ashame, even though as she said, the were dead forever. That's the only reason why she run away, disappearing unexpectedly. She couldn't stand to love someone, with the deep pain she had inside.<br/><br/>And one of the movie strong point is when a law student youngster raised the question about the fact everyone in Germany knew what happened, and only a few were sentenced to jail. Of course, it is quiet difficult to put, let's say between 60 to 80% of a large country's population...<br/><br/>So this is a sad movie, about a strong topic...<br/><br/>Highly recommended !<br/><br/>*** a film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet Orson Welles ***"

","The Plot: A teenage boy finds himself in a (sexual) relation with an older woman. Part of their relation is based on the boy reading to the older woman. However one day the woman disappears, leaving the teenage boy heartbroken.<br/><br/>Several years later he finds her again as he witnesses (as a spectator) her trial where she is charged for war crimes.<br/><br/>As society passes moral judgement over the woman, so does he. Whether he is right or wrong in doing so is left to the viewer to decide, the movie merely shows us what happens given the choices the characters made.<br/><br/>The acting: Although I don't think anyone could've acted any better than Kate Winslet in this movie, speaking English with a German accent to portray Germans is very disappointing. However, the characters don't speak out every emotion they are experiencing (unlike most US of A movies) which challenges the viewer to think for themselves, is it love, fear, sense of duty, hate, misunderstanding, shame (and i could go on) that motivates the characters actions? Very difficult to pull off, but all actors pull this off magnificently. They force you to look at the complexities of a human being and (rightfully so) deny you the easy way out by simply putting people in 'good' or ' bad' categories and be done with it. (Note: see those reviews that think bad of this movie? Written by people who love doing this and find themselves confronted with their own shallow mind, better to disregard the movie then!)<br/><br/>To sum it up, a very nice thought provoking movie about morals and love.

","Somewhere in the dark, amid the wet streets of Berlin, this story arose. It was originally written by Bernhard Schlink, screen played by David Hare and later directed in a motion picture by Stephen Daldry. The story is of a young teenage boy named Michael Berg (David Kross) who is smitten by Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) an older neighbor and seduced into an assignation. Though their affair is the basis for their initial contact, Michael comes to enjoy the pleasant company of the older woman who introduces him to youthful physical pleasure, but also to the mysterious side of a woman with a secret. It is this secret which the adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes) must contend with. His older life revolves around their early companionship, one which ties them inexorably to the future. The forward and backward motion of the story is difficult to come to grips with, but eventually the audience snares the essence of message. Mr. Fiennes is superb as Michael and comes to realize there is so much hatred between the races, it could easily keep theme apart for eternity. The movie is incredible, the cast which includes Bruno Ganz as Professor Rohl, is superior and the result is a basis for a Classic and after viewing the film, would not be surprised. ****"

","Ask any number of people to describe an event, and they will all do so slightly differently. This is because each of our experiences and our own personal psychologies influences how we perceive the world. This being the case, then how can justice be truly blind?<br/><br/>Michael Berg (David Kross) becomes ill one day, but is helped by a passing woman. Later on, he tracks down the woman, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) and they engage in a passionate affair. After falling in love, Hanna suddenly disappears, leaving Michael stunned and heartbroken. They encounter each other again years later, when Hanna is on trial for murders during the Holocaust (Michael is a law student observing the trial).<br/><br/>The film touches on many themes, including command responsibility, the theory versus the actuality of justice, what constitutes morality and others. These are challenging topics, all the more potent when they involve the something as dark and horrible as the Holocaust. It is a credit to the filmmakers that not only are all of these themes and ideas presented intelligently and in ways that stir our minds, but they never make the film exploitative.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet is easily one of the most exciting and versatile actresses alive today. She finally won a long overdue Oscar for her performance as Hanna, and she is wonderful. Aloof but naiive, Hanna is a fascinating individual and is brilliantly realized by Winslet (I have one minor quibble...when she is shown in old age, Winslet doesn't adjust her voice, but that's hardly worth mentioning). As Michael, David Kross matches her beat for beat. He's also stand-offish, but he's fallen helplessly in love with Hanna, which changes his life forever, and leads to an extraordinarily complex moral quagmire. Ralph Fiennes has a small role as the Older Michael, but we can see the similarities of a man whose picking up the pieces of a traumatic life.<br/><br/>The film is superbly constructed by Stephen Daldry The film hits the correct note every time, however the film's ending is a little too oblique. Nevertheless, this is a rewarding and extremely involving film."

","In the era of the Beatles a young law student, David Kross, has an intense affair with an older woman, Kate Winslet. She loves it when he reads to her -- ""Ulysses,"" ""Huckleberry Finn,"" Chekhov. The fling lasts only one summer, then Winslet disappears. One of Kross's seminars takes a field trip to a court in which half a dozen women are being tried for crimes committed during the war, twenty-five years earlier. Kross is flabbergasted to find that Winslet is not only a defendant but appears to have been the leader of the female guards, and the one who made the decision to allow concentration camp inmates to die in a flaming church rather than free them and allow ""chaos"" on the streets.<br/><br/>Winslet winds up sentenced to life in prison. After ten years or so, Kross -- now morphed into an adult who looks exactly like Ralph Feinnes -- begins sending her taped copies of books, which she devours.<br/><br/>After twenty years she is due for release but has no family or other contacts except Feinnes. He's never visited her or written to her but he's the only person who is in a position to help her after so many years of imprisonment.<br/><br/>A couple of things stand out. One is Kate Winslet's performance. It's a difficult role. She must age twenty years on screen, and she must somehow combine pathos with a grim determination -- and she does it. She was only in her early thirties when this was shot but she matures convincingly, aided by discrete make up that gives her gray hair and rubescent eyelids.<br/><br/>During her affair with the virginal Kross, who looks hardly old enough to be in high school, let alone university, she's constantly taking baths and showers, which was fine with me. She even takes to having Kross stand naked in the tub while she roughly scrubs him down, haunted, we suppose, by guilt. (Cf., Lady MacBeth.) Mostly she dominates him, ordering him around, postponing their love making until after he reads to her. Why does she want him to read books aloud? Because she's illiterate. The viewer doesn't get to know this until she is in prison. We see her painfully printing simple notes to Feinnes about what kind of books to read on tape (""more romance""), crossing out mispellings -- the assiduous scrawl of a kindergarten child.<br/><br/>The word ""redemption"" is, I think, way overused. It has a religious ring to it that doesn't always apply, and certainly not here. Time to substitute Freud's ""undoing"", a no-nonsense, strictly non-metaphysical act of ""making up"" for the harm you've done. In this case, it devolves into the delivery of a cheap tin can that once held tea and now holds a pitifully small amount of carefully saved money, a carefully nurtured nest egg of no consequence at all."

","I'm not a fan of holocaust films and I suspected this was one. But in fact this is more en exploration of the reality of having to make your way through a war. And though the young male lead (David Kross)is especially flawless, Kate Winslet is even more luminous and unforgettable. For me, Ms. Winslet epitomizes what an actress should be far more boldly than, say, Meryl Streep. She seems to crave exploring other persona to the point she can authentically speak for them. What's more, there's something oddly disarming about the way she so easily goes nude in many of her movies. She might as well be chiding the rest of us for our utter lack of courage.<br/><br/>I would fault this film with being a little long on its intimate scenes for my taste though I'm not sure it would work otherwise. But this film for me is head and shoulders above others I've seen covering the same subject matter. It makes you think more clearly about what it must have meant to be a Nazi, working for the camps, and though I can imagine there will be people who think this is some kind of apologia for those who worked in the death camps, I would argue this merely highlights their own lack of compassion.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes role is a difficult one and I'm not sure he fully conquers it, but he certainly isn't very far from making it real. Try to imagine what could have been done to make his performance better. I can't think of a single thing."

Still, even if she was a monster, we cannot totally condemn her. Kate Winslet is incredible from the sexually driven streetcar conductor to the perpetrator of an event that killed hundreds of Jews. The amazing thing is that she can't get her mind around what she has done. She saw it as a way to find work since everyone was at war and she needed the employment. She is painfully honest which is hard to fathom for the courts. Roy Fiennes has a connection to her because of their affair, but he is still repulsed by the events. Because of his basic human kindness he continues to read to her as he did by recording books on audio tapes (he comes to realize that she can't read or write). There are not simple answers and no last minute discovery; it's about people trying to connect. This is a fine film."
"tburke85","7","1","1","12 June 2009"," The Reader A Decent Drama With Good Performances
","The Reader is a decent drama with good performances especially from Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, and newcomer David Kross. Director Stephen Daldry is admirable in making this movie about a brief affair between an older woman and a much younger man who years later now a law student re-encounters his former love as she defends herself in a war-crime trial. Kate Winslet turns in a great performance as Hannah and she more than deserved the Oscar she received for this one. Winslet continues to show audiences why she's one of Hollywoods most talented and bravest actresses today especially in the films steamy sex scenes. Ralph Fieness is equally impressive as the older Michael now a law student who still has feelings for his first love Hannah. Fiennes proves to be effective in the role as he does with most of the characters he's played in other films. Newcomer David Kross turns in a good performance as well. He shows some real talent and bravery especially in the nudity/love scenes his character has with Winslet. The rest of the cast are also solid in their limited screen time. The pacing of the movie was a little slow at times and some actors (like Winslet and Fiennes) weren't in it as much as I thought they would be but all of them are great in it none the less. Overall The Reader is a decent drama about love, consequences, secrets, and revelations with powerful performances by the cast (especially Winslet and Fiennes) who make it worth watching."

The other actors were fine also (including Ralph Fiennes, excuse the bad pun ;-). I wish it had been more touching for me but it's already great that the character played by Kate Winslet was multidimensional and not unlikeable despite her sins.

"sol1218","8","1","1","10 February 2009"," The lady with the little dog
","(There are Spoilers) 15 year-old Michael Berg, David Cross, is suddenly taken ill on the streets of Neustadt Germany and nurses back to help by a total stranger who seems to have no one but herself to look after. The time is spring 1958 and the stranger in question is 36 year old trolley ticket stamper Hanna Schmitz, Kate Winslet.<br/><br/>It's later when Michael was fully recovered, from Scarlett Fever, that he came back to thank Hanna for all she did for him that he started to fall in love with her. So much so that the two had a hot and sizzling love affair throughout the entire summer of 1958 until Hanna, by leaving town, broke it off. It's now eight years later, 1965, and Michael now in law collage is sent together with his fellow law students by his teacher Prof. Rohl, Bruno Ganz, to see how the law is administrated in the new German Republic. The trial that Michael is to attend and study has to do with a number of former SS women guards at the notorious Aushwitz concentration camp.To Michael's shock and utter surprise the major defendant at the trail is non other then his former lover, and the women who saved his life, Hanna Schmitz! All this is recounted in 1995 by a grown up, and now a lawyer in Berlin, Michael Berg, played by a middle age Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>Michael has been haunted all his adult life in not being able to come to Hanna's aid like she did for him when she needed him most, at her trial, with vital information that would have well speared her a lifetime behind bars in a German prison. Not that Hanna was totally innocent of the charges against her in having sent a number of unfit for work women inmates to their ultimate deaths at the Auschwitz concentration camp. But it was the major charge against Hanna that she took full responsibility for, and given the harshest sentence by the court, that she in fact had nothing at all to do with. Hanna's personally writing out and signing the order that caused the deaths of hundreds of Jewish women held captive in an abandoned church.<br/><br/>Hanna as we, as well as Michael who would read books for her, all could see very early in the movie was a functional illiterate. There was no way Hanna could write out a long two or three page order that in effect sent some 300 women prisoners to their death in a locked up church, that was later fire bombed by allied aircraft, since she couldn't even write her own name! The most shocking thing of all is that Hanna felt no remorse in the crimes that she committed during the war, she was only doing her job, but felt greatly embarrassed to the point of getting life, instead of four years, behind bars in her keeping the public from knowing that she couldn't either read or write!<br/><br/>It took years for Michael to get up enough courage to finally go and see Hanna in prison which by then, with Michael's corresponding with her through the mail, she did teach herself to read and write. But by that time Hanna also realized what a monster she was during the war and even with her about to be paroled from prison, after some 20 years behind bars, she came to realize that there was no life left for her outside or behind prison bars.<br/><br/>Academy Award caliber performances by both Ralph Fiennes and 18 year old David Kross as Michael Berg as well as the multi-talented Kate Winslet as the confused, in what she did in the war, and tragic, in what she ultimately did to herself,Hanna Schmitz. There's also worth mentioning in the movie actress Lena Olin playing both Rose and her daughter, some twenty years later, Ilana Mather. It was to Ilana, who's mother was the only survivor of the bombed out church, that Hanna through Michael, as her personal lawyer, left all her earthly belongings. Even though Ilana couldn't keep the money that Hanna left for her, she told Michael to donate it to a hospital burn unit, she did in fact take the colorful tea tin that it was kept in. It reminded Ilana of better times when as a young girl she kept her valuables in a similarly tea tin before the outset of WWII."
"Monotreme02","7","1","1","24 January 2009"," Subtle and restrained, holding a little too much back; amazing performance from Winslet
","There's no doubt about it  where American drama film-making is often very in your face, obvious and insistent, British film-making is far closer to the European faction in its elegant, delicate subtlety. The Reader is one such example of this impeccable English film-making, and benefits from the best England has to offer: Director Stephen Daldry, who was a long-time theatre director before moving to motion pictures recently, and who has previously directed two excellent films  the under-appreciated underdog story Billy Elliot, and the even more underrated cinematic masterpiece that is The Hours; screenwriter Sir David Hare, also a long-time theatre professional, in this case a playwright; Roger Deakins, who is one of if not the best cinematographer working today; and at least two of the best acting talents Britain has to offer, Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes. Literally nothing in the film is blunt: ideas and themes in David Hare's screenplay are very subdued and under-the-radar, the acting is not bombastic and melodramatic but rather restrained and calculated, the cinematography serves its purpose but for the most part doesn't particularly stand out (Deakins, who won an Oscar nomination for his work on the film, should have been nominated for either of the other two films he shot this year, Revolutionary Road or Doubt), and in all, I actually felt that it was this subtlety and restraint that really held the source material back from true greatness.<br/><br/>That said, the film does contain many elements that come together marvelously, starting out from the screenplay. Like another excellent script from 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Reader's almost extreme and radical subtlety dictates that none of its rich, resonant, powerful themes burst out of its seams, but rather remain bubbling right under the surface. Many critical viewers unfortunately interpret this gentle, restrained subtlety and nuance as ""lack of content"" and ""emotional coldness"", but I actually felt that this was one of the film's greatest assets. From a distance, it may seem to the simple-minded that the film is about the Holocaust and the horrors that occurred in it, but that couldn't be further from the point. As evident in a very short and easy-to-miss scene near the beginning of the film, the true underlying message of the movie is about the dark nature of secrets, and the fact that sometimes, in order to keep secret something that we are ashamed of, we end up doing far more atrocious things than those that we are trying to hide. This message can easily be applicable to the Holocaust, in that because of the German people's shame that they let an atrocity of this magnitude happen on their watch, they didn't do anything to stop it in time. Then again, the message could also be applied on a personal, human level as well, and it is this universality that lends it even more weight and relevance.<br/><br/>In addition to the inherently rich screenplay, the film is also carried and elevated by its performances. At the center, and also rightfully attracting the most attention, is Kate Winslet's simply riveting, intricate and quietly heartbreaking performance. It's one of the finest acting moments of her undeniably illustrious career  Winslet is my favourite actress of all time and I don't think she has ever delivered a bad or even a mediocre performance; that said, this is definitely one of her shining moments, and aside from sporting an excellent German accent, Winslet demonstrates an incredible ability to embody her character, who is so caught up in her own shame, both for things she had no say in but also for atrocities that she participated in by choice that she has become a closed shell, hiding all of her feelings behind a pale sheet of glass, although she lets just enough of them seep through her eyes to give us a hint of what's bottled up inside. It is easily one of the best performances of the year. Also worth mentioning are the two actors portraying the young and old versions of the protagonist Michael Berg, David Kross (young) and Ralph Fiennes (old), both of who deliver stellar performances for entirely different reasons. Kross is wonderful in showing the transition from the youthful, lively, passionate Kross to the jaded, introverted and emotionally distant Kross, emotionally damaged by his unrequited love for Winslet's character, Hannah Schmitz, who one day just disappeared after their whirlwind affair one Summer. And Ralph Fiennes is remarkable in his portrayal of the older version of Berg, by now completely world-weary, isolated from everyone around him and emotionally cold and dysfunctional. It is another one of Fiennes' immaculately subtle performances that, although thoroughly excellent goes completely unnoticed by awards circles.<br/><br/>The Reader is a good film, but not a great one. It's subtlety and restraint both in its screenplay and in its performances is terrific, but ultimately I felt that the film may have held too much back, keeping us not quite riveted by the plot or characters, as intricate as they are, but rather more objectively but distantly interested. Although a definite beneficiary from excellent performances, in particular Kate Winslet's enthralling, haunting portrayal, The Reader is also somewhat lacking in its more technical aspects, and while a good, entertaining and interesting film, I can think of at least five other films from 2008 more worthy of the coveted Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards than The Reader."

","THE READER (2008) ***1/2 Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, David Kross, Lena Olin. Absorbing and rich characterizations of Bernhard Schlink's book adapted with finesse and subtlety by David Hare about a German teenager (newcomer Kross, making an excellent break-through performance) who has an affair with an older woman (Winslet in an Oscar worthy turn). Years later as a law student he comes across her path and discovers she has ties to the Nazi party during WWII, leading to her trial that his class is assigned to observe. While the heavy dramatic themes and the tricky balancing of humanizing someone affiliated with the Holocaust is a rather caustic situation, filmmaker Stephen Daldry steadily steers the film past pretension and strum and drang and instead elicits a truly heartbreaking love story with some ingenious plot devices. Fiennes is especially low-key yet efficiently clear-eyed in his endeavor as the latter- day protagonist and his scene with concentration camp survivor Olin is one for the film vault and for those who want to study what superb acting is all about."
"doctorsmoothlove","8","1","1","22 January 2009"," The Avenger's Tragedy
","Stephen Daldry took an enormous risk in his film adaptation of The Reader, but he did an admirable job given the difficulty of the source material. The film attempts and succeeds in portraying the human side of Nazism which has been lost in modern cinema. Films like Raiders of the Lost Arc are undermined by their implicit demonization of all Nazis, in spite of the historical lunacy of such a position. Sure, it's expected to depict Nazis negatively but not absolutely. The Reader is a response to years of unfair and incomplete characterizations. <br/><br/>It's a tragic, biting romance set in various points of 20th century Germany. The boy is adolescent Michael Berg and the girl (or rather woman) is thirty-something Hanna Schmitz. They've an affair that is as intellectual as it is passionate. Hanna loves listening to Michael read famous pieces of literature to her after they fornicate. He reads many stories to her until she vanishes one day. He doesn't see her again until he attends a trail as a legal student. Hanna left for a new job with the SS. She is charged with authorizing a document which permitted hundreds of Jewish women to die in a fire. Michael remembers her as his first love and never recovers from her sentencing. During her imprisonment, he sends her self-recorded audiobooks which help her to become literate. Hanna kills herself in prison, at the end of her term, like many of Kate Winslet's characters. Michael uses a pittance of her remaining wealth to donate to one of the children whose mother Hanna inactively killed during her time with the SS. <br/><br/>The Reader suffers from an uneven pace. The film begins somberly and becomes uplifting until Michael attends Hanna's trial. Then it regresses to its original tone, but with the added emotional impact of Hanna's condemnation and eventual death. Inconsistency is the result of narrative itself and not lazy direction. I don't think the story would be as effective if one style was preferred over the other. It would inhibit Hanna's depiction as a living yet aloof person. She would have to conform to our expectations or act converse to them. Winslet is talented enough or the book is skillful enough to use Hanna's personality as the only source of continuity throughout the experience. She is a tragic character even when she doesn't have to be. Not in that literature class type of way, but in her relationships with those around her. She ruins Michael's life and many others' but doesn't care. She isn't even aware of her brown thumb. Hanna really ""does her job,"" as she confesses in court and acknowledges her past openly. <br/><br/>What I admire most about the movie is how unsettling it becomes, but the technique is polarizing. When Hanna and Michael are lovers, they are almost always shown nude. The scenes of stimulated sex are so numerous that they become boring. One or two would have been acceptable, but Daldry shows several. They are affectionate in public and purposefully annoy a waitress who thinks Hanna is Michael's mother. Once Hanna is sentenced, Michael doesn't visit his family and divorces his wife. You keep hoping he will find some inner peace but he doesn't. Hanna is inadvertently in control of everything that that happens to him. Her life is unfortunate but his is even more so since he hosts the pain she doesn't express or is incapable of acknowledging.<br/><br/>When I was in high school I was part of the ""emo-gang,"" a group of students known for their bizarre habits and perverse conversations. We discussed several unfathomable topics that I cannot mention in this public review, but they were the only people I knew who shared my desire for legitimate intellectual discourse on any topic. Nothing was sacred or free of commentary. Many things we discussed I have never spoken to anyone else. I have made suitable friends in college, though they've left the emo craze. One of them has a strong interest in military uniforms, including those worn by the SS. I cannot say that she likes military outfits, specifically German ones, without a quizzical look. The Reader reminds me of why I can't. Filmgoers don't want characters to be unique. It's much easier to slap ""Nazi"" on someone than actually determine if she is evil.<br/><br/>**** out of *****"
"samkan","8","1","1","21 January 2009"," Should Have Tweaked the Novel
","Wow, what a performance by Kate Winslet. Kudos to the author of the underlying novel for such an original and interesting plot and devices. But I couldn't help wishing to fill in what I felt were missing or weak plot lines. The story centers on; i.e., is essentially about Hanna and her struggle with her disability, Might have been useful to flash back to the war tragedy to depict Hanna's handicap as impacting on her circumstances; e.g. certainly, because of her illiteracy, her occupations called for rote tasks and blind routine (Query: Didn't she leave her ticket punching job because she knew she couldn't handle the promotion?). To see what happened when the prisoners died shouldn't exonerate Hanna but could strongly support her life long agony with her disability. Also, her suicide appeared vague in purpose, although I believe I understand it as her reluctance to face the challenge of the world with her -though now less severe- reading problem.<br/><br/>Why so much nudity? Certainly was only a limited factor in the story. Could've made it a PG-13 and I'd have taken my 11 year old son.<br/><br/>I complain too much. This was a fine movie."

I won't explain the plot, as it's been described elsewhere, but I must say that it kept me engrossed.<br/><br/>I think, however, that the silly habit of having ""foreigners"" speak in English with the accent of their countries should be eliminated: these are Germans supposedly speaking in German with each other. OK, we hear them in English, but that's for the benefit of English-speaking audiences. Why should they have a foreign accent? They're supposed to be speaking - I repeat - in their own language. This is an anglocentric quirk that should be stopped.<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent, atmospheric movie."

","'The Reader' tantalizes us with a premise so sultry, so sensuous. Stephen Daldry, who also directed 'The Hours', brings this tale of Nazi accountability to life with the help of a tremendously talented cast. But as the heat of passion wears off, so does the spark that made 'The Reader' such a captivating picture.<br/><br/>'The Reader' nearly achieves greatness during its first hour. It's seductive, sexy. Kate Winslet and David Kross bear all to deliver remarkable and worthy performances. While Winslet is no stranger to stripping down for the camera, David Kross' role as a teenager coming-of-age while living in West Germany during the 1950s is admirably brave. The relationship between these two is captured beautifully on film with human passion during a difficult time of reconstruction and national shame. The film is focused, rapturing.<br/><br/>But as 'The Reader' moves away from its sultry premise, the driving force behind the picture falters. It never ceases to be a fascinating story, but it lacks that emotional punch that would have helped make this a truly memorable experience. It feels rushed, and was in order to be out in time for Oscar consideration. And what was a provocative coming-of-age portrait becomes an interesting but dull look at Holocaust accountability. It suggests an emotionally resonant life story, but in reality 'The Reader' is rather distant. I'm not quite sure what it was getting at, a dilemma that may have risen when translating the source novel from the screen. But I'm not convinced that had Winslet's Hanna been literate, her actions would have been any different. Is it redemption for the awful crimes committed? <br/><br/>The emotional toll that 'The Reader' takes on David Kross' character is obvious. He becomes a heavy smoker, he's forced to watch the trial and humiliation of a woman he thought he knew. Kate Winslet's physical appearance undergoes dramatic changes. The sensuous, lustful body gives way to age. These are two devastatingly human performances, and that makes the difference. 'The Reader' may struggle when it tries to become a profound and meaningful excursion, but the riveting performances of these fine actors is terrific. See it for them. But if you're looking for a more convincing and tragic look at Post-WWII Germany, you may want to look elsewhere.<br/><br/>More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

It's not a mystery-story plot, though, more of a tear-jerker, though for reasons well removed from the usual ""I love her, she doesn't love me, smoke gets in your eyes"" plot-line.<br/><br/>The film cleverly mixes themes of war horror, law, young love, and self-development.

"Quinoa1984","7","4","9","26 December 2008"," engaging and sad, perhaps too sad, with a weaker third act
","Maybe I should've read the book. Ironic that a film that has a crucial point being illiteracy should be seen by me, having not read the very, very highly acclaimed book it's based upon. I saw the film with my wife and mother, both of whom had read the book, and they claimed they had a more enjoyable experience (if that's the term used for a tragic tale of first love gone bad and/or strange in the long-term) as they could fill in whatever gaps were missing from what was, according to them, a faithful adaptation. Taking the film on its own terms, how it works in telling its story, it's certainly better than the stuff previous ""Oscar-baiter"" from Stephen Daldry, the Hours. Certainly Kate Winslet helps every mili-second she's on-screen, and the fact that it's two movies, sort of, makes it interesting when things start to get a little detached.<br/><br/>The first half, what could have made on its own an absorbing story of lust and obsession and hills and valleys in a relationship, is about a near-Last Tango set-up where after a mid-30s German woman (Winslet) in post WW2 Germany helps a 15 year old get home he comes back in some attraction, and soon they start an illicit affair kept pretty much to her (Hannah's) quarters. The big thing is reading to Hannah: she can't read or write, so ""kid"" reads to her before and after (I'm surprised not during) their sexual endeavors. But, of course, the relationship turns sour since, frankly, the kid Michael gets interested in girls his own age and is screwed in the head over it... It screws with him still when this first sort of movie ends and the second one begins, which is when Michael is a little older, a law student, and watching Hannah on trial for war crimes she committed at Auschwitz.<br/><br/>Sound like fun date stuff? Not exactly, though it may hit the spot for the couple looking for that love story where compromises are few and the consequences are plenty (i.e. if Michael comes forward during the trial with information that could help her a tiny bit, which he doesn't, what will that mean for Hannah who does not read or write and did not in fact write the letter she's accused of writing detailing what to do against prisoners). If there seems to be some kind of problem, and this is just a guesstimate from someone, again, not very familiar with the book, is that in two hours, even for something that's supposed to be a short read, is crammed in. We see a montage of Michael reading countless books on tape for Hannah while she's in jail. It's hard to feel any sympathy for her since, frankly, she's a war criminal in the worst possible way. But there is an identification with the boy who becomes a man, and the essential elements of pride and dignity and intelligence that are touched upon.<br/><br/>At the same time it's also a pretty good love story, one that starts as hot and heavy and probably immature on one end and transforms into something that is kind of like making constant amends. It's maybe a little too polished at times- the musical score goes away at the mood as if it were Notes on a Scandal, which isn't quite right- and without Winslet or Fiennes or for his few minutes Bruno Ganz it doesn't work nearly as well. The Reader does make for some involving storytelling, of something not usually considered which is the conscience of law vs love or the power of words spoken and stories told when a life to oneself (like Hannah's) is worth nothing much at all. It doesn't leave you feeling very good inside, but you'll feel rewarded for the performances and at the least the reasonably hot sex scenes (it is Kate Winslet doing her nude/sex thing after all)."

","First, I thought this story was pretty well acted and brought to life. A young boy falls in love and has an affair with an older woman, but she is hiding something. Well done. Next the young man, some years later, finds this woman is on trial for being a guard at a concentration camp, for activity helping with the function of this death camp, and later keeping the doors locked while 300 women burn to death. I think this puts her in the category of evil. So the big twist turns out to be that she was illiterate and (skipping details) didn't have to spend as long in prison as she did, because she was too ashamed to admit that she couldn't read. This storyline is offensive, absurd, and insulting to the memory of all the victims. Participating in mass murder of men, women, and children and what you really feel ashamed about is that you cannot read? Oh please, this movie should never have been made. What a waste of talent (the acting was pretty decent) and cinematography well done. And with regard to those reviews that ask, ""How do we know what we would have done in the same situation?"" I really don't think ""normal"" people can murder so many people without at minimum considering quitting their job at the concentration camp--they were there and employed by choice. Why not give us true insights into people that commit terrible acts and then go home and are tender with their friends and family. Much more powerful was an interview I saw with one of the Nazi executioners that gathered three generations of women from one family, told them to disrobe and prepare to die, and then shot each one. He was asked whether he had any regrets, to which he responded, ""Absolutely not, they deserved it."" This dimension is completely missing from the movie, leaving essentially a love story with the question, how bad can your lover be and you still maintain strong feelings of affection."

By one authoritative reckoning, there have been nearly 300 such cinematic works and some - such ""Sophie's Choice"" and ""Schindler's List"" - have been truly memorable and moving. However, ""The Reader"" is an addition to the genre that it is hard to welcome.<br/><br/>Directed by Stephen Daldry (""The Hours""), technically it is superb. The acting is fine with an outstanding performance by Kate Winslet as Hanna, a former concentration camp guard who betrays no understanding, let alone guilt, for her actions both at Auschwitz and at a fire and yet shows kindness in assisting a young man in the grip of scarlet fever who becomes the reader of the story (David Kross as the youth and Ralph Fiennes as the man). The make-up and cinematography are first class.<br/><br/>The problem is the narrative, which jumps backwards and forwards between 1958, 1966 and 1984, based on a bestselling German novel by Bernard Schlink. Things might be clearer in the book but, in the film, the motivations of the leading characters are utterly opaque and the central message of the work is totally unclear, leaving this viewer anyway perplexed and unsatisfied with a story which seems morally confusing if not vacuous."

"gregf-4","2","6","17","20 October 2009"," Pointless needless propaganda
","I nominate THE READER for the inaugural Leni Riefenstahl Award for Excellence in Propaganda.<br/><br/>To begin, author Bernhard Schlink wanted to examine what it means to love someone who committed an atrocity. He could have set his tragic love affair against any moral crisis he wanted, but his choice of the war crimes trial of five female Nazi prison guards places both his novel and the movie in the category of zionist propaganda. The great propaganda moment comes near the end when the crime in question is revealed at the trial. Two points are of particular note.<br/><br/>LAW VS. MORALITY<br/><br/>Based on their written account of the event, the women are charged with failing to open the locked door of a building during a fire, thereby causing the death of 300 women and children prisoners trapped inside—all save one woman and her daughter.<br/><br/>A law professor, who brought five students to see the trial, explains that what the women did was legal according to the law at the time. Student Michael Berg rejects this sanguine attitude: ""You keep telling us to think like lawyers but they are guilty... What is there to understand?"" Berg is meant to represent the voice of humanity and righteous indignation. For him, what the women did was a crime because they were morally responsible for the lives of the prisoners and they failed in their responsibility. Legalistic tap-dancing around what was or was not acceptable cannot make the crime any less punishable. For this scene—and the film itself— to have integrity, the position of moral righteousness must remain constant. It doesn't.<br/><br/>Because The Reader came out during Israel's bombardment of Gaza one month ago the entire trial is rendered banal. The professor is absolutely correct: there is nothing surprising or condemnatory about what the women did because the same corrupt morality that made it legally acceptable then is again acceptable now.<br/><br/>During the bombardment of Gaza, Israel forced 110 Palestinians, half of them children, to take shelter in a house in Zeitun, a suburb of Gaza City. The next day Israel deliberately bombarded the house for 34 hours, killing 30 and wounding 18. The youngest victim was five months old. There is no trial scheduled to try these war criminals.<br/><br/>In fact, the Jews who committed the Zeitun atrocity were greater criminals. The guards did not actually attack the building. Theirs was a crime of omission; Israel's is a crime of commission.<br/><br/>The only reason to make this movie, much less write the book, is to breathe life into Hitler's ghost so we don't notice the living Hitlers in Israel. The guards in The Reader were not put on trial for allowing innocent people to die; they were tried for allowing Jews to die. The effect is to propagandize the Jew-as-victim myth and make the audience believe that it's a political reality.<br/><br/>COLLECTIVE GUILT<br/><br/>The second propaganda point is the common theme of all Germans sharing responsibility for the holocaust. One of the law students says of Hanna Schmitz, one of the guards: ""I'd shoot her myself; I'd shoot them all."" In contrast, fellow student Michael Berg is downcast throughout the trial because Hanna is his former lover, and he knows she is innocent because she is illiterate. She could not have written the incriminating report as the other defendants claimed.<br/><br/>Against the lies of the other guards, though, Hanna would not defend herself for fear of admitting her handicap. Berg, who could have saved Hanna, did not speak up because he feared his classmates' contempt, and he wanted to distance himself from the crime.<br/><br/>The audience is shown both bloodlust and cowardice, yet they are supposed to identify with the professor's detached, rational respect for the law: ""If people like you don't learn from people like me, then what the hell is the point of anything?"" Indeed, what IS the point"" The idea that justice for these Nazi guards should be fair and rational is hard to take seriously given that Jews in Israel are visiting a collective punishment, a holocaust, on Palestinians, and many Jews are sabotaging attempts to bring the criminals to justice. Moreover, if one accepts that Israel is a law unto itself and commits collective punishment as a matter of national policy, could the professor's rational detachment be invoked in the defence of any Israeli war criminal that might face trial? Regardless of how much attention one pays to the relationship between Michael and Hanna, the holocaust is the focus. Without it, there would be no book or movie. The holocaust defines for all time our moral frame of reference: the past is real; the present is an illusion; Jews are eternal victims.<br/><br/>The legalistic culture and the oppressor/victim relationship described in The Reader are antiquated, so the decision to use them, in preference to meaningful, real-life, examples renders the book and movie preposterous, manipulative and dishonest.<br/><br/>For the above-mentioned reasons and the high quality of the movie's production, The Reader would be a worthy recipient of the inaugural Leni Riefenstahl Award for Excellence in Propaganda.<br/><br/>excerpted from ""Hollywood's most misunderstood genre deserves its own award category"" (http://www.gregfelton.com/movies/2009_02_15.htm)"

","I let my girlfriend choose this film else I would have passed on it because of the topic: Germany, WWII, Jewish Holocaust. I did enjoy the film although parts of it were weak. I've read the many reviews offered by others and unfortunately, couldn't find something that mirrored my concerns.<br/><br/>The scenes were well done. You felt the time periods clearly and the camera movement was supportive. The acting was just OK. Personally, I find German to be much different than British English so I would have enjoyed the film more if the actors spoke German and we had to read subtitles. It's a bit tough to enjoy a good German film when the actors are spouting British expressions like ""atall."" Having said that, this is one of those nerdy films where everything isn't cut and dry and you have to think afterward, not unlike a attending the theater. Given that, is it the actors' fault that we cannot quite understand what is going through their heads? There are two leads: a female ex-Nazi SS guard and a legal student who later grows up to be a lawyer. Apparently, the woman Kate is such a good actress that many other viewers are gushing about her talent while I'm thinking she was so wooden at times that I wondered if she was in fact 1-dimensional. The man behaved unrealistically.<br/><br/>My main problem was with the plot. SPOILER ALERT! The first half of the film clearly identifies the world of the boy and the lady. We see setting, emotion, interaction and a sense of purpose. The second half of the film is a blur apparently consisting of fragments of the boy's life later when he is a college student, a young man and a middle-aged man. This is combined with characters that pop in and out of his life for no particular reason leaving you wondering exactly what is important and what isn't. i.e. whatever happened to, if you show the gun in Act I, you'd better use it in Act II? At one point, the college student determines that he owes the lady assistance but isn't sure how to proceed. His professor advises direct communication and he agrees but then backs out without any explanation. Now while the childhood is shot in one German city and the college life in another, we are suddenly interrupted by a montage through a concentration camp museum which may have been Auschwitz (isn't it still in Poland?) with no explanation of how he got there, why he is allowed to wander unescorted or what is he looking for. Perhaps he decided to pin all responsibility for all the deaths at that camp on his ex-lover and therefore refused to assist her at her trial? Does that even make sense knowing that her duties at best would have been extremely limited given her illiteracy? And more montage where we see him court a classmate but divorce her years later after they have a child. If the wife and child are so unimportant, why are they even in the film? Lastly, after divorcing his wife for unstated reasons and unpacking in a new residence, he happens on a book that he used to read to the lady now in prison and decides to dictate it to a tape recorder, then mail both recorder and tapes to her in prison without attaching any letter of explanation or introduction or even providing one on the tape. Huh? If he dumped his wife and child out of secret pining for an ex-lover, why accidentally find the book and why not talk to her? Worse, he apparently does this for at least 10 years until she is unexpectedly released from prison after 20 years. But wait, it gets worse! He finds her a place to live and a job and offers to pick her up when she gets out but refuses to acknowledge their past or attempt to pick up where they left off. Seriously, who acts like this for 10 years? But, the ex-guard is not much better. While on trial, she patiently explains her duties and limited ability to make decisions and dispassionately explains how 300 prisoners were allowed to die rather than escape during an Allied bombing, yet is suddenly unable and unwilling to admit that she cannot read or write even when the judges make it quite clear that failure to do so will result in strict sentencing while her ex-coworkers get off with almost no punishment by comparison. Huh? Lastly, after her predictable suicide, the man travels to NYC just to sit with a now incredibly wealthy Jew to ask for an apology which is not forthcoming. Who actually behaves like this? When you consider how the Jews treat the Arabs around Israel, or how Europe in general responded to the Yugoslavian disaster, any profound comment is lost. Lastly, what Jew is able to survive the Holocaust, move to America and marry rich? Seriously!<br/><br/>If the film is German, then I appreciate the effort to apologize for WWII. It's a good start anyway. If it is from anybody else, it is contrived to the point of silliness."

","A film that I rarely, if ever, got caught up in. It felt like the kind of movie that is based on a much better novel. A 15 year old boy (David Kross, played by Ralph Fiennes as an adult) meets up with a strange older woman (Kate Winslet) and, before long, they have a passionate, tumultuous affair. This first section of the film is pretty good, bringing to mind some of the great, erotic movies about sexual affairs, like maybe Last Tango in Paris. Less erotic than that, really, but it's pretty hot, and Winslet is extremely good in these scenes, carrying an unknown weight that is threatening to crush her. In the second section of the film, we learn just what her deal is. If you've seen any commercials or trailers for it, you already know the secret. If you don't, the film might work a little bit better, have a little more suspense. Personally, it was in the second section of the film where I really stopped caring. Kross is a law student observing a trial in which Winslet is the defendant. There's just too many scenes of Kross staring at Winslet from above, confused as to what he should do. Plus, where the theme of sexual politics and broken hearts is well enough done in the film, I thought it did a bad job building up any deep theme upon the historical events that are the focus of the film. It uses a very serious event, but I felt it didn't explore it in any but the most banal way, like it never even happened. I also thought Winslet started to flounder in these scenes. The final part works a tad better, but I just felt uninvolved by that point. European greats Bruno Ganz and Lena Olin have cameos."

","I give a lot away so you might want to read the next one.<br/><br/>I heard great things about this from some friends... then after viewing: realized that my friends are a little antisemitic. Here's a summarized premise: A young law student runs into a forty something year old sometime after the Holocaust. They fall in love. He finds out that she's illiterate so he starts to read to her. Fast forward a bit, she's on trial...responsible for over 300 deaths during the Holocaust. At the ending of the trail the young law student weeps when his lover is sentenced to a lifetime of imprisonment. The worst part of this scene is that the mood attempts to actually try and get the viewer to feel for this illiterate nazi! Years go by and she is released from prison... yeah, they apparently just let some of them free after awhile. Anyways she can read now: how great for her... who cares she's a freaking nazi! The fact that there was a movie created to get people to feel something for these people who were truly scum of the earth is repulsive. It attempts to also send a message that ""reading is good."" However, that is just a shelled message to promote biased opinions in favor of nazi's, explaining that they had feelings and were people. Do you really care if some nazi learned to read while she was in jail? Did I mention that she had the Jews read to her and then she would send them off to die? The only good parts about this movie were the reminders that when nazi's were imprisoned they too were given numbers... and that many of them took their own lives because they weren't strong enough in the end to live with what they did. Too bad they weren't all put in gas chambers instead so that the world today could call it a little poetic justice. If this still sounds interesting than watch the stupid thing.

","It's that time again, folks, Oscar is looming and here is this year's Atonement, ticking all the right boxes to impress the impressionable. Surely it's time the Acadamy created another category, a set of Awards eligible to Best Festival Fodder leaving the established set of awards for movies who just want to entertain and make a buck on the side. As if Festival Fodder weren't enough this is yet another platform in the campaign to 'get-poor-Kate-a-gong', a campaign managed by those who somehow think Kate Winslet is an actress. There's a lovely irony at work here for by electing to play a woman who never had a moral compass to lose Winslet just reminds us that in private life she abandoned a husband unable to further her career in favour of a high-profile director who has, indeed, just directed her in another movie, Revolutionary Road which targets the gong circuit. Okay, the Oscar has been devalued so what's the harm in tossing one her way except that that would put her on a footing with both the Hepburns, Bette Davis and other Real Actress winners which would be a travesty especially if awarded for the gift of a role which even Pia Zadora couldn't screw up."

By the time it got to Winslets trial, because she was apparently a guard in a nazi-camp during WW2 I gave up on this pretentious boring piece of crap of a movie.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie.

","Warning: Spoilers<br/><br/>I just do not get it. Apparently it is more shameful for the character Hanna to admit to being illiterate than to have been complicit in the murder of several hundred human beings. Are we supposed to feel sorry for Hanna? That poor little Nazi it wasn't her fault she didn't realise that torturing people was naughty because she couldn't read. Is that what it was about? Because that's what I took from it. The affair between Hanna and Michael also feels unbelievable to me. Hanna's character is colder than a snowman. Even without knowing she is a Nazi Michael would surely have guessed that there was something up with her. If he was just after sex then maybe it is a feasible pairing - a horny teenager and a physically pleasing older woman - I get that.

","It had been awhile since I've been this disappointed, but I left the movie's credits profoundly disgusted. The material is not only weak, but practically void. It stands non-chalant, sourcing it's story as it has a bigger message, but the mix poured with unaesthetic, cold, unimportant flows of sex scenes that can't even pull reactions other than boredom, Winslet snugged on make up without feeling the character, delivering her speech without a change in her blank expression; with tears that seem to mechanical and looks that seem to disgusting.<br/><br/>It has the disadvantage of also being talked in English, set upon Nazi Germany, a completely detachment between Michael Berg grown and youth, and lines and subplots too predictable to be accounted as realistic or even entertaining.<br/><br/>Many movies were, are and will be made about the Second War World. It has lots of material: ""Letters of Iwo Jima"" did beautifully in telling hell over the Japanese side. ""The Pianist"" cut crude into a fight for survival keeping morals. Even ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" did a perfect examination of the disgusting wheels of Nazi officers in trial.<br/><br/>But ""The Reader"" has nothing to give to this big names.

I decided to write a quick review because the story was important and, for the most part, well-written and well-acted. But, in my humble opinion, to make this a truly great movie, and the material deserves more attention, this film needed another pass through an editor's hands to remove the extraneous sex scenes. <br/><br/>The subject matter is serious but I found myself wondering if the costume budget had been drastically cut given how many scenes are shown of naked people. I only needed one sex scene to set the stage for the passionate affair between Michael and Hannah. The repetitious sex scenes became gratuitous and boring. Not one of them was original but instead were reminiscent of those that had gone before in ""Summer of '42"", ""The Graduate"", and many others. A good 20 minutes in sex scenes alone could've been cut and the movie would've been better for it. As it was they became an unwelcome distraction from the actual point of the film. And that's a shame because once we get beyond them the movie really takes off. Until then, however, my inclination to stop watching was great. I'm glad I didn't, but I did want to warn others.

"cwade22","10","2","4","24 April 2018"," I want Kate Winslet's character To teach me things.
","Powerful film! Decisions Michael made were disappointing in that he could've SAVED Her! A hug. Telling the court Hanna could barely write and couldn't read. Why would she be so selfish or proud to go without honesty in that moment, to take the fall, to never see how far and deep She and Michael could've gone, as to not reveal her illiteracy? Michael was young and felt peer pressure to hate Her, but He could've saved Her in that court room. <br/><br/>Modern day, Americans call anybody that disagrees with liberal ideology a Nazi or fascist. They will shout down free speech and call anybody a Nazi. But do they even know who the nazis were? I doubt Hanna was even a member of the NASDP. SS Guard, but illiterate?! I highly doubt an illiterate person would be a member of the Nazi party. Most people don't realize that detail. You can be a camp guard but not a Nazi. You can be a 16 year old WAFFEN SS soldier fighting in battle against the red army, but not even a member of the NASDP. Most Americans get their American version of the war. Russians and Brits get there versions. They're all different. Most Americans think all Germans were evil nazis. There are uneducated video games with ""Nazi zombies"" but where is the accurate history? Germany, there are laws that ban the imagery of swastika. Video game developers can't even add the symbol in the game. It's history and very important to be documented. I'm Half Black and I want to see swastikas in WW2 video games and other documentations. How will we see the past accurately? How will we discern good from bad? Learn from mistakes? Again, most young American liberal minded types will call anything and anybody a Nazi. I'm half black, and they'll call me a Nazi before seeing my skin tone. This is what happens when free speech is stifled and when guilty feeling governments repress historic symbols like the swastika from even video games, or old WAFFEN SS uniforms. How can people demand progress if they hide the past? How can people correct mistakes if they can't see what they were? This is what happens when the German government bans historic documents, and hinders understanding of even their dark and shameful past. I'm from the same city where Dr. Martin Luther King jr was killed. My city doesn't hide that. They have a museum. They remind people. What I see happening in Europe where free speech is being stifled, it's only setting the world up for more of the bad from history. I'm mentioning this because it correlates to the guilt and fear Michael felt in that courtroom from speaking the TRUTH to save the Woman HE LOVED out of fear of backlash from the angry victims and others in that courtroom. People he might've relied on as Clients. I understand the reasons, but it's always sad to see the TRUTH die in fear. Even if it's to save a former SS camp guard. <br/><br/>I think most people can relate to the connection Michael and Hanna Had. When I saw Hanna teaching Michael how to make love with Her, I envied Michael! The pictures of female SS camp guards aren't very flattering. Most were unattractive. Only one was young and beautiful, Irma Grese! Aside from Her, all the female SS guards were scary looking. Maybe Kate winslett was an accurate portrayal of a female SS camp guard, but maybe not. I'll just say, if they looked like Her, I'd willingly go to camp. <br/><br/>I knew the outcome of Hanna. I knew When Michael visited her how things would end. He could've hugged her. Maybe he wasn't ready to re connect. I'm surprised there were no flashback scenes to the 1940's. Most other stories would've included visualizing those times. The main detail I couldn't believe was how an adult living in Germany could be ILLITERATE! Wow! I guess I don't know everything about the Germans from that war. And I've done years of research, more than the average American, regarding that war and the Military factions of Nazi Germany. I wanted Michael to save her, but it didn't happen. I couldn't help but fall in Love with Hanna. She was very lovable, despite her past. When She said she only remembered the past at trial, I guess it's possible her past wasn't emulated in her when Michael met Her. He Saw Her goodness. I think everybody that calls Anybody a Nazi, and stifles free speech should watch this film. The film left me with more questions than answers, but that's okay. I'm thinking. If only everybody could think and remember and learn from the past mistakes. And learn from what works. Hanna didn't teach me how to make love with a Woman, but She made me see the goodness in Her and how everybody can be both good and bad. We all have choices to make. CHOICES! Not talking about her Choices, but choices in general. What's the right choice?"
"SpitztheGreat","6","2","4","4 June 2009"," A movie with substantial flaws
","This movie exemplifies hyperbole. The accolades that this movie won are leaps and bounds beyond what it truly deserves. I'm not trying to argue that Kate Winslet didn't do a wonderful job, she did, nor am I arguing that underneath there aren't strong qualities, but this movie is certainly nothing special. Unfortunately this is an example of a film getting lost in the bubble of Hollywood where some things take on a life of their own.<br/><br/>Movies about guilt, pride, loss of innocence, have to walk a fine line in their story telling. This movie falls apart with it's inability to artfully hold the story together. The danger when dealing with such subject matter is that in order to make it feel real the characters must show emotional damage. The Reader does a masterful job of showing people who's lives have all been damaged by sin. However, the trap that can be sprung, and that this movie falls for, is that the characters become unidentifiable with. The cold nature of the main characters, especially Hana, keeps the audience at arms length from growing attached to anyone. Watching a 2+ hour movie without anyone to feel for is a hollow feeling.<br/><br/>To best sum up my feelings about this movie I will draw a comparison to Benjamin Button. Both movies have such strong source material to draw from, a wealth of talent and limitless potential but yet neither accomplished much that hasn't already been done. The Reader has been done before and done better by other movies. It leaves too many loose ends to be considered a strong movie, interesting and important plot developments are either not explored or left hanging. Winslet is by far the best part of this film, it's unfortunate that the rest of the film didn't live up to her performance."
"jem132","7","2","4","4 May 2009"," Good, but I was vaguely disappointed by Winslet's performance
","I was vaguely disappointed by this one. I thought it was a good film, well worth the time, but I just didn't see the greatness of Kate Winslet's performance. Sure, she's excellent as Hanna, the former SS prison guard who has an affair with a young man (David Kross, amazing), but I wasn't bowled over by her acting. It's a thoughtful drama that quietly makes you question yourself, although I don't think the *big secret* is handled very well-- it all seems rather predictable. Stephen Daldry directs and he's very good at period drama, capturing his settings well and bridging between the decades with ease. The cinematography is lovely. However, in a film that's very much about the power of literature, the writing at times seems sloppy. I've never read the Bernhard Schlink novel, so maybe someone could shed some light on this one for me. Did it fail in it's translation from novel to the screen?"
"yris2002","9","2","4","30 March 2009"," daring, thought-provoking, sublime
","The Reader is a very ambitious and daring movie, in that it risks being misunderstood, mainly by those who believe solved all the questions concerning the Shoah and can see clearly where guilt and responsibility lie. The movie, like the book, shifts the attention from the universal, great history to a personal, small history, trying to pose further questions, to look at things from a different perspective, but never falling into the temptation to justify or blame anyone or anything. The horror of what the Shoa was is out of doubt, is something the viewer has always in mind, and, given the due proportions between collective and individual tragedy, it just gives voice to those people who became, more or less unconsciously, the instruments of Nazi Germany, people whose consciences were totally destroyed and replaced by an absolute duty to obedience, fundamental to the success of that dreadful system. I would define the movie as sublime, in the romantic sense of the word, in its tension towards a possible definite comprehension of reality, even though no final and absolute truth is to be found. The movie moves gently but inexorably into the harsh story of Hanna, superbly interpreted by an outstanding Kate Winslet, one of the most talented actresses of today, capable of conveying a strange but touching sense of emptiness, sadness and at the same time a passionate longing for life. Her love story with the young boy is experienced with passion but also sadness and pain, the only moments in which she feels authentically human is when she is read the classics, which can lead her into the lives of fictitious characters, but full of pure emotion. Less convincing Fiennes' interpretation, who seems (maybe only apparently), a little detached from those events which should have left a time-resistant mark in his soul. The only flaw is the choice to use the English language, both for the books and for the letters between Hanna and Michael. I think it's quite misleading, since the question of the language is highly significant, in that is strictly connected with the sense of belonging to and identifying with a country and its history.

","'The Reader'(2008) is undoubtedly one of the most touching and thought-provoking films made on the Holocaust in particular and the World War II in general. Though the tempo of the film is indeed rather slow, nevertheless it is entirely gripping and forces the discerning viewer to think and realize yet again that life is usually not black-and-white, rather always grey. The film is basically meant for a mature and thinking audience....one that has an eye and a mind for cinema on serious / controversial subjects such as the Holocaust and how the post-war generation of young Germans are still coming to terms with their troublesome past.The performances by all the cast are perfect for their respective roles, even that of Ralph Fiennes, whose role has, in my opinion, been rather unfairly derided by some. The stand-out acting performances are delivered by Kate Winslet (who won a richly deserved 'Best Actress in a Leading Role' Oscar in Feb 2009, for her role of ""Hannah Schmitz"" in this film)and the young prodigy,David Kross (brilliant uninhibited portrayal of an adolescent boy who falls in love with a woman in her 30s and later learns about and has to somehow come to terms with her notorious past).Indeed the duo have given it their all. So brilliant is Kate's performance (at her trial and onwards in the film)that it is difficult not to sympathize with her and make a genuine attempt to also understand her defence of her past actions, especially the circumstances under which she did what she had to do as a part of her official duties as an SS female guard in a Nazi concentration camp. The background musical score by Nico Muhly is brilliant and just right for the grim and sombre mood of the film.<br/><br/>Overall 'The Reader' is a brilliant,sensitive and highly thought- provoking film....full of pathos and tragedy,....a film that boldly dares to challenge conventional notions about the Holocaust without overtly defending its perpetrators / taking sides. The Director leaves it to the judgement of the audience to decide for themselves. One of the ""must watch"" movies for those who value and understand quality cinema purely for its story,performances and direction...not just for gizmos and special effects and to watch certain over-hyped ""stars""."

","This film was superb. It should have won for Best Picture. I've been going to the movies for over 50 years. Never before have I seen a film that kept me from sleeping. It was haunting; everything was great. I am a male but I was weeping for the last 40 minutes of the film. Ms. Winslet is the finest actress of our times. I am grateful that she was awarded Best Actress by the Academy. I haven't yet seen ""Revolutionary Road"", but how could her performance have been better? Until viewing the film, I never learned of the ""secret"" and I won't reveal it here. This is a bittersweet film that you cannot easily forget! In this film, the explicit scenes were not the most memorable scenes. I found the courtroom scenes to be the most compelling. I'm glad that Nicole Kidman did not get the role. She is a marvelous actress but she has a stuck-up demeanor that follows her in every role. Ms. Winslet was perfectly cast."

","This is a film that is not for the young or for those looking for popcorn fare. This is for ADULTS & those interested in moral questions & justification to all sorts of unspeakable acts that we all are capable of doing. I can't express how good Kate Winslet is in her portrayal. In all of her Oscar nominations this is the best work. She is absolutely convincing playing this morally questionable character. Although she won the Oscar, the young man playing opposite her is excellent as well & it can't be said enough how good he is opposite Mrs. Mendes which is no small feat in itself. This is probably not for anyone younger than 21 & most definitely not for those looking for bubblegum light-hearted Hannah Montana let's just call it *Stuff* Anyone that is familiar & interested in the European theater of World War II are those who will be most interested. I would also say this is acting at it's absolute finest & nobody does it better than Kate Winslet. I'm betting Meryl Streep's 15 or 16 nominations will someday be overtaken by this beautiful superb woman. I'm hoping that we keep seeing this excellent actress for another 50 years to come because as long as people keep writing good work, she can do it."

","Michael Berg (David Kross) is an almost-16 year old German secondary student who is very, very ill. On his way home from school, he stops in an alley to relieve his stomach and shiver madly during a torrential downpour. Fortunately, a woman, Hanna (Kate Winslet), who lives in an old building spies him, helps clean up after him, and makes certain he gets home. Back with his family, a doctor arrives and declares that the teen has scarlet fever and must stay in bed for a couple of months. Once recovered, Michael mentions to his mother the lady who helped him on the street and mama insists that Michael take her flowers. Remembering the apartment building, the teenager does so. Hanna, very surprised to see him, is ironing her clothing, including her under garments. Michael is intrigued, for Hanna is very beautiful, even if she is 20 years his senior. On the next visit, protocol is thrown to the wind and the older woman puts the moves on the shy Michael, resulting in a torrid affair. Hanna, especially, begs Michael to ""read to her"", everything from Homer to Chekhov to Tintin. Lovely Hanna works hard as a money-taker for the trolley but, after weeks of meetings, Michael convinces Hanna to go on a ""bike holiday"" with him. Bliss is too weak a word to convey their mutual affections but it is short lived. One day, Hanna has packed up and gone and Michael is disconsolate. Flash forward several years. Now Michael is a law student and his class is attending a local trial of six former prison guards at Nazi camps. Astonishingly and tragically, Michael learns Hanna is one of them. Despite Michael's suspicions that Hanna is illiterate, the former beauty is given the harshest sentence, life in prison, for she claims she wrote the camp's reports. She is gone from sight forever. But, Michael can not forget her. Now grown-up (Ralph Fiennes takes over) and divorced, Michael records books, including their favorites, on tapes and sends them to Hanna in prison, where she is astonished and gratified to get them. But, will the two lovers ever see each other again? This is a powerhouse of a film, incredibly moving and incredibly controversial. While the storyline is intricate, it is still basically an exploration of what is good and what is evil and if there is anything ""gray"" in-between the two. Specifically, can an illiterate German woman, trying to support herself, take a job in the SS, follow orders, send Jews to their death and be anything other than a monster? With this highly volatile premise, there is bound to be controversy and one can not imagine a Jewish person, especially a Holocaust survivor, having anything but one opinion only, with good cause. Yet, the movie presents evidence to support both sides. As the principal stars, Winslet, Kross, and Fiennes are magnificent and well worth any accolades and prizes coming their way. It is even more astonishing to realize that Winslet gave another knockout performance this year in Revolutionary Road, as well and that Kross was a mere 18 when filming began! The scenery, too, is lovely, as are the costumes, musical score, script and direction. Due to the sexual nature of the film, it is unsuitable for anyone under 18. But, this movie is a true lightning rod for the brain and for the heart and should be seen by every discriminating movie attender."

","This poignant film took a devastating look at Germany post WWII.

It is about guilt, illiteracy, love, loss, family, and questioning everything we know. Nevertheless, the aftermath the Shoah is shown on screen in the highest of sensitivity.

"loco_73","Null","2","4","24 February 2009"," Apology not accepted...
","In the interest of full disclosure, I first posted this as a comment on a thread dealing with ""The Reader"" and any potential lessons that may or may not have come out of the movie: <br/><br/>That is the whole point I took from the movie. There are some things that cannot be washed away, guilt for which there is no repentance. Kate Winslett's character, Hana Schmitz is racked with guilt and her attempt at dealing with that guilt is taking on the blame for having written the report which justified the death of 300 Jewish women, even though she was illiterate.<br/><br/>But she clearly realizes that any act of contrition, any apology, any sorrow, though genuine, could not under any circumstance make up for what she did. If a human being is the total sum of the decisions and choices made throughout a lifetime, then this is as good example as any, that indeed we are what we say and do. As it was clear, Hana had gotten a promotion in Siemens AG as the war was starting, but due to her illiteracy she could not accept the promotion that would have seen her required to do office work. It was the same when her supervisor offers her a promotion when she was working as a ticket vendor/controller on the streetcar.<br/><br/>Yet there were people in the same situation as her, people that chose another path in life, instead she made the choice to become an SS camp guard, nobody forced her, and the reason that ""it was a job"" was a poor excuse as the movie makes it plainly clear. Yet, when she asked the judge ""What would you have done?"", the man was clearly stumped, because he did not have any answers.<br/><br/>Also, this points to the larger issue of national guilt. No matter what Germany does, it will always have to confront this terrible legacy which is now part of its history and its very fabric and psyche (as do many other countries in Europe e.g. Russia, Italy, France, all of Eastern Europe and so on). As one of Michael's classmates points out, the trial was a sham, it was a way to deflect guilt from the many to the few, it was a way for Germany to exorcise the demon of the Holocaust from its very soul, a futile attempt alas. As that same character remarked, it is much easier to point the finger at a certain group of people and say ""they are evil, they are guilty, they should pay"", instead of accepting your own share of guilt and complicity in such a harrowing and terrible event in our history. That character enunciates the whole issue, that it was not just the Nazis that had participated and brought to fruition the Holocaust, but that also all German people bore some responsibility for it, through direct action, complicit silence or utter ignorance.<br/><br/>I think that instead trying to rationalize something like this and pass the blame to people as obvious and grotesque as the Nazis, it is better to own it and embrace it in all its ugliness and terror. The Nazis have become over time gruesome caricatures of evil, a matrix for what evil is. I think that the more frightening aspect of the Holocaust and other such sad and tragic episodes in history is that the perpetrators are more often than not, all too human and not the monsters we would like them to be. That is far more disturbing.<br/><br/>One cannot absolve himself of such a deed, an individual or a nation, as the Holocaust, but one can have the resolve to accept the all encompassing guilt emanating from it and teach others about the perils of history, be always vigilant and serve as a living example of what man is capable in face of boundless ambition, thirst for power and the utter need to demonstrate purity and superiority above others.<br/><br/>I think that ""The Reader"" imparts this lesson if one is only willing to pay attention and have an open mind. Lena Olin's character of the Holocaust survivor tells Ralph Finnes's character ""Absolution is something I do not want nor have the right to give"" (I'm paraphrasing here). Kate Winslett's character does not apologize because no apology could ever make up for her deeds. But both both victim and victimizer in the end come as close to an agreement as possible, to a commonality, Hana Schmitz leaves Michael her money, and Lena Olin's character agrees in the end with Michael's suggestion that the money be given to a charity dealing with literacy. In that, there is a common purpose and as close to an understanding as possible, and it comes full circle to the issue of learning.<br/><br/>As Bruno Ganz's character, the professor, tells Michael, ""If people like you don't learn from what happened to people like me, then what the hell is the point of it all?"". We have to learn from history lest we be doomed to repeat it, and in learning we have to step out of our own comfort zone and learn from both the victims but as well as the perpetrators, as difficult as that may be.<br/><br/>So it is perhaps right, that nothing good came out of the story, because nothing good is supposed to, how can it?"

","Based on the 1995 novel by Bernhard Schlink, The Reader (Der Vorleser) tackles difficult ethical standpoints in post-WWII Germany.<br/><br/>Fifteen-year-old Michael Berg (David Kross) has a passionate summer affair with Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet), a mysterious woman twice his age. She suddenly disappears but accidentally resurfaces in his life eight years later as a defendant in a trial he is observing as a law student. It culminates in a decision to either keep or divulge a secret important to Hanna that Michael knows could absolve her but damn him and the cause of those inadvertently affected by her unfortunate actions.<br/><br/>Oscar nominated director Stephen Daldry (for Billy Elliot, The Hours and The Reader) shows his trademark restraint and skillful handling of top-notch actors in this heavy drama about human complexity. The story itself is so open to interpretation and could've been coarsely treated but Daldry and his remarkable cast show immense sensitivity that it becomes difficult not to feel for each one.<br/><br/>After seven nominations, Winslet finally wins an Oscar for Best Actress for her stunning performance as Hanna. She is able to make you have mixed feelings of overwhelming sympathy and intense disgust for such a simpleton. It makes me wonder though, why she has to keep shedding her clothes in most of her roles when she doesn't really need to, with her incredible talent. Kross is a revelation and holds his own screen presence against such a formidable co-star. It was also interesting to find out that the production had to wait till he turned 18 to film his love scenes and that he had to learn English for this breakout role. Ralph Fiennes plays the older Michael, and while I originally thought it was a waste to cast him for this part, I later realized how crucial his eyes and expressions were in communicating volumes of feeling, even in the slightest of dialogues.<br/><br/>While heavy, The Reader is still a must-see, if only to get back to contemplating on your basic humanity. ""What would you have done?"" is the question Hanna poses to the judge, and would be interesting to ask yourself. Elements of many parts of this movie would make for a fruitful after-movie discourse."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","2","4","25 January 2009"," Winslet headlines a strong film that lacks clear and unified meaning
","There's no denying that ""The Reader"" is a well-crafted film. Director Stephen Daldry (""Billy Elliot,"" ""The Hours"") has proved himself more than capable of handling a struggle as deeply internalized as that of Michael Berg (David Kross), a German teenager in post-WWII Berlin wrestling with the shame of an affair with an older Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet), who herself is wrestling with having been a Nazi. There is no question that despite the film being about guilt and shame and how the characters are affected by bottling it up, that Daldry is able to successfully communicate the story, its emotions and keep it visually interesting (though Winslet is the true master of this skill). Yet somehow, ""The Reader"" doesn't manage to drive any kind of message home. It drives home three or four instead of clearly focusing on one.<br/><br/>Ironically, a character at the end of the film suggests to an older Michael (Ralph Fiennes) that if he's seeking catharsis he should turn to the movies. Well, not this one, at least. It's really hard to pinpoint what this film is about. Is it about a scandalous love affair and its implications? Is it about the guilt that is never absolved when one commits crimes of genocide? It's even hard to tell who the film is about because Winslet is as powerful of an actress as there is when it comes to commanding the inner monologue that she'll have you convinced the movie is about her even when--from a bare bones perspective--it's really about Michael, or at the least their relationship.<br/><br/>There's just too much for the viewer to reconcile in ""The Reader."" Between overtones of suggesting we should feel sympathy for a Nazi and understanding why older Michael is being so emotional about Hanna decades after they were last intimate, there's no room for clarity. While you can certainly feel captivated by Winslet's facial expressions portraying a heavy clash of guilt and shame, that doesn't help you better understand why her ex-lover is struggling emotionally to get through law school. It might not seem right to say it, but Winslet is so good that she becomes more a part of the film than perhaps she was intended to be. <br/><br/>Audiences will like ""The Reader"" for its parts, but not the sum of them. Each subplot, each essential question, gets addressed in some way by Daldry and writer David Hare, but the main idea, the message as a whole, is unclear. There are so many satisfying bits and pieces, scenes, symbols and imagery that appear particularly artistic and poignant, that there's something for everyone viewer to connect to, but together they feel almost meaningless.<br/><br/>Because of the thematic identity crisis, there are some structural issues with the film as well. While the producers wanted you to know about Schmitz's dark past, the film ignores the fact that you know for the first 45 minutes or so. It begins telling the story chronologically from the day Michael and Hanna met but then ends up shifting more frequently. These different 'time zones' don't exactly succeed well on their own either, they're all a part of the greater story, which as we know, is not entirely clear.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" is an example of why Winslet is every bit deserving of the acclaim she receives and of how you can take something seemingly unfilmable and give it visual life and make it interesting. In a year as full of remarkable films as 2008, it's simply hard for ""The Reader"" to stand out, especially with some flaws that keep it from being a deeply meaningful film in addition to a well-made one."
"maros612","6","2","4","25 January 2009"," Disappointing
","I can't say I didn't like the movie, but to me, the success of it sounded greatly overrated. The movie works with incredibly strong story, however, the filmmakers in my opinion didn't process it into an atmosphere and plot the story truly deserved. The first segment of the movie takes part in 1950ties, and you could say it's long and even boring. Two others are in 60ties and 90ties. The characters are not lively enough, they're distant and reserved - they only deliver very specific parts of themselves that are very closely related to story. The plot is very passive and often predictable.<br/><br/>Seeing the movie and reading the movie's description on IMDb does not make much of a difference.<br/><br/>That's in my opinion very sad, because the story had excessive potential to be breathtaking and stunning journey into WWII tragic events and people's lives affected by it, taking in account the human aspect of involved individuals."

","The German psyche is complicated, and so is this movie. There are no easy answers as to what motivates the characters.

Out of this hatred was born National Socalism which expressed with some pride an answer to the shame that was felt by a people who had to create a superior race to overcome losing World War I.<br/><br/>Hanna, who to me is the most interesting of the characters, is whether by genetics or upbringing not capable of abstract thinking. To her there is right and wrong and nothing in between. She cannot see of what she has no awareness.<br/><br/>Filled with her own personal shame for being illiterate, she lands in a job where to follow orders is equated with rightfulness. She is young like many who wind up in the military and do not have the benefit of self awareness to differentiate herself from her pedagogy. She admits to horrible things because she did not herself see them as horrible but as her duty. She feels no guilt using and sending prisoners to die who's only value is to read to her.<br/><br/>She is amoral, not capable of empathy.<br/><br/>Her final shame comes when she learns to read and write and is shamed for her lack of intellectual empathy. She cannot face this final shaming and kills herself.<br/><br/>Michal, her young lover, is only important to the story because of his contrasts to Hanna.<br/><br/>This is a well made movie, one that over time I predict will become a classic."

Going back to their ambitious effort, The Hours which would fail to win any other Oscar outside of Nicole Kidman's staggering performance. However, The Reader, their newest efforts have proved to be much lighter and even less impressive of works of 2008. <br/><br/>The film stars a wonderful ensemble of actors; starting with the beautiful Kate Winslet in her most ""bare,"" to say the least we've seen her in her career, who gives a valiant effort portraying Hanna, the woman with a dark past and even darker future. Winslet's performance here, while not surpassing her work in Revolutionary Road earlier this year, should see herself as an Oscar nominee this upcoming season. <br/><br/>David Kross who plays Michael, the object of Hanna's affection at fifteen years old, is solid and gives a courageous breakthrough performance which should make him one to watch in later years.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes, as the elder Michael is utterly heartbreaking. Making us aware of how great he has been in the past and still continues to wow us in his later years, he really shows versatility here. We hope he doesn't remain one of Oscars best kept secrets who continues to go unnoticed through time. Lena Olin, in a brief, yet strikingly igniting role, does what she can in such minimal time.<br/><br/>David Hare's screenplay however, doesn't provide enough character depth to hold us to the story. All are pretty much a mystery and undeniably in agony but we really don't care why. Daldry's direction holds pace but takes a while to pick up steam. The last third of the film is where it really comes alive but the journey there is quite uneventful.<br/><br/>Collectively, The Reader is a solid work yet noticeably flawed but always worth the watch.<br/><br/>***/****"

If the one who Hanna loved was unwilling to forgive her, then she really couldn't live any longer. Michael Berg might be too cruel to his loved one."

","This movie begins as if it is solely a romantic tale of somewhat forbidden love, but it is much more than that. Kate Winslet stars as Hanna Schmitz, a conductor on the city tram lines. David Kross is the teenaged Michael Berg and the original location in Berlin, Germany in 1958. Michael becomes sick while walking the streets and vomits at the entrance to an apartment building. Hanna takes pity on him, cleans him up and helps him go home.
Michael is diagnosed with scarlet fever, a very dangerous illness at the time and it takes months for him to recover. Once he is well, he revisits Hanna's apartment with flowers in hand. One thing leads to another and they become lovers, older woman and teenage boy. The affair continues and quickly includes Michael reading to Hanna on a regular basis. He learns that Hanna is illiterate, unable to read or write even the simplest words. There are then flash forwards to an adult Michael where he recollects events in his past and tries to cope with his present. These flash forwards continue for some time.
Young Michael enters law school and in an advanced seminar they attend the trial of some female Nazi prison camp guards. Hanna is one of the defendants, which strains Michael psychologically. Hanna is found guilty and given a life sentence. Michael is torn, because he knows that Hanna is illiterate and could not have done some of what she was accused of.
When Hanna is in prison, Michael sends her a tape recorder and cassettes containing books he has put on tapes. Hanna treasures the material and it motivates her to learn to read and write. There is a dramatic conclusion to their relationship and an anticlimax. It is clear from the way it is played that Hanna is the love of Michael's life, yet he cannot get past her sordid past. He struggles with his complex feelings for her, from love to revulsion at what she once was.
This is a movie about love between a teen boy and adult woman that lasts, but in a very complex form. It is a reminder that in dark times, people do dark things, sometimes because they are forced to and other times because they consider it their duty. Michael struggles to make sense of his feelings, what Hanna did and at the end he does the right thing, but not to the results he envisioned."

","Wow, I don't know what to make of this picture. It's so good as a fictional story that it feels like it could be a true one. It presents many moral dilemmas, not the least of which is it's treatment of Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) as almost a sympathetic character when in reality she was something of a monster. During her trial, Hanna uses a standard defense used by many former Nazi defendants who stated that they were merely doing their job in whatever capacity they were employed. In one respect, one could almost make the case that there was an element of mental illness involved in her make up, particularly when she comments on why she didn't allow the prisoners in the burning church an opportunity to escape and survive. There's that, and Hanna's overwhelming obsession to keep her illiteracy a secret, to the extent of taking the fall for the other women on trial with her who may have had even more culpability, if that were even possible.<br/><br/>I'd like to say that Kate Winslet deserved her Best Actress Win for the picture but I haven't seen any of the other films her competition appeared in. Strictly speaking though, Winslet's performance arcs through all the ranges of human experience one can imagine and presents a thoroughly conflicted character. Ralph Fiennes also turns in a worthy performance, and I would have to concur with another reviewer who felt that the character Michael Berg may indeed have lived a wasted life. His attempt at rehabilitating Hanna in her prison cell may have seemed noteworthy, but one wonders how much of it was done out of compassion and how much out of guilt.<br/><br/>What probably appalled me most about the story was when the five women on trial with Hanna all received a mere sentence of four years and three months for their role as concentration camp guards. Even if one were to apply some sort of moral equivalency to their role along side Hanna, the idea that Hanna received a life sentence made their punishment seem minor by comparison. All because their feigned indignation made Hanna out to be the leader of the group, when in fact, any one of them could have expressed some humanity during the church incident that the others might have fallen in line with."
"Shambala_Elephant","9","0","0","29 September 2017"," Two Stories Braided Together
","I hate spoilers, and so I'll avoid revealing too much. The movie is beautifully filmed and acted, and perhaps due to that acting, the character of Hannah Schmitz draws our sympathy despite....Well, she commits more than one act that some viewers find unforgivable. But for all the intensity in the love affair that consumes the first hour of the film, the movie isn't merely about the passion between Michael and Hannah, and while it is partly a coming of age story, it is also about how the two halves of the movie interpenetrate each other, just as the young Michael's rigid, very serious home life counterpoints his more joyful life at school and the past cross pollinates with the present.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie, bridged to the first by Michael's enrollment in law school and more conventional coming-of-age experiences that begin to form him into the adult he will become--or WOULD were it not for the reentry of Hannah into his life these eight years later--communicates in flashbacks and images parallel to the first half while alluding to events that happen when Michael is an infant.<br/><br/>Perhaps a couple of turning points in the plot are unnecessarily confusing in that twice Hannah receives a promotion at work that she refuses, albeit for a crucial thematic reason: she leaves her factory job with Siemans to work as a guard then (though revealed first in the movie) leaves her job as a tram ticket-taker to go who knows where until, eight years later, she resurfaces in the courtroom. When she has her affair with Michael she is living in the Siemans building--employee housing, I guess. Suffice to say that Siemans was her main employer before and after her tenure as a guard. At any rate, for those who know the basic historical time-line and watch the dates as they appear on the screen, these changes won't be so confusing. In the same vein, Lena Olin plays both the once young survivor who grows up to write the memoir that will expose Hannah AND, 20 years later, her NYC daughter. Giving the movie the benefit of the doubt, we can say that one of its themes is the ineluctability of the past and the quest for closure to it.<br/><br/>Like others, I think the chemistry between Hannah/Kate and Michael/David Kross is special, and it might make all the difference in how we receive their relationship. However, some viewers will see her less as 'human' and more as anti-social, debauched, while seeing the older Michael as damaged, but that may not lessen for them the film's impact."
"krocheav","Null","0","0","25 September 2017"," The Reader Might Leave You Asking - Guilt or Lack Of?
","As more and more people in modern society fail to clearly identify the difference between Love and Lust – it's little wonder there are so many poor marriages and divorce. 'The Reader' is yet another of the many, so-called 'romantic' movies, spinning yarns of the power of first 'love'. In this case, it's the love/lust between a 15yr old lad and a 36yr old woman named Hanna (Winslet). She, as it turns out was an SS guard in a Nazi death camp during WW11 – we all know this situation ""she/they were just doing their job - like everyone else"". This particular story begins more than a decade after her war service. Now she's working as a tram conductor and the lad, is a student whom she assists in the street - following his suffering a fever-induced vomiting session. She takes him to her apartment, cleans him up and then assists him back to his parent's home. He returns with flowers to thank her and before we know it she has her clothes off and heavily involved in instant seduction – better known as 'lust'.<br/><br/>It's not always easy to figure just what screenwriter David Hare and director Stephen Daldry are wanting to highlight as the chief focus of their adaptation of Bernhard Schlink's novel (as it tended to be with this duo's earlier collaboration, 'The Hours' in '02). The first section concentrates too heavily on the sexual relationship - with over detailed sequences featuring heavy bouts of nudity and sexual experiments. Reviewer, Thelma Adams of the Huffington Post quite rightly identified these scenes as borderline child pornography (little more than abuse). This activity has been carefully set-up to be 'accepted' by the viewer as the 'norm' but, is it really quite so? Hanna is a troubled woman and often treats her 'Kid' harshly. Following their summer 'encounters', she eventually disappears and her 'kid' is left seriously distressed and confused.<br/><br/>It's here, the movie shifts its tone to become an examination of a war crimes trial. More ambiguity within the writing surfaces - with what amounts to being heavy scrutiny of whether it's worse to publicly admit being 'illiterate' or someone who assisted with murdering hundreds of innocent people? The movie is well acted and slickly photographed yet, seems very long for its two-hour running time. While it obviously pleased the academy (it doesn't take much these days) and some audiences – it will, and has, left serious analytical thinkers unhappy with what they will clearly 'read' between the lines."

","While taking a German course in undergrad, I read Bernhard Schlink's 1995 novel ""Der Vorleser"" (which more accurately translates to ""the narrator""). I naturally thought that it would make an interesting movie. Sure enough, they eventually made one. It took me several years before I got around to seeing it, but now I have.<br/><br/>The main gist of ""The Reader"" centers on the complexity of Hanna Schmitz as a person, but also on responsibility for one's actions. Hanna might have been merely a cog in the machine, but that doesn't excuse her deeds. Indeed, part of the purpose of writing the novel was so that Germany could collectively accept responsibility for its actions.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet (who won a well deserved Oscar for the decidedly unglamorous role) portrays Hanna as a tragic figure, someone who might have not fully understood what she was doing but probably should have, and so she did eventually have to face the consequences. In the end, it doesn't matter whether or not Hanna understood what she was doing; she still made the choice to do it.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes plays Hanna's paramour as an adult, doing what he can for her (while knowing full well what she did). Nonetheless, the movie belongs to Winslet. This is another masterpiece from Stephen Daldry, also the director of ""Billy Elliot"", ""The Hours"", and ""Trash"" (about some boys in Brazil's slums)."

","Kate Winslet was the flavor of the week at the 2009 film festival when she arrived to promote her new film ""The Reader"", directed by Stephen Daldry and costarring Ralph Fiennes. At the packed house press conference on festival day number two, two of Lady Kate's co-stars in the film, veteran British actor Ralph Fiennes, and 17 year old German actor David Kross (her lover in the picture) as well as director Stephen Daldry and the two writers, David hare, screenplay, and Bernhard Schlink, of the original German book on which the film is based, were all present. Daldry, it might be mentioned, is no stranger to Berlin having introduced his big one ""The Hours"" here in 2002. For those with short memories that was the one in which Nicole Kidman played Virginia Woolf in bulbous nose makeup, and probably more for the bulbous nose than anything else, nabbed an Oscar that year as best actress. <br/><br/>Kate Winslet has been mentioned for Oscars in two of her performances this year, ""The Reader"" as well as ""Revolutionary Road"" (opposite Leonardo Dicaprio) and, if not a sure thing against competition like Meryl Streep, is certainly a sentimental favorite as she is getting to be a wee bit overdue. At any rate the gorgeous 33 year old British actress is at this moment probably at the very peak of her physical beauty and can arguably lay claim to the title of reigning queen of Hollywood on both sides of the Atlantic, lesser busy bodies like Nicole Kidman notwithstanding. <br/><br/>For the record, in the film, set back in the postwar Germany of the early fifties, Kate plays a lonely middle aged German woman, Hanna Schmitz, who was once a concentration camp overseer and, because she is illiterate has the teenage boy she has taken in as a lover read to her from storybooks. Pretty interesting stretch of the envelope, one might say, a classic English rose playing a somber Nazi lady thrashing about with a teenage boy to forget her sorrows, and illiterate into the bargain. Kate said she had to do a lot of historical research to prepare herself for this highly uncharacteristic role, which is maybe a light year away from the all-American suburban housewife she plays in ""Revolutionary Road"". Such looks (quietly breathtaking) and such versatility is definitely something to write home about. This picture which basically addresses the thorny question of lingering German guilt for the atrocities committed by Germans in WWII seems to have sincere intentions but gets to be a bit shaggy with a two hour plus running time of 124 minutes. Germans talking English in this English-speaking German story may turn out to be a hard sell to German audiences, but just watching Kate do her thing may turn out to be enough to make local viewers forget which language she's doing it in. For this viewer it didn't work at all and threw the whole picture out of kilter. <br/><br/>German author Bernhardt Schlink of the best seller on which the film is based was queried about his feelings with respect to seeing his original German dialogue converted into English in the film version, and, in general, as to what he thought of the oddity of German characters speaking English on screen. His reply, that he has no complaints because film is in itself an international language and English has become the lingua franca of international cinema, so his story will now reach a wider audience, elicited an appreciative round of applause at this display of discrete modesty. My own feeling is that it will have a hard time getting past first base on the international market and will do nothing to enhance Winslett's already impressive C.V. But she sure is looking great these days! Alex, Berlin, February 6, 2009."

","In the anti Apartheid film, A Dry White Season the lawyer character played by Marlon Brando stated that Law and Justice are not the same thing, at best they are distant cousins and in South Africa they are not even on talking terms.<br/><br/>In a similar vein in The Reader, Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz) the law professor argues: 'Societies think they operate by something called morality, but they don't. They operate by something called law.'<br/><br/>He goes on to say: '8000 people worked at Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been convicted, and only 6 of murder.'<br/><br/>The Reader is an infuriating film although I admire its subtlety and in some ways daring. Although the narrative is jumbled up, it consists of a love affair of Michael Berg (David Kross)a 15 year old schoolboy and a tram conductress Hanna (Kate Winslet) who is over twice his age. It is a passionate affair mainly due to his raging teenage hormones and during their time together he reads books to her.<br/><br/>Hanna then suddenly disappears and the story moves eight years later when Michael is a law student attending trials of Nazis with other students and their lecturer Professor Rohl. To his horror he finds Hanna is one of the defendants as she was a guard at Auschwitz and is accused of allowing several hundred prisoners to burn to death locked inside a church.<br/><br/>This incidents sullies his memories of Hanna and racks him with guilt. Unable to talk to anyone about this he finds that he has information that could help her and lower her sentence. Micheal realises that the reason Hanna liked him to read to her was because she was illiterate and the accusations she is facing was the she allegedly gave written orders leading to people's death. This cannot be true but Hanna is embarrassed to let people know she cannot read or write.<br/><br/>The final section consists of an older Michael (Ralph Fiennes) who we see in some scenes now a wealthy, successful lawyer, divorced but with a child still affected by her relationship with Hanna. Over time he has sent her tapes in which he narrates stories to her and eventually just before she is about to be released from prison he goes to see Hanna who is now an old woman.<br/><br/>Eventually Michael goes to New York to see one of the survivors from Auschwitz who a small child at the time. It is an uncomfortable experience for him as he confesses his love affair with Hanna to her. The first time he has ever spoke about it.<br/><br/>I somehow felt that the film always did not get its theme across clearly despite its symbolism and imagery. I liked parts of the film but it did not lead to a coherent whole.<br/><br/>Hanna asks the Judge at the trial what would you have done?' Of course no answer is forthcoming. In the same vein young Micheal allows Hanna to be wrongly convicted. He is angry, ashamed, bitter or just clueless. Yet someone gave those written orders and he let Hanna carry the blame and let the real culprit get away with a lesser charge.<br/><br/>I did think Hanna's lawyer was useless, I have little idea of the German legal system but he let her basically walk into jail and throw the key away. Surely he would had known that Hanna was not exactly that bright and she could not read or write. Did she never sign anything? Maybe one of Michael's fellow students was right, the trial was a sham, deflecting guilt from the many to a few."

As a 15 year-old youth, played by David Kross, he develops a relationship with an older, illiterate woman when she finds him very ill one rainy day in an alleyway in Berlin. Aside from a passionate relationship, graphically shown on screen, he also reads to her from some of the great classical novels. This is an unknown territory for the illiterate Hanna, whose world is now open to great writers. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is the mature Michael, who is a successful lawyer with a daughter from an earlier marriage. Facing some personal questions about his relationship with his daughter, he revisits his youth in his own memory, coming in contact with Hannah Schmitz, played by Kate Winslett. Hannah ekes out a living collecting fares from streetcar passengers.<br/><br/>We later find out that Hanna took a job with a German company Siemens working in a death camp during World War II. There, she routinely selects prisoners for death in the gas chambers. In her trial, which Michael witnessed as a law student, it is clear that she carried out her duties without guilt. To some, this appears as evidence of her complicity in war crimes. To Michael, it must have seemed that she did not fully realize what she was doing. Neither did she know until later the impact of her relationship with Michael, who apparently was haunted by his youthful sexual liaison with Hannah. In the end, Hannah does come to terms with her past and Michael becomes her only contact with the world as he carries out her final wishes. <br/><br/>Kate Winslett plays a lonely woman who is drawn to Michael, a talented language student. As an older, broken woman, she shows the effects of her tortured life journey. Her story makes the viewer feel a strange sympathy, while feeling repelled by her choices in life. Michael, as a youth, is made exceptionally realistic with David Cross in the role. Ralph Fiennes shows the disappointment of a middle aged man as he looks back on his life; yet he is capable of changing course. <br/><br/>The acting of Ralph Fiennes and David Kross as Michael and Kate Winslett as Hannah Schmitz gives the movie its punch.

This woman's ignorance is what made her. No thoughts, bring her to no regret , no think about what she has done. To break this the protagonist gift her the ability to read, and write, breaking the ignorance came the awareness , this without possibility to fix. So the death. To the protagonist remain the memory and story to tell. In the end he doesn't and has not to forget. As a victim he will remember and tell it to the daughter."

","Can you image the love between a 40 year old woman and a 15 year old boy? It's a bit kinky, isn't it? But it happens in this story. It is Hanna and Michael's special love story in Germany in the 1950s. <br/><br/>How can you describe the chemistry between Hanna and Michael? Hanna seduces Michael. She shows him her naked body and teaches Michael about sex. An interesting aspect of the plot is that Hanna always asks Michael to read books to her. Most scenes in the first half of the movie show Hanna and Michael lying in bed naked while Michael is reading. <br/><br/>It is dramatic that they meet each other again several years later in court. Hanna is the defendant in the trial. She is accused of being a prison guard in Nazi Germany. Michael is a legal intern in the audience. Hanna confesses all the crimes she is accused of and even crimes she did not commit just because she does not want others to know she is illiterate. This is a shame for her! Finally Hanna is sentenced to life imprisonment. Actually Michael could help Hanna to clarify the facts, but he does not. He chooses to keep silent. Maybe Michael feels guilty of his silence. He sends tapes of his voice reading books to Hanna. This gives Hanna the hope and courage to live. She learns how to read and write! She starts to write letters to Michael, but never gets a reply. <br/><br/>Finally they see each other after several years. Hanna is released from prison, but she is already an old lady with grey hair. Her lonely heart needs Michael's love. But this last hope failed. Hanna ends her life in despair.<br/><br/>This is a film full of profound, original and challenging insights. I think the movie reflects the abnormal society in Germany after the Second World War. Perhaps the ""weird"" love and psychology could only happen in an unhealthy society. Kate Winslet portrays a lamentable and impressive Hanna."

"lilianeforever","10","0","0","12 September 2015"," A moving experience
","The Reader is a complex and fascinating tale on love, deceit, guilt, redemption and forgiveness. The film is narrated in the form of flashbacks from Michael Berg, a successful but withdrawn lawyer from West Berlin, struggling to have an emotional relationship with his lover and even his daughter. The first sequence begins with young Michael Berg (played by David Kloss) falling ill on a tramway and being comforted by Hannah (played by Kate Winslet), a tramway worker. After several months in bed, Michael goes back to Hannah flat with some flowers to thank her. As soon as Hannah hears Michael mentioning reading, her predatory behavior kicks in. Young Michael Berg falls prey to a sexual predator, and society fails to take notice.<br/><br/>The seduction scene is extremely disturbing. While Michael undresses, she assures him that she will not look at him ""Don't worry, I won't look!"" yet she does so immediately, to check 'how mature' he is, and see if he can fulfill her needs. Once satisfied with her choice of prey, she begins his 'initiation'. David Kloss was only 18 when filming of the love scenes took place, but he towers well over Kate Winslet, which wrongly gives the impression that the relationship is somehow legal. Michael Berg is 15 and Hannah 36, and pedophilia should be added to her long list of misfits. Yes Michael becomes more confident – I did not think I was good at anything – yet, at the same time, we can see Hannah truly turning into his Alpha and Omega. <br/><br/>Many complain about the length of the love scenes, the sheer amount of them and how detailed they are. But only then can you see how important those moments are to Michael, who is totally in love with Hannah. Those moments are nothing else than wild sex for Hannah, who very carefully controls the how and the when. The long lasting damages inflicted to Michael's psyche are carefully depicted. The final blow comes when Hannah mysteriously disappear one day, leaving Michael heartbroken and scarred for life. <br/><br/>The 'affair' lasted the entire summer and no one in Michael's entourage finds out about it: his parents are clueless, his school friends just notice that ""Michael always leaves early"" and that is it. Once Michael discovers Hannah is gone, he gets back home late and visibly shaken, but no one reacts. His mother serves him dinner and life goes on. Has Michael been failed by his parents? Should they have taken notice of Michael's many transformations during that summer? Or was it more convenient for them to see nothing? Their 'blindness' will define the rest of Michael's life. <br/><br/>In the second part of the movie, Michael Berg is now a 23-years old law student. He is already morphing into a withdrawn individual, interacting with the other student, but not forming any strong bonds with a group or any girl, even though he is very attractive. He enrolls in a seminar focusing on former Nazi camps guards' trial. At the trial opening, he realizes in sheer horror that one of the accused is his former lover. <br/><br/>During Hannah's trial, one of the victims recalls young inmates being selected and nurtured by Hannah and in exchange, they would read to her. Still, despite those attentions, they ultimately all dispatched to the chambers. ""Is that any kinder?"" asks the witness. The revelation is terrible for Michael, as he realizes that he was not special to her, and that he was the latest addition to her collection of readers. He finds out as well, for the first time, that Hannah is illiterate. He has flashbacks memories of all the hints that should have alerted him to that fact, but he never took notice. Maybe he never cared enough to take notice. He was too young but again, is youth, like illiteracy, an excuse? <br/><br/>Hannah, who is too ashamed to reveal her illiteracy, cannot defends herself properly and takes the full blame for the murder of 300 inmates and ends up with a life sentence. Michael, in possession on the information that could have reduced her sentence, decides to remain silent. Was he ashamed of having fallen for a former ruthless Nazi guard? Did he remain silent to conceal the relationship or did he think that she deserved to get a life sentence for her crime? <br/><br/>In the third and final sequence of the movie, we witness Michael going back to his goal in life: reading for Hannah. He records himself reading the books he read for Hannah decades earlier and sends the tapes to her in jail. Is he seeking redemption for having let Hannah down at her trial? He can't help but love her after all these years so he still wants to do something for her, but he cannot bring himself to be with her, still shaken by the horrors he heard at the trial. <br/><br/>After Hannah hangs herself, Michael travels to NY and meet with one of the victim present at the trial, Mathers. For the first time, Michael finally tells someone about the affair and for the first time as well the viewer can see the despair on Michael's face. ""Did she acknowledge the impact she had on your life?"" asks Mathers. ""She did much worse to other people"" answers Michael. This is, in my opinion, Stockholm syndrome at its best. <br/><br/>The movie ends with Michael finally revealing his affair to his daughter. The movie does not explain what he intends to achieve by doing so. He probable does so to seek forgiveness from his daughter for having being a distant father for most of her life. I would suspect this could have the opposite effect on the daughter. I strongly recommend 'The Reader, it is a beautifully made movie, with strong performances from all the actors, especially from Winslet, Kloss and Olin."

","The movie starts and builds itself so very slowly that feels very strange. Also there's the awkward focus transitions between the young and older Michael and also between Michael and Hanna from time to time. But the movie really sets itself up well after a few moments in with those intimate shots. The characters, especially the main characters, are revealed very well by peeling their layers one by one. I like how the movie emphasizes on the characters' flaws, especially their hypocrisy, innocence and their reactions to ordeals, their own or of others they know. The acting overall is a great job indeed. Kate Winslet really depicted the character very nicely. We can really see all Hanna's angles, from her wild adventures with Michael, her firmness to him, but also her powerlessness which she hides from him. David Kross nicely depicted the innocence of a youngster who gradually changes into someone wiser. Ralph Fiennes did also a great job in imparting the emotions on the reading recording scenes and depicting the older Michael's doubts and reluctance toward Hanna."

","So deeply impacting and enthralling that it made me shamefully weep for a NAzi! Isn't that truly art? Displaying the utter destruction of a human via shame and pride. So proud was that character, that in her last day would not fathom letting some kid take care of her in the end. A very strong willed but weak spirited woman. Kate Winslet did an amazing job of being shut down , walled off and dysfunction . Yet she also displayed an innocence and a nativity that would make it clear why she would be drawn to young people as her emotional peers.

","While not the best example of a Holocaust movie, THE READER transcends that by portraying a sensitive and emotionally moving story about a man's relationship with a woman he later finds out was an SS guard. Every aspect of this film was exquisitely put together, from the cinematography to the score, and all of the performances were excellent as well. In particular, Kate Winslet gives a nuanced performance as the former SS guard and Ralph Fiennes is wonderfully understated as Michael Berg (in middle-age), the titular reader. Without giving anything away, the depth of the title's meaning will become apparent about midway through the film. Thematically, it deals with secrecy in relationships and being able to read people. How does a person's past affect perception of them, especially if learned after the fact? Does it change what they mean to us? All of those questions are worth pondering and are dealt with in an interesting way through the lens of the Holocaust. The only issue I took with the film is that towards the end, Michael has a meeting with a survivor who somewhat punishes the audience for feeling any sympathy whatsoever for the woman at the center of the story. Is it right to sympathize with someone who is responsible for horrible things? I'll leave that up for other people to decide. Bottom line, this was a well-produced, finely acted drama that deserved the awards attention that it got."

","It starts in 1995 with Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) as an older successful man. Then it flashes back to 1958 when Michael Berg (David Kross) encounters Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) for the first time. He's a sickly teenager who falls for the older woman. They have a secret love affair where he reads the classics to her. Hanna is given an office job and then she disappears one day. He grows up to be a cold and distant defense lawyer even to his own daughter. As a law student, he finds himself attending the trial of Hanna Schmitz as a Nazi SS guard at Auschwitz who locked 300 prisoners in a church which burns down.<br/><br/>The love affair is slow and at first, I figured this is a slow European story about a love affair. It does turn into much more. I would prefer the love story be trimmed a bit while some re-enactments of the war years could be added. It is a provocative examination of guilt and shame. It lays out the story but not give any easy answers. The performance of Kate Winslet is outstanding. The film definitely gives the audience plenty of time to ruminate on the issues. It probably gives too much time and space. It needs to pick up the pace and force a point of view on the audience. That's why a couple of scenes of the war years would be essential. Although director Stephen Daldry seems set on the unanswered question of the murky morality without the essential scenes."

","Spearheaded by forceful performances, The Reader is a very well-crafted historical drama that succeeds in portraying a story that is provided by very challenging source material, as an incredibly intimate relationship is used to explore the moral and emotional issues that arose in the scope of the Holocaust and its aftermath. Kate Winslet is simply outstanding in her role, and one cannot say enough about the quality of her acting, particularly due to the fact that the character she portrays is very unsympathetic and distant. Interestingly enough, the Holocaust is not placed in the forefront, but is rather maintained as a constant backdrop to the story, which makes for an extremely powerful and riveting viewing experience. The Reader is therefore the type of film that proves very gripping as it takes its audience on an emotional journey, one that has even greater resonance due to its main subject being Germany's postwar guilt."

","My friend recommended this movie. My friend said ""It's about love between a man and woman dealing with the postwar generation."" It shows two kind of completely unrelated topics.

"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","3 May 2014"," Do not judge a book based off its cover. Read deeper. The Reader was indeed a pretty good read. The movie was even better.
","Having both readt the book by Bernhard Schlink and then saw the movie directed by Stephen Daldry. I have to say, both were very sophisticated stories. I found that movie is very close to the source material. Without spoiling too much, it tells the story of Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) a German lawyer who finds out, that the woman, who he had an affair with as a mid-teenager in 1958 is being trialled for war-crimes. He's in conflict with himself over morals, as he doesn't know if he should help the woman, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) or not. Michael realizes that he know a personal secret of Hanna that if revealed, could help her at the trial. He has to make a choice, play Devil's Advocate, and help Hanna due to his blind love for the woman, ignoring the crude facts about her time as a Nazi Guard at Auschwitz concentration camps or allow justice to be served for the benefits of the Holocaust victims involved. While, Ralph Fiennes isn't in the film, much. He does bring his A-game to the part. Most of the film has Michael Berg being played by David Kross, who plays the young Michael in all the flashbacks, who received much praise for his performance. The one person who really deserve praise, is Kate Winslet as Hanna. You can see her deliver lines with such stubbornness, and pride. She also can be charming, but a bit crude, at moments. She really pulls off the complex character, well. She really did deserve the Academy Award for Best Actress that year. I didn't mind the German accents. It wasn't that bad. The movie mood is a bit dark, and gloomy for the casual viewers. There is a double standard here with the sympathy the movie put on Hanna. I doubt if the film had a male SS guard who committed wartime atrocities, escaped justice for more than 20 years afterwards, and engaged in a borderline-abusive relationship with an underaged girl. It would be hard to pull off. Honestly, it's hard to feel sympathy for Hanna. I really doubt a lot of people wanted to feel sorry about a cold and unsympathetic Nazi. The ending was a bit awkward. I thought it would ended better if Michael didn't do to New York. Honestly, it's not one of those entertaining type movies. I think the sex scenes were alright. It portray sex as what it is. Romantic at times, awkward sometimes, and brutal at others. One thing, it fail to portray is the age different. It supposed to feel disturbing due to the fact that he's underage, but it doesn't. You never see that, as David Cross looks way older than 15 year old, and Hanna is somewhat of an attraction age. It was too tastefully done. Another fault is that the novel portrayed Hanna's illiteracy as a metaphor for generational illiteracy about the Holocaust, the film failed to convey those thematic overtones. Germany was a rather literate country in the 1930s and 1940s - and I don't think it explains very well people's willingness to join a group to slaughter people. After all, the Nazism weren't all un-education bigots. Many of them were doctors, scientist, teachers, and scholars. Most join because of self-worth and survivable. Many of them felt that they got wrong, over the loss of WWI and looking for revenge. I don't see why the Germans born after World War 2 have to feel guilty for their fore-fathers mistakes. It's like saying all Modern Americans should feel guilty for allowing slavery to happen in the past. Yes, its sucks that it happen, but they weren't even alive, during those events. The only person that should feel guilty for it, is those who live during the World War 2 timeline and knew about it, and didn't do anything to stop it. The movie feels like one big Vergangenheitsbewältigung guilt trip, anyways. Also the movie fails to portray the 1980s in the film. It felt like it was present day. There were some different in the film from the book. In the book, Michael contracts hepatitis and misses 3 months of school. In the movie he has scarlet fever. I guess, the sex scenes wouldn't be appealing to watch if he know that he has hepatitis. Another thing, missing is young Michael getting advice from his father. It really was needed to tie in the story of life with his normal family, and his life with Hanna. Overall: it was the complexity of human morality that made this watchable. Other than that, it wouldn't be that good."

","At the time of it's release The Reader caused considerable controversy which clouded its qualities. Everyone was upset about nudity and sex, as well as the alleged glorification of the Nazis, yet little has been said about the qualities of the movie. The advantage of writing this review today is that we can take a step back and talk about the movie itself.<br/><br/>In my opinion, The Reader is an exploration of guilt and shame. It addresses the situation in which any of us might think what we should or shouldn't have done. Given the historical context, namely Second World War in Germany, this becomes a potent dilemma to ponder over.<br/><br/>A considerable part of the cast plays SS-personnel and shows them as they were: Ordinary people who made their choices under extraordinary circumstances. Obviously they haven't chosen wisely. But it is worthy mentioning that the victors write the history. Had Germany won, the SS-members would have been the heroes of the fatherland. So their choice was partially a gamble which didn't pay out.<br/><br/>But there is another plot line. The main character in his youth meets a lady and they engage in a sexual relationship. From today's perspective the lady would have been exposed as a child molester. However, after WWII there has been a shortage of men in all countries involved, a fact that helps understand this escapade.<br/><br/>The cast delivers a solid performance. Overall, this is an excellent movie."

","The Reader is a powerful film that delivers a gut-wrenching story and some powerful acting. This was the film that gave Kate Winslet her long overdue Oscar and boy did she ever deserve it. This film has many themes including eroticism, love, and friendship. This movie is simply not meant to be a tearjerker, but don't be surprised if you feel a tear or two.<br/><br/>Stephen Daldry's film is set in two phases. The first phase is a tale of romance that blossoms between a 15-year-old boy and a 36-year-old woman. The next phase is a gut-wrenching court case involving the woman, Hanna as one of the defendants for taking part in some heinous crimes as a member of the SS.<br/><br/>The acting is very, very powerful. Kate Winslet delivers a masterful performance and you can't expect more out of her. Her facial expressions and cold, stern manner truly defines the hardness of her character. Ralph Fiennes does a solid job as the older Michael Berg whilst the guy who played the younger Berg was so-so.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film that will surely wrench your gut. The final hour is very hard to watch as we a submission to guilt and how it affects the love between two people. This film is well-acted and they story is well-written. Despite Kate Winslet's bravo performance, it's really hard to sympathize with her character because of the crimes she performed. This is one powerful film. I rate this film 9/10."

It is true that the pictures of this movie are so beautiful. The views of the streets are the very European ones and I was enchanted with them. However, the pity point is this movie is that the scene of this movie is located in German, the characters speak English and call their names in English pronunciation. I want it to be unified. <br/><br/>Second, I do not like the personality of Michel.

The man in the story was torn between them and it gives us a inside look at a dilemma that any person faces at some times of his/her life.<br/><br/>This movie is driven by two individual performances- Kate Winslet and David Kross. Kate Winslet gave probably her best performance to date. She did complete justice to the character Hanna Schmitz. It was one of those performances that takes a character to new height. David Kross, though very young, gave an outstanding performance as young Michael Berg. Also Ralph Fiennes portrayed the despair in Michael's character brilliantly. Lena Olin ,even with a cameo role, gave a memorable performance.<br/><br/>My only complain is that the transition of story shown in the movie was too irregular.

","This is one of those times where I'm kind of at a loss for words (or as much as I can be). I don't know what it was specifically, but I can't seem to put a finger on why this movie had no effect on me. It has all the right elements for stirring things up emotionally: a forbidden love affair, dark secrets, the Holocaust...and yet for the most of the film, I remained relatively detached.<br/><br/>The Reader tells the story of a summer love affair between Michael Berg, a high school student and Hanna Schmitz, a woman twice his age who works as a tram conductor in Neustadt, Germany. Throughout the affair, Hanna requests that Michael to read aloud to her and mesmerized by his current circumstance, he willingly obliges. Then one day he arrives at her apartment to find it empty and Hanna gone without a word.<br/><br/>Eight years later, Michael is attending the Nazi War Crimes Trials as a law student and is floored as Hanna has re-entered his life as a defendant in the case (the theatrical previews show this so I'm not giving anything away).<br/><br/>There are some great conversations between the students and their professor in regards to the difference between guilt according to the law and guilt according to morality and David Kross does an exceptional job conveying the mangled and conflicted heartache seeing her in this revealing light, but I'm beginning to realize that my problem was ultimately with Hanna's character. Maybe I wasn't invested enough in their relationship or maybe it was the way Hanna was written, but I just could not wrap my head around it. She comes off like a genuinely clueless simpleton during the trial but in earlier scenes she is fierce, manipulative and strong.<br/><br/>A couple of the tag-lines for the film are ""Unlock the mystery"" and ""How far would you go to keep a secret?"" I didn't feel that the mystery was too...well...mysterious and I didn't believe, as a plot device, it really held the weight that brought these two worlds crashing down.<br/><br/>This role earned Kate Winslet her sixth Academy Award nomination. A friend of mine was confused as to why she was nominated for The Reader instead of Revolutionary Road, but I have a feeling that in order to prevent a split in the votes and potentially missing a nomination in the Best Actress category altogether, she submitted herself for only one role.<br/><br/>I love her and think she should already have an Oscar in the bag from previous roles, but it would be hypocritical of me to say that anybody should win based on a body of work. I know people feel differently and I don't think they're wrong. It's just my belief that each year should be a clean slate and you should be awarded that year for the specific role you are nominated for. I think the Oscars should be like any sporting event: One team against the other and the outcome is based on the performance during that specific match-up despite a winning or losing record.<br/><br/>However, the Oscars are determined by a group of people and not by goals, touchdowns, runs, or three-pointers. If Kate Winslet does win, even though this wasn't my favorite role of hers by far, my human side will be thrilled... even if my critical side will still be at a bit of a loss."

","I watched ,""The Reader"",last night and really enjoyed it. I thought that it was an intelligent screenplay and a wonderful cast ironically with the exception of Oscar winner Kate Winslet. Her performance was not bad enough to unbalance the film but she really was not a great choice for the main part.Crucially the plot needed her to mirror the complexity of the situation.Instead her German accent was weak, her range was limited and made it impossible to have any empathy for her.For the love story of the film to make any sense she need to be erotic and show love for Michael. The missing scenes were of the actually events for which she was being charged. No burning barn,no executions.No space for those who actually suffered at her hands."

"aelaycock","8","0","0","17 January 2012"," A superior Oscar-garnished love story exploring difficult issues
","""The reader"" is a dark fable from post-war Germany, which asks - but fails to answer - some searching questions about individual and collective guilt, selfishness and kindness. Maybe such questions are ultimately unanswerable, but they have to be asked. It is also a deeply touching love story, beautifully constructed and acted from the start.<br/><br/>A troubled middle-aged barrister, Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) reflects on his 15-year old self (David Kross), and the affair that lit up his life in dour, rain-soaked, 50s Berlin. During a tram journey he becomes ill, vomiting in an alley; and a stranger (Kate Winslet) cleans him up and helps him home. After recovering from a long illness he returns with flowers to her poky little flat. A central feature of the flat is a bathtub, fuelled by coal. He sees her bathing, and becomes obsessed with the woman - who is obviously much older - and visits her again. He himself is a charming, well-educated, popular and handsome young man. After helping her with bags of coal, he is persuaded to take a bath, whereupon she secretly observes his naked body, then seduces him. So begins their brief encounter – a strange but tender one, which involves him reading to her in between bouts of bathing and of course lovemaking. There is nothing pornographic about the sex, but it is intensely erotic with Winslet's womanly figure against Kross's toned youthful body. I don't know whether Kate used a body double, but it certainly doesn't appear so. He reads all sorts of things – Mark Twain, Chekhov, Tintin comics, even erotica (which she pretends to disapprove of). The odd thing is that she herself never reads the books, indeed she seems totally uninterested in books as objects. He knows nothing about this solitary woman except her name, Hanna; she neither knows nor cares anything for his background. She has set strict boundaries to their relationship. Yet she becomes the gravitational centre of his universe, as she is the centre of the whole movie. He discovers she is a tram conductor, and he tries to meet her on a tram. This triggers a row in which she shows her cold, cruel side. But they go on an idyllic bicycle tour, and fetch up at a country church where children are singing some sublime choral music. She looks at him with tears streaming down her face, clearly she has an innate ability to respond to great art. But there is something deeper about her response. The church itself is significant in some way. In a rare scene involving herself without him, she is offered promotion to an office job. Strangely this triggers an exodus, she packs her bags and leaves. Some observant viewers may already guess what's going on. When he discovers the empty flat, Michael is devastated.<br/><br/>We move to the middle part of the film, with our hero a law student (still played by David Kross). He has lost some of his jaunty disposition, having been deeply affected by Hanna's abandonment of him. As part of his studies he attends a war crimes trial, where he is shocked to learn that his former lover is up on trial for crimes against humanity, committed as an SS Guard. This is where, to avoid spoilers, we have to leave this absorbing story.<br/><br/>Please watch this film. I believe this film throws up some intriguing moral points which deserve reflection on the part of the viewer. Of course points about retribution and mercy, but also about the ageing process, remorse, the role of literacy in our society. A modern, humane Germany coming to terms with its brutal past. This may be the first time we have seen a sympathetic portrait of a full-on Nazi war criminal other than Hitler himself. The film is visually superior, realistically re-creating scenes from the recent history of Germany, from wet Berlin to the sunny countryside. David Kross is outstanding as the young student, so eager to shed his virginity but in much deeper than he can imagine. Yes, the film has flaws. The conceit of making the actors speak English with a German accent is almost laughable these days. There is some unconvincing stuff which tries to establish the Fiennes character in a domestic and work context. I'm not entirely convinced by Ralph Fiennes himself – so perfect in ""The English patient"". Physiologically he is so different from David Kross that we can't make a proper connection between the two. Fiennes is too melancholy and urbane. Maybe a better alternative would have been to use makeup and prosthetics to age Kross. After all, they did a superb job with Kate Winslet. And that brings me to the huge central performance – that of Winslet herself. She bravely shows everything that is required of this character – a deeply flawed psyche, beauty, intense sexuality, vulnerability. But also coldness, cruelty, ultimately an unknowable human being. I can visualise her face during the trial - lonely, puzzled, hopeless, but still beautiful. I can't praise her performance enough, it is utterly haunting, and well deserving of the Oscar she received."

","This film is in many ways a drama that concerns us all because we produced the situation that prevailed after the victory/defeat of 1945.<br/><br/>All Germans are responsible either because they voted for Hitler or because they were not able to unify against Hitler, thus enabling him to seize power with one third of the votes. Then you had the simple workers, employees and farmers who were hanged when trying to be trade-unionists, or deported. Everyone knew what it meant, saw the crimes and smelled the smoke.<br/><br/>Then you had the middle and upper middle class, the university professors and intellectuals, the doctors and surgeons, the lawyers and judges who all decided that justice was the implementation of the law of the moment, hence of Hitler's law, and then in 1945 of the law imposed by the US or the USSR. The father and mother of the main male character are such people.<br/><br/>Then you had those who came of age before the end of the war and got into it, including into the SS, like Günther Grass. They took part in the atrocities, including Auschwitz, which is the case of the main female character. The liaison between the two main characters does not change one iota to that fact.<br/><br/>Justice in that case cannot be only the retribution of a crime. It has to make sure the criminals they convict and sentence are really the authors of the acts that are brought against them. And in that case it is not true and the main male hero who is a law student when the trial takes place does not provide justice with what he knows, and that is a crime too.<br/><br/>Three hundred people were burnt to death in a church whose doors had been locked and were not unlocked under the responsibility of six female SS. The problem for the court is to find out who is the leader of these six SS women. They satisfy themselves with the fact that the main female character acknowledges she wrote the report that was signed by the six women; that the five other women accuse this one to be the author. But they do not check if this woman can write. They assume she can. But she can't. The real leader of the six, the one who wrote the report is one of the five other women who was very lightly sentenced.<br/><br/>But the main male character, and his law professor, does not do what he should have done: tell the court what he knew, that she was illiterate and that the sentence was a miscarriage of justice. Then later he will entertain a relation with her via mail only and cassettes since she could not read or write, without seeing that it was cruel since that amounted to reminding her of what must have been her only happy moment in her life, that three or four month long affair with him. And never, even after her suicide in prison before leaving, will he tell.<br/><br/>That's not justice, that's vengeance and what's more blind or blinded vengeance. Justice was blindfolded on that occasion. The judges should have made sure but they assumed that one of Hitler's achievements, literacy for all, was true, in other words they did not do their job properly.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","People will think The Reader is another holocaust story. Granted some areas of this film are based around it but it is the deeper subtext of this film and the questions it asks us that take it in another direction entirely. This film intends to show that not everyone involved was a monster.<br/><br/>We start with a middle aged Michael (Ralph Fiennes) preparing to meet with his daughter. He seems to be holding a secret. A secret he takes us on in his mind. We transport back to the fifties where Michael (now played by David Kroos) is eighteen and throwing up in the street. He is helped by a thirty year old woman, Hanna Schmitz (Winslet) who cleans up his mess and gets him home. When Michael is finally better he visits Hanna with a bunch of flowers to say thank you. Within minutes he realises that she is a secretive woman albeit seductive and when he spots her getting changed he finds himself swelling up and leaving. Of course he goes back, Hanna has left a lasting impression in a matter of minutes and upon his arrival an affair triggers. One which must be kept secret. Hanna blows hot and cold with a young naïve Michael, where all he wants to do is fall in love she seems to just want sex. She shows her distance when it takes the third time they sleep together before she tells him her name. As well as sex Hanna asks Michael to read to her, refusing to read anything himself. Over a summer the couple hold a steamy affair involving reading and sex, distancing Michael from the things an eighteen year old should be doing. Hanna begins to realise this and disappears leaving Michael distraught and wandering who this woman really was.<br/><br/>Years later he is attending law school. The class sit in on a war crime trial of six guards who would select people for death at Auschwitz. To Michael's horror he sees that Hanna is one of the guards on trial and that her distance and secrets were of her past but that isn't entirely accurate. Eventually Michael works out her secret and knowing it could help her in the trial he must decide whether this secret will bring justice to her victims.<br/><br/>Michael still beats himself up over his choices and still in his fifties he finds himself writing and taping himself reading books for Hanna's benefit as she rots in prison. He can't seem to see evil in her.<br/><br/>The film ranges from a love story, to a political drama, to a war-crime holocaust piece to a non linear grudge story. It never seems to really settle on a genre and as we go through we change into different tones. The film starts great and continues well when we find out Hanna's secret. Although the secret becomes a twist to the film it seems to be very minimal for the circumstances this woman finds herself in. The secret could lighten her sentencing but instead she would rather not be ashamed. The only way I can see through this is as if she realises the pain she has caused and believes she should be punished.<br/><br/>The Reader does show the holocaust in a different way. We see it from this woman who is not particularly evil but of one following orders and her job. She is deemed as bad as every other soldier involved and that's where the differences is, we strangely sympathise with her when really we shouldn't. She even says to the judge, 'what would you have done?', when he asks if she was involved in the selection of people next in line for the chamber. Not giving her an excuse but it shows how several people chose to dust the occurrences under the carpet in order to continue with life.<br/><br/>Many will find this a little off putting as no one wants to give sympathy to the criminals during the holocaust but the film has a lot of subtext which go deeper. It's all about secrets. The affair is a secret for starters, at only eighteen Michael can't tell his parents he is sleeping with a thirty year old woman and it is something she also wants to keep hidden. Also the secret which he knows can get her off the hook. Does he reveal it or doesn't he? The film is about false love, false hope and choices. The choices we make that define a person and a generation and this film shows how different generations attempt to understand each other. <br/><br/>The acting is great, the young Kroos and Winslet hold great chemistry with an erratic relationship and Ralph Fiennes comes in to add an emotional edge in the last forty minutes. His first meet with Winslet after years is sad and perfectly acted from both parties. The cinematography is realistic and believable and really shows a post war Germany as they attempt to cover the cracks and forget the horrific past. I would have liked to have seen it told more linear however as at times it became confusing.<br/><br/>Not the best post war Germany film to be released and also not the best holocaust film but it does force you to ask different questions towards what went on in these times and although it will not change anyone's opinion on what actually happened it may make you start thinking about it much deeper than you did before."

The actors I mentioned gave really good performances. Also praise worthy is Lena Olin both as a mother and daughter survivors of concentration camps. Fine direction by Stephen Daldry of a screenplay by David Hare as adapted from the book by Bernhard Schlink.

"JohnRayPeterson","9","0","0","25 September 2011"," Winslet unequal play of an emotional fortress. Gripping
","After acquainting myself with writer David Hare in a recent movie review (Page Eight), I naturally was drawn to this movie because it was an adaptation of an award winning novel by Bernhard Schlink. I was a little surprised that it was not a movie I had considered watching before; it won Kate Winslet an Oscar for best actress,the film countless other awards as well as nominations and good to very good ratings from my usual sources. Why had I skipped it? Ah! It was the storyline I had difficulty with. Stories which deal directly or indirectly with WWII events are always a tough read for me and harder to view still. So with a healthy dose apprehension, I started watching it.<br/><br/>The IMDb storyline sufficiently describes the plot without spoiling the heart of the story. Keep in mind that as with the book, the movie has three parts, the first two brilliantly setting the stage for the last part. I was fascinated by Hanna's character, played by Winslet; it is a role I can compare to no other I know. That sort of thing appeals to me. Winslet manages to keep you guessing and wondering about her character. The role is not, I repeat not, endearing but it is captivating. The writers built in the character an emotional fortress we simply cannot break through yet persist in trying, right to the very end. Winslet certainly deserved her Oscar.<br/><br/>Then there's the role of Michael Berg, played by Ralph Fiennes and by David Kross (young Michael Berg). They both did excellent, conveying the emotions we could, in this character understand clearly and through which we vicariously try to unravel the mystery that is Hanna. Hanna and Michael's affair is sensuous, raw and extremely well presented; it is not a romantic passage though. Inevitably, there is a short passage where Michael Berg visits a concentration camp; the brief and eerie moment emotionally hits you like an unexpected kick in the groin. The movie is slightly over two hours long and you need every minute to take it all in. The direction by Stephen Daldry is a fine style example of how to hold back in order to project more strongly; the movie will feel cold but you will not."

That's... not romance LOL that's puberty, lust, whatever you name it... women provided sex, boy was there to take it. He needed her as much as he needed sex. That's OK, now, when she leaves, is he devastated for life? Or later on he was upset because she was SS?<br/><br/>Later when he's in law school, he keeps doing all those ""OMG she's SS"" faces throughout the trial... now what was that really that he was feeling? Was it ""OMG I shagged an SS guard!""? Or maybe ""OMG I gotta do something!""? Or maybe ""OMG It's the 13th trial session and I still can't get over this! OMG again!""? Or even just ""OMG""?<br/><br/>Then he goes to talk to her and gives up. Was he still mad at her? Was he ashamed of talking to her? Was he trying to preserve her dignity? After all, he wasn't meddling in the trial, he was merely talking to her about it... there was nothing bad about even visiting her.<br/><br/>Alright, then he says nothing, woman goes to prison for 20 years, and then he goes to visit her. He goes all cold, trying to teach her some morality or something in the dinning room... what was that? Was Michael really that shallow and childish as to be mad about her for being an SS guard in a time of war? Or was he still mad, which wouldn't make sense, she was just a shag, he was even looking at the other girls, they're ""romance"" wouldn't last long...<br/><br/>I bet the book makes a lot more sense, because the movie just didn't cut it."

","Based on a German novel by Bernhard Schlink, The Reader was turned into an British film, directed by Stephen Daldry of Billy Elliot and The Hours fame, adapted by David Hare (The Hours) and stars Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>Michael Berg (David Kross) is a 15-year-old living in 1958 who has Scarlett Fever. A train conductor, Hanna Schmidt (Winslet) helps him out and after he thanks her starts to have an affair with the older woman. Their relationship is cemented by Michael reading anything classic novels to Tintin comics to her. But after their relationship breaks down, Michael becomes a Law student at Heidelberg University, but when studying German War Guilt and see a war crimes trial he see that Hanna use to be a SS guard. What is made even worst is she is being made a scapegoat by the other guards for a massacre during a death march. Michael is left with a choice to relieve Hanna's secret to save her from a long prison sentence.<br/><br/>The Reader was a film that was obviously made with the Award bodies in mind and its main strength is its actors. The Reader does have an excellent cast, Winslet got to win her first Oscar, Fiennes is pretty much great in anything he does and the young Kross shows great promise, giving a believable performance as a young man ending up in a relationship with a older woman and how he would act and the decision he has to face. The main three actors are very natural in their roles even though it is a little weird that some actors speaking with German accents and others with English ones. There are also very well supported by other actors in the movie, from the likes of Bruno Ganz and Karoline Herfurth.<br/><br/>There are mentions of ideas of German war guilt and personal guilt with the SS guards trying to avoid their own collective guilt placing it all on one person. But the main story is about Michael and Hanna and their relationship, from the early, almost stalker like start to its evolution to a sexual relationship and its aftermath. Michael is continually drawn to her in some form, but also wants to keep his distances. It is a complex relationship and you could easily argue that Michael should have told her secret. But in the past Hanna was quiet a cold and manipulative, she is not that nice of a person so it is no wonder that their relationship breaks down. They are complex characters.<br/><br/>The direction by Stephen Daldry is standard, nothing stylist but the period details are well captured and he knows how to move the film along. It is a tender sort of film, look at human emotion and a social drama. It is certainly a well made film and Daldry just wanted everything to grow slowly, trying to be as real as possible, though some things are a bit of a stretch."

"Eternality","5","0","0","20 May 2011"," The Reader is an undeserving Best Picture nominee.
","In years to come, The Reader would not only be remembered as one of the most overrated and least deserving films ever to be nominated for a Best Picture, but also as the film that denied Christopher Nolan's unparalleled superhero epic, The Dark Knight, a chance for a shot at Oscar glory. In fact, there are many other films that are superior to The Reader: Clint Eastwood's Changeling, Thomas McCarthy's The Visitor, and John Patrick Shanley's Doubt are some worthy examples that should have been considered if the Academy had foolishly decided against The Dark Knight. <br/><br/>The Reader is directed by Oscar-nominated British director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot, The Hours) and stars Kate Winslet in one of her most challenging roles to date. She plays Hanna Schmitz, an ex-Nazi guard during the Holocaust who now plies her trade as a train ticket collector. One day, she encounters an ill teenage boy Michael Berg (played by David Kross) near her home and decides to temporarily care for him. After a few meetings at her home, a torrid affair blossoms between them. Hanna does not know how to read and write; so apart from sex, Michael often reads books to her. However, the affair is shortlived when Hanna suddenly leaves town, leaving a heartbroken Michael in her wake. This is essentially the crux of the first third of the film. <br/><br/>The second and final third of the film revolves around a war crime trial (where the two meet again in the courtroom) and Hanna serving her life sentence (and growing old) in prison respectively. While the copious nudity and numerous sex scenes involving Winslet and Kross in the first third serve as a tantalizing appetizer, what comes thereafter in the remainder of the film lacks sustainability in what is a straightforward and predictable narrative that is as inspiring as a dead fish. The direction by Daldry is dull and almost lifeless. As a result, The Reader moves like a tepid game of chess between two uninterested opponents. Furthermore, the film lacks focus with back-and-forth timeline shifts that are more distracting than informative. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes plays an adult Michael, whose screen-time is not sufficient to fully realize his role, thus giving a poor and flawed young-to-old transition of the character that viewers will find hard to care. Fortunately, Winslet's character does not stray the course. Thanks to some impressive makeup, Hanna remains emotionally and physically believable. Winslet will probably win her first Oscar for this but that does not make The Reader a must-watch. It is anything but. <br/><br/>GRADE: C- (5.5/10 or 2.5 stars)"

","The Reader is a classic existential story of how people are unable to accept the morality and consequences of their decisions as they seek the truth about themselves. Hannah has moved on in her life from being a Nazi prisoner guard and has drifted into normal post-war Germany life, leaving behind a past without confronting the inhumanity of her actions. Her search for the truth about her actions doesn't begin until her trial for war crimes leads to her conviction in the deaths by fire of prisoners she was guarding. At trial, she defends her actions as just carrying out her guard duties as directed by the SS. Were she to let the prisoners out of the burning building, in her eyes, she would be guilty of dereliction of duty. As the trial proceeds, she gradually comes to realize the scope of her crimes and accepts a longer sentence than her co-defendants; she acknowledges writing a summary report of the incident for her SS superiors, while in fact, she is illiterate. She chooses a long prison term because she finally realizes the scope of her crimes. She is overwhelmed with guilt and believes that she doesn't belong among her fellow Germans.<br/><br/>Her young lover, Michael, is on a parallel course, unable to deal with his past, as Hannah's lover. He too is prevented from reaching the truth due to guilt and fear of adverse social reactions by his peers.. As a law student observing the trial, he remains silent rather that provide exculpatory information as to Hannah's inability to read or write. He leaves the courtroom knowing he could have shortened her prison sentence by 15 years.<br/><br/>In the end, neither character can accept their circumstances. He can't bring himself to treat her with compassion, after being her only friend during her 20 years in prison. He can't overcome the guilt he feels about being her lover and his cowardice at her trial. During their final encounter just prior to her scheduled release, she recognizes there is no future for her outside of prison because even Michael doesn't want to be near her. Suicide is the only release from her emotional misery."
"madcardinal","9","0","0","21 April 2011"," And the Award For Best Performance in This Film Goes to . . . David Kross
","An ambitious work of art, ""The Reader"" nearly matches the very high achievement of the novel on which it is based. There is no syrupy, Disney-style distortion of real life; nor will you have to endure the usual Hollywood pandering to pressure groups - no tired prudery masquerading as pseudo-raciness in this film. Simply put, the honest, forthright portrayal of a beautiful, terrible and heart-wrenching love story is a godsend for those used to the dishonest babble of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet does a fine job of portraying Hanna, both as a seductive train conductor in her thirties and as an older woman wasting away in prison. David Kross's performance as young Michael, however, is slightly superior to Winslet's. When it comes to young male performers, forget the insipid silliness of Zac Efron and Jesse McCartney. Kross is not a hollow piece of eye candy, but a young man of substance who courageously dedicates his body and his considerable acting skills to his craft. He is especially good in the scene where he reads ""Huckleberry Finn"" to Winslet.<br/><br/>To its credit, ""The Reader"" does not shy away from the negative after-effects Michael struggles with when dealing with his cub-cougar relationship with Hanna. Regarding the Holocaust, when Hanna asks the judge a pointed, naive question, we are forced to consider the role self-preservation and human frailty play in the face of overarching, domineering evil.<br/><br/>This movie easily surpasses some films frequently listed by critics as among the greatest of all time. Off the top of my head, ""The Reader"" is superior to ""The Searchers"" and ""Midnight Cowboy"" by a good margin. It contains some of the finest love scenes ever filmed, and the scene in which Hanna washes Michael while they're both standing is one of the most poignant, beautiful depictions of the male body in all of cinema. ""The Reader"" deserves the highest recommendation, and all adults should make time to view it except, perhaps, for those who have an aversion to the sight of the human body."

","This, in essence, is a simple story told in a very matter of fact manner that doesn't insult the viewers intelligence. From the opening to the scene it is spellbinding stuff and if the viewer were to watch the film for what it is, which is a coming of age romance with an emotionally stunted woman who has somewhat lost her humanity, and that includes the losing the emotion of love, then it is indeed a brilliantly told film. What makes this film so emotive is the subject matter that resonates most of the way through the film, namely the holocaust. The film doesn't pretend that this is secondary in any way shape or form, it's just that the main story is of two people, one lady, who has lost her way in life in terms of emotions and primarily one boy (often referred to as 'kid' by the older lady).<br/><br/>As much as the holocaust and anything associated with it sickens the senses, the fact that it is one of the subject matters of this film associated with one of the leading characters doesn't necessarily mean this need be considered a holocaust movie - in fact it's not! The subject of the holocaust is respectfully dealt with and I think they've done a good job with the subject matter.<br/><br/>In fact, I really enjoyed this film and it was a joy for me not have all the buttons pushed when they could so easily have gone that way.<br/><br/>All in all, watch it folks, if you love movies I think you'll love this for what it is!"

","""The reader"" is one of the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. Michael is a 15 years old student who meet a mysterious woman,Hanna, older than him.They begin a secret affair. Hanna likes to be read aloud while Michael discovers his sexuality as Hanna teaches him how to approach. But Hanna mysteriously disappears. He encounters his lover many years later on trial for Nazi crime charges. The difference of age between Hanna (can she be considered pedophile?) and Michael is an original metaphor to describe the different generations-the former that witnessed the Nazis committing terrible persecution towards the Jews and did nothing to prevent it and ,in many cases, supported actively their actions;the latter that had to relate with this crucial,yet difficult to accept,period. Plus,it is not a traumatizing turn to discover that a person you loved is not only a former Nazi guard but she played an active role by killing innocent people like did Hanna?Hanna is manipulative but with Michael she becomes more human-a humanity she never had. The secret Hanna holds is not only her active part in a crime but the shame of being illiterate which she considers the worst.So an education can make a person wiser and change the course of his life?But although she is perfectly aware to take part of a brutal massacre she could not be seen as a supporter of the Nazi propaganda because she has not political ideology being herself an illiterate woman. The movie stimulates all those questions and manages to depict all of them with a good sense of balance,in the typical delicate but yet competent way of Stephen Daldry. He avoids exaggerations leaving the single person to develop his own point of view.The direction was really marvelous , a proof of Daldry's abilities. The actors play extremely well.Kate Winslet is mesmerizing as always and shows abilities never seen before and her Oscar award for Best Actress is completely deserved.She gave a devastating performance as a former Nazi guard and her face communicates the illogical and cold mind of the illiterate woman.David Kross is truly fantastic, a revelation.He should have been nominated as well. Ralph Fiennes is good (but for the given screen time not so impressive like Winslet and Kross).The supporting cast(Lena Olin and Bruno Ganz)is excellent. The pace of the movie is quite slow.Simply one of the best of the year.My vote is 8/10 ."

","The heart of this film is in the title--""The Reader."" If you're looking for a Holocaust picture, this really is not it, but it's mentioned. If you're looking for a period film, NOT THIS, it covers every decade from the 50's to the 90's. It's a movie hard to categorize other than ""astonishing depth"" for looking deeply into the psychological make-up of several leading characters. The activity of ""the reader"" at different segments of Hanna's life helps makes this story so intriguing.<br/><br/>It begins with a teenage Michael Berg (David Kross) becoming ill in the alley and an mid-30's, Hanna, helps him home. This chance meeting sparks an affair. Hanna (Kate Winslet, ""Titanic"") shares her body in trade for Michael reading to her. The affair ends suddenly, but not in the heart and mind of Michael.<br/><br/>The movie travels 5 decades. An early 90's decade scene has older Michael (Ralph Fiennes) planning to meet with his daughter. Michael is obviously troubled, struggling within himself, but why? The movie tell WHY! It tells of multiple relationships with ""The Reader."" Kate Winslet's performance is the driving force and success to this thought stimulating story. It's why she won the Oscar and many other awards for her role in ""The Reader."" She stated in the bonus material, ""It (this film) doesn't answer any questions."" Another great summary line from the screenplay writer (David Hare), ""How do you live in the shadow of one of the greatest crimes in human history?"" ""The Reader"" asks questions, but lets the viewer think of possible answers, or why? After watching during an evening, my night was filled with pondering, dreaming, and my own inward struggle dealing with the issues of the film's main characters. This movie does that to you. Not exactly entertaining, but surely and hugely thought provoking. Call it a ""sort of"" masterpiece."

","Who knew that a film called 'The Reader' would be a controversial film about paedophilia in post Nazi Germany. I suppose its like being surprised that 'The English Patient' isn't completely shot in a hospital. I'm a big fan of Ralph Feinnes, I may never have watched this film if he wasn't in it. I mean seriously it's called 'The Reader' - reading is not the most stimulating of activities when you're doing it so why make a blockbuster about someone else doing it!? But wrong I was, this is the most gut wrenching, thought provoking roller-coaster I have watched this year. It tackles two of the most sensitive topics imaginable with a completely unbiased brush only bent on telling a compelling and emotional story. If you like that sort of cold-but-true Ralph Feinnes film where nobody really conveys emotion but the emotions that are implied rip you out of your seat then you will love this film. Not much here for people that don't like romantic dramas but so much for people that do! The TV guide listed this as 'the performance of winslets career' and that is completely correct, immediately you're not looking at the lady that was in Titanic any more, she blows you out of the water. No bad acting all round really but everyone else has a pretty easy ride compared to winslets character."

","The novel left me really completely cold, perhaps because at the time everyone was raving about it. I found it too moralizing, slow and poorly written. The most important thing about the book was the story itself. This is why I loved the film. It is very visual, I find the narrative very well transported to the visual media and the dialogues are great. I find the portrayals of young Michael sublime and Winslet is also perfect for the role of Hannah. Not being German, but speaking the language I somehow felt the whole time it's wrong the film is made in English and that it should be in German, probably also because the photography is very European. It feels like a German film which is in this case a good quality."

","Although it wasn't powerful or riveting as I thought it would be, it's still a alright film. Ralph Fiennes, David Kross, and Kate Winslet was perfect for there roles, especially Kate and glad they didn't cast her role with some other actress. The film has to do with a boy reading to a grown woman and build a relationship because of it and crimes committed during Nazi occupation that comes back, for redemption although Kate Winslet's character didn't seem to feel much guilt for most part. Like she said, she was only following orders, plus others that were involved much more gets off with a way lighter sentence. And during Kate Winslet's characters prison term is when Ralph Fiennes becomes her reader once again, and helps her through the time she has left behind bars. The movies has some wonderful moments, but a it's a very slow paced film to the point it can get a big annoying sometimes, and parts of it seem to drag on and on.

","Fancy a heartbreak? Watch this film.<br/><br/>Michael is a successful middle-aged lawyer with a restless personal life. He remembers his teenage youth when he met and had a short but passionate affair with his first love - a simple older woman who was living an orderly, dutiful but reclusive life. The age difference could be disturbing to some, but I think the woman being full of repressed feelings and individuality, she was on a similar emotional level as our teenage boy and used her sexual energy to experience some freedom through ecstasy.<br/><br/>For pretty obvious reasons (to the viewer), she asks Michael to read books to her out loud. She is so keen to keep this particular reason a secret that she even causes great harm to herself protecting it.<br/><br/>I know I'm talking in sign language here, but don't wanna spoil the story. So I'll end by saying that it really is worth watching. A tale about how sometimes doing your 'duty' for the lunatic people that run your country will be considered evil by later generations. A tale about a good man's inability to empathise and forgive. A tale about a good woman having her heart broken - not by the generation that had no mercy on her, but by the man that she had grown to believe in."

Kate Winslet is wonderful and she is not shy to play the role of a mature woman. David Kross is fascinating to watch transform from boy to man. Ralph Fiennes...what can I say...he blew me away! Some people may not like the idea of a younger boy and and older woman relationship, but I think that in such times and circumstances humans seek others like moths seek a flame.

","Yes it is. It is also a very decent film, and I can't see why it attracted so much criticism upon its release. Unfortunately films to do with the holocaust don't seem to go down well with our European neighbours, and I sense that it is something that they would rather forget.<br/><br/>Fortunately or unfortunately this is exactly the type of film which always seems to get all the armchair amateur arty philosophers discussing the meaning of life for hours. Guys, it is just a film, a good one but just a film nevertheless.<br/><br/>I thought the film was a little bit too long and the middle part could have been shortened slightly.<br/><br/>Up until seeing this film recently on DVD I had never been a massive fan of Kate Winslet, not from Titanic onwards, but in this film she was absolutely magnificent and her acting was of the very highest order. Ralph Fiennes was his usual very competent controlled self, but I found his character (Berg) to be infuriating and especially so in the scene when he meets Winslet in the prison canteen towards the end - still, it shows what a good actor he is."
"wisewebwoman","8","0","0","18 December 2009"," Good Interpretation of the Book.
","And that must have been a challenge, as a narrator, who weaves the story, must have a different rendering on screen.<br/><br/>The story is compelling, and takes place in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Stephen Daldry brings his fine directing skills to this complex story of human morality and frailty and its far reaching effects. Bernhard Schlink's best-selling German novel, ""The Reader,"" is the source and he had input into this screen treatment.<br/><br/>David Kross, a newcomer, gives a wonderful performance as Michael when he gets involved with Hanna, played by Kate Winslet, after falling ill on the street. She offers him assistance. Their illicit affair blossoms when he gets well and goes to thank her for her help.<br/><br/>Part of their connection is Michael's reading to her from an assortment of books that he brings.<br/><br/>My only problem with this screen interpretation is the gratuitous sex between an underage male (legally a child) and his older lover (Hanna is in her mid thirties). There is far too much sex shown and not enough reading. I believe if this had been an older man shown with a fifteen year old girl there would have been more of a protest. Here their scenes are graphic and bordering on prurient.<br/><br/>The awakening of Hanna takes place with the reading of these books and not so much the sexuality so I feel the emphasis was incorrect. Be that as it may, Michael is heartbroken when Hanna disappears. Years later, while he studies law, he goes to a trial and finds that an older Hanna is being tried for war crimes.<br/><br/>This was a complex book and is a complex film which gives no simple answers. We cannot judge Hanna for there is a Hanna within all of us. Her empty lonely life was enriched with her exposure to literature for the first time. We understand her. We don't condone what she did as a guard but we can sympathize.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes plays the grown-up Michael but with far less nuance than David Kross. I found it more than a little jolting when he appeared on screen. Ralph does pained very well indeed but his performance lacked spectrum and the emotional depth that Kross had.<br/><br/>8 out of 10. Winslet and Kross were superb."
"helgaakberg79","10","0","0","12 December 2009"," Extraordinary adaptation of Bernhard Schlink's masterpiece (one of my favorite books)
","Delightful David Kross, stunning... no, STUNNING Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes, solid and elegant as usual. Though filled with beautiful and tasteful images of sexuality, ""The Reader"" is really about feelings of guilt and shame. For most of his movie director wants us to identify with Michael, innocent who is also guilty. Michael is ashamed of associating with Hanna and also intensely ashamed of his shame. Director repeatedly makes his point that guilty are also innocent and innocent are also guilty. During trial Hanna is so ashamed of being illiterate that she accepts life sentence. And Michael is so ashamed of his relationship with her that he does not inform court that she is illiterate, that she could not have written that document she is charged with. Because of his inaction Michael is then overcome with guilt for not having helped Hanna, who is now both perpetrator and victim. Mainly because Michael did not provide evidence that would have shortened her prison term and did not give her support that might have avoided her suicide. Hanna is also victimized by other defendants during trial. Michael then tries to do right by flying to New York to visit surviving daughter of one of Hannah's victims played by fabulously convincing Lena Olin. He asks her to take Hannah's money or at least give advice about how to use it but daughter refuses. She harshly rejects any involvement in Hannah's affairs not allowing even little forgiveness. I found interesting Hanna's poverty compared to riches of Olin's character's New York apartment. But there is no mention of it in Schlink's book... My guess is that director was trying to stir guilt in his audience. Perhaps he was trying to turn our sympathy from daughter encouraging us to be more forgiving of Hanna than daughter was. Bottom line? As soon as you want to condemn someone you must face your own moral relativity."
"johnnyboyz","8","0","0","31 October 2009"," Wonderful film chronicling the fear, guilt and moral predicaments a young man undergoes when he thinks he's stumbled into a dream situation.
","The Reader begins in 1995 as a certain Michael Berg stands in his Berlin home early on in the day. There's a disagreement with a woman who's there as well; could be anybody, and she accuses him in an angry manner that he's been distant with her, ignoring her and that he is unable to follow the simplest of commands when it is revealed he did not wake her up. She storms out, and Michael is left to contemplate what's been said. It's a relatively straight forward but extremely poignant way in which to start capturing this person's attitudes to relationships and women. Berg doesn't have much of a retort to these accusations; as the film develops, we realise the importance a mere fling had on his life, and maybe we think that he's attempting to regress back to a child-like state, when off the cusp sex with strangers drastically opened his mind. Berg thought he knew of a certain female individual from many-a year ago, while the could-be deliberate 'distancing' himself in relation to the girl in the opening keeps the anonymity prominent.<br/><br/>The film will eventually flash back to 1958, before returning to the then-present and chronicling various incidences and the years in which these things happened; all the while building to a rather tragic denouement. Ralph Fiennes plays Michael Berg as an adult, and he is accompanied by a certain David Kross, a young German actor whose career, based on this evidence, is promising to say the least. The film is all about Berg; how one chance meeting shapes lives, his and other people's. The film, like a certain book he reads to a certain Hanna Schmitz in his youth partly entitled ""Homer's"", is an odyssey of what makes him who he and others are.<br/><br/>It's a testament to Roger Daldry's film that The Reader can shoot all over the place in terms of jumping to specific times in people's lives spanning four different decades. The film never feels sporadic or dis-jointed, despite all this hopping about. I like The Reader a lot, predominantly because it unfolds over a number of years. It takes years to come to terms with some things; it takes years to comprehend certain other things. As a film that explores whatever friendships; relationships; acquaintancies or mutual-understandings two people of contrasting 'sorts' go through, or as a film that explores somewhat unnatural or 'taboo' understandings between two people, The Reader nails it.<br/><br/>If one was to think of another recent example, Ang Lee's 2006 film Brokeback Mountain might count as a film that explored chance pairings, which in turn prolonged deeper feelings that rose to the surface as well as realisations of certain sensations. For Michael in The Reader, that sensation is coming-of-age. His relationship with Hanna is one that sees him engaging in rather regular sessions of a sexual nature following school; something he takes for granted; something that I think he sees as the equivalent of stumbling into a sexual fantasy, with absolutely no way of it terminating because it feels so right at that time for him. Within the actual relationship, Hanna adopts the more dominant half of the pairing. Her sheltering of Michael as he sits, helplessly, in the entrance of her apartment building coughing and shivering as a result of the driving rain, already establishes a position of power over a somewhat helpless flu victim. Once he's in better health, her ordering of him to fetch coal and to complete other such menial tasks takes over as the order of the relationship, and she dictates as to whether he will read to her before or after they engage in sexual episodes.<br/><br/>Hanna's apartment as a cinematic space sees most of the small and un-kept location of her general living area as a location in which Michael, in his closed off Utopian place away from school and the family, can indulge in his whatever budding submissive and sexual sensations he, at that stage in his life, wants to explore. The most interesting aspect of this apartment is its bathroom area; a further space closed off within a location already established to be closed off. The bathing area comes equipped with a curtain on a rail, a physical and very symbolic object that allows the character to place a barrier between them and the rest of the living area – it is no coincidence that the two frequently find solace in this area, reading and so forth. At one point, Hanna hits Michael after a disagreement and an argument; she runs a bath; the bathing space is closed off from whatever goes on outside of it and they seem at ease again in what is some sort of recognition of the human form in its rawest form.<br/><br/>The film develops, and Hanna cuts off contact with Michael, although they will both share a common bond between them in their time apart. Their respective journeys through life, following the affair, is all about coming to terms with the past, and accepting what you let happen. For Michael as he grows older, it is the fact he just jumped into the goings on with Hanna whereas for her, her bleak past to do with some Jewish-related atrocities that happened during The Second World War comes back to haunt. The study plays out wonderfully, with a lot of dramatic weight. As far as film-making goes, each period in history is superbly brought to life; the switching from dank, rainy evenings in the 1950s to the bright, sunny afternoons of the 1990s combine brilliantly while the young actor Kross impresses; particularly in a moment later on in which he notices Hanna after all those years and emotes the necessary emotions in his acting. As an all round piece exploring an array of various notions combining with the basics of bringing a text to life, The Reader excels."

"sddavis63","7","0","0","7 August 2009"," After A Slow Start It Picked Up Steam
","I found the first hour or so of this movie to be somewhat tough slogging. The film is set in Germany in 5 different time periods - 1958, 1966, 1976, 1988 and 1995, and moves fairly fluidly between them. Each period offers a depiction of the somewhat complicated relationship between Michael and Hannah. The first hour deals primarily with the 1956 time period. Michael is a 15 year old who becomes ill and is helped by 36 year old Hannah. The two develop a bond, and begin an affair which is rather explicitly depicted. Michael, played in this time period by David Kross, is a fairly typical teenager smitten and somewhat obsessed with an older woman. Hannah, played throughout the movie by Kate Winslet, was a mysterious character, at the same time both cold and distant, and yet very passionate and caring, and one who loved to have Michael read to her. The affair ends abruptly when Hannah disappears. Fast forward to 1966, when Michael is a law student and his class attends a trial of SS guards, where he discovers to his horror that Hannah was one of them. It's at this point that I found the movie really picked up steam. The earlier relationship between Hannah and Michael was interesting but in all honesty not that powerful. Having seen them make love once, I didn't really need to see it 5 or 6 times. With the trial, though, a number of interesting angles began to be explored.<br/><br/>The first came from the 1966 trial itself, and Hannah's rationalization of her actions in letting several hundred Jewish prisoners die in a fire when she could have released them. ""We couldn't let them escape,"" she says. ""There would have been chaos."" When the judge continues to question her she asks with what appeared to be complete bewilderment ""What would you have done?"" - a question for which the judge offered no answer. In the end Hannah is sentenced to 20 years in prison. In a way this is another film that depicts the inability to answer many questions about Nazi Germany. In that sense, Hannah is a troubling character. She accepts responsibility for what happened but expresses little guilt for it. ""Why did you join the SS?"" she's asked. ""I needed a job."" You get the sense that Hannah doesn't really ""get"" the horrors of the Third Reich of which she was a part - albeit a minor one. <br/><br/>The second interesting angle was the resumption in the relationship between Michael and Hannah. Having been appalled by the fact that she was an SS guard, Michael struggles with his conscience, because he also realizes that the piece of evidence that got her the harsh sentence wasn't valid. Hannah admitted having written the report about the incident while the other guards on trial denied it, but Michael realized she couldn't have written it - she was illiterate, which was why she enjoyed being read to. It's an unanswered question why she admitted to something she didn't do. Perhaps it was to assuage an unacknowledged guilt, but it was never explained. Ten years later, Michael begins sending her tape recordings of books she liked which he's recited into a recorder. She uses them as a springboard to teach herself to read. Eventually, in 1988, when Hannah is due to be released, the prison contacts him because he's her only connection to the outside world. Their reunion in the prison is somewhat awkward, but he makes arrangements to set her up on the outside, but tragedy prevents that from happening.<br/><br/>The relationship between the two is the focal point of the movie and it's explored in pretty good depth, with good performances by those portraying both characters (Ralph Fiennes plays the older Michael.) I wasn't entirely convinced of the need for the 1995 scenes which depict the relationship between Michael and his adult daughter. For some reason that I didn't understand, this served as a springboard to Michael's reminiscences of Hannah, but the connection wasn't clear. I also wasn't clear why Michael felt the need to take his daughter to Hannah's grave and begin to explain to her the story of their relationship. At first I wondered if, by chance, the real secret would turn out to be that the daughter was actually Hannah's daughter, but once actress Hannah Herzsprung was introduced in the role it became obvious that she was too young. As a result, I found Herzsprung's role superfluous, its significance being left largely unexplained.<br/><br/>In the end, I found this an interesting movie that raises a number of questions and issues, although not offering any real resolution to them. 7/10"
"sheenajackie","9","0","0","13 July 2009"," Reading The Reader
","Director Stephen Daldry, Producers Anthony Minghella and Sidney Pollack, Screenwriter David Hare, have combined to produce a brilliantly realised story of multiple layers of emotion, history, conflict, and personal tragedies. Bernhard Schlink's seriously complex novel weaves a horrific Holocaust incident into a backdrop for an unlikely but telling love story between a young innocent and an experienced, if naive and uneducated, woman, which allegorises the younger German generation finding out, and trying to come to terms with, their awful past. The novel is a great piece of restrained and convincing storytelling, and the film succeeds in re-working the novel into an equivalently convincing drama. However, the film would be nothing without the superb performances of Kate Winslet and David Kross. I am amazed at Kross's performance. Kate Winslet has had years to perfect her acting and I have never seen her perform better, but Kross, only 18 when the film was made, matches her scene for scene, and brings juvenile acting to a new level.<br/><br/>The only disappointment was Ralph Fiennes. He has a tendency to drag out scenes of emotional intensity to a degree that borders on melodrama. This story is pure drama, not melodrama. Unfortunately, Fiennes's role, mainly constrained to the last scenes of the film, causes the film's momentum to drop, which is a great pity. The pathos and heartbreak of the denouement of Kate Winslet's character, Hanna, is thereby undermined.<br/><br/>The novel is a masterpiece of intensity portrayed through spare and deliberate restraint in writing. The film manages to capture that spirit of intensity and maintain it throughout, until the last scenes where Fiennes, so self-absorbed, cannot make himself go through the mirror of his character and objectify it to make it real.<br/><br/>Winslet certainly deserved her Oscar for not only a fine piece of acting, but for constraining her theatrical personality and changing her acting style so dramatically, to convey the loneliness and agony of the internal Hanna, at loggerheads with the inhuman world she found herself in as a young woman which confounded her in every way. She was broken yet continued to live. She found her lost innocence again in her teenage lover, but he had to grow up.<br/><br/>This story is a tragedy, an allegory, an historical analysis in fictional form, an indictment of inhumanity, and yet remains, all through, an impressive and unusual love story. The film (and the book) have not, in my opinion, received enough attention. This is presumably because the story is also about uncomfortable issues and history. It deserves much more recognition than a Best Actress Oscar. It will last, though, and be watched and re-watched in future years, and time will give it its due reward to one of the best films I have seen for years - in fact since Daldry's The Hours."

","Post-Nazi West Germany. A young boy vomits on the street in a rainstorm, in Neustadt, 1958. An older woman helps him. What follows? Full frontal sex, sex and much more sex. In between reading, reading and much more reading.<br/><br/>Well, the movie IS called THE READER, a heavy-handed, manipulative ""romance"" tale that will tear-jerk those who are inclined to be that way jerked, but will infuriate others with a shred of ethics.<br/><br/>German-born David Kross is the young boy, Michael (looking like Peter from NARNIA, with much more beaver surrounding him). Kate Winslet is the older beaver--I mean, woman, Hanna, unafraid to tap a 15-year-old for his endless spermatozoan reserves. And, apparently, his reading skills. She's a poor illiterate tram guard who relishes his knowledge of the written word - from Tintin comics to Homer epics - but keeps her illiteracy a secret from everyone.<br/><br/>Romance protocol ensues - passionate arguments, frenzied love-making, uncomfortable silences, pathological insecurities - until Hanna and Michael go their separate ways.<br/><br/>Years later, law student Michael witnesses the trial of six female war criminals - one of them, his beloved Hanna, a former guard at Auschwitz! She would pick out young girls for execution, but first make them read to her; even sicker than the other war criminals who just used to gas everyone.<br/><br/>In keeping her illiteracy a secret (out of vain stupidity, it would seem), Hanna takes one for the team when she is accused of writing and signing orders for executions - something which only Michael knows she cannot do - and is sentenced to life.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 1995, and Michael, now a mourning-faced Ralph Fiennes, decides to perk up Hanna's incarceration by reading books onto tapes for her. Hundreds of tapes, which enable Hanna to teach herself to read. Yet he refuses to visit her or return her scrawled letters. We realize he is torn between the beauteous memories of his spanking he got from her as a lad, and the ethical ambiguity of loving a ruthless Nazi.<br/><br/>The novel by Bernard Schlink is a giant in German literature, that I presume asks many more questions about the Holocaust than screenwriter David Hare's and director Stephen Daldry's film is prepared to do. Though the film is an emotionally powerful drama, only two major profundities are explored.<br/><br/>One is voiced by a law student regarding the scapegoating of the six female guards - which also hits the criminal Bush-Cheney administration right on its head: ""The trial of these six women is a diversion. You put them on trial, you say they were the evil ones, they were the guilty ones, because one of the victims happened to write a book. Do you know how many camps there were in Europe? People go on about, How much did everyone know? There were thousands of camps. Everyone knew! Our parents, our teachers; that isn't the question. The question is, How could you let this happen? And better, Why didn't you kill yourself when you found out?"" <br/><br/>The film's other profound strength is portraying Hanna - the heroine - as an indoctrinated Nazi. It is easy to convey Nazi amorality in soldier characters with blue eyes, SS uniforms and severe ""Cherman"" accents - much more jarring when the indoctrination is manifested in a simple woman who is the love interest.<br/><br/>Michael is shattered when he meets old Hanna (Winslet in excellent aging makeup) and finds no remorse in her, ""It doesn't matter what I think. The dead are still dead."" Her blind ignorance furthers his mourning face, ""They had to be cleared! More were coming in!"" <br/><br/>Poetic ending: Hanna piles books on a table to attain a good height to hang herself... shouldn't we be saying, Good Riddance? Especially to someone weak-willed enough to be inculcated to war crimes with no discernment or remorse (N.B. the Ku Bush Klan: Rove, Addington, Woo, Cheney, W., Rice, Ashcroft, Wolfowitz, CIA torturers, soldier grunts who committed atrocities at Abu Ghraib, et al).<br/><br/>Instead, tears for the beaver... because she's Kate Winslet. Movie manipulation at its best. Get the great Ralph Fiennes to cry over her and one tear-jerk fest coming right up.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

","Years after having an affair with Hannah Schmitz (Winslet), Michael Berg (Kross) is at law school and sees his former lover in court, defending her involvement in a war crime.<br/><br/>Based on Bernard Schlink's book, The Reader is a wondrous adaptation that finally answered the viewer's question as to when Kate Winslet would win an Oscar.<br/><br/>Kate's strong performance is not only her first Oscar winning scene stealer, but arguably one of the finest dramatic performances she has ever delivered. The English actress has certainly had an eventful career with her breakthrough romantic sweetheart in Titanic to the clunky and spontaneous Clementine in Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind. Both Oscar nominations but against Helen Hunt in 1997 and Hilary Swank in 2005, there was perhaps a lacking in intense drama to be a true contender. Both fantastic performances, but the academy certainly favours those dramatic performances and here, there is certainly no shortage on the drama front.<br/><br/>Set in Germany after the Second World War, Schmitz and Berg form a controversial relationship where Schmitz holds the ropes over the teenager. The formation of this relationship is a charming opening. There is no baggage for developing the character's background and we are virtually straight into the shocking manor of the sexual pairing of the two central protagonists.<br/><br/>From Schmitz's hidden secret to Berg's obedience there are certainly a few complications along with the buoyancy and free nature of the affair. And therein lies the drama, and along with it some rightfully deserved Oscar nominations and a finally rewarded recognition for Britain's most promising actress.<br/><br/>The beginning of the story establishes the intricate bonds of Berg's confinement in his own home under the watchful eye of his family where Schmitz discovers she has problems living alone. The realistic concepts brings the viewer's right down to earth with a wonderful scripted screenplay that at first keeps the dialogue as minimalistic as possible as the scene setting gets a wonderful work over by director Daldry. The story is then notched up into a more controversial drama as the affair escalades and brings around a sad moment half way through. Years after the affair when Berg sees Schmitz in court does the drastic implication of the war and political opinions come to the screen.<br/><br/>There are issues of Post war implications, Jew imprisonment and punishment in prison that are all heavily debated in the court case that demonstrates the power of the law against doing what is right.<br/><br/>When Ralph Fiennes enters the picture do we see a soft and meaningful feeling of sorrow and depression that rightfully explains his actions, which rounds off the collection of acting performances and though this a wondrously scripted and directed picture, it will be remembered for an astounding performance by Winslet."
"dromasca","9","0","0","30 May 2009"," a film of two stories
","There are two stories or if you want two different films in this film.<br/><br/>The first one is a wonderful love story, starting the 1950s Germany trying to cope with the trauma of the war and of the defeat and to build itself back as a nation and as a country. Michael is a 15 years old teenager discovering love, life and himself. Hanna is 20 years older, a simple woman trying to break the walls of a lonely life. Their relationship starts on a purely sexual way but soon turns into something else, as she starts asking him to read to her loudly from his school literature books. Reading becomes the center and the focus of their affair. One day however she disappears. <br/><br/>We find them almost a decade later, when he is a student in law and she is on the accused bank of a SS camp guardians trial, accused of war crimes. He feels betrayed twice by her disappearance, and by her having said nothing about her past. When the occasion comes to ease her punishment by revealing that she is not able to read he fails to do it, he is too ashamed, she is too ashamed, and social conventions again win over truth. <br/><br/>The final part of the relationship is sublime. He is now mature, she is old and in prison. He starts sending her recordings of his readings of the preferred book, she finally starts to understand the evil she caused and also the reasons of failure and learns to read and write. It is a relationship that is no longer physical but only spiritual but it still gets only stronger. When liberation time approaches however, Hanna cannot cope with real life - the physical world and and a real relationship with Michael have no meaning for her. <br/><br/>The second film or story is a Holocaust theme, but not the usual one. The film happens many years after the war, but the shade of the Holocaust is planing over the whole story. Hanna was one of the blind executioners, her evil deeds had nothing ideological, just reflected the moral decay of the world she lived in. For many years after the war she just lives, does not seem to have any remorse or think too much about what happened. Her process of acknowledging comes late and is not well expressed, she is not a character that explains herself well by any means. The world around here judges and condemns her, but not even the judges have a good answer to the question she asks at the trial'what would you have done in my place?'. It is not that the good answer does not exist, letting 300 Jews burn alive in a church rather than releasing them and risking 'disorder' is obviously the evil choice - but it is the new society that may not be yet strong and good enough to give the appropriate answer. <br/><br/>The way the theme of the Holocaust is dealt in this film cannot avoid controversy. Both heroes of the film make at given moments of the story the wrong choices, and none of their tentatives of atonement can really compensate or fix what happened, Many people could read in the telling of such a story by itself a tentative of humanizing the wrong-doers and seeking excuses for the unspeakable. The real answer is given I believe in one of the final scenes, when a survivor of the Holocaust refuses to make any judgments, learn or teach any lessons based on one happened in the camp. This is again a disputable position, but a possible one. <br/><br/>Kate Winslet is superb in the role of Hanna, rendering the character with all its simplicity, naivety, lack of sensitivity in many moments tenderness in other, mis-communication, and humanity. For once the Academy may not have been wrong. Her German partner, young actor David Kross succeeds to match her beautifully as the young Michael. I liked less Ralph Fiennes as the mature Michael, but then I seldom like Fiennes. Overall this film asks a lot of important questions and provides back answers that will not make everybody happy, but it's a complex story and the answers cannot be simple. The film did not enjoy too much success, maybe there is a level of saturation because of too many Holocaust movies lately, but 'The Reader' will I think get in time the status of one of the important films of the genre."
"vibrationsofdoom","8","0","0","29 May 2009"," A well done, but sad, tale of fragile humanity...
","I recently picked this up due to the interesting and rather unusual storyline: a young man has an affair with an older woman and short though it is, the woman disappears. 8 years later, the young man, studying to be a lawyer, is shocked to discover that one of the defendants in a Nazi war crimes trial is none other than Hanna, the woman he was ""in love"" with. The early scenes contained much nudity and sexual content, though I will admit some of it was tastefully done, especially when it proved that the young Michael was very inexperienced with women, and it also pointed out the somewhat selfish nature of the older woman, who could be given into compassion and tenderness when the call arises. Which is the first glimpse into what I will term ""fragile humanity:"" When the selfish needs of the individual are met, some are more open to bestowing ""gifts"" or ""favors"" on those who please them first. Obviously the young Michael's inexperience with women led him to a failed marriage and the most important travesty this movie has to deal with: Michael had secret knowledge that would have saved Hannah from a life in prison sentence due to her role in the Nazi prison camps. I find it incredibly difficult to believe that Michael had not used that secret to keep this woman from spending 20 years in prison (For those confused by the whole 20 years vs. life in prison sentence, Europeans take a different view of life in prison than Americans do. 20 years is the maximum sentence for a life in prison case). I ALSO find it hard to believe that Michael doesn't seem to feel something, ANYTHING for Hanna after what he's shared. It's as if he's punishing her himself. Hanna's tale is indeed a sad one, and once again we see her readiness to atone for her sins for her part in the death of 300. However, the one young lawyer does make a DAMN fine point: there were hundreds of death camps all over Europe? WHY just these six women put on trial? It becomes painfully obvious that Hanna's illiteracy is one small part of the problem: the other women decided to use Hanna as a scapegoat so they could all get reduced prison sentences.<br/><br/>All this aside, it was a very sad story and a heartbreaking one as well. It forces us to question people's motives and decide for ourselves the best course of action for our lives. Hanna is unfortunately forced to pay for her mistakes, and we clearly can see the major point of this movie: sometimes our smallest of choices can spiral us out of control and leave us feeling trapped, as if we have no choice but to carry on. It is one of the most extreme and devastating lessons about life we can learn, but also proves that humanity has very strong instincts to survive, and deep down it's obvious that Hanna felt she had no other way to survive with the secret she's held for many years. The acting was quite emotional; it's obvious the actors/actresses understood the emotional depth and contents of their roles. A powerful statement this movie makes, but left me puzzled at WHO was the bigger monster: Hanna, or the man who kept her secret and allowed her to serve a life sentence for her small part in the Nazi war crimes. It also makes me stop and examine a piece of history that I was obviously too young to be a part of."

","Directed by Stephen Daldry and written by David Hare, ""The Reader"" is a thought-provoking and surprising drama that takes the viewer in several different directions. Though some reviewers on this site are critical of Daldry and the film, in lesser hands, ""The Reader"" would be a total, erratic mess.<br/><br/>The story is told in flashback as the adult Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) remembers his youth. As a 15-year-old boy, the young Michael (David Kross) has his first forays into sex with an older woman, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) in 1958 Berlin. She helps him when he winds up on her doorstep, ill with scarlet fever; he returns to thank her when he's well. The two enter into a sexual relationship. As part of their time together, Hanna has Michael read to her. One day, Hanna simply disappears. The next time Michael sees her is in 1966, when he is a law student in Heidelberg and his class travels to watch a trial. It is then he realizes not one secret that Hanna carried with her, but two.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" is, above all, a very human story of real, conflicted human beings, and the brilliant performances reflect this. David Kross is exceptional as the young Michael, in the throes of first, blinding passion, who, in the face of the truth about the woman he loved, endeavors to understand her nonetheless. Kate Winslet is magnificent, and that's the only word for her. Hardened by life and her unsentimental and uncompromising view of the world, she is cut off from people due to a secret she considers shameful. With Michael she allows herself some softness, and gives in to not only passion but emotion, sobbing when Michael reads a sad story to her. Winslet shows us all of this, her need to connect with someone, and her strict view of life. Ralph Fiennes turns in another excellent performance; Michael's world and his own isolation were shaped by Hanna. As an adult, he still grapples with a decision he made and his own guilt; he still tries to understand not only her but how he could love her, and in the midst of all of these complex emotions, he believes he owes her something. He ends up giving her the greatest gift he could - her dignity.<br/><br/>As with ""Dead Man Walking,"" there is more to a person than his or her actions, reprehensible though they may be. We are not, after all, what we do but who we are. While some crimes are unforgivable, there is, shockingly, at times a connection with the perpetrator that allows us to see the person and extend a consideration that person never gave another. Thus murderers have loving parents and family, and someone who showed inhumanity to others has a little humanity shown them.<br/><br/>A very remarkable story."
"ryancm","7","0","0","24 May 2009"," Disturbing
","THE READER is a somewhat disturbing film that is hard to dislike. Interesting story and some great photography, direction and acting. The disturbing aspect is the character flaws in both Hannah and Michael. He's always so remorseful with tears coming out of his eyes every five minutes. Hannah is a difficult character to understand which makes it all that more disturbing. What's so shameful about being illiterate? While there were no excuses for what she did as a camp guard, she could have saved herself by admitting she couldn't have wrote that discriminating letter. To compound that, why doesn't Michael go ahead and defend her? Just plain stupid and totally unbelievable, yet fascinating. KATE WINSLET and David KROSS were extremely good in their roles, less so Ralf Finnes. As an adult, the older Michael should have seen an analyst as he is troubled throughout his entire adult hood and a wimp at that. He needed as much help as Hannah in his own way. The time lasps are a bit illogical as well. One of the best performances, however, is the one given by Lena Olin as both mother and daughter. A brilliant performance what is never talked about or discussed. She should have been up for a supporting award at least. How does the public and critics let these performances slip by the wayside? Too much attention on Winslet I guess. Despite reservations, THE READER should be seen. Good DVD extras plus lots of deleted and extended scenes."

","(spoilers)""The Reader"" is a compelling watch and romance. Not going in with any foreknowledge of the story, the movie proceeds to offer up a passionate beginning and then floors you mid-way through with the facts of the past and the path of the story. By far most interesting was the character of Hanna Schmitz, played very well by Kate Winslet and almost equally as good was young David Cross playing Michael Berg. The love story is genuine if a little twisted at first. Some of the interesting angles of the storyline put morality, duty, and love at odds with one another. The WWII era evils of the Nazi state society come front and center as the Schmitz character doesn't seem to understand or comprehend her wrong-doing - seeming ignorant and remorseless. Brutal and real toward the fate of the characters, they seem to be destine for problems. Paralysis of action of the main character seems terribly believable. Writing and dialog is excellent, cast is outstanding and direction is smart. Quite enjoyable and sad."

","Undoubtedly, Kate was the show stealer in this movie; with a slow pace starting the movie shuttle to and fro between past and present with lot of emphasis put across characterization. Performance by David Kross is also commendable, special mention to the courtroom sequence where Kate Winslet is prosecuted. In my opinion his role sort of overshadowed the role of Ralph Fiennes. The movie has some of its own moments which can only be described as though provoking and unique in respect. The theme is somewhat dark due to the touch of Holocaust in it but the same should have been supported with a glimpse of the ""Church Massacre"" that was shown in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall a good movie with wonderful performances by all the actors.

","As one poster put it, The Reader is pretentious cheese. Stupid, pretentious cheese! Only in the movies does a girl who finds a boy drenched to the skin and puking his guts out not ask him for his number so that she can phone his parents. Instead, she washes the vomit off the cobblestones (first things first!), gives him a hug (huh?), then walks him home as it begins to snow! After 5 minutes in bed with scarlet fever, the boy tracks down his angel of mercy, spies on her, shovels coal for her, gets naked for her, then lets her have at his scrawny, underage bones. Only in the movies.<br/><br/>The scrawny, underage bone-jumping continues throughout the summer without anyone wondering where the boy goes or what he does or whom he does it with. Turns out Scrawny Underage Bone-Jumper is (surprise!) not exactly the kind of girl you'd bring home to Mother. But since she's played by Kate Winslet, whom, like Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman, and (in her salad days) Helen Mirren, drops her drawers the way you and I breathe, what scrawny, underage Boy Toy (who gets his own naughty bits moment when Winslet scrubs him down) is going to have a problem with that?<br/><br/>So what's my problem with this stupid, pretentious cheese, aside from Winslet's God-awful geezer make-up? For starters, the German characters have British accents! Hey, you guys are getting paid good money to be in this stupid, pretentious cheese. Would it kill you to do a German accent?<br/><br/>Fiennes's performance consists of ""I'm constipated!"" and ""I'm really, really constipated!"", while Winslet's is one great, big ""Look at me! I'm acting!"" She-Devil, who is tried for allowing a church full of women and children to burn to the ground, bawls like a baby as she watches a children's choir perform? Spare us! And when she is told that she's getting a promotion, Winslet looks as though she wants to throttle somebody (maybe her agent)!<br/><br/>Fiennes, whose lone resemblance to Boy Toy is that they're both zonked, gives a woman, whom, as a child, was one of She-Devil's ""charges"", She-Devil's life savings. I didn't know which was more patently-absurd: giving a woman who lives in a 7-figure Manhattan flat a tiny wad of bills or her telling Boy Toy to donate the ""blood money"" to a Gentile literacy group (Jews, she snootily informs him, hardly have a problem with illiteracy!), but she'll keep the tin that it came in. Wait -- isn't the tin tainted because it contained the ""blood money"", and, worse, it seriously-clashes with the decor?"

"qetzalita","5","2","5","18 March 2018"," Entertains but nothing new about it, (pretentious).
","There were certain moments while watching this film, where I couldn't stop thinking ''Oh, God really?''. 
Since the first minutes in, you can notice the rush: three minutes and you have the first sex scene, and twenty minutes after that, you begin with the breaking-up part. The way scenes are sequenced don't let you enjoy them not even a little bit. This broken way to tell the story, ruins everything else, that only can be saved by Winslet's performance. 
Also, the absurdity of dialogs, (sometimes turning a little cringy to hear the whole conversation), can't just get away.
I suppose people actually like The Reader, because it ''moves'' with a 'human topic' that can't be forgotten, but there's a moment after you hear it that much in movies, books and everything else, that you have to look beyond it: you try to find structure, form and technique. This movie doesn't work due to its lack of proper ways to be narrated and its pretentious 'pseudo-philosophical' exagerations about important topics like guilt and moral values, just far away from true human nature and compassion; I talk about the last scene when the writer/jew/surviver says the horrors that happened to the Jewish people were the worst thing that has happened ever, (but logically, that's not true, people still suffer and had suffered before all along human history, and giving that importance to this, avoids total human empathy, not even close to reality).<br/><br/>I read somewhere that this movie is actually a good film-adaptation of the book, so I can't imagine how painfully must be to read it."
"MBunge","4","2","5","8 October 2010"," Naked Kate Winslet - good! A ""you've got to be kidding me"" plot twist - bad!
","This movie might be a lot better than I think it is. It's a good, if somewhat unexceptional, right up until a big revelation. That's clearly supposed to be a moment when the film is striving for deep emotional significance. But at that moment all I could think was ""You've got to be kidding me"". If that moment works for you, you might believe The Reader is a great story. It didn't work for me and I was left sitting in the theater, noticing what a skewed moral center this movie has.<br/><br/>The Reader is about the responsibility and guilt that Germany as a whole and for all time bears for the Holocaust. The looking glass it uses to examine that concept is the relationship between Michael Berg (David Kross) and Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet). In Berlin in 1958, Michael is 15 years old and falls into a torrid affair for a summer with Hanna, a woman twice his age. They have a lot of sex and Hanna has Michael read to her constantly. Then Michael begins to feel the tug of girls his own age, and Hanna abandons him for a reason all her own. Jumping forward to the late 60s, Michael is in law school and his professor takes him to see the trial of 6 Nazis prison camp guards. The 6 defendants are accused of letting 298 Jews burn to death in a fire. One of the defendants is Hanna. And no, the story is not about Hanna being wrongfully accused. She was a Nazi and she did let those Jews burn to death. But Hanna has a secret. It is one she is so desperate to keep that she'll willingly accept most of the blame for the massacre. Michael figures out her secret, but lets her be severely punished without saying a word. Then the film jumps forward again a decade or so, with Michael (Ralph Fiennes) now a divorcée with a young daughter who reconnects with Hanna in prison. He sends her cassette tapes of him reading the same books he read to her as a young man. The final fate of Hanna and Michael leads to one of the strangest scenes I've ever encountered, where a character in the film essentially tells the people watching the film that what they've been watching really has no significance.<br/><br/>I don't think this is a great movie. I believe the only reasons it's been called great and received a nomination for Best Picture is because of the secret I mentioned before. That, and Kate Winslet being almost perpetually naked in it. I don't want to give the secret away, but let me describe it in a fashion that might help you understand why the secret actually ruined the film for me. The people who made The Reader have essentially taken a Holocaust movie and melded it together with an Afterschool Special. No, I'm not joking.<br/><br/>I rather enjoyed The Reader as a fairly pedestrian coming-of-age movie right up until the big revelation, largely because of Winslet's plentiful nudity. But after the big revelation, I sat in the theater and felt nothing but annoyance for the rest of the film. Hanna is a mass murderer and compared to that, her secret is petty and pathetic. Yet this movie fails to recognize or accept the vast emotional, moral and intellectual chasm between the two. That Hanna thinks her secret is worse and more embarrassing than being a mass murder is, I guess, supposed to make her more sympathetically human.<br/><br/>However, I am utterly uninterested in feeling sympathy for a mass murdering Nazi and I don't think there's anything wrong with taking that stance. But beyond even that, Hanna thinking her secret is more shameful than being responsible for nearly 300 people burning to death is incontrovertible evidence that she is massively disturbedand the story NEVER acknowledges that. The Reader wants to treat Hanna's situation as this great personal crisis, but it's only a crisis because she's a deeply dysfunctional weirdo. By refusing to acknowledge how odd Hanna is, the film left me unable to accept anything else it was trying to do.<br/><br/>There was another film in 2008 that deserved the Best Picture nomination that went to The Reader. It's time for Hollywood to realize that just because a movie is serious and somber and about the Holocaust, that doesn't automatically make it a great film."

The depiction of the ideal Aryan superhuman character tortured by the insensate rest of the world compels the ratification of the injustice. And what about that snobby Jew woman telling Micheal illiteracy isn't a Jewish problem while Hanna had to learn to read in a prison - after watching the movie, i don't like 'em Jews so gud.<br/><br/><ul><li>Those are the major points.

"3xHCCH","6","2","5","2 February 2009"," A Very Morally Polarizing Movie
","This is another one of those difficult to watch movies. Unfortunately, there is nothing neutral about this movie. Anything I mention about it can spoil another person's appreciation of it. I think it would be safe to say that this is a very polarizing movie. It plays two very emotionally charged cards which are bound to upset viewers -- one is about pedophilia, and the other one is about the Holocaust.<br/><br/>Yet here it is, a nominee for Best Picture in the upcoming Oscar Awards. Being the most unexpected of the five nominees, this is the film most blamed for kicking out the popular choice ""The Dark Knight"". So, does ""The Reader"" measure up? <br/><br/>**************** Spoilers ahead! <br/><br/>The first third of the movie is of a very sexual nature. The female party Hanna Schmitz is 36, but the male Michael Berg is only 15! OK, granted that even if the female party looks like Kate Winslet, this would still be disturbing for some. Though admittedly not so much than if the sexes were reversed, would it? <br/><br/>Aside from this detail, those very frank execution of these sex scenes were really unexpected especially since one party is supposed to be a minor. There was even uninhibited frontal nudity by both Winslet (she's not the Rose of ""Titanic"" as we remember it anymore) and the 17 year-old promising (and daring) new actor David Kross. And I thought they did not really resort to such gratuitous exposure anymore these days, but I guess this is the proverbial ""for art's sake"" in its truest sense. However, as an unusual fetish, Hanna would request Michael to read books to her before they would make love, thus giving their affair another dimension; and this movie its title.<br/><br/>Hanna and Michael's affair occurred in the summer of 1958, abruptly ending when Hanna left the city. The setting then fast forwards to 1966 when Michael was attending law school. As his seminar class sat in on a case involving atrocities of Holocaust guards, he was shocked to hear his beloved Hanna's voice on the witness stand as one of the accused guards. In the trial, Hanna withholds a vital secret that could have spared her from a life sentence. Should Michael reveal himself and this secret he also realized in order to save Hanna? <br/><br/>Fast forward again to the 1970s when Michael (now played by a very cold Ralph Fiennes) gets divorced and visits his old home. There he finds his collection of novels, so he suddenly decides to record himself reading these novels aloud as he did before, and send these tapes to Hanna in prison. Of course, these recordings succeeded to buoy and encourage Hanna's spirits and gave her a renewed sense of purpose in life. However, in 1988, the story of Hanna and Michael ends unexpectedly for a reason I am not entirely clear on.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie is really Kate Winslet, who is so bold as to accept and tackle such a thanklessly negative role like Hanna, and yet still come out as someone that audiences can somehow sympathize with. This audacity of Ms. Winslet is perhaps why the Academy correctly elevated this role to Lead (not the Supporting that the Golden Globe recognized). However, this is not to downplay Kate's effort in ""Revolutionary Road"" which is no walk in the park either. Her roles were both offbeat, irrational and miserable, yet she was able to portray them with sensitivity and dignity. She is ripe for an Oscar win this February.<br/><br/>The script loses points with me not really because of the emotional buttons it pushes, but because it fails to clarify character motivations that drive critical moments of the story. The great mystery that the movie's tag-line invites to unlock almost seems too trivial in the greater scheme of the events. That meeting of Berg and the Holocaust survivor at the end was not very well written and fails to evoke its planned dramatic purpose.<br/><br/>The treatment by Director Stephen Daldry may be a little too bleak. Although, it has the same feel and look of the other Daldry masterpiece ""The Hours."" But I guess there may have been no other way to portraying the emotionally-charged material, but straightforwardly and frankly, as this movie certainly did."
"JimSDCal","8","2","5","30 January 2009"," Not Oscar worthy
","""The Reader"" directed by Oscar-nominated director Stephen Daldry should not have been the 5th film to earn an Oscar-nomination as Best Picture. That honor should have gone to ""Doubt"" or ""The Dark Knight"". But, Holocaust-themed pictures are popular with the Academy so this film was nominated. However, this is not a great movie like ""Schindler's List"" but only very-good, like ""The Pianist""<br/><br/>Michael is a high-schooler in West Germany in the mid-50s when he is afflicted with scarlet fever. When he gets sick on the streets, Hannah (the very good Kate Winslet) comes to his aid. After months of convalescense, he goes to Hannah's house to thank her for her assistance and soon the pair starts a romance. It mostly consists of Michael's reading literary classics to Hannah and then sex. This tryst lasts a few months and then peters out.<br/><br/>Almost a decade later, Michael is a law student and as part of a seminar on the legal ramifications of the Holocaust he attends a trial of several women charged with war-related crimes. Michael is very surprised to see Hannah on trial and has crucial evidence about her possible complicity. He must decide whether or not to bring it up.<br/><br/>I like this film but do not feel it to be one of the year's 5 best. So it gets a grade of 8 and a positive recommendation. But, do not expect a truly great movie when going to see this film."
"howard.schumann","7","2","5","29 January 2009"," Strangely flat and lifeless
","Stephen Daldry's The Reader is based on a novel by Bernhard Schlink that grew out of an experience from the author's youth when he discovered that the teacher he had admired for his love of literature had a darker past. Shown through the lens of memory by an adult lawyer (Ralph Fiennes), the film is set in Berlin, thirteen years after the end of World War II. A fifteen-year old boy, stricken with a sudden illness in an apartment doorway on his way home from school is assisted by an older woman. Six months after his recuperation from Scarlet Fever, the boy returns with flowers. After the woman provides a bath for him to clean up from shoveling coal, he is initiated into sex. The woman is Hanna (Kate Winslet) who collects fares on the local streetcar and the boy is Michael Berg (David Kross), who returns every afternoon. Hanna also has a strange obsession.<br/><br/>She wants to be read to and Michael eagerly complies, reading The Odyssey, The Lady With the Little Dog by Chekhov, Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn and even Lady Chatterley's Lover which she objects to. Then, one day she disappears without explanation and the film flashes forward eight years. Michael is in law school and his class led by their teacher Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz) is observing the trial of Nazi war criminals. Shockingly, Michael observes that Hanna is one of six co-defendants, all former guards at concentration camps who, by their inaction, allowed three hundred Jews to be burned to death in a bombed church. He has to face the trauma of not only seeing his first love after many years but also finding out that she was perhaps the woman most responsible for the deaths of the prisoners the guards were assigned to watch.<br/><br/>Sadly, Michael fails to reconnect with Hanna during the trial and views the proceedings from a distance. Though knows a secret that may help Hanna in her defense, he is unwilling to go the extra step to visit her in prison and try to convince her to help herself. The older Michael, now a lawyer, however, attempts to rekindle the emotions of his youth by sending her tapes in prison of him reading classic books. Adapted for the screen by David Hare, The Reader has an important story to tell, allowing us to gauge the reaction of the younger generation in postwar Germany to revelations of Nazi complicity among their elders. Unfortunately, however, I found it to be strangely flat and lifeless, undercut by an air of portentous self-importance and peopled with characters whose complexities and contradictions are never fully illuminated."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","5","21 January 2009"," Very good, but no Masterpiece
","The Reader is a great adaptation of the amazing novel. The screenplay is of the highest caliber. It revolves around everything the novel focuses on, and it gives these characters some dimension and force. Of course, the main performances here are spectacular. David Kross is very realistic, and although at times he felt awkward to me, I think he still managed to make all of his expressions be fitting and work with his character. The tour-de-force here is Kate Winslet. What is possibly her best year, giving an amazing leading performance in her other brilliant film,Revolutionary Road, here she plays her character of a different caliber that she has never done before. Her acting is certainly of the highest rank, and she deserves all the recognition. Ralph Fiennes, a great actor, managed to pull it off very well too. We feel for him, playing the older Michael. The film has some amazing cinematography, costumes, set designs, and amazing make-up. It does come with it's flaws though. I felt that some of the small actors were not up well for their writing. They were not bad, no, but maybe too bland. The music score was brilliant, but I thought at scenes it was way too loud, and went on for too long. But of course, the highs of the film bring everything to another level. Quite brilliant film"
"seawalker","7","2","5","12 January 2009"," Passionate, thoughtful and moving, but there was a problem...
","I enjoyed ""The Reader"". I did. I thought it was a good film. A passionate, thoughtful and moving piece of work about guilt, shame and the secrets that can blight a life. In the first half Kate Winslet and David Kross carried the film, and both were very good, but when Ralph Fiennes took centre stage, ""The Reader"" became outstanding. ""The Reader"" was a solid and quality piece of work.<br/><br/>My problem? Er... Well, the nudity. Kate's copious nakedness was really kind of distracting and ""The Reader"" didn't need it. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it took something away from the power of the movie. Perhaps the filmmakers thought they had to demonstrate, in a blatant and provocative way, the passion and the intensity of the affair between the older woman and the younger boy? I don't know. I just felt that the explicitness was draining and a little bit unnecessary.<br/><br/>Come on guys (and gals)! There are other ways to shoot love scenes. You can concentrate on the legs, the arms, the back, the lips, the feet, the face. Especially the face. You don't need to show everything.<br/><br/>I am not a prude. If Kate Winslet still wants to take her clothes off on screen, then that is just great. In fact, it is fantastic! More power to her elbow. At 33 she is still a fine looking woman. I even promise to only slightly smile when she comes out with the standard spiel about the nudity being 'essential to the plot'.<br/><br/>But be honest. The nudity was not essential to ""The Reader"", now, was it?"

","Sat through it, catching short periods of snooze time, and woke up near the end, over at last. Wondered more about how Kate's husband felt about his wife exposing herself to mouthwatering hordes of oglers, some of whom actually criticized the quality of her charms, than to caring about what was going on story-wise. Had to read these reviews to find out what I'd missed.<br/><br/>This may be off-topic, but what better film to comment on the fact that professional reviewers are way less interesting than the weighing in of user views seen here, as honest and politically incorrect as you can get. Time is close when we will not need or want professional reviews. They anyway tell us more about the reviewer than about the film under scrutiny, and the pros must lead very narrow and boring lives.<br/><br/>I have a confession. I've chosen the ""hated it"" setting as being more rewarding to start the examination of a movie. I've seldom read such original and colorful material. Exciting!"

Unfortunately, I feel the same about Ralph Fiennes. And believe it or not, Bruno Ganz as a Robin Williamsesque university lecture , and Lena Olin as the Manhattan based gallery something-or-other, (who ARE these people?), surpassed them both. Ganz in particular. Shudder.<br/><br/>The film itself I felt started slowly with no real meat to the cold romance depicted.

"ElMaruecan82","7","1","2","24 December 2016"," Pride and shame as parts of a fascinating equation... but a slightly disappointing resolution...
","A sickly teenager meets a woman twice his age. The early interactions are hesitant and awkward but so emotionally powerful that when the two end up making love, it feels real. I believed in the sex-driven relationship between Hanna Schmitt (Kate Winslet) and young Michael Berg (David Kross) and the way it turned to a life-changing addiction.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Hanna and Michael is integral to the realism and I applaud the aesthetic approach of Stephen Frears who didn't sugarcoat the material because of the controversial age difference: nudity never feels gratuitous because sex is the before it gets deeper, and a new habit grows between the two lovers. Before their 'ritual intercourse', Michael reads books to Hanna, and she enjoys listening to them. There's never a more convincing expression of love in Winslet's eyes as when Michael becomes the reader instead of the lover.<br/><br/>But time goes on, and out of sight, out of mind until Michael crosses Hanna's path again in the 60's during a trial, which will bring some answers about her personality and fascination for reading. ""The Reader"" then reveals its emotional core, it is not a coming-of-age story, but a character study of two persons bounded by their romance, itself connected to painful war memories, although Michael can't remember the war but he seems to have inherited part of the guilt inhabiting Hanna's heart. And out of debatable pride, both Hanna and Michael will take the most frustrating decisions, frustrating in the sense that it doesn't serve any of their interests. <br/><br/>Maybe this is what ""The Reader"" is about: things we can't indeed understand because they're commanded by shame and pride, two parts of an insoluble equation that defined the darkest pages of German history. But ""The Reader"" is another kind of Holocaust movie, the memory of the tragedy is vividly present but seldom mentioned during the film, except through a poignant testimony from the sole survivor of a church fire scene: a Jewish woman who came to identify the former guards who pushed the ""zeal"" to the extreme of not opening the doors when the fire was set, among them, Hanna Schmitt.<br/><br/>The trial is the central piece of the film, the one that connects between the opening flashback scenes, set in post-war Berlin and the 1990's where Ralph Fiennes play the older Michael. This is also the only moment where the Holocaust is straightforwardly mentioned through a horrific accusation pending on Hanna. She's accused of having signed the Jewish women's death warrant. How could she? She couldn't even read, let alone write. And this is when it gets tricky: if you personally believe that all the pride and shame in the world don't amount to much in some extreme cases, you'll have a hard time accepting the decisions of both Hanna and Michael, which I did, unfortunately.<br/><br/>Hanna is ashamed of her illiteracy and can't publicly admit it, but then how about the shame of having ordered the deaths of three hundred women? It's not just about being a guard and following orders but about deliberately lying and pretending you decided to terminate the lives of innocent people. Basically, Hanna Schmitt would rather be accused of this crime, accepting to be remembered as an evil Nazi than an illiterate woman. We have to accept that from Hanna's standpoint, a reputation of illiteracy is worth the infamy of being remembered as a Nazi. I repeat myself because that's what the film is about: the boos, the insults and the spits in the face are small prices to keep that secret. <br/><br/>Well, maybe that says a lot about Hanna, as there's something genuinely and unconsciously evil in the way she would rather trade her illiteracy for a crime committed under the Nazi flag, just as if one was 'less shameful' than another. But I had too much sympathy for her, to accept to believe it. The whole trial was extremely frustrating to watch, it's not just the crime but also the legacy you leave. To the film's defense, history already proved that people, notably German people, kept their mouth shut although ""they knew"". But even with the will to suspend my disbelief, I felt like the writing went through an abrupt decline when the trial started.<br/><br/>Indeed, Hanna always talks in such a way to maintain a cloud of ambiguity over the role she played, it's like some suicidal impulses. She can just say ""I was following orders"", instead of ""it was necessary"" or ""I had to do it"", she's like giving dim-witted comments that incriminate her more than if she gave simple but straightforward answers. It's like whatever Hanna can say, she'll say the worst possible thing to lose the jury's sympathy, and it's no wonder all the other guards ended up conspiring against her. Don't get me wrong, Winslet's performance was brilliant and deserved an Oscar, but the script kept me asking ""why doesn't one simply say that?"".<br/><br/>Young Michael knows he can clear Hanna of her charges but after sharing his concerns with his Law teacher, played by Bruno Ganz, he chooses not to say a word, probably out of personal guilt. But even at the end, when older Michael meets the daughter of the Jewish woman, he beats around the bush. Instead of saying, ""she was illiterate"", which means that she didn't give any order, so she was no guiltier than the other women. Instead of firmly establish her relative innocence, he says that she was illiterate, that he had a liaison, and it takes forever for the woman to get the point. And I'm not sure she got it.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" starts like a movie beyond any reproach but as the plot advanced, it felt like the protagonists would never say what 'normal' people would in similar situations, I understand it's for dramatization's sake, but it's a shame that near the end, realism would be traded for plot contrivances."

In fact, Michael offers compensation to those Jewish, but also exposes himself emotionally in front of her, without vulgarity, and reveals her decades later about his relationship with past Nazi guard, and a tear almost mutate from his eye. He implicitly admits guilt, even though he did not know the past when he fell in love with Anna , even though he left her twenty years in prison without the visit, but refused so he will grant a Jewish Yom Kippur, nothing can erase the guilt of the ""Holocaust""! She refuses to receive the compensation funds because this may suggest that the story of the ""Holocaust"" is over, and her house in the film suggests a degree of affluence originally, but Michael is obliged to provide financial compensation in any case, so he is looking for a Jewish organization provided her ...

"YellowManReanimated","6","1","2","11 February 2012"," One of the most poorly written yet well acted films I've seen.
","The writing in this film is atrocious. Is it really conceivable that a woman would condemn herself to life imprisonment because she doesn't want to admit that she can't write? Are we to believe for a second that the Michael character would care so much about an affair he had for one summer that it would decisively affect him for the rest of his life, regarding his future relationships and kids etc? And why did the writer think that he could throw all sorts of situations and ideas into this film from pederasty, to war crimes, to law, to morality, to forgiveness, to the power of art, to the need for redemption, to the subjectivity of evil, etc, etc without actually making any sort of point, except for perhaps one. Being that human beings have an effect on each other first and foremost in virtue of their humanity. It's the only thing that really comes from this movie and it's an important and moving observation but the contrived way he gets there verges almost on the embarrassing at times.<br/><br/>The thing that saves this film though is the acting. Particularly that of Kate Winslet. I've personally been a fan of Kate since her big budget venture in 1997 and she proves with this film that she has a shimmering talent that is still breaking new ground today. She is able to take the most implausible of scripts and characters and create something human and wonderful in this film. She is at times empathetic, tender and vulnerable and at other times hard, cruel and detached. The way she navigates her character's journey and finds truth amidst conceit is truly fascinating to behold. It is a master-class in the art of film acting. Ralph Fiennes and David Kross also should not be ignored for their committed and heart-felt portrayals of young and adult Michael. There are some great supporting performances from Bruno Ganz and Lena Olin too. The director allows these actors space to breathe and inhabit these characters and he makes a good choice as without that space the film would have been extremely poor.<br/><br/>This film is a triumph for Ms Winslet, not so much for Daldry and his writing team though.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Great performances by all. Fantastic job of creating realism in the sets. Approaches the atrocities in a way that can cause some to sit back and ponder it in a new light.<br/><br/>This movie did an amazing job of delving into the ways people behave when subjected to an intimidating and dangerous situation.<br/><br/>It has already been reviewed by so many others one might not feel the need to watch it after reading all the reviews. After all one would know every detail of the movie before watching it, and for me that ruins it.<br/><br/>So I chose not to write about the acting but rather the psychology behind the people portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>Fear of the unknown is a natural thing for people. Fear of how one would behave in a stressful situation is part of that. I suspect some of those who are most vocal towards Nazi criminals have at least a small margin of fear that they might have done the same thing if they had been there. One can talk till blue in the face and make all sorts of oaths, (""I would never do that."")But if surrounded by an intimidating force, such as Nazis, one understands that refusal to comply with orders brings swift execution. One can sit behind a PC screen safe and secure in their home and swear they would refuse, but until the tables are turned and the pistols are aimed at you, you do NOT know which path you will take. And that my friends is mostly what this movie is about. <br/><br/>People ask, ""How could anyone allow this to happen""? Fear is the great immobilizer. It can numb consciences to the point people who would normally be disgusted by atrocities can ignore or take part in them due to the powerful instinct to survive. And when it is all over develop the mindset that it was their assigned duty. ""It was my job."" ""To disobey meant my death.""<br/><br/>It is unfair to blame ALL German citizens. Besides, there were Germans who helped hide people. Blame not the German people but rather the Nazis, a political party that USED the German people.<br/><br/>It would only take a major disaster to see the return of such circumstances. And I suspect that is what some people fear most.<br/><br/>I fear it is already in the making in America.<br/><br/>Why are there internment camps in every state?<br/><br/>They are titled FEMA but they were never used after Katrina. WHY? What are they being saved for?<br/><br/>Think it can't happen again? Think you would refuse to participate even if it meant your death? Don't bet on it..........."

Great actors, great plot, great direction, great production and it has an essential thing.... the SURPRISE ELEMENT! Great everything... more Academy Awards would have been TITALLY deserved! You're gonna cry from the beginning 'till the end... I know I cried... A LOT!"

","Nobody plays emotionally constipated men better than Ralph Fiennes. He has such a marvelous way of showing depth of emotion mixed with disgust for it. I think everyone shines in this film. If you are a wuss about human feelings and acts of cowardice then do NOT watch it. (The commenter who claimed she didn't get the ending needs therapy.) All you have to do is be related to a person who grew up in that era or be their offspring. These people were raised to be polite even if it meant at the expense of truth. It must have been a holdover from the Victorian Era but most of the people who were young during the war and some even after lived quietly with constant pain. Over and above all else one must only show a good face/appearance. Never have scenes in public. I can completely understand why Hanna and Michael could only constantly think of weakness as looking for the truth. I cannot however forgive Michael for not letting the court know Hanna was illiterate. But, that is human nature folks! Welcome to the real world where we all make horrid mistakes all the time and choose to do the easier thing and yes, allow ourselves to be motivated from lust. Love it or leave it."

","When I first heard of this film I thought it was just one more good film because the lead actress had won the Oscar. I was wrong! In the beginning I found the film a little boring story of an older woman falling in love with a young man but as the film unveils it becomes more and more interesting revealing a tragic ending and a never to be forgotten story. The first third of the movie is of a very sexual nature. Hanna and Michael's affair occurred in the summer of 1958, abruptly ending when Hanna left the city. The setting then fast forwards to 1966 when Michael was attending law school. ""The Reader"" is a good film that also makes us think a little more about the consequences of our attitudes in this life. Excellent acting by Kate Winslet and a deserved Oscar."
"TxMike","Null","1","2","27 May 2009"," Winslet's Oscar-winning performance.
","Quite by coincidence I watched two Nazi-themed movies back-to-back, this one and ""Valkyrie."" While they are quite different movies, together they offer some very interesting insights into Nazi Germany in the 1940s and following years as war criminals went to trial.<br/><br/>This one is edited in such a way that it jumps back and forth in time, but the early part is in 1958 when David Kross as the Young Michael Berg is seen very sick, at what turns out to be scarlet fever, and is helped by a stranger. The stranger happens to be Kate Winslet as Hanna Schmitz, a basic, sturdy German woman who works as a ticket taker and change maker on the city transportation line.<br/><br/>We are also introduced early to Ralph Fiennes as the adult Michael Berg in modern times. He is a lawyer and as the movie unfolds we learn his back-story. We see the young Michael in law school, and later by chance encountering Hanna again in the 1960s in a courtroom.<br/><br/>This is a fictional story, but is a plausible one. Winslet is just perfect as the German woman. There is considerable nudity in this film but all in done in context with the characters and is not offensive. The critic Ebert has an excellent review of the story and its meaning, regarding taking responsibility for what we see and participate in.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW: When young Michael returns in 1958 months later to Hanna's apartment, now well, all he wanted to do was thank her for having helped him and cleaned him up before he went home that day. But Hanna is lonely and takes the opportunity to start a torrid sex affair with this 15-year-old boy (the actor was actually 18). This lasted the summer, and Michael went off to Hanna's at any chance he could. The result was always the same, but soon Hanna made him read to her each time before they got into bed. We find out Hanna never learned to read and write, and in the 1940s took a job with the Nazi SS as a guard, and in 1966 she and 5 other women were at trial for murder. That she participated in choosing imprisoned Jews for execution was lost on her, it was just her job. Michael as a law student witnessed the trial, and during Hanna's 20-odd years in prison sent her tapes he made, reading books for her, but never visited her. Through this she learned to read and write, but could not face getting out of prison and working in the real world as a 70-something woman. She hung herself the day she was to get out."

","Starring Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes, two of my favorite actors, The Reader was what I expected it to be...an absolutely stunning movie rich with excellent acting and a compelling tale. The movie is about how a young man and Kate Winslet enjoy a sordid love affair one summer (sordid because the boy is only 15 and Kate Winslet is in her 30's). The boy falls in love with her but one day, Kate Winslet packs up and leaves without telling the young man and his heart is broken. Later in life, the young man is a law student and Kate Winslet's character is at the center of a huge trial. The movie explores themes of love, loss, and ""what is the right thing to do?"" As with most Kate Winslet movies, there is an abundance of nudity in this movie, which in my opinion, never fails to increase the sense of realism and eroticism in a particular scene or shot...and that goes for all movies; not just The Reader and not just Kate Winslet movies. The musical score to this movie supplements the visuals well and the acting is just top notch. A must-see film in my opinion."

Winslet is mesmerizing as Hanna Schmitz, a lonely working class woman, who befriends an ill 15 year old Michael Berg(David Kross). The two enter into and intense sexual affair and the tender moments escalate by way of the books that the teenager reads to Hanna. Several years later, Michael, now a young law student takes part in a seminar that observes Nazi war trials. To Michael's shock, Hanna is on trial for notorious crimes she was part of when working as an SS prison guard. He actually knows a secret Hanna is keeping that could be her own salvation. <br/><br/>As Hanna is serving a life sentence in prison, the grown Michael(Ralph Fiennes, now a divorced father of one, begins reading books on tape to send to his former lover. So influenced by her memory, he becomes a man possessed supplying Hanna with tapes; she in turn is inspired to learn to read and write. A poignant story of romance and dedication. Kudos to director Stephen Daldry for the simple matter-of-fact atmosphere. Also in the cast: Jeanette Hain, Lena Olin and Bruno Ganz. If you have to go out of your way a bit to see THE READER, it is well worth it. A no miss masterpiece."

No matter what we do in life, we are human, and we are part of a Whole, and that Whole encompasses everything and everyone. There is no evil, there is no good, there is only Us. Us is a Whole that never dies despite appearances. This may sound silly to the egocentric persona, myself included, but the Truth really is...to know all is to forgive all. If this movie doesn't generate a whole different kind of compassion in the viewer...one that helps us see things in a whole new Light, I don't know what will.

","I did not see this movie in the theaters, so the actors and sounds did not grab my attention immediately, but once they did, and they did, this movie became the most wonderful exhibit of studies in catharsis, which I have ever seen. Though I did not suspect duplicity in catharsis as I moved through each scene, by the end of the movie it was clear to me that the writer(s)intention was to culminate the movie with the strongest of the expiations, the opening to the closed doors of the psyche. I don't want to be specific for fear of spoiling it for others, but Kate deserved the Oscar, and I liked this film much better than Slumdog Millionaire, but I wouldn't go so far as to say the Reader should have won the Oscar. SM was a good film, one that deserved recognition, a film that could grab your attention in almost any setting. I suggest that if you find yourself in the mood to curl up with a good book, it is the perfect setting to watch the DVD. Kate as Hanna is amazing, strict to our perception of the more logically oriented women of the Deutschland. It is surprising to see what delights this woman in this role, and that is to KW's credit. There may be one disturbing scene with a stark reminder of Nazi atrocity so you are warned. If the mere hearing of any discussion of the Nazi prison camps bothers you, you are once again warned.<br/><br/>However, if there is some slumbering guilt deep beneath the surface of your heart, which sometimes emerges to knock at the door, this movie may motivate you to open that door. If we open that door, we may be better off for it."
"the-gossip-king","9","1","2","27 March 2009"," Fascinating and thought provoking - Kate Winslet is amazing
","Whenever i mention the reader to people and say how good Kate Winslet was they all say 'yes but so were Ralph Fiennes and David Kross.' Yes they were, i agree but her performance absolutely rips theirs to shreds in terms of not only authenticity, but empathy, sympathy and the large arc in which she creates for her character. I had read the book before this and yes you should read it, it is amazing but the two are very different because the book is short and relies on shock value than emotional depth which is where the film excels. David Kross who is talented plays Michael Berg who is taken advantage of by Kate Winslet who plays Hanna Smitz. This is all before the war. The audience's first reaction is of disgust but it masterfully turns into a compelling love story. The twist comes when Hanna disappears and i won't tell you the twist but you'll probably realize from the trailer anyway. And although Hanna is an evil *&^^%$ Kate Winslet still had me on the verge of tears. I really felt for the character and it is a testament to Kate Winslet. Now that i have raved about the actors i should mention the crew. David Hare the screenwriter and Stephen Daldry the director last collaborated for one of my favorite films 'The Hours.' Daldry's direction is simple but compelling and fast paced and Hare is one of my favorite writers and he keeps up his usual brilliant standard. The score by Nico Muhly was good for a newcomer but was not as good as Philip Glass' one in the Hours. Needless to say i don't know which film i like more, the reader or the hours and i am torn between the better performance, Nicole Kidman in The Hours or Kate Winslet in The Reader. And as my conclusion i would like to classify that this is not a holocaust movie. It has relevance to the story but the story is set before and after the terrible event. This movie as a film is not as good as things like 'Schindler's List,' it is unfair to compare because this is the first film to boldly take on the actual aftermath of the tragedy. Something that i think the cast and crew definitely overcome."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","19 March 2009"," What's in a movie title?
","I'll start with a spoiler-filled synopsis presented in the simplest, plainest way. Bear in mind, those who don't know the story and have decided to read on despite the spoilers, that in the movie the story is told with deftness and style, as well as subtleties in abundance. The story, in chronological order (temporally scrambled in the movie), starts in 1958 Germany, when Michael, a 15-year old student, through a chance meeting, develops an affair with Hanna a streetcar conductor in her mid-thirties. While sexual attraction appears to be the key to their relationship, Michael is fascinated when Hanna asks him read to her various books, initially after their lovemaking and then almost as foreplay. While physically attractive, Hanna is down-to-earth, pragmatic and reveals little of herself. Young Michael does not notice her acute inferiority complex for her illiteracy, which she takes great pain to hide. (Remember that all these situations unfold only very gradually, throughout the entire movie). The affair ends after a few months when Hanna leaves town without saying goodbye after being offered a promotion to a desk job. <br/><br/>About a decade later in 1966, Michael, now a law student observing certain court proceeding as part of his course, is shocked to find Hanna, now 43, in the accused stand charged with Holocaust crime. This is when it dawns on Michael that Hanna is illiterate, which as it happens would be an effective defense to get a lighter charge. Because of her reluctance to reveal her ""secret"", she is convicted for murder with a life sentence. An agonized observer, Michael does nothing. He does schedule a prison visit but backs out in the last minute.<br/><br/>After another decade, now in 1976, Michael has a successful career but a failed marriage. Stumbling across an old book, he finds his feeling for Hanna rekindled and starts recording cassette tapes of his reading to send to Hana in prison. Initially shocked, Hana soon embraces this audio paradise. Then, using the tapes against the corresponding books she borrows, she starts to learn to write. She even tries this new mode of communication by writing him short notes. But while the tapes keep coming, he gives no written reply.<br/><br/>When Hanna is due to be released after serving 20 years of prison term, the matron calls Michael as her only contact, the only person who is able to help Hanna adapt to a new life. Material preparations (accommodation, community links etc) Michael effectively takes care of. But when he comes to see Hanna before her release, for the first time in some 30 years, he is aloof and distant. Although she doesn't show much, Hanna is devastated by her disappointment. She kills herself just before her release. This is not quite the end of the story but I'll come to that later.<br/><br/>The primary theme of the movie is the relationship between these two individuals and how her illiteracy comes into it. While there are hints and suggestion throughout, it will eventually be up to the audience to draw their own conclusion. More controversial is the Holocaust element which many agree is not the main theme. Still, there has been a lot of criticism that the movie tries to garner too much sympathy for Hanna. As the story goes, Hanna takes up the job of concentration camp security guard because with her illiteracy, she has little choice. She is charged with selecting prisoners each week to be killed but in her simple mind, because new prisoners continually arrive, some have to be sent away to make room. Again, the audience will form their own opinion.<br/><br/>It should be quite evident that this movie would be rich with painful and emotionally charged scenes, such as the aforementioned final meeting between Hanna and Michael. But one scene is so blissful and idyllic that it seems almost out of character with the rest of the movie, and that is when young Michael persuades Hanna, who evidently has know little happiness all her life, to take two days off to go with him on a bicycle tour. <br/><br/>One scene I particularly like is not even between Michael and Hanna. This is after Hanna's death, when Michael, following her last wish, looks up Ilana a survivor from that atrocity in the concentration camp. In a carefully preserved tea can is all the money Hanna possessed upon her death, which she wants Michael to give to Ilana. In Ilana's plush apartment, the miserable little roll of bank notes that is Hanna's life saving looks ridiculous. In an elegant and controlled exchange, Ilana and Michael engages in a fierce, subtle sparring. The outcome is a compromise. The money will go to a Jewish organization that promotes illiteracy while Ilana keeps the exquisite tea can  a sign of partial absolution for Hanna.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet deserves her Oscar (as well as best supporting Golden Globe, although it's a little perplexing that it should be supporting) playing Hanna over a span of 30 years. David Kross playing young Michael is impressive. Ralph Fiennes hasn't had his best life performance in this movie but it's a bit of a thankless role. One quite conspicuous flaw is seeing Michael in 1966 (mid-twenties) played by Floss and in 1976 (mid-thirties) by Fiennes. The transition in that 10-year gap is unconvincing but I'm not sure if much can be done. One marvelous performance that deserves recognition is Lena Olin playing Ilana in the scene mentioned before."
"v-v-vinaybabu","9","1","2","16 March 2009"," 'The Reader' Movie Review
","'The Reader' Movie Review<br/><br/>The Reader is an English movie based on the Nazi holocaust which happened during the Hitlerian regime in Germany. The movie is today widely known thanks to the best actress Oscar received by Kate Winslet for her role in this movie.<br/><br/>The publicity that the film received in the media mainly focused on Winslet who had earned a reputation as the big loser at the Oscars, for repeatedly getting nomination for the ""Golden Man"" and then losing out. Though the media mainly focused on the big question of whether Winslet would win the Oscar at least this time or not, the movie and its story are worth acclaim on their own merit.<br/><br/>The movie begins with an adult Michael Berg (played by Ralph Fieness, who is famous for his role as 'Lord Voldemort' in the 'Harry Potter' movies) staring out of his home window. As he looks out of the window, we see a yellow train passing by. As the camera zooms closer to a train window, we move into the past and see a young Michael Berg (played by David Kross) returning home. <br/><br/>Hannah Schmitz (played by Kate Winslet) helps a sick Michael reach his house and Michael pays her a courtesy visit after he gets well. Then a chain of events occur which lead to physical and emotional bonding between Hannah and Michael, in spite of the difference in their ages. <br/><br/>Hannah is fascinated with the plays that Michael reads to her every evening. This bonding between them is presently really well and is a great study of human psychology. Hence the movie is titled 'The Reader'. Later, Hannah takes up a new job and moves to a different place. <br/><br/>The movie becomes more serious and gripping from here on, as Michael Berg, now a law student accompanies his professor and his colleagues on a trip to watch a few Holocaust perpetrators put to trial in the court. He is left stunned, when he discovers Hannah among the Nazi women guards put to trial! <br/><br/>As the investigation progresses, Hannah is forced to admit that she gave the idea of preventing the victims from escaping the church were put up at, by locking it from outside. She is also forced to confess that she wrote a memo after the event, supporting her actions. While she keeps saying that all of the six Nazi women guards had jointly executed the plan, the other perpetrators refuse to accept their part in the crime. Instead, they project Hannah as the leader who issued all the directions. All the while, Michael keeps saying to the professor that he knows something that will absolve Hannah of her crime, but never presents in the court.<br/><br/>In the end, Hannah is sentenced to life imprisonment, while the other guards escape with a sentence of four years and three months. Kate's acting in the courtroom is one of the highlights of the movie.<br/><br/>The scene now shifts to an older Michael who returns to his parents' house, at a time when his marriage is fast falling apart. Here he gets nostalgic, as he touches the books from which he read out to Hannah, several decades ago. <br/><br/>With a tape recorder and a microphone, he spends several hours' everyday reading out the plays. He neatly packs each play and forwards them to the prison, where Hannah is put up. <br/><br/>Kate gives a memorable performance as the old lady, who spends her old age remembering the sweet memories that she had, listening to the plays from the tapes. The happiness that Hannah feels is presented in a manner that tugs at our heart strings.<br/><br/>She learns to read and write now, in her prison cell. We are left in a shock as we realize that she spent two decades of her life, living in imprisonment for a crime she never committed in the first place as she should couldn't write a memo or read its contents and understand them.<br/><br/>She gives up her life one day before her release, since she never wants to leave her home for the past two decades.<br/><br/>The viewer is left with a lasting impression, as the movie draws to a close. The storyline and the multiple-award winning performance by Kate Winslet remain etched in our mind long after we have finished watching the movie. It is understandable that the movie was nominated for the top Oscar honors, though it couldn't convert the nominations into awards, losing out to the ""feel-good movie of the decade"", 'Slumdog Millionaire'!"
"RandyTheRam","8","1","2","13 March 2009"," A New Perspective
","The Reader was one of the most memorable films of 2008. It was also incredibly controversial, as it humanizes the monster: a Nazi prison guard. Kate Winslet brilliantly portrays Hannah Schmitz, the German who decides to become a Nazi, a decision which a teenager struggles to understand after an affair with her. The film seems to be in two parts. The first part is their affair. She is an older, lonely woman, and he is a teenager. She is reluctant to love him, but they bond over his reading to her. The first half of the film is executed perfectly. While some already seem to deem Hannah as evil as she is now a pedophile, pedophilia is not the theme of the first half. The theme of the first half is love and happiness. We know the Holocaust is going on, but it is not even shown. They go away with each other to the country, etc. However, the film abruptly changes. Hannah has suddenly left, and the boy is left sad and confused. Later, in law school, after the Holocaust, he finds out that she was a Nazi. It is here that the film becomes more controversial. He is trying to understand how someone he thought he knew could do something so evil, and also struggles with his newfound guilt for loving her. A brilliant line is, when talking about the toll their affair took on his later life (as he has become unable to form real relationships), he says ""she did far worse to others."" The Reader may be a holocaust story, but its central theme is love. I remember when I saw this film in an advanced screening, the critic talking about the film detested it. He said it was insulting to Jews who were hurt in the Holocaust to humanize the monster. But the hard truth is that the Nazis were people, and the film tries to understand how ordinary citizens could do something so cruel. While the film made me think, I also have problems with it. First of all, I wish they would have filmed it in German. While Kate Winslet was brilliant, it is frustrating that films like Slumdog Millionaire stay true to the culture and speak the language, but The Reader hired famous actors to make more money. The Germans are speaking English in this film. Also, the ""big shock"" about the film was incredibly easy to figure out. I think that some intelligent people might have a problem with the fact that the main character does not figure out the surprise soon enough. Also, the first time I saw the film, the ending dissatisfied me. However, upon seeing it again, I think that it was a simple and profound way to end the film. Another nit-picky problem of mine was its lack of a consistent score, which I personally feel would have added more emotion to the film (but this is just personal preference). But I still loved The Reader. The Reader dares to go where other Holocaust films have never gone before. It is a standout of 2008. However, it is not a ""perfect"" film, and beware, for many people found the film to be insulting."
"colonel_green","8","1","2","9 March 2009"," Well, Winslet's plan to win an Oscar by starring in a Holocaust film worked.
","Stephen Daldry is a director who has started to acquire a reputation for tackling books that are rather difficult to adapt, starting with his 2002 debut, ""The Hours"". This time, he has chosen as his subject Bernhard Schlink's 1995 novel 'Der Vorleser', which was somewhat controversial at the time, attracting accusations of creating too much reader sympathy for a former SS officer. I did not find that to be the case here; what Schlink and Daldry are doing, as I see it, is raising uncomfortable questions and taking the stance that there are no neat answers (which could, I suppose, be called a dodge, or else dramatically unsatisfying).<br/><br/>The film, like ""The Hours"", has a somewhat intricate narrative structure, juggling timelines in 1958, 1966, spans from the 1970s to the 1980s, and 1995. There are points when this seems unnecessarily complicated, but it generally works well. The most effective sequences are the 1958-1966 span, where Michael Berg (David Kross) finds himself drawn into an affair with Hanna Schmidt (Kate Winslet), a Neustadt tram employee. He is 15, she considerably older. Their relationship is almost a quid pro quo of sex and reading. Then, one day, she vanishes, only to return into his life surprisingly in 1966, when he finds her on trial for her role in the death of 300 Jewish women in the final days of World War II. In the later sequences, an adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes, a long way from Amon Goethe) as he deals with the aftermath of these events.<br/><br/>One of the more prurient items of discussion regarding this film is that it features quite a bit of Kate Winslet naked and having sex (though 1 in every 2 Kate Winslet movies might be said to have the same). There is also plenty from the young Kross (one imagines your average young actor would be thrilled for their first role to involve a lot of time being naked in bed with Kate Winslet). There is in our society something of a double-standard regarding such underage relationships; if this film starred Brad Pitt and Emma Watson, once imagines the reaction of critics and audiences would be rather different. However, ""The Reader"" conveys with great subtlety the damage this does to Michael (even before the Nazi revelation). In 1958, while the affair goes on, Michael becomes isolated from his friends and ignores the more age-appropriate Sophie; by 1966, at law school, he finds himself incapable of sleeping in the same bed as a fellow law student; in the present day, we find him divorced and struggling to connect with his daughter.<br/><br/>On the issue of the Holocaust, the filmmakers are quite aware of the risk they run in focussing so much on Hanna; the camera tends to create sympathy, particularly as she is so scared an uncomprehending when brought to trial. We feel the temptation to make excuses for her based on illiteracy. And, at the end, the film wheels out a survivor (Lena Olin, wonderful in two scenes) to challenge this directly. Michael, whose story this is and whose views have been transplanted to the audience to an extent, squirms under her questions. As Olin says, the film cannot offer absolution, nor, perhaps, should it (that's up to you, of course).<br/><br/>Berg's guilt comes not just from his inability to resolve the question of Hanna, but also from his own actions in 1966, and what that says about him. On a much smaller scale, he repeats the moral cowardice of Hanna's generation which casts doubt on whether he'd have done any better in her situation.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Winslet deserved an Oscar for the work she does here (though it's more properly a supporting role, not a lead); what she does with her facial expressions in the trial scene is impressive. Kross makes a strong impression here as well. There's novelty in the presence of actors from past Holocaust dramas occupying roles much more sympathetic; not just Spielberg's Amon Goethe, but Hitler himself, Bruno Ganz (""Downfall"", another film that attracted criticism of too much sympathy for the devil), as a law professor. Overall, a very strong package.<br/><br/>And for those who don't get the title reference, do consider watching the BBC comedy series ""Extras""."

Their relationship includes an important element. Michael regularly reads to Hanna.

Michael is not going to see her again until ten years later, and it will be in a courtroom. She is accused of killing hundreds of people as a Nazi prison guard.<br/><br/>Director Stephen Daldry sensitively paints a picture of a young boy who doesn't really know where he's going with an unconventional relationship and the ramifications of learning something unbelievable about someone you once loved.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet gives the performance of a lifetime as a woman without remorse. And yet, she is not evil in the slightest. She just shut herself off from what happened, disconnecting herself from her past. ""It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead,"" she says. In the courtroom, she seems lost, helpless, almost pathetic. ""What would you have done?"" she asks the judge, and it's not a rhetorical question.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Michael has to battle his own demons. He knows something, a piece of information that would exonerate his former lover but can he bring himself to disclose it? Doesn't she still deserve punishment? And who is he to decide? Those are questions that will haunt him for a long time.<br/><br/>Yes, ""The Reader"" deals with the topic of the Holocaust, but it is not a Holocaust movie.

","Stephen Daldry's THE READER is another fine showcase of the acting range of Kate Winslet. Her performance here is breathtakingly wonderful as she manages to portray one of the most complex cinematic characters of 2008 in fine fashion. It is no real wonder she won the (long-overdue) Oscar for Lead Actress, but in my opinion, the award would have probably been more suited for her much under-appreciated work in the widely snubbed-for-no-real-reason REVOLUTIONARY ROAD.<br/><br/>THE READER's nomination for Best Picture came as a bit of a surprise but upon closer inspection one would realise that the direction, screenplay, and story were simply top-notch. Some credit must also go to young David Kross who performed his role admirably well. Ralph Fiennes is also as solid and reliable as ever.<br/><br/>My only real problem with THE READER was the way in which the story was told; in my opinion, there was no real need for the non-chronological, fragmented approach, as it would have been just as effective (and less annoying) if it was told in a more straightforward manner. Moreover, the film starts to lose its initial appeal after the first 2/3.While the events that occur in the last third of the film are somewhat important, they do little to progress the story. What was done in 35 minutes could have been achieved in about 15-20.<br/><br/>THE READER is a rare gem of a Motion Picture. Worth watching even if it's only for Kate Winslet's stunning performance. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 250 at 232. Highly recommended."

The story is for the most part fluid and for the whole part elegant and superbly crafted. An adaptation of book boosted by Winslet's central and very difficult role.

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","1","2","17 February 2009"," Former SS Guard Seeks Redemption Through Affair With 15-Year-Old Boy  'The Reader' Review
","The Nazi Holocaust is one of the most popular subjects tackled in film, although it is worth mentioning that it is a topic that has almost never turned out a bad movie. Jakob the Liar, despite being an outstanding film, was not so well received popularly, although it's an exception to the rule. Movies that approach the issue of the Holocaust are generally made by filmmakers who understand the importance and depth of the event, and are smart enough to respect it as such, and The Reader is no exception.<br/><br/>Directed by Stephen Daldry, who also gave us brilliant films like Billy Elliot and The Hours, it's an intricate analysis of the meaning and depth of guilt, and whether or not those who have been exposed to it and thus become infected by it are left with the option of redemption. <br/><br/>A young man named Michael Berg falls into a case of Scarlet Fever as a teenager while riding on a trolley car in West Berlin in 1958. He gets off, overcome with nausea, and is sick in the street and pretty much helpless until a woman comes to his aid, helping him home. After being bedridden for months, he seeks her out to thank her for her help, and the two begin an affair despite a significant age difference. The affair is brief but is also Michael's first sexual experience, so he attaches great importance to her. While they are seeing each other, Michael brings over books and reads literature to her between their love-making sessions, and the two grow closer and closer until one day she vanishes without a trace or even a word.<br/><br/>Michael learns nothing of her until nearly a decade later when, as a law student, he sees her in the courtroom being tried for her participation in the Nazi holocaust. She had joined the SS as a young woman and ultimately ended up participating in an event that left 300 Jews dead in a burning church. <br/><br/>The story is told through the eyes of Michael's older self, played by Ralph Fiennes, and the movie is told through a series of lengthy flashbacks. It's a brilliant approach that allows us to see through Fiennes' outstanding performance the depth of the affect that Michael's involvement with Hanna has had on his life. <br/><br/>Michael is put in a terrible position for a young man. He is at one point aware of information about Hanna that could severely alter a case that is obviously being built to frame her for deeds that she could not possibly have done, but he is torn by his emotional connection to her and his horror at discovering the darkness of her past. To speak out what he knows would have a tremendous impact on the rest of her life, but would also approach all kinds of philosophical questions that he doesn't appear ready to deal with, and would also have unknown but probably extensive affects on his own life as well.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a book I haven't read, but my understanding is that the movie doesn't show all of the same nuances and depth that is revealed in the book, which is sort of like saying the meal you get served at a restaurant doesn't look like the picture you saw in the magazine. Of course a movie can't stay perfectly faithful to a book, but The Reader clearly gets the important meaning across, although the last third at some points feels like it's being rushed along. The first hour of the film is pretty powerful, but it leaves a feel that the movie thinks it's told most of its story by the end and should kind of hurry things along.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I appreciate that even though it presents as one of its main characters a woman who participated in sending Jews to their deaths at Auschwitz, it neither demonizes her nor does it attempt to absolve her of her past and ask us to root for her freedom. She has committed atrocious acts that have been buried for years, and the movie supports the theory that people who do such things should not be allowed a clean slate just by the realization and acceptance that what they did was wrong. <br/><br/>But don't worry, I didn't just spoil anything about the plot, because this is not a legal thriller. It's a moral drama with two main characters who are in two very different but very deep kinds of distress, and it is how they handle that distress that pushes the story along and makes it work. It's a story about the real world that takes place in the real world, not a story about the real world that takes place in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Had it been the latter, it would have been a very, very different movie which, by the way, would never have been nominated for any Oscars. Isn't it strange how that works?"
"jwardww","9","1","2","16 February 2009"," No Easy Answers
","The Reader is the best kind of movie, because it engages the mind with puzzling and yet interesting ambiguity. Daldry, the director and Schlink, the author, leave their intentions not so much transparent, as invisible. That is refreshing, when the story involves places and events which usually are presented to illicit one reaction from an audience. That's not the case here; and you may find yourself thinking about the film for weeks after seeing it. Essentially the movie is about forgiveness of others and of ourselves. In this scenario, everyone is revealed to have something to feel guilty about. But because the filmmaker and author present so many facets of the story, no heroes or villains emerge. Is Winslet's character guilty or the worst kind of victim? What kind of background did she have that left her unable to read and a slave to authority? It's a tribute to Winslet that we care so much about her character's back story. Fiennes' character could be equally indictable on his failure to divulge key evidence in the trial, despite his being an aspiring lawyer. Even Lena Olin's saintly writer is not shown to be without taint in a scene that shows her smugly living on her profits from the stories of the murdered. The blurring of right and wrong is what makes this movie so much better than typical Oscar contenders."

"rory_barker078","8","1","2","4 February 2009"," Kate Winslet superb in a smartly told drama
","The Reader is a confident and intricate story dealing with themes of compassion, guilt and reflection. The plot that develops is a reassuringly plausible one, effectively displaying how normal people were capable of extraordinarily heinous acts in extreme circumstances, in this case Hanna's demise as a strict Auschwitz guard who then in turn is unable to develop a conventional life in post war Germany, haunted by her past grievous acts played perfectly by Kate Winslet. Her performance often is the catalyst of the story, the audience and Michael originally desperate to understand her more and she continues to drive the story toward the end of the film in her touching portrayal as a fragile old women. This build up to the climax of the story, with Hanna hanging herself is particularly touching as Hanna teaches herself to read, as the viewer is often confronted with her toddler style handwriting, furthering the feeling of her vulnerability and even alluding to innocence. Although the film is effective in dealing with themes of compassion and guilt, exploring each of the predominant characters morality, the film lacks the sensitivity, or shocking nature when exhibiting the holocaust. In particular a scene, in which the early twenty year old Michael goes to Auschwitz in an attempt to understand more about the crimes committed, features the infamous shot of the shoes stacked up in an enormous pile, as well as the living quarters for the prisoners of the camp. It is probable that this generation has become de-sensitized by these images due to the many references of them in modern culture. The fact remains, that The Reader fails to display the true horror and disturbing nature of the holocaust as films such as the documentary Night and Fog (1955), or even contemporary hits such as Schindler's List (1993) or The Pianist (2002)."

From then onwards, Michael runs to Hanna's apartment for physical intimacy every time he had an opportunity.<br/><br/>Chapter 3 - Each time Michael meets Hanna, he would read her a book. From The Odyssey by Homer, D.H Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, to Anton Chehkov's The Lady and the Little Dog and Tintin the comic, Hanna widens her knowledge, and develops an interest with Michael and his reading session. But when the large age gap and the differences in viewing an issue, they were torn apart, and Hanna left the apartment, starting a new life.<br/><br/>Chapter 4 - 8 years have passed. Michael, now a law student, attended a court hearing session on the trial of the Germans who had assisted in the massacre of the Jews during World War 2. To his surprised, he saw his long lost Hanna, now sitting together with a group of ladies, who were put on trial. What will Michael do? Based on Bernhard Schlink's Der Vorleser, The Reader is a American big screen translation of Schlink's novel on the search of true love and uncovering the truth. All told in a life span of 38 years (where the story begins from 1958 and ends at 1995), director Stephen Daldry enlivens the novel, through the smooth flow of the past to the present. With an excellent performance of Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes and David Cross, The Reader has live up to it's name of being a Oscar nominee for 5 awards, including Best Picture.<br/><br/>Here, we are seeing how Michael, now a lawyer, is trying to help a illiterate Hanna to discover the wonder of books, and how it helps her to explore the outer world, rather than surrounding her life working as a dull and boring bus ticket conductor job. As a kid, his curiosity of exploring the opposite sex has driven him into a physical relationship with a lady who is 20 years older than him.<br/><br/>To show the audience how Hanna explores the world of books and getting in touch with the world of reading and writing, Daldry presents to us a 30 something Hanna wanting to quench the thirst of literature through her almost daily physical intimacy with Michael, and starting to write at an old age, where the novels were read and recorded in cassette tapes. This is the important point where Hanna has found the meaning of her life towards her feelings for Michael.<br/><br/>While Ralph Fiennes delivers a superb performance as adult Michael Berg, it was Kate Winslet and David Cross who has graped the heart of the audience. Kate Winslet portrays Hanna, where from young to old, she was looking for something to clear her conscience. David Cross as young Michael Berg, was seeking remedies to retain his first love and finding the truth on Hanna's decision. Fiennes's appearance as a adult Michael Berg was more on preserving the first relationship with Hanna.<br/><br/>Not to mention that The Reader were produced by the late Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack, which both passed away before The Reader was completed. Of course, this makes The Reader a highly recommended drama to catch it on the big screen.<br/><br/>The Reader was there for you to find out the truth, and to explore the world of the famous authors, who brought us classic literatures which no one would easily forget."

","The Reader is a post World War 2 drama set in Germany. It involves a middle aged woman, Hanna Schmitz, played by Kate Winslet, who works for the transport company but has a dark past and a young boy who falls in love with her. Their meeting was per chance when young Michael Berg stumbled upon her building very sick. Hanna takes care of him and sends him home. Later after he recovers from his illness he comes to thank her, and their affair starts to blossom. Hanna, has a dark history of being a guard in concentration camps, and being involved in mass killings. She's illiterate but has a fascination for literature. She liked being read to. And she requests Michael to always read to her. Eventually she leaves Berlin, after she gets her promotion. Years later, when Michael is in law school, he finds out about Hanna and her past, and despite knowledge which can help reduce her sentence he disclose it during the trial. Hanna gets the maximum sentence amongst the accused, and is sentenced to life imprisonment. Michael, repentant of his earlier actions, starts sending her audio tapes of books, which slowly helps Hanna, learn to read and write.<br/><br/>Its a gripping drama, one of the few which has interested me recently. Kate Winslet and David Kross, the young Michael Berg, have been extraordinary. They eclipse Ralph Fiennes' performance by a mile. Kate Winslet might finally be given the Oscar nod for her role in The Reader, though David Kross, in my mind is equally competent for getting an Oscar nomination, in my mind. Kate Winslet's German accent sounded funny at times, but its easy to overlook such things when you see such a level of performance in front of you. The story is told in a good manner, switching between the present and the past. Little things like the soft musical background score sets the tone of the movie. Kate Winslet does brilliantly to portray an immensely complex character, Hanna Schmitz. She does greatly in distancing herself a bit from the audience, keeps a stone face in front of emotions.

","If any actress deserves to win two Academy Awards for Best Actress in the same year (for Revolutionary Road and The Reader) that actress is Kate Winslet. Kate Winslet is the greatest actress in the world today and proves it again in a stupendous performance in a story that deals with never ending guilt, personal shame and the nature of evil. Only an actress of Ms. Winslet's skill could have performed the role of Hanna Schmidt. Although a concentration camp guard and Nazi war criminal, one can develop a measure of sympathy for this character who herself becomes a victim. At no times does this movie offer any excuses for Schmidt's behavior. She was following orders and it resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, deaths that could have been easily prevented. But was she acting alone? Did she give the orders? Or was she just a cog in a huge murder machine which years later makes her a scapegoat? The audience is presented with a plain-looking but passionate woman who is just trying to survive and has a personal secret which she wants to hide. And although she served in a criminal organization and was party to the commission of horrible crimes, it seems that the real criminals are those who fail to reveal information about her that would have at least mitigated her guilt. Although Ms. Winslet correctly is the star of the movie, the driving character in this story is the boy lover who many years later fails to act to save his one-time lover. The first part of this moving which tries to show the intensity of the initial relationship is unconvincing. There's lots of steamy bedroom scenes but ultimately they fall flat as boy-man is just a little too boyish and Hanna Schmidt is just a little too aloof to convey a sense of a powerful bond. So the audience has to accept as a given that the bond exists in order for the rest of the story to be effective. The movie however does pick up in pace and intensity when the boy now a young man sees his ex-lover on trial for war crimes, crimes that he knows, and has evidence to prove, she could not have committed or at least ordered. The conflict is framed. The players are on the field. Hanna Schmidt is hapless; her secret obvious; her victimization complete. She was doing her job, doing what she was ordered to do. Did that make her a criminal? Indeed, who are the real criminals?<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz is great as the boy-man's teacher and mentor."

Michael is later diagnosed with Scarlet Fever, and has to stay in bed for weeks, to fully recover.<br/><br/>Michael returns to see Hannah after his convalescence, bringing her flowers to thank her. He spots Hannah putting a stocking on her bare leg, as he's leaving. Hannah sees him ogling her. Hannah is in her 30s. And she's seen as being wise and worldly, by the naive Micheal.<br/><br/>Next time that Micheal returns to Hannah's, she asks him to do some chores. When working, Michael gets filthy, and Hannah insists that he bathe, before he leaves. While Micheal is in the tub, Hannah slips quietly into the bathroom. She strips naked, and slyly seduces Micheal, right then and there. It's the start of a summer affair between them. <br/><br/>During their time together, Hannah insists the Michael read a variety of literature, poems, and prose to her. Hannah cannot read herself. And she comes to rely on Michael's readings, to expand her understanding of the world, as well as for own pleasure. By the end of the summer of '58, the affair between Hannah and Michael ends. Michael then attends law school, to pursue a law career. <br/><br/>As fate would have it, Hannah is caught and tried for her participation in Nazi war crimes. Michael is a part of the trial, as a budding lawyer. He had no idea that Hannah could be capable of such vicious acts. It's all a devastating revelation for Micheal, and he tries to figure out how to handle it.<br/><br/>As the years pass, Michael continues to be entwined in Hannah's life, even after she's sentenced to prison, and he grows up and marries someone else. Micheal just can't abandon Hannah, and this leads to his realization, of how deep his feelings are for her. For Micheal, this leads ultimately to tragic heartbreak.<br/><br/>This film belongs to Kate Winslet, who should win an Oscar. Ralph Fiennes as the adult Micheal Berg, is good, but not great. He seems to be trying too hard, to convey sorrowful angst. David Kross plays the young Micheal Berg, and his performance shows an incredible emotional fluency. He too, should win an Oscar.<br/><br/>The bleak, murky city streets of Berlin, set the emotional tone for the movie. There's always a feeling of heavy gloom, running throughout the course of this film. The racy sex scenes between Hannah and young Michael, manage to temporarily jolt the viewer out of the somber mood that cloaks the film. The full-frontal nude scenes of young Micheal, are alarming though, especially since he's a minor. The producers probably thought that explicit male nudity is hip. It just winds up being tasteless and seedy, in this film.<br/><br/>The main reason to view this film, is Kate Winslet. This has got to be the best performance, of her already stellar career. The movie is depressing overall. But Kate's performance alone, makes seeing this film worthwhile."

","The film smacks us right away as a series of moral dilemmas. Certainly contrived by author Bernhard Schlink, whose original original The Reader was an international bestseller. Schlink, a lawyer/judge who usually writes detective stories. He broke with his writing and took on the novel which becomes a meditation on Nazism and takes on the denial of the surviving participants and the incomprehension of Germans like Michael who were born in the aftermath. The questions are fair onesthat perhaps resonate more deeply in the 21st Century. What of the role of guilt in victims, guilt of the perpetrators, guilt of the individuals and the collective. What of the justice, the forgiveness, redemption and of course, literacy and the role in Western thought.<br/><br/>All of this is a pretty heady stuff for any film to take on its shoulders. The director, Stephen Daldry (The Hours) pulls all of this together with help from David Hare's screenplay and the remarkable cinematography of Roger Deakins together with a sensitive score by Nico Muhly, this is indeed rarefied film-making. <br/><br/>The story pulls us into post-WWII Germany when teenager Michael Berg (David Cross) becomes ill and is helped home by Hanna, a stranger twice his age (Kate Winslet). Naturally, when Michael recovers from scarlet fever and seeks out his healer Hanna to thank her, the two become passionate. David Kross is amazing as the young Michael. Some say the key role in the film. As the two are quickly drawn into this passionate but secretive affair, Michael discovers that Hanna loves being read to and their physical relationship deepens. Despite their intense bond, Hanna mysteriously disappears one day. Michael is left heartbroken. Eight years later, while Michael is a law student observing the Nazi war crime trials, he is stunned to find Hanna - this time as a defendant in the courtroom. As Hanna's past is revealed, Michael uncovers a deep secret that will impact both of their lives. The Reader is a wonderful story. <br/><br/>Kate Winslet is magnificent, especially her scenes with the wonderful David Kross are filled with compelling, contradictory and totally believable undertones. I think the problems with the film on the shoulders of director Stephen Daldry. Some of the scenes are confusing and painfully long with little point. His other films like ""Billy Elliot"" and ""The Hours"" have some of the same issues with long drawn out scenes. Ralph Fiennes who I always find to be amazing in everything he does, has some wonderful moments with Winslet and they are able to keep the mood almost haunting of what could have been. <br/><br/>In the end we are left with a good movie, but one that could have been better. The acting is superb with some surprising feelings. The Oscar nomination will find this movie an audience that it might not have found otherwise, ***/**** .<br/><br/> The posters for the film are all designed the same way with snippets of the face thing either done on small or large scale.

The story means his choice as the key to its significance, but most of us American viewers will resolve that the movie is about the war crimes of the Nazis and their reaction by post-war German generations. Though I have always been interested in the coping post-WWII societies who committed the most pivotal atrocities of the war, namely Germany and Japan, that's not what the film meant to me. I found Kate Winslet's performance, and frankly her nude beauty, entranced me, and I was entrenched in a sort of existential concern for the well-laid plot in terms of how it affected her.<br/><br/>This wise historical psychological drama's basic premise is a sexual relationship between Winslet, a mysterious and emotionally withholding woman in her mid-30s, and a 15-year- old boy played by David Kross. Whether or not such things are wrong, which really they aren't, or socially illicit, which they generally are, is not concerned here. The only thing that matters to the kid being intensely absorbed in the discovery of his sexuality. We are unsure of what matters to her, and perhaps she is, too, but the reality is there. She is aloof yet demanding with sex, it being obvious to her that a 15-year-old virgin would have absolutely no problem with that, but it seems to care more that he read to her. The film's three-time Oscar-nominated, BAFTA- and Tony-winning director Stephen Daldry depicts them almost entirely through nudity because when they are together, they are about nothing else.<br/><br/>It happens, and the story, to me, is about the surprise life holds for a transitory relationship of both intense passion and total anonymity, how it links her earlier life and his later one. It is told in a flashback format and powerfully acted by Winslet and Kross, with Ralph Fiennes coldly enigmatic as the elder version of the character. The film is marketed as being as if Fiennes is the male lead, but Winslet and Kross are the core essence of the movie. This digital feature, only Daldry's third film and yet his third critical success, begins with Fiennes parting awkwardly with a one-night stand before watching an S-Bahn pass by outside, which leads us to flash back to another tram in 1958 Neustadt. An unhappy-looking teenaged Kross gets off but wanders around the streets. The following is shot almost entirely in shadows and silhouettes: He finally pauses in the entryway of a nearby apartment building where he starts to vomit. The tram conductor, a woman, yes, her, comes by and coldly, pragmatically helps him.<br/><br/>Winslet's character, who puts up a dominant, almost masculine, front, is indirectly deconstructed by not only a shocked Kross but characters who truly haven't met her before the surprising revelation about her. They get nowhere. One can't forgive what we learn she's done, but is that all there is to her? There is pressure in all societies to do what everyone else is doing, pressure much bigger than any single society. What would we have done if we were Germans during Hitler's rise? If we had been Jewish, we would've tried to flee, and we'd either be lucky or not so much. But if we weren't? Bernhard Schlink's story is a realization that many people are like these two characters, and nearly all of us have secrets that we would do unforgivable things to keep."

","The book was impressive. The film - up to the final scenes fairly gripping and fairly true to the book. The issues of legality versus morality well brought out; the effect of hidden secrets on people's lives; the effect of a love affair - all dramatic and excellently acted and portrayed. But . . . . . . having praised the good bits, why was this not a German language film with sub-titles (as was the much better 'The Lives of Others'). The cod German-English accents are a joke. Kate Winslet is very watchable - but the amount of gratuitous nudity unnecessary. I felt she was miscast, and there was too much 'look at me' in her role. (Kristin Scott Thomas better deserves the Oscar for 'Il y'a Longtemps Que Je T'aime). The other acting was excellent. Despite these criticisms, the film pretty well held me until the final scenes - in New York and at the graveside. Mawkish, over-sentimental and totally unnecessary."

","When I watched the screener, alone at home with nothing but my own thoughts, I was pleasantly surprised at how fast paced the film started. It was sexy and intriguing. I did question Hanna (Kate Winslet) temperament at times but it worked for me.<br/><br/>Everything fell apart when Hanna skipped town on the mousy boy Michael. I bought into his love for her. That was clear. I just didn't accept her doggedness in keeping her illiteracy a secret. It was absurd. Of course, in real life, most people who can't read or write are ashamed and work at keeping it a secret. The absurdity of it all didn't surface until much later when a crisis presented itself.<br/><br/>When he started law school, he becomes this passive, washed out student who takes in 50 packs of cigarettes a day. That's all he did. Go to class, smoke his lungs to tar and kept his distance from fellow students. I accepted his new characterization. It reflected his feelings of hurt and distrust. But it did nothing for story. His passiveness put the story on hold, and me as well (Zzzz).<br/><br/>Then Hanna reenters his life as a perpetrator on trial for crimes against humanity when she worked as a S.S. guard at a Nazi death camp. ""The Kid,"" aka Mr. Passive, happens to be present (contrivance) as a law student observing a real life trial, and what does he do? Nothing, this time rightfully so being that he's only there to observe. Then the crisis comes when her illiteracy could have actually saved her from a life sentence. However, she chooses to keep her shame to herself and take the blame for everything. She would rather go to prison for life than admit that she can't read or write.<br/><br/>Junior realized this and wanted to confront her, to save her from herself and to breath life back into his comatose role. But what does he do? Just take a wild guess. That's right. Nothing. He lets her rot, at which point I wanted to stop watching this film and let the screener rot.<br/><br/>Of course, I continued on reluctantly and I was pleased when the story left his uninteresting youth behind to show a man who was finally about something (working on his relationship with his daughter). The story even became touching as he reconnected with the aging Hanna who was on the verge of getting out of prison after 20 years. But the solid yet predictable ending wasn't enough to save this film from the depths of mediocrity.<br/><br/>""The Reader"" isn't Best Picture material. The Academy fell for the old tricks of the Weinstein's aggressive campaigning once again."

","In 1958 Germany, 35 year old tram conductor Hannah embarks on an affair with 15 year old Michael. Before each session of sex, she makes him read to her. The affair lasts all summer but, when offered promotion to an office job, Hannah quits and moves on. Eight years later, law student Michael attends the trial of Hannah and six other women as war criminals - between them they allowed prisoners to be burnt to death. When asked for a sample of her handwriting to prove that she didn't write the report into what happened, Hannah confesses that she did write it, and is sentenced to life imprisonment as opposed to the 4 years the other defendants get: at this point Michael realises that Hannah is illiterate and therefore innocent of the greater crime. He respects her decision and keeps the truth to himself. Years later he finds the books he had read to her, and begins to read them again onto tape, which he sends to her in prison. Hannah, touched by this gesture, takes one of the books from the prison library and by matching the number of spoken words with words on the page, starts to teach herself how to read and write, writing short simple letters to Michael. As her sentence comes to an end, Michael is prevailed upon to help her with accommodation and work, but Hannah takes her own life before she is released. Michael finally takes his daughter to visit Hannah's grave and begins to tell her of the relationship he has kept secret all his life.<br/><br/>This film is an acting masterclass. Kate Winslet is utterly magnetic whenever she is on screen, delivering a Hannah who is complex and simple, compassionate and cruel, full of contradictions and, quite clearly, someone who is faulty in some fundamental way. Fiennes' adult Michael is equally good despite less screen time, though perhaps somewhat lower key (not that any of the performances are particularly flamboyant). And 18 year old David Kross as young Michael is the glue holding the first half of the film together in a performance of remarkable maturity.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is that while it might be a masterclass in acting, it is never that engaging. Young Michael engages our sympathies, but his experiences with Hannah - particularly the court case and its immediate aftermath - damage him, and the film never fully recovers from the remoteness which then envelops the only really sympathetic character. The only sequence which moved me to tears was when Hannah teaches herself to read and writes her first halting letter to Michael.<br/><br/>This film is well worth seeing, but I'm not sure I shall want to see it again soon. I can imagine it being Oscar-nominated - it is very worthy - but I'm not sure it is particularly entertaining.<br/><br/>And I was greatly saddened to note the much-missed Anthony Minghella (with whom I appeared in a school play back in 1970) on the credits, producing with Sydney Pollack, equally missed."

The viewer learns that the woman cannot read, and her shame or pride makes the character go through many painful and distasteful acts to hide her illiteracy.

","The novel upon which ""The Reader"" is based is a highly acclaimed and much loved piece, particularly in Germany. It deals with German national guilt about Nazism and it is a book which, by all accounts, is a clear, well-defined and gripping piece that has something to say and says it well. This makes it all the more surprising that the film adaptation is so confused.<br/><br/>It is not just a confused piece, but a disappointing one as well, particularly as it is solidly made. It is very well shot and beautifully scored and there isn't, technically, much wrong with it. It is also pretty well acted, though this is not one of Kate Winselt's finer performances and the Oscars have nominated her for the wrong film (when compared with far more interesting performance in ""Revolutionary Road""). There is a particularly strong turn from Bruno Ganz, as a Law professor.<br/><br/>However, the film simply doesn't amount to anything. You never really care for the characters as you have no time to connect with them before they begin to have a wail of a time. The plot meanders, ponderously, through many years and becomes increasingly dull. And, through it all, you're never sure that the film knows what it wants to be.<br/><br/>Is it a Holocaust drama? Not entirely. Is it about German war guilt? Not entirely. Is it about the triumph over illiteracy? Quite probably, as most of the film appears to be about this. There are elements of all of these, but as the two hours of well-put-together, decently-acted drama plays out, the film, as a whole, doesn't really develop.

","A teenage boy named Michael (David Kross) has a passionate love affair with Hanna (Kate Winslet), a tram conductor in Berlin. Years later, while studying to be a lawyer, he discovers that Hanna is on trial, and he finds himself in a position to alter the outcome. Does he act? You have to see the film to find out. The first half is devoted to the relationship between the teenage Michael and Hanna. Ralph Fiennes, who plays the adult Michael in his usual sooky way, reflects back on his decision, so the film is a series of flashbacks. The second half busies itself with the trial, the outcome, and Michael's effort to balance the scales of justice. I was involved up to a point with this movie. It didn't bowl me over. The sexual relationship between Michael and Hanna was meant to be erotic, but it was shot like incest. I suspect the director is gay because he brought no eroticism to the hetero encounters. Michael was filmed as a gay man would film him. Lots of frontals. I felt that there was no sexual interest behind the camera in Winslet. Is that an issue? Yes, it's an issue because we have to believe that Michael would be sexually into this older woman. I didn't believe it. Stephen Daldry didn't, either, or couldn't. To be fair, a hetero would shoot lots of female frontals if given the opportunity, so it's horses for courses. Daldry was simply a bad choice for this story. Because I couldn't get comfortable with the relationship, I couldn't empathize with the characters. Finnes really irritated me, too. His sullen, closed character was simply not an interesting subject for a film, no matter how convincingly he played him."

"leftbanker-1","10","1","3","17 March 2017"," Decent Book, Great Movie
","I have to say that this is one of those books that worked better—for me, at least—as a movie. As a book it just seemed a little lightweight, like a young adult book except you would need to remove all of the stuff about a 36 year old woman screwing a 15 year old kid's brains out.<br/><br/>To me Hanna's illiteracy represents her absence of consciousness. A person who doesn't read is like a child unable to make proper decisions on morality and must simply follow orders whether they are given by the SS, whatever stupid religion you follow, or Donald Trump's minions in the White House. Trump is a great example of someone who doesn't read, who chooses not to read, which is worse than someone who can't read. At least Hanna knew that not reading was something shameful which is more than you can say about the 45th president of the most powerful country on earth. Trump represents the triumph (once again) of the stupid.<br/><br/>The essence of the book lies here:<br/><br/>""Did you not know that you were sending the prisoners to their death?""<br/><br/>""Yes, but the new ones came, and the old ones had to make room for the new ones.""<br/><br/>""So because you wanted to make room, you said you and you and you have to be sent back to be killed?""<br/><br/>Hanna didn't understand what the presiding judge was getting at. ""I . . . I mean . . . so what would you have done?"" Hanna meant it as a serious question. She did not know what she should or could have done differently, and therefore wanted to hear from the judge, who seemed to know everything, what he would have done.<br/><br/>This was curious because only a day later I read this in a letter from my brilliant younger brother: The problem with ""people of faith"" is their inability to accept the failure of their bad ideas, or to recognize when they're being bamboozled by those representing them. When you don't rely on a fact-based ethos, you tend to find yourself confused by outcomes that don't match the faith and fantasy.<br/><br/>Of course, the Germans weren't illiterate, far from it, but they followed a dogma instead of making individual decisions and choices. It's hard work making your own choices which is why people find such comfort in religion and superstition and authority."

This movie is full of clichés, it's almost unbearable. The dialogues are unnatural. The story is powerful, but the way it's told is an offence. What a pity! The first 20 mins of the film are already a warning. Why do the two main characters develop a relationship? It seems totally theatrical, unbelievable. Where does the kid's fascination come from? The woman is a stranger to us, we never get to know her, her character is so erratic and inconsistent: one day she is sweet and sensitive, another day she is a rude bitch. Then the grown up man, who is he in reality? We get a glimpse on his family problems, but are they relevant to the story? In a more technical ground, the film is slow and redundant. OK, the kid is reading to the woman. We don't need to listen to him reading for hours to understand the concept and its impact on the characters. OK, they have good sex.

The first half of the movie is just sex, sex and sex: so I guess you could call it Oscar-baiting porn. It's very unengaging and boring- all it cares about is winning an Oscar. Even Kate Winslet admitted it. Sure, she and Ralph Fiennes and David Kross can act, but you can't give them any real credit or awards in a movie that is pretentiously directed and tries so hard for them to win awards. No wonder it didn't make much money at the box office. This movie meant nothing to me- as David Kross's character meant nothing to Kate Winslet's. It's a big piece of anti-Nazi propaganda where not enough research or history has gone into it to make it even remotely interesting. I hope this movie marks an end of an era- where no movies that only want an Oscar won't get one, and the movies that don't care about success fail. There is no emotional work here- only badly directed, unfocused. The only time that I actually felt sorry for a character was when Hanna (Kate Winslet) was in a café and couldn't read. Then she went back to being a bitch. The most annoying thing about this movie that it tries too hard, only to give you flaws and sex scenes that aren't necessary. Note that this is not a porn movie, but a drama. There is no need for that much sex and nudity. I was never interested- and never will be.

","It is sad to see another book-to-movie conversion gone wrong. Overall this film is certainly okay, but if you've read the book, especially in the original, you will probably be disappointed.<br/><br/>Obviously a lot of the director's and cast's attention was caught up with the usual Nazi, World War II and Holocaust themes. Which unfortunately caused them to completely under-portray the more subtle human angle that was the relationship between Hanna and Michael. Especially Kate Winslet's portrayal of a Berlin woman of the time was very, very poor. It is admittedly very hard to accurately portray a typical Berlin character, even more so if one has never lived in the region and even more so without speaking the typical Berlin dialect of German. Unfortunately all these things are necessary to accurately bring alive the character of Hanna Schmitz and the relationship between her and Michael. It is quite apparent that Kate Winslet could never fully get into the character of Hanna Schmitz, which leaves the whole movie with a rather stale aftertaste.<br/><br/>The book has a variety of central themes: simple juvenile first love, responsibility in an unbalanced relationship, pride and how to deal with the problems it brings, broad human rights questions and philosophical points both small and big. While the movie attempts to bring out all these nuances, it only succeeds in a few areas, and virtually all of these have already been covered by a great many movies dealing with WWII themes. Why Kate Winslet won an Oscar for her sub-par performance is quite beyond me.<br/><br/>Having said that, the rest of the cast are pretty good most of the time, the settings are very accurate and the questions the movie does manage to stir up are important and well done. Overall it remains just slightly above average though."

","The Reader belongs to Kate Winslet: she is quite simply superb. Everybody else, Ralph Fiennes included, slip into oblivion. The sex scenes are- how does one put it?- both erotic and disturbing. When the Kid (played by David Kross) asks her if she- a much older woman- loves him, she nods. But the nod is everything. It means no and yes and also 'are you kidding me?', all at once. <br/><br/>Her past is demonic, no doubt, but I suspect that the viewer will (like me) come out of the movie sympathizing with her. After seeing the film, the question that perplexed me was why did she kill herself? The most obvious answer is Guilt. Yet, I can't help feeling that it might be something else also. Why for instance didn't this Guilt consume her before? And whether this Guilt also included her abandoning- not loving- the Kid, which, as we discover, leaves him permanently petrified- passive and polite? But she couldn't have known all that, could she? Perhaps- and this is the only answer I could come up with- she was ashamed of not being able to read, so ashamed in fact that she chose to spend the rest of her life in prison than let people know this. Like Salman Rushdie wrote in 'Shame', if you tell the secret, it invites shame; if you don't, you are stuck with guilt. Kate's character chooses guilt. <br/><br/>That she couldn't read was the only secret she wished to keep as her own, having no qualms about admitting to her other more horrific misdeeds: it was indeed the defining characteristic of who she was, the one thing that made her, and what eventually becomes our key to understanding her. Ironically enough, once that secret is gone- she does eventually teach herself to read and write with the help of audio-tapes of books Ralph Fiennes' character sends her- she no longer knows her place in the world...<br/><br/>But we can never know the answer for certain, and that is what makes The Reader such a great, beautifully multi-layered- and might I add, secretive?- film."

But I'm not rating the acting, but the overall movie-experience that I had and what I think this movie deserves.<br/><br/>""Deserves"" might not be the right word, because the subject matter is a very ambitious one. And just for that might be rated higher by some people. But the problem is, that apart from the different time lines, the story and the decisions the characters make, leave you indifferent most of the time. And they shouldn't, because of the nature of them. But although Kate Winslet is great and the movie begins pretty strong, it all gets deluded along the way. A shame then, but a movie that drags to long, trying to make a point that is pretty clear from the get go (or after half the movie is over)."

","Leave it to David Hare to write an excellent World War II movie where the focus is hard and center on two individuals affected by the war. A young German boy in Berlin 1958 will meet and love an older woman who once served as a guard for the SS. The things we don't know about those we love. In 2008 a person might fall in love with an ACORN worker entering fraudulent votes for our Massiah. But this was 50 years ago and the issues were different. Hare makes his point in all good time and wanders over a broad scope of ideas before bringing home the idea that we're pretty much stuck with the baggage when we love someone because erasing the love doesn't work even if we want it to.<br/><br/>This is a very sexy movie, and like all excellent movies will interest you from the first moment and hang on for 2 hours.<br/><br/>Where the BUT comes in is this fine film is still another in an endless string of films intended to re-write history to make World War II all about the Jews. This disservice to the Austrians, Czechs, Poles, Hungarians, Dutch, Belgians, French, English, Americans, Catholics, et cetera will eventually come home to bite these propaganda filmmakers. The industry is strongly dominated by Jews (though it's supposed to be a crime to say so) and they ought not abuse this power for selfish interests. Yet the pace of World War II movies with a tilt toward making the Jews the be-all and end-all of the war will be sharply stepped up, and 2009 will have the highest such output ever.<br/><br/>Please give The Reader a try. It's great drama and the propaganda angle is minimal in this one. 8/10."

","I never believed that Oscar always went to the best is out there, but after watching ""The Reader"" I am still wondering what Kate Winslet did in this movie to deserve the Oscar for a leading role? other than having sex with a minor! <br/><br/>The 1st half of the Movie officially should be considered as Pronography or Adult movie as it shows very detailed aspects of having sex which would be unnecessary in a drama, showing them together half-naked in the bed would give the viewer the same understanding of their relationship, there was absolutely no need to go to those details. and in the 2nd half, she rarely had any strong play, a stubborn German woman who was ashamed of her illiterateness? even for the cost of her life! <br/><br/>Congradulation to Academy for its new definition of a leading role as a an actress!!! Sharon Stone should have received hers for Basic Instinct."
"Hick_N_Hixville","7","1","4","4 February 2009"," ""The Reader"" Delivers the ""Goods"" That ""Milk"" Failed To Fake
","When I went to see this curious combination of art-house sex romp and period mystery, it was playing on one screen in an 18 screen multiplex theater right next to ""Milk."" What irony.<br/><br/>I first took notice of ""Milk,"" when I read that Gus Van Sant made Sean Penn and James Franco wear huge rubbery fake penises for ""love"" scenes and other nudity. I figured I would go see that, get the audience reaction, and see if I could keep from laughing and embarrassing myself. It's one thing to laugh out loud during Rambo IV when Stallone starts blowing apart the Burmese, but quite another to do the same in a theater (likely) full of many older, worldly gay men there to see a ""serious"" cinematic tribute for Harvey Milk.. After I read that all the ""strap on"" scenes were cut out, and that there was no honest depiction of the bath house debauchery the period was famous for, I skipped it.<br/><br/>I went into ""The Reader,"" without having read the book, and not knowing much about it except that it dealt with Nazis, war criminals and sex. That was enough to interest me. Shades of ""The Night Porter"" maybe? Not really, but the penis had definitely moved over from next door, and it didn't look fake either. Completely flaccid (absolutely necessary to avoid an instant NC-17 tag), certainly not huge, but a realistically ample ""shower."" It was attached to a barely 18 year old little known German actor who looked like a brown haired version of Prince William fused with a lanky Jonathan Taylor Thomas, and who partook in quite a few of those slow, extended ""European"" type explicit sex scenes with 30something lead actress Kate Winslet, who also showed off almost all of her body except the beav. I was the only male in a sparse audience made up entirely of middle aged, and older women. The movie was not funny, but I did laugh quietly at the thought of the dilemma this might pose for many of the gay men next door if they really knew what was going on so close by.<br/><br/>I also laughed a bit because the other Winslet flick, ""Revolutionary Road"" was playing just a couple of screens on down. Here a stiffly clothed Winslet gets two of the most incompetently mechanical screws in modern film. If ""The Reader"" is all about sexual fantasy fulfillment for ""mature"" straight women, ""Road's"" adaptation of Richard Yates' 1962 suburban ""horror"" novel is an explanation for why the Stepford men in Ira Levin's later horror tale turned all their women into programmed robots. It was the only way those 30 second wonders were ever going to give them an orgasm.<br/><br/>""The Reader,"" beyond its relaxed Eurosex themes, is also a lame thriller. Lame only because it isn't very thrilling. The secret of the story is very easy to spot early on. The core plot involved Kate Winslet and her brief, lusty 1958 relationship with the German youth, aged 15 to 16 then, and how their lives and interactions play out through 1995. Seems that before she became the cathartic lover of an impressionable and lonely teenage boy, Winslet's character was an SS guard at Auschwitz and other camps during the War, and she is charged and convicted in 1966 of commanding a unit of female guards in 1944 that killed around 300 Jewish prisoners by burning them alive in a church (a trademark act of Holocaust brutality) during the retreat from the camps as Soviet troops advance.<br/><br/>The decently hung German kid plays the male lead character both as a 16 year old, and as a 24 year old law student in 1966 during Winslet's trial. The 1958 scenes are lushly detailed period recreations, complete with bucolic and romantic ""wandervogeling"" between Winslet and her boy that vaguely evoke similar earlier scenes in ""Cabaret."" The scene involving the penile money shot is a lingering one where Winslet slowly bathes the youth's taut, naked body as he stands awkwardly inside a claw foot tub in her dingy flat. No, she can't scrub away her sins doing this, but it is gratuitous eye candy for a select audience, both watching it, and missing it in the theater next door.<br/><br/>The male lead as an older man is played by Ralph Fiennes, whose persona is so radically different from that of the younger actor that it's hard to suspend disbelief and accept the two as the same person. Fiennes does his usual; he whisks about in well tailored suits and looks consistently constipated, and sexually aloof. He is more like the duds Winslet is dealing with down the hall on Revolutionary Road than the shy, eager stud she bedded years earlier.<br/><br/>I am also a bit leery of the ""good German"" approach of the film. These Germans seem a bit too eager to prosecute their own kind for war crimes, but as ""good"" Germans will do, they justify their desire for justice with a lot of awkward, rambling philosophizing about the difference between morality and law. Just like they did years earlier when opportunists like Heidegger bastardized Nietzsche to justify acts they now admit are crimes. One thing this movie does well is it shows how it was mostly illiterate working class types, such as Winslet's character, who get what tepid justice is meted out, rather than say, a mayor, or Bundestag legislator, or some AG CEO or chairman, all of whom would likely go deliberately undiscovered and unpunished. Even at that, for someone convicted of ""murdering"" 300 Jews, and sentenced to life in prison, she's up for release within twenty years, and with all the tender support the state social services agencies can muster to help her readjust to life on the outside. Despite all the sex, and decent mounting of the historical periods this movie delivers, I still like ""The Odessa File,"" and maybe ""Marathon Man"" better."
"Vorpa","5","1","5","8 June 2009"," The reader ... will be finished sooner than the viewer.
","Normally I am not a fan of Kate Windslet. I keep getting haunted by atrocious drooly scenes from Titanic and the like. However I must say I am quite impressed in this case. She creates a fierce and at the same time tender character.<br/><br/>But that's about it. She appears to be the single interesting character in the entire movie. All side actors simply go away, have no meaning and form no true addition. Of course we have the male lover, but, this may be highly personal, to me they should have casted somebody else. This guy looks too dumb, too plain, too old and argues as an adult. No wonder Kate has to call him kid throughout the movie, he acts and looks like he's at least 17. Furthermore there is no difference between the young Michael Berg and the Michael Berg a couple of years later. Finally he has a German accent. This reminded me of these old war movies from the sixties where the Germans speak English with a German accent. Hence: annoying!<br/><br/>Besides a good Kate and an annoying David Kross (playing Micheal) the rest of the movie truly does not matter. The plot is extremely straightforward (but does go back and forth in time for no apparent reason, it is not like these flashback are revelations or anything). It is an endless road with numerous meaningless sideways. What about the boy's family? There is one scene in which they wonder where he was the past afternoon. How about all the other afternoons? What happened to the family anyways? Why put in a scene if these people don't seem to matter anyway? And am I suppose to truly feel that this guy loves her so much? What you need is not a dozen or so sex scenes, a group of cute girls that appear and disappear or an ex-wive, but an actor. <br/><br/>*** HUGE SPOILER AHEAD *** Why does she not tell she's illiterate? And how on earths name is a war tribunal unable to find out this sort of vital knowledge? To speak of it, the court is a farce. ""I need a sample of your handwriting."" Are you a judge or a prosecutor or a stenographer? And what use is the conversation between Micheal and his law teacher, another meaningless character, about this subject? <br/><br/>*** AND MORE SPOILERS *** And I could go on. In fact, I will go on. Why isn't the guy writing back, he is unable to open himself up to any girl now? Why does she starts a relationship with a kid in the first place, to forget about things? Why does she suddenly leave her apartment when she gets a promotion? To escape life? I don't want to have everything written out for me, there needs to be room for contemplation so to say and people make a lot of erratic decisions throughout their life, but too many why's and loose ends is definitely unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Now I could have forgiven the movie all these flaws and recommend it as worthwhile, but since it runs for over two hours that is not going to happen. Long movies are okay, but long mediocre movies are simply bad. Steer away unless you are a fan of Kate.<br/><br/>Verdict: 5"
"space_base","6","1","5","30 January 2009"," A beautiful, yet flawed curiosity
","THE READER is a film that is going to perplex many audiences. The reason for this is that is has many of the ingredients that make a film great, and many will see the film as a great success because of these. But unfortunately, the film also misses the mark in a few areas and many film goers will not be able to look pass them. I was stuck in between these views... that is why it has taken almost two days for me to get this review out.<br/><br/>What really struck me off the bat was how great the film looks. Roger Deakins always works wonders behind the camera, but there was something about the look of this film that was just so lush and captivating. There's no doubt that it's Oscar nomination for cinematography is completely justified. Next, direction. Daldry, with just two other films under his belt has gained quite the reputation (with 3 Oscar nominations under his belt), and that is because he has a great sense of realism and the ability to make the audience feel apart of his character's world. Those abilities are put to great effect in THE READER. There is not a moment that doesn't feel completely authentic. Also adding the the sense of immersion are a wealth of very fine performances, by heavy-weights (Winslet, Fiennes) and relatively unknowns. I'm pretty sure that Kate Winslet will take home the Best Actress Oscar this year, but I feel that it is NOT her finest performance and there were better performances from other female leads (Melissa Leo in FROZEN RIVER and Sally Hawkins who failed to obtain Oscar recognition for HAPPY GO LUCKY).<br/><br/>While the film has it's undeniable strong points, THE READER also has some unforgivable flaws that damper the film as a whole. Frankly, it's one of the colder films of recent memory. For such an intimate portrait of these characters, I was shocked at how little I cared about any of them. Even Winslett, the heart of the picture, I had little feeling or sympathy for. For a drama of this caliber, the lack of emotional connection was beyond disappointing. But perhaps the biggest flaw was how generic it all felt. Throughout, I was just constantly reminded of different, and often better, films. I don't know why, but there was so much familiar with the plot and the setting that I couldn't help but be reminded of such films. I know it has been stated to the point of insanity, but THE READER is the definition of Oscar Bait (especially in the case of Winslett, who will once again prove excessive nudity = Oscars). What also didn't help matters was that after a strong start, the film just seemed to get more tedious and boring as it proceeded, to which I began to car less and less (The film at just over two hours rushes through it's plot, sometimes leaving the viewer confused and in a state of ""why do I even care."" The film does build to a strong third act though).<br/><br/>I may sound like I'm ragging on the film, but I'm most definitely not. It's just that in the time after my viewing of it, the flaws have seem to become more apparent then before; and that's always frustrating.<br/><br/>For all it's stunning cinematography and visual grandeur, there's an uneasy sense of ""I've seen this all before;"" For all of the films great performances, I wondered why I didn't care about their characters more; For it's strong direction, I wondered why the film couldn't flow at a more comprehensive pace.<br/><br/>This brings me to the conclusion that in THE READER, most every positive aspect comes with a negative one. This is a shame because the talent on display could have given light to a great film. Instead, the final product is more of a deeply flawed curiosity that some will love and some will hate. A few however will be stuck in the middle like I am. I find that worse than the two extremes."
"hjames-97822","1","1","6","9 April 2015"," Played To Enrich The Producers and the Director.
","In all fairness I had read the novel long before the film was even cast. It has long been very popular in Europe and is even required reading in many high school level classes.<br/><br/>This film is well done in may ways and honestly has some wonderful dialog and some scenes that are no less than wrenching. It also confronts a political past that is being too soon swept under the proverbial rug.<br/><br/>I assumed there would be nudity involved given the book and since Kate Winslet was booked for the female lead. She has been in so many parts involving our being exposed to her various parts she has become well known for it. People expect it from her. Let's hope she is banking her millions. When the day no one will buy a ticket to see here (rather bland) breasts at least she won't have to peddle real estate in Anaheim. If you have not seen this film I would at least advise you read the book first. While the film has some very redeeming qualities, I found the novel in this case much better.<br/><br/>Now to why I gave one star. I would give zero if it were possible. I have a serious personal disgust for older actors, producers and directors that manipulate young actors for their own benefit as I believe is the case here.<br/><br/>The character played by David Kross is supposed to be about 15. They needed a young boy actor who could look as almost childlike as possible. It has been documented by some that they even shaved a good part of his body to remove any excess hair.<br/><br/>Now, I am not a lawyer and don't pretend to be. I am told the age of consent for portrayal of these scenes in Germany (and other European nations) is 16 for boys. Kross was contracted for these parts when he was just 16 years of age. Now, the law aside, in my book he is simply not fully grown in any way at this stage.<br/><br/>Knowing that if they filmed this boy under the age of 18 in simulated sex and nude scenes they could seriously compromise their access to the US market, they simply ran the clock out. Portraying a boy of 16 or 17 would like have left them with an unrated film they would have difficulty distributing and that would not be eligible for awards. And that is the name of their game.<br/><br/>So they simply waited to film him a few days after he turned 18 so they could meet the letter if not the spirit of the law. Then, to cap it off, they added this to all of their interview and marketing materials. In case after case after interview the director is quick to point out that he was just days past his 18th birthday when the scenes were shot. He wanted to make it clear that Kross was young, but legal in America. While young Kross mostly sits head down staring at the floor.<br/><br/>I have a serious issue with people who enrich themselves in this manner and with an Oscar for Ms. Winslet for for her being complicit. Am I wrong? Maybe. But I think it reeks of the money at all costs mentality that is typical of Hollywood. Ms. Winslet was more or less twice his age when she did this and then publicly joked about it. Yes, I question her personal morals and judgment too. I'll pass."

","The Reader is part of a rare canon of films, in my opinion, that are bad for wholly uncommon reasons. At a glance, it is a ""good"" film. It passes every sniff test of being so. It was nominated for five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actress, Cinematography, Screenplay). But it only holds a meh Rotten Tomatoes rating (63%). It was a definitive box office success but not a blockbuster. It has most likely avoided the posthumous scrutiny a film like 2004's Crash has because it did not take home the top prize at the Academy Awards (Slumdog Millionaire); it won just a single golden statue (Winslett).<br/><br/>But do not be mistaken, this film is atrocious. It's of an age of cinema that has mostly died off, thank god. At least it feels like this kind of badly overwrought, force-fed romantic, stupidly over-indulgent period piece has gone by the wayside (they at least don't seem to automatically cleanup during awards season).<br/><br/>Perhaps this is all a little too harsh. What's the harm in making a super glossy version of a Lifetime Movie of the Week with A-list actors once in awhile? Well the answer to that is twofold: nazis and statutory rape. Both featured prominently!<br/><br/>There's no real good way to spin this, just as there is no real way not to cringe when watching it. This film bounces back and forth and all over the course of almost 40 years. It's a tired trope, and messily done here. As I write this and we approach the new decade (2020), one can only say about The Reader (2008) is that... it exists. Twelve years have passed, and it still exists. I'm sorry that you, dear Reader, have stumbled upon this review in whatever time/place you find yourself, for it means you most likely have some kind of interest in this movie.

","If you're a fan of Kate Winslet and want to watch the film that won her her Oscar, and you're old enough to handle some very uncomfortable sex scenes, go out and rent The Reader. If you're not old enough, or you prefer well-acted movies where everyone keeps his and her clothes on, rent Labor Day instead for a great Kate Winslet performance.<br/><br/>David Kross stars as a fifteen-year-old boy in post-war Germany who enters into a relationship with the much older, mysterious Kate Winslet after a chance encounter. While it's very clear that David's interest is solely the interest of any hormone-raging teenager who gets within a three-foot radius of any woman, it never explains Kate's interest. On a physical level, why is she attracted to someone who, five years earlier, was in grade school? On an emotional level, why does she want to permanently damage a young boy's mind and future relationships? In their meet-cute, she helps walk him home after he's ill on the street. Leading up to their first explicit encounter, he helps her with a chore and gets his face dirty; she insists he take off all his clothes and have a bath. The set-up makes no sense, and if you're looking at the film through a lens concerned with child abuse, Kate is clearly guilty.<br/><br/>A good portion of the movie details Kate and David's sexual relationship, but as the film starts with Ralph Fiennes reflecting on his youth, the audience is left to hope there's a little more to the story. The plot does progress, and if you look up the film online you'll find out what happens in the first sentence of description. If you want to be surprised, just rent the movie without knowing anything about it.<br/><br/>While the performances of the lead actors are very good, the script is surprisingly weak. There's a shocking lack of character development than not only leaves the audiences wondering why they made their choices, but makes the main points of the plot unbelievable. I can only imagine Kate Winslet working through her script, exclaiming, ""She does what? But why?"" with no one to help her. Given what she had to work with, she did a very good job.<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Although it's about Hanna, but I feel like it's about the boy. I think what they want to show is the main character, Hanna doesn't know how to read, and then by some events happened, she learned how to read and so, she becomes able to read and write. And also they want to show her life with a boy who is way younger than her. That is what I guess of the plot.<br/><br/>This film shows knowing mother language is very important.

","I am very disappointed in this movie too. The director prefers a slow-paced movie...but in view of the subject being discussed, it would make the movie whole lot better if some of the unnecessary things were given lessor importance.<br/><br/>For instance, the sex scenes at the beginning were such a drag and could have been cut really short to keep things just at the right amount.<br/><br/>Other scenes could have been made at a slightly heightened pace, to allow more discussion on important matters and issues that this movie fail to bring out. I will give credit to winslet's intense acting performances which somehow helped me to endure through this slow torture."
"esteban1747","8","0","1","22 May 2012"," Cruel and real
","Life is not a perfect line, people make mistakes and progress. Some do think they are doing the right thing when in fact everything is wrong. This is quite often in systems under dictatorships, where the people have no right to think and to express freely their opinion. Huge mass follows what the leader is saying and some try to do his/her best for the ideas delivered by the leader. This story is about that, a person who thought to be a hero when in fact she was a monster, an illiterate monster. The plot was well conceived and the film was interesting from its beginning. The acting of Kate Winslet here was much better, in my personal opinion, than in Titanic. She was cruel and real. David Kross as young Michael Berg was also excellent showing naivety together with his thirst as a youngster with enough power to satisfy his female. The evolution of the film is unexpected, and adult Michael became a cult and discreet man with hidden suffering. Stephen Daldry, the director of the film, chose an uncommon plot and an excellent cast for a film, which is a good example that there are many real stories worth to be shown in cinema, and may serve for educating the people, particularly the young one."

She has done something no other actress has ever done in the history of cinema.Talking about the whole film, everything was just perfect. The best scene is when they ask her to write on the pad to check spelling and she refuses to, i cannot tell you why,but you should watch it to experience it Hats off to Kates performance in this film.

Kate winslet performs well, if she was supposed to be ugly and nasty ass heck breasts. Any ways I didn't know people liked pedophiles so much because that is the main plot of the story. In actuality the boy was raped and she should have also gone on trial for that. Don't waste your time with the piece of garbage. I garantee you will hate Kate winslet by the end of the movie.

","An adaptation. Like second part of a novel. The scenes, the dialogs, the feelings are same. But option for Kate Winslet and Ralph Fienes makes to born new nuances. Few scenes and the art to explore the deep spaces of writing. Exploration of love and shadows of past, fragility and gloomy story, the novel, the film as parts of definition for crumbs of two existences in which the soul translate lost words. It is difficult to define the whigs of story. Or essence of lives and connections. It is , in same time, picture of a teenage adventure and waves of adult memories. Description of forms for a bleak world . Sketches of guilty and capitulation. Leafs of past as ingredients of present. And letters of escape. As bones of a very long silence."

","OK, so a woman in her thirties has sex with a fifteen year old boy. I know that it is politically correct to assume that this causes the exact same trauma to a boy as the reverse would to a girl. But it doesn't. Boys and girls, men and women, are not the same. You can pass laws saying that they are, but that doesn't make it so. You could pass a law that says that cats will henceforth be considered dogs, but that won't change anything's fundamental nature. This film leads you to believe that the Ralph Fiennes character was scarred for life by his teen-age experience. He may be weird, and distant, but so are a lot of people who had differing experiences. And by the way, I guess you can really count on Germans to keep their mouths shut. Don't tell the court about Schmitz's illiteracy, don't tell anyone about the camps and ovens. Jeez."

","The reader, the movie (by Nico Keuning)<br/><br/>It's quite normal to make a film in the slipstream of the success of a bestseller. The reader is one of the many examples. It's based on the novel Der Vorleser (1995) of Bernard Schlink. Reality is not of any importance. Neither in a book nor in a picture. Imagination, that's what it's all about. But there must be something to believe in. And that's exactly what lacks in The reader.<br/><br/>The Reader is a cheap story, based on the planned success of the German past: the controversial contents of sexual intercourse of an elder woman with a young schoolboy (which is in The Graduate, normal and hilarious) and Auschwitz. With these two ingredients the film can't go wrong, as far as success is concerned. But what about the story? Predictable and in veracious. That she is a illiterate is quite obvious from the beginning, but the director (Stephen Daldry) shows us this feature of her in a educational sequence of flash backs during the process concerning her behavior as a simple guard in Auschwitz where she childishly obeyed the rule Befehl ist Befehl.<br/><br/>How can such a woman appreciate the world literature, which is read to her by the scholar? How is it possible that a 'reader' like she is, never during her live escaped from illiteracy? The film is disappointing and confusing.<br/><br/>And, Hollywood, please don't reward actrices any longer with an Oscar when they play the role of an older woman! It's too easy and not persuasive. Kate Winslet played better roles."

","a bunch of unnecessary nudity thrown in for publicity. I think Kate Winslett's nude scenes were to help advertise the Reader. Her young lover, Michael, also shows off too. But aside from that, this movie is OK but nothing great. Winslett is Hana Schmitz, an older woman that falls for a 15 year old and begins an affair. She has him read her lots of books since she is hiding her illiteracy. The first part of the film is about the affair; the second part is about Hana's trial. She is on trial with others for being a nazi guard and letting her prisoners burn in a church. An older Michael is now in law school and is attending her trial. He wants to say something when Hana's illiteracy could help her case, but doesn't. Hana gets a life sentence.<br/><br/>The make up and aging of Hana is very good. But the film does have a slow pace and is too long at close to 2 hours. Winslett deserved all the acting nominations and awards. The subject matter just doesn't make this my type of movie.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Drama lovers will probably like this and think it's great. I thought it was just OK."

Maybe I've seen too many Nazi holocaust films. Narrative devices that work on paper look contrived when portrayed on the big screen eg. the reading tapes.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective Kate Winslets make up, to make her look aged, severely lacked continuity & realism. One minute she looked 100, then next scene she looked a fake 50, then a powdered wannabe 60s.<br/><br/>The performances a good & it gives a different perspective of Nazi Germany & people trying to understand it.<br/><br/>But overall it was hard work to sit through.

"karlericsson","9","0","1","4 December 2009"," touches upon two topics, one of them it does not quite dare to follow through
","First a little lesson in order for you to understand this review. It concerns minorities in a society of power. <br/><br/>In order to gain and maintain power, masonries were created through history. The idea of a masonry was a kind of conspiracy against the rest of society. The members of the masonry helped each other when times were rough, so that for nobody of them times was ever as rough as those who had no organization to help them, like the majority of people. The masonry of course also helped each other to positions in society, so that if one member reached a high position he quickly used his influence to put other members of the masonry in as high positions as he was capable of furnishing. Skilled members of a masonry were preferred, especially in starting up a masonry, but the better the masonry worked the more it could do with less skilled members as long as absolute loyalty was ensured. In fact, if there was a choice between a member less skilled but more loyal a member more skilled but less loyal, the former was preferred. <br/><br/>Masonries can be describes as ""created minorities"". If you already belong to a minority, you don't have to create a masonry. Provided that the minority you belong to like each other better than the surrounding majority and provided the minority is not persecuted by the surrounding majority, you will have a functioning masonry and the minority you belong to will slowly, sometimes quickly, rise to power in a power-society. Now, if we take the blacks in USA. They do not rise to power and the reason is simple: they are persecuted, not openly of course, since that is against the law, but insidiously all the time. There is always some excuse for not letting more of them reach power than a certain quota which is needed in order to seem non-racist. If it was not so, then blacks would have more positions in power than whites because that is the inevitable consequence of masonry. Another reason for the failure of the blacks to reach power is that they are easily recognizable and so would easily ignite a racism if there were too many of them in power. Not so with Jews, for instance, who are so like other whites that the Nazis were forced to put a David-star on them in order not to confuse them with other whites. <br/><br/>Between masonry and non-masonry there is a vast landscape of ""buddies"", ""contacts"" and what not. They all have the same purpose: to gain and maintain power. That's the way it is.<br/><br/>The majority of people are always poor and far from having any influence in society. Those are the ones that are being toyed with as with, for instance, the poor woman in this film. All she is left with is doing a good job as employee. She is fragile and has very little self-esteem and would it become common knowledge that she cannot even read, she would rather kill herself than letting this happen. It is made clear in the film that it wasn't inability, like dyslexia, that made her an illiterate, so the only other choice we have is extreme poverty or abuse in childhood as an explanation.<br/><br/>Who has most guilt in a war and/or a holocaust? The profiteer, who makes money on it or the poor person who is left with the dirty work? Knowing how dementia has grown strong in society in later years, I allow myself to state the obvious (which this film doesn't, by the way, probably because the makers think that people are less dumb than I think that they are): You have as much guilt for anything as you have influence to change that thing. The extremely poor have practically no guilt and the extremely rich have practically all guilt. When those with all the guilt sit to judge over those with no guilt - then shame has over-crossed every conceivable boundary.<br/><br/>In the end, the guilt-ridden story-teller visits a rich Jewess in the USA. She was not a direct victim but bears a cross for all family-members that were killed in the holocaust. She doesn't see that she is a profiteer of the events, belonging to a minority which, after the war, had no difficulty whatsoever to reach power-positions in society - the persecution was gone and replaced by its opposite and you can easily claim that after the war, being Jewish was the same as belonging to an augmented masonry.<br/><br/>This film is a story of rich and poor and how, once again, the poor are pointed out as the bad guys and the rich as the innocent. The film does take a stand for the poor but that stand you will have to look for a little. That's one topic. The other topic is the crushed self-esteem of the poor. So many of them are left with so little of it, that they cling on to it even when facing death. This is another great topic, totally deserving a film of its own."
"RickHarvey","5","0","3","18 November 2009"," Had potential
","Let start off by saying that the first half an hour isn't very captivating . It mainly consists of an woman in her thirties having sex with an minor. If you want to keep engaged with the film, then just try and guess the next sex position they'll be in . This is the first Thirty minutes in an nutshell: sex, read, sex ,read, more sex, read, sex, etc. This could be enough for many views to just turn the film off at this point. The first half is immensely boring.<br/><br/>But there still hope. The second half becomes more engaging and turns into the film which you would call a good standard drama. There are some emotionally scenes but there not a lot to say. Its mediocre. Now what confused me the most when watching THE READER was , how on earth did Kate Winslet win an Oscar for this. I'm not criticising here acting as I believe she is an very good actress but here performance in this film was very weak. Still an good performance mind you, but when you know she won an Oscar for it, you expect something more breath taking. The acting was all great, there nothing you can shoot down about it. Mainly it was the direction that was poor as the first half an hour was unnecessary.<br/><br/>The film took a while to take off and when it did it was too late. Poor directing lead to the film being boring and not very captivating . It had potential but sadly it an film that you soon forget when the end credits start rolling"
"rjc2006","7","0","1","23 October 2009"," Great story but...
","I found it fascinating. But I have problems with the morality play here. I understand that the Holocaust was horrible but the woman in this movie portrayed by Kate Winslet is someone caught up in the horror of German dominance. Michael Berg on the other hand, has free will in his actions and his choices are utterly contemptible and repugnant. He's actually worse then the woman he so freely judges. The movie is riveting but has such a sadness that it borders on depressing. It also begs the question for today's society, are you so very sure that you would be able to refrain from doing similar when you have a gun held to your head."
"fwomp","6","0","1","21 September 2009"," Mixed Morality
","Maybe it's just me, but I'm sort of surprised that the Jewish community hasn't gotten a tad up-in-arms over this film. I mean, it really sets a seriously sympathetic tone for a death-camp guard with unfortunate circumstances. I realize she wasn't well educated and had to make tough decisions in order to survive, but so did many people who came out of the holocaust ...Germans among them. But usually NOT death-camp personnel who were the overseers of those who went into gas chambers.<br/><br/>Still, this film is well-acted thanks to the amazing performance of Kate Winslet (THE HOLIDAY) as Hannah Schmitz, the guard in question. Although I won't take anything away from the other actors in this film, particularly young David Kross as Michael Berg, the boy turning into a man with the help of Hannah's sexual appeal, I will say that, without Winslet, this film likely would've fallen flat, theatrically.<br/><br/>Set across generations of Germans and Germany, the story is loaded with historical interest surrounding the holocaust courts that were set up after WWII. Hannah, not surprisingly, is a keystone for the courts as they uncover what they think is her sole involvement in the ordering of the deaths of Jewish women in one of the camps. Circling back to her time at the camps as a guard, it is quickly surmised (by the movie watcher and Michael, but not the courts) that Hannah has never learned to read, so has those she's about to condemn read to her.<br/><br/>The condemnation is set up in a way that allows Hannah to remember those she's let loose into the gas chambers; a sort of penance for what she is ""forced"" to do. In a similar manner, she condemns young Michael to a life of lovelessness in that he can never forget her, his first true love. And when Michael goes to school to become a lawyer, he and his classmates are soon brought into the case involving Hannah, but only as spectators. But for Michael, much more is apparent. He has the chance to save Hannah from the courts but is forced into a moral conundrum: Is she worth saving? Is she deserving? The story continues as we watch Hannah's prison years pass by. With her age comes knowledge and words. Michael sends her packages containing books on tape that he recorded for her, emboldening Hannah to learn to read on her own. Which she does. But is it too late for personal forgiveness and redemption? The ending hits pretty hard at these core issues. Personal responsibility. Moral condemnation. Rule of law. Historical atrocity. All of these are intertwined to form a patina of the past that blurs the future.<br/><br/>The film is watchable mainly for the purposes of Kate Winslet. Her performance is absolutely stellar. But the pacing and mixed moral message were tough to swallow for me. I'm not Jewish, but I believe that the holocaust happened. And I believe those associated with it, in any way, do not deserve our sympathies. Even those supposedly ""forced"" into these kinds of situations. Where's the morality in that?"
"EUyeshima","6","0","1","2 August 2009"," Haunting Post-Holocaust Drama Falls Short Despite Solid Work from Winslet and Kross
","If you mixed Robert Mulligan's ""Summer of '42"" with Stanley Kramer's ""Judgment at Nuremberg"", you could likely come up with a melodramatic hybrid as lugubrious as this 2008 drama about post-WWII moral ambiguity and obsession. Adapted by playwright David Hare (""Plenty"") from Bernhard Schlink's critically acclaimed 1995 novel, the film directed by Stephen Daldry (""The Hours"") offers the veneer of an important subject in reflecting upon the years-later psychological aftermath of the Holocaust. The source book deals with the difficulties which subsequent generations have in comprehending the scope and magnitude of the war crimes However, the screenplay focuses more squarely on the passionate affair that develops between Hanna Schmitz, an enigmatic, controlling woman in her mid-thirties, and Michael Berg, an impressionable fifteen-year-old student in 1958 Berlin.<br/><br/>The film begins well enough when the focus is primarily on these two characters with Hanna calling upon Michael to read to her during their discreet afternoon meetings. The affair ends abruptly, and he doesn't see her again until six years later when she goes on trial with several other women for contributing to the murder of 300 Jews while she was serving as an SS guard at Auschwitz. The plot turns on a key revelation that is quite obvious from the early scenes, yet it is at this point when the film loses momentum considerably. Daldry's excessive jumbling of the timeline does not help either in overcoming the increasingly convoluted storyline which has the older Michael conveying a deep sense of conflict over Hanna when she is found guilty and serves a life sentence.<br/><br/>Making good cinema out of such introspection poses a challenge. We are meant to empathize with a man who is torn between protecting the subject of his youthful ardor and withdrawing from the horror of the crime for which she accepts accountability. When the plot threads wrap together with the characters' fates sealed, there is a pervasive sense of emptiness since Daldry and Hare cannot move us emotionally beyond the elliptical nature of Hanna and Michael's relationship. This leaves the principal actors to fill in the gaping holes. In response, Kate Winslet gives a strong, nuanced performance as Hanna, foregoing much of her glamour to track the oblique character over three decades of stoic concealment. German actor David Kross is genuinely affecting as Michael, and he brings the necessary vulnerability and eagerness to make more palatable the controversial sex scenes with Winslet. Ralph Fiennes has the diabolically difficult role of the older, haunted Michael, who must come to terms with his unresolved feelings toward Hanna. He is given precious little latitude to flesh out an obviously pained character.<br/><br/>Give credit to Daldry and Hare, however, for attempting to tread a fine morality line in presenting a character whose sense of duty to the Nazis did not end up defining her life. At the same time, they fall short in dramatically connecting her lack of rehabilitation with the broader question of responsibility and culpability for the Holocaust. There are plenty of extras on the 2009 DVD beginning with five separate featurettes. The first is the standard ""making of"" puff piece with the cast and crew discussing the characters and the production, while another is a ten-minute interview with Kross and Daldry about the young actor's casting. Winslet is spotlighted primarily for the make-up and prosthetics she had to don as the aging Hanna. Two shorts focus on Nico Muhly's haunting soundtrack and Brigitte Broch's meticulous production design. The theatrical trailer is also included, although the best extra is a run of deleted scenes, 42 minutes in total, which provide added context for some of the more elliptical turns of the story."

","Kate Winslet has been said her acting is excellent since her early days. She must have already deserved an Oscar in ""Sense and Sensibility (1995), and she was really conspicuous in that film. So it is now quite natural to get an Oscar this time, even seems too late. But a part of an illiterate woman who has the ominous past, is this the most suitable to her? Again she showed us a best acting, but they should have offered to her further good role where she could exhaust her talent for delicate and fine acting, shouldn't they?<br/><br/>Still in this film, David Cross playing the part of young Michael Berg is eminent and gives us his big presence.

"pontifikator","8","0","2","3 July 2009"," The Reader
","""The Reader"" is about damage, betrayal of unimaginable breadth and depth, and the fantasy of undying love. David Kross plays Michael as a youth, Ralph Fiennes plays Michael as an adult, and Kate Winslet plays Hanna.<br/><br/>NOTE: There are spoilers in this review. I've typed in an alert. If you haven't seen the movie, you may not want to read the spoilers.<br/><br/>Michael's damage is shown in the very first scene, as the elder Michael deals rather poorly with a woman who has slept over. The damage is caused by the statutory rape of Michael, with his joyous consent, in the summer of 1958 when he was fifteen; he was the willing seductee of Hanna, a woman not quite old enough to be his mother. Young Michael glories in his sexual awakening, but as we see the damage in his later life, we understand that the effects go beyond Michael, wrecking the lives of everyone who loves him.<br/><br/>It is good to see the movie treat the fifteen year old Michael as a fifteen year old: Michael has no understanding of Hanna and what is going on in the adult world. Hanna makes him cry, a perfectly fifteen year old response to his hurt bewilderment. Hanna keeps herself secret from Michael, begrudgingly telling him her name, calling him ""kid,"" berating him for following her to her place of work. She moves from her apartment with no notice, and Michael has no way to find her. His first betrayal. The damage to the young Michael comes to the fore, and we see his inability to have a relationship with his family and with girls his age. As time goes by, we learn that Michael (still played by Kross) goes to law school in the Sixties, fails to relate to his classmates, and is in a seminar with advanced students. The indications are that Michael is quite intelligent, even among his law school classmates.<br/><br/>As part of his seminar, his class sits in on a trial. The proceedings bring Michael to a shocking realization concerning Nazi Germany. It may have been that the people murdering the jews were ordinary people with ordinary lives, people who had families and were loved. If these were ordinary Germans who became monsters, their betrayal of morals, standards, and humanity far exceeds Hanna's betrayal of Michael. The quandary of how to understand family members who were loving parents at home and murderers and worse at work is beyond Michael's (and our) intellectual powers. <br/><br/>These betrayals wreck Michael's life. We watch the older Michael, who has failed in his emotional life but succeeded as a lawyer, as he tries to rebuild his relationship with his daughter. Our last view of him shows Michael beginning for the first time to tell his daughter of his affair with Hanna and all that followed, and we have some hope that he can heal himself from his deep, terrible wounds.<br/><br/>SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER<br/><br/>As part of his law school seminar, the class sits in on a trial of extermination camp guards, and Michael is shocked to find that one defendant is his Hanna. His shock turns to horror as he learns that her betrayal of him is nothing compared to the psychopathic betrayals she recounts in court as matter of factly as if she were deciding what to buy for lunch.<br/><br/>During the trial, witnesses recount the horrors they suffered in Auschwitz and its work camps, where Hanna was a guard. Hanna's testimony leaves the viewer stumped as to whether she is borderline mentally incompetent or completely and utterly immoral. References are made to Germans knowing what was happening in the Jewish extermination camps and blindly ignoring it, so my guess is that the issue of her competence/immorality is a broader question: can we all be so willfully bind? So mute? And there is the deeper issue faced in Germany of dealing with a family member who was involved in the Holocaust. How could Michael (or anyone) have loved such a person, been blind to whatever was within Hanna (or any family member) that allowed her depraved behavior.<br/><br/>Michael realizes from circumstances at the trial that Hanna is illiterate and ashamed of it. Rather than admit she cannot read and write, she falsely confesses to having written a report which places her in charge of the guards. Michael faces the question of bringing her illiteracy to her lawyer's knowledge, and he chooses to keep silent. When she alone of the six defendants receives a life sentence, Michael bears some responsibility for its severity. He has been mute, when he has information that could have lessened her sentence.<br/><br/>Eventually Michael comes to terms with the reality of his fantasy love, and he begins to dictate books into a cassette recorder, which he mails to Hanna in her prison. I believe this is an attempt not to relive the happy past but to recapture a happier part of it; however, there is no redemption, not even any forgiveness. The attempt falls flat. As in the real world, there can be no forgiveness for the Holocaust. The Holocaust is irredeemably evil.<br/><br/>His idealized love for the idealized woman is not merely shattered. His fantasy is blasted, dis-integrated, atomized. For Michael, the only recourse is to end the fantasy which has prevented his emotional growth as a person. At the end of the film, we see that Michael has accepted what happened and has decided to return to life however belatedly. At last Michael shoulders the responsibility for the heavy burden he placed on himself and others.<br/><br/>This is an exceptional movie that deals with adult themes and problems in all their messiness, and there is no rainbow at the end. Not a happy ending, but an ending with promise. A promise absent not only from Michael's life for decades but from the lives of those who loved him."

Actually I wrote paper on ""Holocaust"" at college but I really learned how horrible it was from the movies, not a textbook. ""Life Is Beautiful"" (1999) , ""The Pianist"" (2002), etc.<br/><br/>For me, this is the first time to see a movie which described the viewpoint of perpetrators, not of the victims. So I thought the story seemed new and unique to me. Also the best reward of this movie was Winslet's outstanding performance. If I could borrow a quote from Eastwood, Winslet ""Just stood there and spoke the truth"", and she made her acting real.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I felt that the movie could have been much better with less naked scenes or love affair and with more depictions of reading and mental interactions between Hanna (Winslet) and her lovely kid. I expected hope for life, not despair, would come to Hanna as a result of her redemption, you know. To be honest, I was not fully satisfied with the ending. If you are eager to watch Winslet's acting AND her voluptuous body, I guess it's worth watching at a big screen."

","From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot, The Hours), it was the leading actress I most interesting in watching it for, as she won the three big awards. Basically, set in Germany, after World War II, teenager Michael Berg (David Kross) meets Hanna Schmitz (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Kate Winslet), a stranger twice his age, after she helped him when ill. After getting better, he goes to find her again to thank her, and they quickly begin a passionate, secretive affair. While they make passionate love, Michael discovers Hanna's love for books being read to her, with titles like ""Homer's Odyssey"" and ""The Lady with the Dog"". Hanna disappears after being promoted, and Michael is heartbroken, but eight years later he sees her again, while studying law, in the courtroom. Hanna is on trial for being involved with the extermination of many women, Michael could have said something to change it, but she was found guilty and put in prison for life. Now grown up, Michael (Ralph Fiennes) still has thoughts about Hanna, and he begins sending her tapes of him reading books, and he does eventually visit her in prison. In the end, Hanna commits suicide, possibly not ready to face the modern world, and it would have been Michael that would have looked after her. Also starring Downfall's Bruno Ganz as Professor Rohl, Lena Olin as Rose Mather / Ilana Mather, Alexandra Maria Lara as Young Ilana Mather, Linda Bassett as Ms. Brenner, Volker Bruch as Dieter Spenz, Karoline Herfurth as Marthe, Hannah Herzsprung as Julia and Susanne Lothar as Carla Berg. Winslet is a great actress, I obviously enjoyed the moments with her clothes off, but she proves a fantastic talent for dramatic acting. Kross is a great young support, and Fiennes in his small amount of time does well too, I can see reasons why the critics give it only three out of five stars, but it is a very worthwhile film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Cinematography and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Kate Winslet was number 55 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 29 on The World's Greatest Actor. Good!"

","Years after a young man ends an affair with an older woman in post-WW2 Germany, she is accused of war crimes. The first third of the film, which focuses on the affair, goes on a bit too long and runs out of steam, but things become interesting thereafter as we eventually learn the fate of the woman. Winslet is quite good in her Oscar-winning role, effectively conveying the conflicting emotions of her tragic character. She is ably supported by Kross and Fiennes, playing her lover as an eager young man and a reserved older man, respectively. Daldry's direction is marked by visual elegance and dramatic moments that are moving but not overly sentimental, helped by a fine score by Muhly."

","Okay, if I were the Academy Awards, I would have given Kate Winslet the Oscar for Revolutionary Road. She was compelling and she showed all different kinds of emotions and she refused to let her character get one-sided. But in this movie, all she does, is screw, bath, bath, screw, read-to-me then we screw...I was waiting for something to happen because I knew the second half HAD GOT to be better. <br/><br/>But, alas, it was not. Throughout the course of the movie, it was made plain that Hanna could not read or write. That is why she had Micheal read to her. But during the court scene, when the other Nazi's blamed the writing of the report on Hanna and the judge puts a notepad in front of her, instead of saying she can't read or write, she takes the blame. Okay, you'll be going to jail for almost half of your life but no one will know she can't read or write. I mean come on!!! How stupid can you be. She was on trail for MURDER!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>The judge probably wouldn't have believed her but still...she would have said something and that would have made this movie a little bit more interesting. But no, instead of saying she couldn't read, she went to jail for about 20 year while the rest of them got 4."

","This is one of those rare opportunities one has, to compare and contrast a novel (Schlink's 'Der Vorleser') with its movie, both being recent and both being controversial. All in all, my take would be that the movie comes out on top. It is more nuanced than the novel, the characters are better delineated, it grips the viewer without the subtle, insidious effect the novel seems to have had on most of its critics (including top-notch ones!). The bottom line, in the novel at least, is that the monstrous behavior of former SS officers is buried in an avalanche of schmaltz, romantic delusions, euphemisms... Hanna's total lack of humanity is at least partly excused on the grounds of her illiteracy: a hard one to swallow, also because it is not at all clear how she could have joined the SS AND a tram company without even being able to write her own name; genocide becomes hidden in childish arguments (Hanna 'gladdens' the last days of many perfectly healthy, innocent young women before sending them to the gas chamber!); in the discussion about the church fire (caused by that nasty Allied air force!), much judicial quibbling is devoted to establishing who had written a report on the fire, and no-one asks the obvious question 'Why were those innocent women locked up in a church against their will?'; the death march (not shown in the movie) is made to sound, in the novel, almost like a pleasant walk before a picnic. In regard to the above issues, the movie performs rather better than the novel, due perhaps to input from non-authorial sources. Therefore, in my view, the movie deserves, perhaps, six out of ten."

","Recently saw ""The Reader,"" with Kate Winslet. Frankly, I don't know why the many kudos for this film nor for Winslet receiving the Academy Award for her performance in it. For me, the story didn't unfold so much as plod lugubriously with far too much time lavished upon the sexual foray between Winslet's character and the teenage boy. I consider Kate Winslet a decent enough actress, capable, perhaps, of delivering an Oscar winning performance, but it didn't happen in this film - not necessarily because of lack in ability on her part. As written, the scope of personality in the character Ms Winslet portrays is far too narrow and limited to allow for much more than looking mostly sullen or abstracted in scene after scene; limitations far to great to allow for rendering a performance that warrants an Oscar. In other words, she did the best with what little she had to works with, but, alas, it wasn't enough for me.<br/><br/>Also, I would argue that the film's subtext, the trial of the prison guards, was an opportunity squandered. I feel it should have been the film's main focus and thrust. To relegate the trial to subtext dilutes it of it's power to dramatize the gripping revelations that would shine a light on what and how this sad, proud woman had come to be sitting in that chair, in that courtroom, before that tribunal. <br/><br/>Lastly, I was much bothered by the complete disconnect between the Ralph Feines (Feinnes?) character as teenager and older man in later years. Seems to me that by the time a boy is in his mid to late teens there is some indication or resemblance to his later adult self, however vague. There is no such connection here - not remotely. The only ""resemblance"" between them is the fact that they are both male. Again, and alas, it wasn't enough for me.<br/><br/>All in all however, the film did have it's moments...."

","The reader shows a kind of love which sets off of just physical attraction but grows into an intense emotion for a lifetimeÂ…..I would say it's a little heavy dose of nudity to start the movie with but how the director has connected all those moments to memories in the later part of the movie is simply moving. I am sure the novel itself must be great second half read but here the real winner on screen is Ralph Fiennes even though Kate claimed most of the popularity from the movie. This performance of Ralph reminds you of another of his intense romantic drama movie The English Patient. The classroom discussions are also a good addition to the movie since they don't take movie off the track but instead help moving it forward.Another thing I noticed was that Kate's body language or dialogue delivery speed did not match that well with her makeup (aged around 60-70 years) towards the movie's end. Also the movie could have been shortened by 10 minutes or so by going a little easy on nudity but on the whole a good quality movie and moving too."

","Perhaps it is the fault of expectations formed after the parade of awards, or, more likely, of those formed after having read the amazing book by Bernard Schlink? Whichever it is, I found The Reader-movie quite unnecessarily sentimentalized. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes, one of my favorite actors, plays so badly that it almost causes a toothache. The final scene, with the daughter and the grave, is simply pathetic.<br/><br/>Additionally, the film introduces scenes that I do not remember from the book, and which by their ambiguity acquire a sinister meaning. When the judge asks the mother-survivor of the camp how many people died in the fire, she answers that they all died. Then he asks her how she survived, and she does not answer. What are we to deduce from that missing answer? <br/><br/>Further, when Michael visits the daughter-survivor, the opulence of her New York flat is in a striking contrast with the pathetic prison cell that we have seen just before. Is the conclusion that Jews, if they survive, always know how to take care of themselves? Lena Ohlin is completely unconvincing in the role of the aged daughter.<br/><br/>Kate Winslett is doing her best, although one would think that, what with the contemporary knowledge of cosmetics, one should age women on the screen much better. (Well, I do admit that I think it quite often - they all tend to look like wearing peculiar masks.)<br/><br/>All this does not take away the utmost importance of moral questions asked in the film (not the ones about German responsibility, asked so many times before): did Michael did what he did from respect for her, from fear for his own situation, from the sense of (legal) justice, or from all of the above? It brings to mind Giorgio Agamben's reading of ""Bartleby, The Scrivener"" and the force (or lack of it) and the consequences of ""I prefer not to""... <br/><br/>I do admit, however, that mine is a European reading, based on great many books and films on Holocaust. Perhaps this sentimental version of The Reader fulfills a useful role, gently introducing North Americans to the complexities and horrors of Holocaust."
"clicherebel","8","0","1","22 April 2009"," Both Fences
","More than a romantic story that revolves around the beauty of Secrecy that transcends Necessity; ""The Reader"" dares the audience to explore the possibilities of German guilt on the Holocaust but carefully dares not to beg for sympathy nor ask to be absolved from it. It provides a view of both sides of the fence. Questions the concept of Good and Evil, the difference between Morality and Law, how man perceives and applies it and subtly exposes the Hypocrisy of Nazi War Trials. Also it raises the issues of illiteracy; how threatening a notepad and pen can be to an illiterate therefore stressing the importance of education as a very liberating tool.<br/><br/>Despite Ralph Feines' outstanding acting career, he failed to deliver continuity between young Michael Berg who fell in love with a train conductor Hanna Schmitz, to the wiser Michael who visited her as an Ex-SS guard in a post WWII prison specifically illustrated at their meeting after many years of estrangement at the prison canteen setting. The table setting was awkward not because it meant to be awkward but because he played it awkwardly. The expected chemistry was absent, Ralph Feines' character felt so out of place and separated from the whole scene; he dwarfed behind Kate Winslet's frail frame.<br/><br/>David Cross portrayal of the young Michael Berg though a little rough around the edges and needs a few polishing, already guaranteed him the spot to be at par with the young Hollywood actors his age and older, considering he barely spoke English a year before landing the role. He is so natural and comfortable with the screen that he effectively evolved from being the naive smitten schoolboy to being the embittered detached law student struggling with a moral dilemma complementing Kate's Hanna Schmitz.<br/><br/>As for Kate Winslet who supposedly said in an interview that anyone who plays a Holocaust role would definitely snag an award. I daresay this to Kate: ""How wrong can you be?"" Kate Winslet's performance is exceptionally commendable; Hanna Schmitz did not win the Oscar's for her but instead Kate Winslet justified the existence of Hanna Schmitz. She transitioned gracefully between being a sweet nurturing lover, to a remorseless monster, to being the victim of circumstance subtly contrite of her past. Kate's acting has gone a long way since her Titanic days and evolved to be a superb stellar actress to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>""It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead"" Overall the movie is good and sort of different in ways of delivery and plot. This is not your typical Holocaust movie. Despite modesty to stand out, ""The Reader"" is emotionally stirring, thought-provoking and contains all the elements that make a good movie worthy of time and penny. You may walk out of it unchanged but it definitely grows in you and moves you in ways beyond words."

","Now to expand & explain my above summary.<br/><br/>Stephen Daldry Directed & David Hare adapted the screenplay.in the same sloppy,disjointed manner they did with THE HOURS a few years back.<br/><br/>The Hours was at least well acted,& Kate Winslet did a more believable acting job in that than she does here. I,for one cannot conceive why she was even nominated for any awards for this very uninteresting, unbelievable and unconvincing role.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT===== SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>She is supposed to be illiterate, We first see her in 1955 as' a street car conductor,I doubt that any transit company would hire a person who could not read. 11 years earlier,she is in the SS & a guard at a Concentration Camp, I doubt very much that the SS would of head her in that position. We now jump 10 more years to her WAR CRIMES trail.She and 4 other female guards were transporting inmates (mainly women & Children). Due to a raging storm,the inmates are sheltered in a church,which conveniently gets bombed,They do not let the inmates out all perish except one mother and child do miraculously escape.(we find this out later). Granted this is a tragic event, BUT i did not believe one iota of it. I may have seen this tragedy played out before, either in a Civil War or Native American story.<br/><br/>All the above is in the second half of the movie, the first part,her sexual escapades with a very good looking 15 year old boy.(they cast a 17 yr old lad & had to wait till he was 18 to do the nude sex scenes)<br/><br/>Granted the lad was 'horney', but did we need to see so many naked sex scenes.David Kross is the lad & he does a good job. We also see him at 23,when she is on trail. How convenient,illogical would be better.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is the lad (Micheal) all grown up in more modern scenes, See while the were having sexy t years ago he was reading to her not knowing she was illiterate. He sends her tapes in prison & she learns to read. I was not convinced,in fact I was bored & talking back to the screen. Ralph is usually much better, here he is DULL><br/><br/>The settings are OK,the aging makeup is good, Maybe some one will explain this to me.<br/><br/>Ratings: ** (out of 10) 54 points(out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)"

","""The Reader"" movie is a sad story about the past generation(Hana) and the young man (Micheal). It became the Oscar awarded movie, The Reader. The sad story really touched. The more i kept watching, the more tears flowed on my face. At first, i thought it was too sexually contented. However, i realized there were a lot of things that i acknowledged that movie. Self-esteem, lust, being ashamed, forgiveness, empathy, massive massacres, Holocaust, the winter death march, etc.<br/><br/>After a lot of year, Micheal remind the his past with Hana, so he still remembers he was the reader for her. So he starts recording many books and sends it to her. When i saw this part, i am crying.

","'The Reader' is a well-directed film, with great performances, but stands sole in terms of keeping the viewer gripped. A well-made film in all aspects, but not an endearing watch for the commoner. Sex goes on and on in the first 60 minutes, while the penultimate 30 minutes are the death of characters? The Reader works in bits and pieces, not in totality.<br/><br/>Pluses of the film: Well-directed. Sex Scenes are truly arousing. Performances are first-rate: Kate Winslet won the Oscar for this role, and rightly so. Ralph is outstanding. Others are passable.<br/><br/>Minuses: Lenghty.<br/><br/>on the whole 'The Reader' holds scant appeal."
