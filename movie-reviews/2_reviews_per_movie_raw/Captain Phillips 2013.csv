","Based on true events, Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips is the rarest of thrillers, the kind that relies on neither distracting special effects nor circumspect character development. Driven by a powerful, soul-baring performance by the inimitable Tom Hanks, the movie never lags, never oversells the plight of its characters, never reduces anyone or anything to mere caricature.<br/><br/>Hanks is the titular captain of the United States container ship MV Maersk Alabama, cruising along the coast of Somalia with a full load and heading toward the horn of Africa. Two skiffloads of armed Somalis close in, ready to board the vessel. They're pirates, working for a warlord in their impoverished country, and they smell opportunity.<br/><br/>If this were a standard action flick, we might see the heroism of Phillips and his motley crew as they fight the evil pirates and save the world. It's not so here. There are nuances afoot; for once, we get the perspective of the lead pirate (Barkhad Abdi) without falling into the easy trap of feeling empathy toward him. <br/><br/>The pirates board the giant ship, clearly pleased with their find. Muse (Abdi) quickly proves himself to be a strong, humanistic leader; he's single minded (where's the crew? where's the goods?) but not sinister. His gang includes a strong man with a quick temper and Muse's own relative, who'd begged to come along on the mission - a mission that, when successful, would go a long way to improving their lives. <br/><br/>The movie is told in two distinct halves: the time spent by the pirates on the Maersk as they search in vain for treasure and crew, and the time spent in the ship's lifeboat as they make their way to Somalia. The villains are conflicted and desperate. And armed. But they're quickly immersed in an impossible situation. <br/><br/>This is one of the toughest, most naked performances of Hanks' stellar career. It's sometimes painful and heart wrenching to watch. He's an Everyman, per usual, but he's not also a savior or a hero. He doesn't suddenly develop super strength and overpower the bad guys. He's just a guy in charge of a boat and its passengers. <br/><br/>Matching him wit for wit while frantically trying to keep his own wits about him is Abdi as the skinny, intelligent Muse, seemingly a veteran of high piracy (though not against huge container ships). Abdi is a wonder to watch; unpredictable and cunning but a little greedy and rapidly running out of viable options. Truly a talent to look out for, Abdi nails this role.<br/><br/>The ending is predictable only in the most general sense. Bill Ray's screenplay does not duck some plausible consequences to the actions of each main player and leaves us with a scene that is as emotionally overpowering as anything in Hanks' previous Philadelphia. <br/><br/>It seems that every time Tom Hanks makes a good movie, people begin to label it as ""Oscar bait,"" as if the movie were created just as a vehicle to earn an award. Captain Phillips delivers a tight, action-packed story fraught with none of the usual missteps of the genre, and if it is indeed rewarded with the highest of honors, it will be well deserved."

","That went a lot higher than my expectations. I was thinking an okay movie, but that was more than just okay. Truly impressive powerful thriller.<br/><br/>The movie's strength points could be summed up:<br/><br/>1. Greengrass's thrillers are really fine, I like his The Bourne Ultimatum with his shaky camera tricks. And here he is doing it again maybe with different techniques. As a thriller, Greengrass managed to make this movie get on your nerves and put so much tension, and that's a success.<br/><br/>2. The Somali crew.. Now, that's some serious impressive sh*t. Some Somali dudes you have never seen their faces in a movie before come and make such spectacular performances, that's something you should admire. It made the movie so believable that you'd sometimes forget it's just a movie. Barkhad Abdi has made a huge step in his career with this movie and that was crowned by his nomination for the best actor in a supporting role. He probably won't get it, but he deserved it.<br/><br/>3. Tom Hanks is just a really fine actor. He was driving the whole thing with his convincing performance. I still can't believe he got my tearing in that scene, or let's just say crying. Greengrass has taken him to squeeze some fine acting skills.<br/><br/>4. Fair screenplay that didn't make you forget that justice should be done, no matter how the conditions the person lives in, but it also pushed the eyes to take a look into the world that would produce such people as pirates."

","What a stunning film - the imminent threat of deadly violence tempered with the tragic circumstances that drive people to such desperate actions made for a very human story.<br/><br/>If Hanks is nominated for an Oscar for this, then Barkhad Abdi deserves a nomination too, because their scenes together were electric - never once did Abdi appear the junior party, every bit Hank's equal as two cunning foes trying to outfox one another.<br/><br/>The best lines in the film were perhaps when Phillips beseeched of Muse: ""Surely there's something other than fishing and kidnapping people you could do?"" <br/><br/>To which Muse replied, sombrely: ""In America, maybe"".<br/><br/>It's a must see, the best film I've seen this year."

","It's fair to say that the movies which have been walking away with Box  Office numbers this year have been either big superhero movies or big  sci-fi movies. If you're wondering whether or not you should go and see  this film because it looks like something a little different DO IT!  This is a film, regardless if you already know the story, which  delivers excellent acting, excellent moments of tension and excellent  use of emotion which ,when you leave the theatre, won't be difficult to  feel at all.  Now if you're still considering whether or not you should go and see  this film, let's address the rumours you might have already heard:  1.There's been a lot of talk about Tom Hanks potentially claiming  another Oscar - yes he simply HAS to be up for contention after this.  True in the first half of the film he doesn't necessarily have to be  all out emotional, but he does enough so that when we reach the second  half and ultimately the final act, we are in as much shock and awe as  the character of Richard Phillips through watching his performance.  2. A few people have said ""too much Tom Hanks."" There's two sides to  this: Obviously he's going to be in the story a lot because he is the  star BUT he doesn't give the only good performance here; the Somali  pirates are truly terrifying, not just because of what they are but  because their characters have a lot of uncertainty making them very  unpredictable.  3. Some people are saying it's overrated and we've seen it all before.  I'm not claiming its the greatest movie ever made, but what I am saying  is its definitely worth a look.  So if you're worried about wasting some cash don't be, it's definitely  a film you won't regret paying for."
"ClaytonDavis","10","240","350","27 September 2013"," Paul Greengrass directs another tension driven film bringing Tom Hanks to the forefront...
","Hours after the World Premiere of Paul Greengrass' newest psychological thriller ""Captain Phillips,"" my heart is still palpating at a hundred beats per minute. Starring the magnificent Tom Hanks in his finest performance since ""Cast Away,"" this edge-of-your-seat thrill ride lands as one of the best films of the New York Film Festival and the year.<br/><br/>An intricate and precisely executed thriller written by Billy Ray, everything about ""Captain Phillips"" works amazingly. It's this year's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" in tension and features not one, but two fierce performances from Tom Hanks and newcomer Barkhad Abdi. A loose dramatization and not a fact to fact retelling of a dark day for an American captain, the film takes us through the days Captain Richard Phillips' cargo ship was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. The film unravels itself with a narrative intensity bringing our hero from the day of his departure to the end of his journey. Writer Billy Ray's detailed and well-structured script provides Greengrass to do exactly what he does best in his directorial efforts. There are definite elements in ""Captain Phillips"" that remind me of the emotional and gut- wrenching effect that ""United 93"" had on so many of us nearly seven years ago. While you will have a near heart attack, you will be in tears by the end credits.<br/><br/>I haven't been this impressed with the work of Tom Hanks in years. Putting every ounce of his charm to good use but digging deep into a character with such raw and emotional fervency. Hanks' dedication and abilities utilized are the same tools used in his first Oscar-winning performance in ""Philadelphia"" I assure you. It's a turn that could make him this year's Daniel Day-Lewis. As his wife, the beautiful Catherine Keener is regulated to one single scene, at the beginning of our film, where Hanks dominates the conversation. Still a cherry on top if you ask me but not something that many will notice nor remember..<br/><br/>Breakthrough performer Barkhad Abdi is simply sensational. With a snarky demeanor as he calls Capt. Phillips ""Irish"" - Abdi plays Muse, a Somali pirate that is layered with pride and disdain for the human condition. Billy Ray gives him such a complexity, hinting at a sensitive undertone but not masking the overtly violent rage that embodies his soul; it's a creative formula that equals an interesting dichotomy. Abdi administers these traits brilliantly.<br/><br/>As you expect any Paul Greengrass film to be, the technical executions are top-notch including the intimate Cinematography by Barry Ackroyd and the tight editing of Christopher Rouse, both sure-fire Oscar nominees for awards season. <br/><br/>One of the amazing things about ""Captain Phillips"" is the final twenty minutes or so. Pent-up emotion that has built for nearly two hours, our hero's last moments with the audience are both triumphant and incredibly vulnerable. This is when Tom Hanks shows his true power as one of the finest actors to grace our screens. I admire the man. He captures the real human condition, both in courage and in the face of defeat. How would you react in what you thought could be your final moments on Earth? Who would you think about? What about if you did make it? Would you be so overcome with emotion that you couldn't focus on the blanket of safety that surrounds you, or would you just crumble into the fetus position, wanting to return to your place of origin? ""Captain Phillips"" renewed my love of the movies. It's what breathes life into my daily routine. It fascinates us and which is why, no matter how terrible our lives are, or how the economy falls beneath our feet, cinema still lives. Free as a bird. I'm in awe of all of this. I feel privileged to share those moments. Not to be hyperbolic or put focus on the Oscar race, which is what I do for a living, but ""Captain Phillips"" showed me what Tom Hanks really means to cinema. Our lives are habitual and ordinary at times, yet someone, every now and again, has the ability to capture those little quirks of our own selves. I think Hanks is this generation's treasure that will be remembered for years to come. I'm in near tears as I write this now. Paul Greengrass brought me personally into a situation that I will likely never be in and examined my frail and defenseless spiritual nature. Connection. That's what cinema is about. Few films do this. Many never will.<br/><br/>To get off the somber note, ""Captain Phillips"" is filled with high- levels of tension. Bring your defibrillator and a bottle of Xanex to make it through the picture as your heart will be beating outside of your chest. In so many ways, it's the perfect film. Real life, authentic characters, and a cast and crew that show up to deliver some of their finest works. A dynamite lesson of the human psyche.<br/><br/>""Captain Phillips"" opens in theaters October 11."
"gt-thereelword","9","112","162","10 October 2013"," Exhausting, Thrilling and Powerful.
","Paul Greengrass has proved his talents with two fantastic Bourne films, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, and two impressive real-life dramas, Bloody Sunday and United 93. Green Zone, while being a little like Bourne in Baghdad, was also a worthy thriller. Captain Phillips sees Greengrass deliver another true story to the big screen, proving that he is indeed the current king of cinematic re-enactments.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives one of his finest performances in a long time. His Captain Phillips is a professional, serious man that keeps his emotions in check while sternly ensuring his crew understands his expectations. As the situation escalates, his emotions begin to creep through. Leading towards a final release that is both heartbreaking and relieving. Hanks' character isn't explored too deeply, but we are nevertheless with him every step of the way.<br/><br/>In a fantastic casting choice, Tom Hanks is more than matched by Barkhad Abdi, who truly shines as the lead pirate. We're given more access than expected to this character – to all four pirates for that matter. Abdi manages to evoke empathy from a character that could have easily succumbed to stereotypical villainy. His performance provides a complex level of emotion to the proceedings. He knows that the situation has easily ran away from him, yet he naively decides to re-assure himself – and Captain Phillips – every chance he gets.<br/><br/>This is no-nonsense filmmaking of the highest order. Paul Greengrass' kinetic camera rises above the sometimes dizzying approach from some of his last films. The hand-held factor works beautifully here, ensuring the you-are-there level of realism is cranked to a ten at every second. As the events escalate, we are always kept aware of what is happening. While skipper jargon and navy terms are exclaimed every which way, care is placed on making sure we still know exactly what is going on. Billy Ray (Breach, State of Play, The Hunger Games) constructs a taut and clear screenplay that compliments Greengrass' filmmaking style.<br/><br/>To call this tense is an understatement. Henry Jackman's score pushes every sequence to an almost unbearable level of tension, Barry Ackroyd's cinematography beautifully captures the sweat and intensity of every moment, and Christopher Rouse's masterful editing brings it all home.<br/><br/>Exhausting and thrilling, Captain Phillips is all the more powerful with the knowledge that you're witnessing a true story. Paul Greengrass and co. have crafted an experiential film that you won't be forgetting in a hurry.<br/><br/><ul><li>thereelword.net</li></ul>"
"billygoat1071","9","74","108","18 October 2013"," Challenging Fortitude
","Captain Phillips is a biopic based on 2009's Maersk Alabama hijacking incident, which was an intriguing story and ordeal of the people involved. This film adaptation mostly plays as a straightforward thriller with only brief backstories. In spite of whatever comment regards to the accuracy this film is getting, it didn't hurt how much of an exhilarating piece of cinema this is. Merits obviously goes to director Paul Greengrass and star Tom Hanks. It's quite predictable what you'll get if you put those talents together, but the result is somehow surprising like you've never see it coming.<br/><br/>There's nothing much interesting happening at the first act when the film was exploring the personal life of Richard Phillips, but that seems to be the point: the dreariness of the intro immediately presumes that he really is just an ordinary guy. Though, there isn't actually enough detail about his personal life in those scenes aside of his job and his family, same with the Somali pirate leader, Muse. Everything becomes more alive when the actual plot starts going. Lives turn upside down, tension rises every minute passes, and the humanity of both Phillips and Muse are becoming more and more visible. It's a down to earth matter of life and death where both sides aren't too perfect enough to succeed or survive, and their actions could end up causing even worse situations.<br/><br/>Even before the release, everybody has already been betting that Tom Hanks will get a nod for this(probably because of the accent or he's just Tom Hanks). Other than mimicking the real Phillips' accent, Hanks really gives his character a palpable sense of fear and pressure. But there is one scene in his performance that will definitely give the viewers a total impact, which it might've made the camera linger. That whole scene could be a trick for some to love this movie even more, but even without it, Hanks is still spellbinding as Captain Phillips. Another amazing performance is first time actor, Barkhad Abdi. Abdi manages to be threatening, sympathetic, and strangely charismatic at the same time as Muse, thus it makes the character more effective.<br/><br/>Now for Greengrass, his aesthetics are all there. Shaky camera bringing momentum in every action scene, action scenes filled with nerve wracking suspense, and sidelines taking place in control rooms. But this is his challenging side, such as United 93, when there aren't any much explosions nor fighting set pieces practically involved. The title might give one an assumption that the film is about a captain who fights off pirates. But it turns out, they're just hopeless victims who do not have a single gun to defend themselves from their armed enemies. The kind of thrill here is anxiety. You will always get the sense that there is something wrong going to happen in every step these pirates take, leading the hostages really need to depend on the government and the Navy SEALs. What's smart about this is it's all mind games. They're troubled by complicated decisions, yet have awareness of naivety. At the second half, the excitement is now relied by figuring out which of them is going to be fooled by whose tricks. By the end of the film, you will then realize how limitlessly enticing it was while realistic at the same time.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is almost just a very great thriller, then it eventually becomes more powerful. Despite of calling his achievement heroism, it was more like a test of courage. The movie is wise to make sure Phillips is no glossy superhero, but a regular human being who gets to face a situation that may lead anyone to trauma, just to sacrifice the risks of his crew. Simply, that may tend to inspire which is why it's so focused to his point of view. Otherwise, the filmmaking did an astonishing job, although you already know what these people can bring. But surprisingly, it still defies our expectations. It's amazing how Tom Hanks' talent can still surprise many, and how Paul Greengrass' obvious style feels unique and fresh (in this movie, at least). Rating the film can be somewhat difficult. It's so engrossing and excellent, it's hard to notice any terrible flaws about it. Later on, it doesn't matter. Captain Phillips is a satisfying ride that ultimately does its best."

","""Captain Phillips"" is the Hollywood retelling of the true-to-life 2009 harrowing story of an American container vessel Maersk Alabama (with Captain Richard Phillips at the helm) being held hostage by Somali pirates. The screenplay by Billy Ray was based on the novel ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" written by Captain Richard Phillips himself.<br/><br/>Playing the titular character, Tom Hanks is what this film is all about. He starts off simply, playing Capt. Phillips as a family man and seasoned seaman on a routine delivery. However when the pirates came, you see him transform into a cool-under-pressure leader and shrewd tactician, matching wits with these desperate aggressors. In the last five minutes, Hanks would give us an unexpected display of emotion which may well deliver him another Oscar for Best Actor.<br/><br/>The four Somali-American first-time actors playing the pirates are a very realistic bunch. They play with wild-eyed and feral intensity, really scary. Barkhad Abdi plays their skinny foolhardy leader Muse, engaging Phillips in a deadly chess game, toe-to-toe. Faysal Ahmed plays the hot-headed Najee, who was the loose cannon of the group. Barkhad Abdirahman plays the young recruit Bilal, getting himself a baptism of fire on his first time out. <br/><br/>When I saw the name director Paul Greengrass in the credits, I understood why the sense of tension and urgency were so well-conveyed. This was that familiar sense of excitement we felt in his previous films, like the last two Jason Bourne films or that suspenseful 9/11 drama ""United 93"". He really knows how to make military operations exciting on screen, as he did for the Army in ""Green Zone"" and the Navy SEALS in this film.<br/><br/>I have to admit I was on the verge of getting seasick with the shakiness of the camera, but luckily I held on despite the two-hour length of the film set at sea.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a different sort of adventure drama, with a topic not too commonly tackled in a mainstream film. We hear of these events on the news, but this film brings us right in the middle of one. We will feel the tension building as the pirates were approaching. We will feel the fear when the pirates were on board. We will feel the desperation and the frustration of being trapped in the middle of the open ocean with no help immediately forthcoming. If you are up for such a realistic experience, then this film is for you."
"Buddy-51","Null","13","17","7 June 2014"," Action the Greengrass way
","Based on an event that garnered worldwide attention in 2009, ""Captain Phillips"" tells the tale of two total strangers, both hailing from opposites corners of the earth, who are brought together by circumstance and fate.<br/><br/>One of those individuals is Richard Phillips, the captain of an unarmed cargo ship sailing through international waters off the coast of Africa en route to Mombasa, and the other is Abduwali Muse, the leader of a band of Somali pirates who are determined to board the ship and hold its captain and crew hostage for ransom.<br/><br/>Billy Ray has based his screenplay on the book ""A Captain's Duty"" by Steven Talty and Phillips himself. The movie, directed with his usual taut precision by Paul Greengrass, relates the story in step-by-step detail, exploring the relationship between these two wildly disparate but equally desperate captains, as a thrilling real-life drama plays itself out on the high seas. While Phillips' self-sacrificing heroism - and that of the Navy Seals who successfully took out three of the four pirates - takes center stage in the drama, Ray is still able to give Abduwali his due, making it clear that the young man has been driven to this action as much out of desperation as out of greed or criminal intent, since illegal fishing and the dumping of toxic waste on the part of foreigners in that area have pretty much depleted the Somali fishing grounds, leaving men like Abduwali without any viable means of supporting themselves and their families. Sadly, piracy becomes the next obvious step in the struggle for survival. It would have been easy to have turned Abduwali and his cohorts into one-dimensional villains, but, to their credit, Ray and Greengrass have chosen not to do so. <br/><br/>This complexity of character is attributable in no small measure to the outstanding performances by veteran Tom Hanks and newcomer Barkhad Abdi, who earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his work here. Together, they create a human dynamic that carries the film far beyond the heart-stopping, race-against-the-clock surface aspects of the drama. Not that the visceral is in any way slighted, for in true Greengrass fashion, the film moves along at a breakneck pace, rarely slowing down to give the audience a chance to catch its breath along the way.<br/><br/>By far, the most effective scene in the movie comes right near the end, after Phillips has been rescued and is taken to the ship's trauma center to ascertain his physical and mental condition. Unlike the vast majority of movies and TV shows in which characters who are subjected to horrifying circumstances seem to bounce back from them almost immediately, ""Captain Phillips"" shows us the true human response to a life-shattering, traumatic event (thanks in no small measure to Hanks' magnificent acting). <br/><br/>It is just this type of insightful verisimilitude that informs each and every moment of ""Captain Phillips."""

","""It was supposed to be easy. I take over ship, get paid, no one gets hurt."" In 2009 a Somali named Muse (Abdi) is in trouble and needs to get money for his boss fast or face the consequences. His plan is to hijack a cargo ship and hold it ransom until he gets his money. When he boards a ship captained by Rich Phillips (Hanks) he thinks he found his answer to his problems, but things only get worse for all involved. This is a true story. It's always more fun to watch a movie that is also a true story and even better when you see one that you remember the events when it was happening. As far as the movie goes it starts off pretty slow but grows more and more tense as it goes on. As great an actor as Tom Hanks is I found myself thinking that this is really a part that many people could pull off. Then I watched the last 20 minutes and realized why they got Hanks. Much like the movie Apollo 13, when you watch a movie that you know how it ends but still end up shedding a tear it is because of great filmmmaking. This falls into that category. A movie that builds momentum the entire time. Starts off slow but by the end you are hoping for more. I liked it. Overall, tense and makes you think about both sides of the event and if the pirates were really evil or not. I give it a B+."

","This is a powerful and intensely watchable film , a masterful exercise in building tension . Director Paul Greengrass has established himself as a huge talent . This is the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years . The first encounter with the young Somalis who chase and board the gigantic Maersk Alabama is on the shores of their homeland, delving , briefly but significantly , into the poverty that drives fishermen to risk life and limb in pursuit of deep sea big game . As the crew of an American cargo ship is hijacked by Somali pirates who proceed to engage in escalating negotiations with authorities to get a lot of money . Amongst the men on board are the ship's captain who along with the rest of the seamen are taken hostage in a cynical game of life and death.<br/><br/>It's a grade A picture , a gem , absorbing , riveting , highly moving , incredibly tense . This is a psychological drama in which a group of violent pirates demand for a ransom of millions of dollars , it unfolds a battle of wits between the crew of the shipping company and the Somali pirates . This is a smart and sensitive thriller filled with noisy action , thrills , emotion and very entertaining though overlong . Thrilling as well as exciting confrontation of wits between captain Phillips , seamen and pirates , who gradually come to up more and more . This drama about the capture on the high seas of an American ship is doubtless the most exciting one that has ever come down the pike about . This nail-biter is a tightly-knit drama centered on the relentless sea maneuvers of a freighter pursued by a band of pirates and the captain's subsequent kidnapping . The picture makes up for it with an evolving atmosphere of anxiety and fear . <br/><br/>Everything in Paul Greengrass's impressive film looks so real that you might think it's a high resolution videotape of a pirate hijacking . Interesting screenplay , being based upon the book ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" . And the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama and hostage-taking of Captain Phillips were also central to the Elmore Leonard novel Djibouti (2010). The timing of the release coincides with the theatrical release of a Danish movie titled ""Kapringen"" or ¨A Hijacking¨ (2012) by Tobias Lindholm dealing with similar events . Top-notch performance by Tom Hanks as a clever as well astute captain along with a remaining support cast formed by unknown African players . Tom Hanks says the first time he met the actors playing the Somali pirates was when they started filming the pirates taking over the bridge , Paul Greengrass mentioned he did this intentionally to build up tension between the actors on board the ship and the actors playing the Somaili pirates. In ¨Captain Phillips¨ there is the urgent hand-held camera-work, a directorial trademark refined and perfected by cameraman Barry Ackroyd , which lends an air of pseudo-documentary authenticity to carefully staged reconstructions, putting us right there in the huddle of the action . Furthermore , a tense as well as enjoyable musical score by Henry Jackman .<br/><br/>The motion picture was compellingly directed by Paul Greengrass who proved his action aesthetics and nail-biting filmmaking as well as he formerly made in ¨Green zone¨, ¨The Bourne ultimatum¨ , ¨United 93¨, ¨Bourne supremacy¨ , ¨Bloody Sunday¨, among others . Rating : Above average , a magnificent film . Essential and indispensable seeing . The picture will appeal to Tom Hanks fans ."

It exceeded my expectation in every single way possible and let's just say I had a really high expectation to begin with. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie was stunning. Hank did an amazing job as a likable Captain Phillips while Barkhad exceeds in his character as a scary villain yet someone who we feel like deserves our empathy too. The production design in this movie is really well done and the directing is FREAKING amazing.The pacing of this movie is great and I loved the way they delivered the climax. The way they blend the emotion and tension in this movie was pretty balance without over doing it. <br/><br/>My experience with this movie is honestly one of the best two hours of my life.

"rooee","7","33","60","24 October 2013"," I'm just a cook...
","Cinema has come a long way since Under Siege. The titular hero of this story is no expert in hand-to-hand or weapons and tactics. He's definitely not a cook.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is Richard Phillips, captain of the Alabama cargo ship, en route to Mombasa via Somali no-man's water. Muse (impressive newcomer Barkhad Abdi) arrives with a handpicked crew of pirates, and they board the Alabama. Nail-biting tension and hostage-taking will follow. It's best that one goes into the film knowing no more.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass is the best director working today in the authentic documentary aesthetic. He knows that the drama is in the detail. Captain Phillips' most thrilling moments are when Greengrass is most exacting and pedantic about characters' relative positions within the environment. That sounds kind of formal, but then Greengrass's shaky-cam does veil an essential precision. He focuses on the immediate situation, leaving us the viewers to picture it in the wider political context.<br/><br/>As with Kathryn Bigelow, Greengrass's anti-polemical style is occasionally a curse but mostly a blessing. The action may occur on the surface, but there's depth beneath the objectivity – perhaps best encapsulated in the image of three mighty US warships surrounding a tiny craft in international waters.<br/><br/>The implicit themes are globalisation and imperialism. The opportunism of the pirates is met with a defence based on an escalating chain of command. It's chaos versus structure; improvisation versus meticulous contingency planning. Money is nothing without an entrenched system to contain it and protect it. Sorry, Africa – we'll throw food parcels in your direction but we won't help you build long-term infrastructure plans, and you sure as hell can't step on ""our"" turf.<br/><br/>When the pirates are first approaching the Alabama, Muse presents his gang as seaborne law enforcers, and I couldn't help thinking of the United States' assumed position as ""world police""...<br/><br/>More than anything, Captain Phillips reminds us of the power of Hanks and Greengrass, two servants of cinema at the absolute top of their game, and that should be recommendation enough. It's worth paying to see – please don't pirate it!"

","While we were fighting terrorists in two different theaters of war after the 9/11 attacks, nobody could have anticipated than an old-world form of terrorism, namely high-seas piracy, would come back in style. But that's what befell the crew of the American cargo ship Maersk Alabama in April 2009, when four Somali pirates took over their vessel, resulting in a three-day ordeal in which the captain of the ship, Richard Phillips, was held hostage for a $10 million ransom. That ransom was never paid; and a team of Navy Seals managed to end the crisis by killing the four pirates, who had been holding Phillips hostage in an escape boat less than two hundred miles from the Somali coast. Phillips and his crew, however, all survived the horrific ordeal, shaken but alive. This is the true story told in the movie CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, based on the book ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" by Phillips and co-writer Stephan Talty.<br/><br/>Effectively directed by Paul Greengrass, whose penchant for docudrama was perhaps best established in the much-lauded, and intense, 2006 9/11 film UNITED 93, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS stars Tom Hanks in the title role, of the captain who, aware that armed Somali pirates were present in the waters of the Indiana Ocean some six hundred miles east of Somalia, urges his crew to keep a lookout for any skiffs that seem to contain armed men. One such group, led by Abdi, approaches them; but through some skillful maneuvers, they manage to evade them. The next day, however, the Maersk Alabama isn't so lucky. Armed with automatic weaponry and with a better knowledge of American cargo ship tactics, Abdi and his four companions board the ship and hold Hanks and a few others hostage (this while Hanks has managed to get the rest of his crew below deck and out of sight. When one of the hijackers gets his foot badly injured by broken glass, Hanks urges them to get help, and leaves with them in the ship's escape boat. The pirates believe that Hanks is willing to be a hostage in an act of self-sacrifice; but all along, his crew on the Maersk Alabama, are tailing him and his captors; and the decision is made from Washington to end the crisis by the use of the Navy's elite Seal Team Six (the same one that would, in 2011, track down and kill Osama Bin-Laden). It all comes down to a fierce confrontation within a hundred miles of the Somali coastline.<br/><br/>The same sense of realism that infused UNITED 93 also informs CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, with Greengrass and his director of photography Ackroyd doing things largely in the same documentary, almost cinema verite, style that had worked for both UNITED 93 and Greengrass' 2002 docudrama BLOODY Sunday. Just as much of the success of the film, however, is also owed to the incredible Everyman performance of Hanks in the title role. His ability to do the Everyman role, exemplified in his portrayal of astronaut Jim Lovell in the 1995 Ron Howard classic APOLLO 13, works out quite well for him; and Barkhad Abdi makes for a particularly great adversary. There is a real sense of Greengrass, as he had done on UNITED 93 (as well as Hanks on APOLLO 13) of not wanting to do everything in CAPTAIN PHILLIPS as your typical Hollywood action blockbuster, and the end result, along with an intense score by Henry Jackman (which also interpolates the climactic cue of John Powell's score for UNITED 93) being the icing on this cake, is a tremendous piece—indeed, one of the best films of 2013, in the final analysis."

","""Of the crooked timber, no straight thing can ever be made."" - Immanuel Kant<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass directed ""United 93"" in 2006. The film was marketed as an ""apolitical"" and ""objective"" account of the September 11th attacks, but was devoid of all historical context, and so functioned more as a Pentagon propaganda piece. Here was a film about a handful of state assisted Saudi Arabians attacking at least 3 high profile US buildings which totally ignored the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia, totally ignored how these attacks were used as a pretext to launch two illegal wars, totally ignored US ties to Al Qaeda, the group purportedly behind the attacks (on the very day of 9/11, the US were collaborating with Al Qaeda within the Macedonia civil war), and totally ignored both the motivations behind the attacks and what certain Saudi's stood to gain from another Western crusade. To this date, the 9/11 Commission, the White House, FBI, CIA and British government have failed to provide proof (not garnered from water-boarding) that Al Qaeda carried out 9/11 or that Al Qaeda chieftain Osama Bin Laden masterminded the attacks, let alone that these groups or individuals constitute the governments of Iraq and Afghanistan, the two countries upon whom wars of retaliation were subsequently waged. Osama Bin Laden was killed in 2011 (again no evidence was presented to the public). In 2001, before the US invasion of Afghanistan, the Bush administration turned down offers by Afghanistan's Taliban groups to turn Bin Laden peacefully over to US authorities.<br/><br/>Like ""United 93"", ""Captain Phillips"" revolves around a vessel being hijacked. Here the Maersk Alabama, a Danish/American container ship, is boarded by four armed Somali pirates. The pirates battle with the Alabama's crew, before escaping with the ship's captain (Tom Hanks) aboard a lifeboat. The United States Navy then arrives. They surround this lifeboat with a small fleet and proceed to assassinate three pirates. The fourth survives, and is subsequently jailed in America. Captain Phillips survives.<br/><br/>Whilst Greengrass obviously sympathises with both his Somalis and the crew of the Alabama, you simply can't frame a film as a thriller, or depend heavily on the US Navy loaning you a flotilla of aircraft carriers and destroyers, and not expect it to be anything other than compromised. This is ultimately a film in which the Somalis are manic bad guys (high on drugs, no less), in which the Alabama's crew are good guys ""delivering aid to Africa"" (most of their cargo wasn't relief aid), in which all context is ignored and in which the US Navy does ""murderous but wholly necessary things"". The film is matter-of-fact to a fault. This is all there is to reality, it says. Accept it.<br/><br/>But as everyone knows, to the point of being smugly annoying, that is not ""all there is"". The Somali pirates are largely a result of Western companies dumping nuclear and toxic waste off Somalia's coast, coupled to severe illegal over-fishing by foreign super trawlers (300 million dollars worth of seafood stolen from Somalia each year). The United Nations would itself release numerous reports blaming toxic waste for mutations, deaths, diseases and illnesses within Somalia. Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, the UN envoy for Somalia, would say: ""There is uranium, lead, cadmium, mercury, industrial, radioactive, hospital and chemical waste killing Somalis and completely destroying the ocean."" Why can companies do this? Because Somalia's government has all but collapsed, thanks to Western Empires deliberately destabilizing and developmentally arresting the nation, funding warlords, dictators (Siad Barre et al) and instigating proxy wars with border nations. This has been going on, uninterrupted, since the late 1950s; any local government body not beholden to Western corporate interests, and which attempts to nationalise resources, will be destroyed. <br/><br/>In the early 2000s, Somalia began to fight back. To oppose US-backed warlords, right-wing religious factions began to unite, some under the name The Union of Islamic Courts. The UIC united almost all of Somalia and provided stability, but was nevertheless swiftly demonized by the West – their unwitting creators - as ""Islamist terrorists"". Because the CIA solves everything with bullets and blood, the US and UK then pushed its Ethiopian puppets into invading Somalia. Tens of thousands died and the UIC was pushed back. Tired of all this crap, and forged in a cocktail of anarchy, the militant group Al Shabaab was formed, partially to fight off Western and Ethiopian gangs. Today, they are US public enemy number 1.<br/><br/>Whilst Greengrass undoubtedly intends his film to be a work of social critique, possibly like some of his earlier pictures (""The Green Zone""), ""Captain's"" narrow scope hampers things. You can not tackle such a loaded event in such a constrictive manner and expect it not to set up, intentionally or otherwise, many false assumptions. One senses Greengrass attempting something approaching satire – the idea of a film in which a zillion dollar US fleet is absurdly pitted against four lowly pirates who literally struggle to ""climb to the top of a (socioeconomic?) ladder"" is genius – but satire is completely beyond him. Juxtaposed scenes in which Hanks and our pirates talk about ""fighting for promotions"" feel, for example, reductive rather than enlightening.<br/><br/>Beyond politics, the film is tense, well shot, but also repetitive and overlong. The casting of Hanks brings dubious (and possibly ironic) connotations, Hanks the poster boy for a post-John Wayne Americana (""Apollo 13"", ""Private Ryan"", ""Band of Brothers""), genteel but packing heat. Philosopher Jacques Ellul once predicted that future propaganda would increasingly portray itself as being ""apolitical"", ""naturalistic"" and cloak itself in ""realism"". Greengrass' military-men are emblematic of this shift: grim, stoic and fixated on ""just doing their jobs"", everything forever outside their purview and moral radar. Greengrass' camera adopts the same stance.<br/><br/>6/10 – Wastes a good premise."

","The true story of Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years.<br/><br/>After seeing ""Captain Phillips"", I can only call it 2013's version of ""Argo"", with a little bit of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" mixed in. Although, it is not as entertaining as ""Argo"" (with good reason) and not as densely technical as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (perhaps a good thing).<br/><br/>While it may be fair to critique the film for historical accuracy, this is one time I am not going to do so. The captain has his story, the crew has theirs, and the military and pirates probably see it other ways, too. But the film is called ""Captain Phillips"" and is based on his book, so the film's only goal was to tell his story, whether or not it matches the facts completely.<br/><br/>There are two negative things that must be said about the film. The first is that the shaking camera is all wrong. While I understand that this makes sense for hectic, tense scenes, it is completely unnecessary to use at all times. Perhaps the effect was intended to make the audience feel they were really there, but it came across as more annoying and was ultimately a poor cinematography decision.<br/><br/>The second issue is how long some scenes run, and as much as five minutes could have been cut. This is forgivable, however, given how much the suspense pays off in the final act. While the audience may get bored if their attention span is weak, they will wake up in the fast-paced finale (which is far more fitting from a director known for the ""Bourne"" franchise).<br/><br/>With regards to the Oscar nominations, I have no opinion on its three technical categories and cannot fairly judge Billy Ray's adapted screenplay without reading the book (though I think his finished product is quite good and likely deserved the nod).<br/><br/>In the acting category, it is surprising to see Tom Hanks get overlooked when he was awarded by many other groups (including the Golden Globes). Between this and ""Saving Mr. Banks"", many people saw this as a banner year for Hanks. Hanks is a difficult person to judge with regards to acting because his face is so recognizable and therefore he is seen as Hanks rather than his character. But with the intensity -- and actually getting vomited on for the role -- this was his best work in years and it is unfortunate he was overlooked.<br/><br/>Barkhad Abdi has been nominated for a variety of supporting actor awards, including an Oscar. I am torn on this universal praise. While I think he certainly would earn the ""debut"" or ""breakout"" award if one existed, was he the best supporting actor in 2013? Perhaps not. Abdi will never be an A-lister and may not even pursue further acting, so it is great to see the recognition... but to win? Perhaps not.<br/><br/>And as for Best Picture, this just is not going to happen. Despite some strong performances and an incredible attention to detail with regards to how the ship and military operate, this is not a ""best"" picture, and its nomination was even questionable. Worth seeing yes, but best picture no. The Golden Globes gave the film four nominations and zero wins; I suspect the Academy will follow a similar decision-making process."

","Based on a true story, this film is a dramatization of the 2009 hijacking of an American ship by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean. The title character is played by Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>The beginning has its flaws. It takes a while to get used to the busy hand-held camera work. It also gives the impression of being yet another ""us vs. them"" / ""good guys vs. bad guys"" scenario that has been done hundreds of times before, particularly those based on true stories.<br/><br/>Last year's ""Argo"" advanced this genre from its superb directing despite its great stretching of the truth. While ""Captain Phillips"" does not advance the genre, it also does not set it backward.<br/><br/>Once the adventures begin (and there are two of them), the film is very engaging due to the skills of director Paul Greengrass. He is especially adept at portraying the detailed level of teamwork in military operations.<br/><br/>The last half hour could have been cut a bit as it seemed there was a bit too much drama at that point. But Tom Hanks's final scene displays so much vulnerability and humanity, it's no wonder he is one of moviedom's greatest superstars."

It is a simple and true tale of a man battling great odds, which i think could have been told in a better way. We never get to see how is family are coping with the situation, this would have given the film its much needed emotional kick. The thing the carries the film is Tom Hanks' obvious charisma, but even with that half way through it starts to become tedious, the lifeboat section seemed to go on and on, there was too much repetition and no movement forward just so that the film makers could get the film to over two hours. It also has a terrible ending with the Captain being shouted at by a nurse with one of the worst voices i have come across, she just does not shut up, this was supposed to be therapeutic but was very grating."

Between pirates getting on a cargo ship and Navy Seals shooting some faces, what is in between in not an exposé on the unfortunate causes for this piracy problem (only 3 lines are said on the topic) nor is it a tense thriller (unless you think listening to Somalian men rant, fueled by claustrophobia and general cluelessness every other minute is a riveting way to spend 2 hours). The script is garbage, the pirates are absolute morons and Tom Hanks does little but mumble or sit quietly.

"Likes_Ninjas90","5","20","43","23 October 2013"," The film would have been more satisfying if it were more than its title
","In 2009 the cargo ship Maersk Alabama was carrying food aid towards the countries of Somalia and Uganda. Twenty crewmen were on board the ship, which was skippered by Captain Richard Phillips. The ship came under attack by four Somali pirates, who boarded the vessel and threatened some of the crew with assault weapons. The majority of the ship's crew hid in the engine room, while Phillips and two others faced the pirates. After encountering resistance from the remaining crew, the pirates took Phillips hostage into a lifeboat. <br/><br/>Paul Greengrass (United 93, Green Zone) and screenwriter Billy Ray adapt Phillips' book ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, NAVY SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" and opt for a straight and conventional retelling of these events, rather than expanding and deepening any broader philosophical and sociopolitical goals. The film's subtext, characters and its thematic purpose feel secondary to the action. It asks what Greengrass looked to achieve with this footnote of much wider and global problems. The setup exposes minimal details about the personal lives of the characters. Tom Hanks plays Phillips, who is driving with his wife (Catherine Keener) to the airport for this trip. The city is orderly and functional and they discuss how their children will have to work hard to be the best at their jobs. This scene is contrasted with the arid landscape of Somalia, where young men are stood over by armed thugs and ordered to steal a boat. The juxtaposition of economic pressures provides the basis of a fascinating film that never eventuates. The film's production notes state the film is about the problems of globalisation, the haves and have nots. Yet sizeable issues, such as the way major vessels are taking Somali fishing spots, are reduced to singular, passing lines of dialogue. The film's overlong final standoff scenes would also have had more power if there were stronger contexts for the pirate characters, rather than simple archetypes. <br/><br/>One of the other major compromises Greengrass makes is his refusal to divorce the film from conventional Hollywood stylisations to build the tension. His techniques seem predictable. In the first attack scene, there are close-up shots of the radar pulse, showing the pirate speedboats moving in close to the vessel. The film also uses crosscutting to show the panic on the ship as the crew moves to the engine room, while the pirates struggle to throw their ladder over the side of the vessel. Despite one jump moment, I expected the film to be a lot tenser than it was. The dilution of the tension could be due to Greengrass' decision to shoot the film in his trademark jittery hand-held style. While the camera tightens on the faces of the actors, the erratic movements and constant wobbling are atrocious and serve no stylistic or thematic purpose. Some of the hide and seek battles between the crew and the pirates are still interesting, such as when they realise the pirates aren't wearing shoes and throw glass traps on the ground or send the lower decks into darkness. It is also a minor achievement that the film subdues Tom Hanks' recent self-consciousness, minimising his performance to be more controlled. In a mostly linear and contained story, without much personal backstory, Phillips isn't a hugely interesting character and Catherine Keener seems like wasteful casting, featuring in just a cameo appearance. <br/><br/>I preferred the way the recent and superior Danish film A Hijacking (Kapringen) didn't linger over the danger of men with guns the same way that Captain Phillips does. It's a smarter film that uses its crosscutting to forge a battle between professionalism and raw emotion. The tension is drawn from the way personalities boil over in the negotiation process. Captain Phillips is meant to be about the cultural clashes and competitiveness of today's economic climate and the way that motives clash under the wrong circumstances. While Greengrass doesn't entirely vilify the pirates, he still keeps them at arm's length like he did with the terrorists in United 93. This is in spite of an immersive, believable and intimidating turn by first time actor Barkhad Abdi as Muse the pirate leader. What is unusual about the anonymity is that in the film's climax he attempts to make the pirates seem tragic in the face of the Navy's extremism. These are young fools but still young fools branding machine guns and putting people in headlocks. Surely that deserved more time and examination than some of the endless shots of military hardware in the final quarter. The real Captain Phillips has said publicly that he never felt sorry for the pirates either. Additionally, a lawsuit from 2009 is still proceeding, with the crew suing the shipping company that owns the ship for ignoring warnings and putting the crew in danger. The film would have been more satisfying if it were more than its title."
"lucasnochez","5","16","33","11 November 2013"," Review: Captain Phillips Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com
","I'm not sure if there is some sort of unwritten rule in Hollywood to pump out glorified films of American icons or a quota for the ""Based On A True Story: American Hero"" genre. With the likes of Olympus Has Fallen, White House Down, and G.I Joe: Retaliation, there is only one way to distinguish these films from the likes of Captain Phillips, and that's the talent behind, and in front of the screen.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a clever, beautiful and meticulous piece of American propaganda. Brought out by its studios Columbia Pictures and Sony, it tells the story of a Captain of an American cargo ship being taken over by a small and young band of inexperienced Somali pirates.<br/><br/>Think of it like this; the film is directed by Paul Greengrass, the same director of United 93, a film that recounts the efforts of average American passengers foiling the plans of foreign terrorist plans during 9/11; it stars our generation's own Humphrey Bogart, and arguably the most recognizable American actor right now, Tom Hanks, and its produced by the team behind other contemporary American classics like The Social Network. So why is Captain Phillips sinking right out of the water?<br/><br/>I know that, for the most part, I will be in the vast minority with my viewpoint on the film, already gaining critical praise and reception from early festival screenings and talk, most noticeably for Hanks' performance. But what about the performances of the practically unknown, amateur and first time Somali actors who, not only hold their own beside the masterful Hanks, but at times tower over time like a freighter ship beside a life vessel. Pirates Muse (Barkhad Abdi) and Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) stand out more than the other two pirates, but as the award season nears closer, I am sure neither of these names will be announced as serious award contenders when the time comes.<br/><br/>What is most disappointing about Captain Phillips is its massive potential. The film starts off, giving the audience equal screen time to both the protagonist and antagonist, showing the lives of these two very different men and the 'jobs' they must perform in order to survive. One individual is a captain of a cargo ship who steers heavy waters to get shipments into port on time; the other is a fisherman who is violently forced to become a Somali pirate for a larger, more corrupt entity. Greengrass and screenwriter Billy Ray briefly touch upon the incongruencies of both men's worlds and different upbringings as well as viewpoints, but, shortly after, is drowned with scenes of unapologetic American patriotism.<br/><br/>As for Tom Hanks, well, Hanks does what he does best throughout the course of the film. There is no denying Hanks as a powerhouse actor and fine entertainer, just not with the presence of other actors. Some of Hanks' most memorable and recognized performances (Cast Away, The Terminal, Cloud Atlas) are ones when he is interacting with only himself. Captain Phillips is a testament to that notion; delivering his best and most emotional scenes in either a lifeless life vessel or disoriented and unresponsive to an aiding nurse, Hanks delivers his signature Tom Hanks characteristic, just with a different accent.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Greengrass and company, Captain Phillips is an unaware, self-reflexive, continuing practice of the ""home of the brave and land of the free"" stretching its muscles. Just last year, making its premiere at the Venice and Toronto film festival circuit, a Danish film, titled A Hijacking made its rounds internationally, and then shortly after, in a limited theatre bout. The film never found footing after its critical praise and strong reception from audiences. The trailer is also oddly familiar to the style and narrative of Captain Phillips. Yet again, the Hollywood studio system just goes to show that with the right actor and precise director, no idea is safe of Hollywood's ongoing obsession of being uncreative.<br/><br/>Emotionally charged, suspenseful and paced brilliantly, it is hard to ignore Captain Phillips as one's familiar, unsteady first boat ride–it may be a bit nauseating, rough, and hard. Making you reconsidering jumping on again.<br/><br/>Night Film Reviews: 5/10 Stars"
"ghost_dog86","4","25","56","13 October 2013"," Don't believe the hype
","Why critics are so gaga over this movie, I have no idea. But once again, it is my job to be the voice of reason. There is no doubt the true story of the real Captain Phillips is quite compelling, but due to a misguided directorial effort from Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum) ""Captain Phillips"" the movie simply comes off as a bit hollow and shockingly boring.<br/><br/>Based on the true story of Captain Richard Phillips (played by Tom Hanks) who in 2009 was the Captain of an American cargo ship, which was hijacked by Somali pirates, I realize it makes me sound crazy or heartless that I was somewhat bored with a movie containing a premise which can only be described as: surefire Oscar bait, but I'll get right to the point. The biggest problem with ""Captain Phillips"" is that not for one second did I believe Captain Phillips was in any danger of dyingand the man had multiple guns pointed to his head throughout! And before you say it, this criticism had nothing to do with the fact that I already knew the real life ending, because I knew the ""real life"" ending of ""Argo"" as well, but due to some excellent direction (thank you Ben Affleck) I questioned the survival of those characters until the very end. This goes back to the suspect direction that takes this ""can't miss"" premise about a hostage situation and injects very little suspense or peril.<br/><br/>The only thing saving this venture is the interactions between Captain Phillips and Muse (played by amateur actor, Barkhad Abdi) the Somali pirate leader. During these interactions the plight of the pirates does become more layered, therefore extending the premise of this film beyond the trailer. But other than that, Greengrass gives us little more than what's shown in the trailers. In fact, what he adds (a few million dollar tracking shots and a plethora of the Greengrass hand-held shots) only detracts from the film, as these camera movements become far too distracting when characters are simply standing still and attempting to have a conversation. I mean, while this could be considered to be somewhat of an ""action film"", for much of ""Captain Phillips"" it seemed as if Greengrass thought he was directing the next installment in the Bourne series, instead of a maritime drama, which (judging by the script) was meant to focus on personal interactions rather than hand to hand combat.<br/><br/>This next paragraph may contain a spoiler: The Acting: Everybody on screen gives fine performances. But, the thing I would like to touch on is Tom Hanks' performance in the final few minutes of this movie. In the final few minutes, due to the situation Captain Phillips is placed in, Hanks must act as though he is under great emotional duress. I never associated the term ""overacting"" with the great Tom Hanks, but the performance he puts forth in the final ten minutes, will surely garner scattered snickers from audiences.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""Captain Phillips"" is a clear example of one of those films where meaningful things are happening on screen and (as an audience member) you understand that you should be feeling something, but, due to the director's inability to form an emotional connection with his audience, feel nothing but disconnection from the action. If you want to see a good movie about Somali piracy, check out ""Asad"", the Oscar nominated short from a year ago. But unless you're talking about a DVD rental, don't waste eleven dollars on ""Captain Phillips"".<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland"

Captain Phillips was so boring I didn't even get to the end.The start of it i thought, here we go this should be good. then 10mins went by and nothing really developed and then 20mins still nada and so on. This film really had potential for a great story, a great plot, and well Tom Hanks is a pretty decent actor too. Movie of the year i hear some folks cry.. Yeah and there's pigs flying outside my window too.....<br/><br/>The film is PG, not that I think there's anything wrong with creating films for the wider audience, but for profit and wrecking the movie for it is just plain nasty. I don't believe any kid is going to watch this film and find it remotely interesting so why target them ? If the film was for adults I can imagine the other reviews could of been correct."

","This movie left me a little underwhelmed. It was watchable but nothing exciting or amazing. The second half of the movie seems to drag on for far too long. Additionally, I thought the characters weren't developed all that much. Who are these pirates and why do they do what they do? Money, yeah I get that. But I would have liked to see more development. Same goes for the Cap's crew. Who are they? Why should we care if they get captured or killed? The movie doesn't really do a good job of drawing me into the characters or their backgrounds. It plays more like a dramatized news story, or a rescue 911 extended episode. Interesting, but quickly forgettable.<br/><br/>I will, however, commend the actors on their fine acting. Especially the final scene in which Tom Hanks really gives a great performance in the one moment the movie actually made me care about anything that was happening on the screen."

Does it mean US NAVY should participate with an aircraft carrier, chopper, two ships, and so many sniper and ... in a simple kidnapping by 4 Somalian laymen?

The shocking aspect is more in the votes given by both the public AND the critics. The movie, based on the real story is too real to present any interest. Too clear cut characters: the smart pirate, the kid pirate, the dumb pirate, the crazy one. And the pure, effective, benevolent US cavalry, or navy, whatever. Tom Hanks does its best to seem really shocked when showered with the blood of his dead keepers. This movie and the appreciation it has been given will be seen outside of the US as a disgrace ..."
"p-stepien","3","18","40","6 January 2014"," Greengrass Struggles Aboard the MSV Maersk Alabama
","Paul Greengrass of Bourne fame ventures into the semi-true story of Captain Richard Phillips and his encounter with the not-so-bloody not-so-terrifying pirates of the Somalian coast. When the MSV Maersk Alabama, loaded with food for the poor, starving children of Africa (rolleyes), embarks onto its course to the port of Mombasa from the Oman coastline, they are full aware of the dangers posed by pirate activity in the area. With Somalian kidnapping on the rise, the loaded cargo ship is but another prey for the rag-tag band of yellow-toothed AK47-wielding outlaws. Normally a crew would back down and hand over the ship peacefully, but not this yippee ki yay band of die hards (with glass traps to boot). Led by the scrawny Muse (Barkhad Abdi) this band of hijackers has met their match!!! <br/><br/>Achingly overwrought ""Captain Phillips"" intends to thrill, together with manipulative background music attempting to heighten the tension, where there is none to behold. Somehow, most people seem to have fallen into the trap set up by Tom Hanks and Greengrass' shaky cam, but when the foursome of motley pirates are set to collide with the navy and seals the attempt to keep tension high is as ludicrous as the outcome is inevitable. The fearless Somalian fishermen-turned outlaws versus the entire might of US military excellence - never has an action thriller been so lopsided in favour of the so-called 'good guys'. This is one movie where I actually found myself rooting for the 'bad guys', despite Greengrass's best intentions to have Phillips and the overbearing force of the US Navy being perceived positively.<br/><br/>Riddled with unnecessary focus on detail the movie irritates with its trite dialogue, often inserted to add some skin-deep expansion on the plight of Somalia, but never offering any attempt to flesh out any of the characters. Lacking any meaty commentary Greengrass basically offers a straight up action film, which however lacks the ingredients to make it interesting. The conclusion is foregone from the outset and the lack of depth fails to really emotionally involve with anyone. With the story basically devoid of tension from mid-way (when the terrorist kidnap Captain Phillips and use an escape pod to head for the mainland), the last hour is overbearing to the point of excruciating cries for the story to just end. The realistic fly-on-the-wall never really helps, as it struggles to imbue a sense of purpose of proceedings, making you almost wish for the crew to just dump Captain Phillips in the water, so the movie will finally end.<br/><br/>With an overwhelming sense of patronisation of the plight of Somalians, ""Captain Phillips"" also barely treads on the right side of the moral landscape. Not to say that Somali pirates are justified or noble, but the story has been literally whitewashed with the fearless 'whites' saving the day and outsmarting their opposition (I believe not a single talking part from the 'good side' was offered to a coloured person). The ""Smiling Pirate"" Muse has been vilified, not one mention being made of him actually being underage, with absolutely no focus being placed on 'his side of the story', apart from some banal shopworn tag-lines about his fisherman roots. The beginning was actually promising, when Muse was introduced, but soon focus shifts away from him and suddenly we become overpowered by American patriotism coupled with overblown music intended to force a sense of tension. Single lines of dialogue are afforded to wider ranging issues with Rich Phillips supplying an opening comment about the rat-race juxtaposed with the conditions of life of ordinary Somalians one of the few high points of the drama. Apart from that its an pompous mess of action overly focused on the title character and his emotional responses than to actually posing any serious questions. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks acts his heart out, but with such a divisory persona it's hard to really connect with him. The best acting is therefore on the side of the worn Somalian naturals like Abdi, who deserves Oscar recognition much more than Hanks. Nonetheless, the secondary cast of the cargo ship crew was mostly terrible and laughable in their execution, offering a few hardy laughs with their picturesque poses and worried mimicry.<br/><br/>Within the cascading amount of Somali pirate movies, this is by far the worst. ""A Hijacking"" is hardly a great movie, but shows how deficient Greengrass's storytelling is. Just around the corner: ""Fighting without Nets"" will premiere at Sundance and hopefully present a movie with more than one layer to it."

I just don't see the point behind this kind of film-making. This wasn't the Blair Witch Project. It wasn't ""ostensibly"" filmed by an amateur with a hand-held video camera. This ""technique"" doesn't even make the scenes more ""realistic"", because the human eye doesn't see action in a shaky camera way. It's just annoying. Really annoying.

","This is based on real events just a few years ago. Tom Hanks is Captain Richard Phillips, who travels to the middle east to take a fully-loaded cargo ship to an African port. They must pass through international waters off the Somali coast, they are aware of the inherent danger, they are prepared, they have drills, they feel they can ward off any pirate hijacking attempt.<br/><br/>But as they get going radar picks up a couple of boats headed in their direction. They can't be sure, but they suspect a hijacking attempt, they secure the ship, they contact international authorities.<br/><br/>The main pirate is played by Barkhad Abdi as Muse. He has three others, and they are determined to get this ship. Their goal is to capture it and the crew and then hold it for ransom. They allude to the insurance man coming with bags of money, millions of dollars. <br/><br/>The movie is extremely well made, the actors are very authentic in their roles. Hanks of course turns in his usual award-worthy performance, it remains to be seen if he in fact will win any. <br/><br/>Quite a good, exciting, gripping movie. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: As we know from the news Muse was captured as the four pirates tried using the rather slow cargo ship's escape pod to get to Somalia, with Cpt Phillips as a hostage. American military ships, helicopters, and Navy Seals showed up, Muse ended up in captivity, the other 3 pirates were killed by sharpshooters, through the escape pod's windows, and Cpt Phillips was rescued relatively unharmed, just bruised and in shock from his near brush with death. Muse was brought to the USA, tried, convicted, and now is in prison. After about a year Cpt Phillips returned to the sea."

","In the great Leonardo DiCaprio film Blood Diamond, the standard explanation for why the political situation is so screwed up in that continent wherever you go it was simply T I A, This is Africa. And one of the most screwed up places in that continent is Somalia which has not had an effective central government in years now. <br/><br/>It's a country totally devolved now with a bunch of warlords, some with ties to Moslem supremacist groups, others have no ideology but profit. With no government to rein them in, some on the coast have discovered that piracy is an effective way of making money.<br/><br/>So what starts out as two small skiffs with outboard motors and four men in each boat turns into one skiff with four armed men who get lucky and find a whole in the boat's defenses and board the USS Maersk Alabama, a freighter with a good cargo and commanded by Tom Hanks playing the real life Captain Richard Phillips who becomes a hostage of the pirates as they leave in one of the ship's lifeboats.<br/><br/>After that it becomes a battle of wits between Hanks and pirate leader Barkhad Abdi and will the US Navy effect a rescue. This battle is at the heart of Captain Phillips. This man is mister average American, no superhero and doesn't claim to be. His responses to these volatile pirates are a matter of having his training kick in. <br/><br/>What I did not understand is why a merchant freighter going into those waters was not armed. Certainly in World War II eventually they were armed. I wouldn't advocate arming our whole merchant fleet but when you're sailing in waters like off the Somali coast it would seem the prudent thing to do.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives a wonderful performance leading a very well cast film showing sailors and pirates caught up in a bad situation."

","Why do people you admired in you youth grow old with the passage of time? I wish that all the actors and actresses I admired could stay young forever...<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is a man I admired and one of my favorite Hollywood actors. He has won a special place in my heart with films like Splash(1984), Big(1988), The Burbs(1989), Turner & Hooch (1989), Joe Versus the Volcano (1990), Philadelphia(1993-Won Academy Award for Best Actor), Forrest Gump(1994-Won Academy Award for Best Actor), Apollo 13(1995), You Got Mail (1998), The Green Mile(1999), Cast Away(2000), Road to Perdition(2002), Catch Me If You Can(2002) and The Ladykillers (2004 Remake). If you are his fan, these films should be the core of your DVD collection. <br/><br/>Back to this film. Captain Phillips is based upon the 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking, an incident during which merchant mariner Captain Richard Phillips was taken hostage by pirates in the Indian Ocean led by Abduwali Muse. <br/><br/>At the start of the film we see Phillips(Hanks) making last minute preparations for his departure to Oman. From there he boards the Maersk Alabama and embarks on a cargo transport route through the Gulf of Aden to Mombasa, round the Horn of Africa. Due to pirate activity off the coast of Somalia, the Phillips orders strict security precautions on the vessel and carries out practice drills.<br/><br/>During the practice drill Phillips sights Somali pirates in two skiffs. He then plans to outrun them by giving orders to turn the engines to maximum power output - at the cost of accidental over-heating and engine shutdown. He succeeds, but the pirates do not give up. The following day they catch-up and board the Maersk Alabama.<br/><br/>From then on, what happens is for you to find out. Rent/watch online or download/or go to the cinema when the time and price of the ticket suits your budget. <br/><br/>The photography, atmosphere and script is brilliantly done. Paul Greengrass does a good job in the director's seat. He previously directed United 93(2006) based upon the 11 September 2001 hijacking of United Airlines Flight 93. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives a very real portrayal of the terror of being kidnapped. He shows the true leadership quality of a Captain by protecting the bulk of his crew from the Pirates. <br/><br/>In conclusion: one of the better films of 2013. And in parting might I add that the image of Tom Hanks in my memory will always be how he looked like in the film Big(1988). God bless you Tom Hanks."

They had just as much chance as the teabaggers. Terrorists never win in the end.

","I was going to watch Captain Phillips with the lowest expectations possible, since I really not liked Paul Greengrass previous works such as the Bourne's trilogy, but I really don't bother about it at all, after all, who knows, right? The film may be a masterpiece or a piece of garbage, but knowing which is which requires you to watch the film. And gosh, that was very bad. At least, compared to the hype given. <br/><br/>OK, the performances were good in the film, specifically by Hanks, who clearly show what he came for in the final moments, but overall the film it's pretty mediocre. The script looks like it's following some kind of protocol. The character development looks like something made by someone making a online study, given the level of amateurish. The viewer just know the entire thing that Captain Phillips has a wife which he likes, kids and of course, he is a captain with a considerable level of experience. That's all. I wonder if it is, nowadays, everything the viewer expect from a character. He is so one dimensional that it's impossible to care about him or whatever. In fact, I just disliked the villains more than him, but these were the characters more close to real life as possible, since they had a noble cause to fight for. Yet, the way they are developed made they looks like just as one-dimensional characters as the captain. Not counting that story-telling aspect is abysmal, the story simply didn't go ahead and most of the first 70 minutes or so were pointless. It's just boring. I almost feel bad for Hanks, because he did really well in a story that really isn't good or even average. It's bad. Plain bad.<br/><br/>The cinematography was terrible in my opinion. I have nothing against shaky cameras and zoom-in-and-out, but in this film they are used like every time, and in my opinion they weren't needed at all and just worse the situation of the film, that is already overall weak. But fine, a good thing about it. I have no complaints about one of my favorite criteria when judging a film, the art direction. I liked a lot the night ambient and definitely it adds a needed ton of realism to the film. But isn't good enough to save this film from being a total fiasco.<br/><br/>My final rating: 5.5/10"

","Film is watchable, nothing more, and in my opinion doesn't deserve all the praise it is getting. It simply doesn't have enough substance to justify 2 hours of running time. It is a story that depicts the true events of first seizure of American flagged merchant ship by pirates in two hundred years. Tom Hanks plays the protagonist captain Phillips. Tom Hanks is a capable actor and he portraits cap Phillips as wimpy corporate overseer perfectly. Normally this leads to inability of viewer to connect with the character. What I've found the most amusing part of the film is how four Ak-47 armed Somalis in a skiff were able to capture freighter of hundreds of tons operated by at least couple of dozen crew members, the true representation of Western social decay."

Since the issue is not addressed, I can only assume the captain is stupid, which makes this a movie about a stupid person.<br/><br/>I also don't find Tom Hank's performance realistic. He acted too calmly, and didn't even break a sweat. Strangely, near the end he had a nervous breakdown.

If the pretentious movie has the right or enough elements it can work. But this one just came off pretentious. I appreciate it trying to stick close to the truth. Although I have never done any research on what went down with Captain Phillips. Everything about this movie is predictable to the end. However my favorite aspect of this movie is how it portrays the pirates that invade the ships, as human beings. Although the end doesn't necessary justify the means. While some worry about the changing times, others worry about surviving. And I liked that message of this movie. Instead of portraying the pirates as these vicious and malicious villains. And when it comes to the pirates, they really sacrificed when it came to their diets. Since the actors playing the pirates looks like they just walked out of the holocaust. Their acting is also very believable. Despite the effort and the intentions of this flick, it just didn't do it for me.

Its highlights include great acting by both principal actors (Hanks and Abdi), an incredibly intense showdown between two boats, and a strong ending.<br/><br/>The scene depicted in the trailers, with the skiff boarding the freighter, is one of the best individual scenes of 2013. It ratchets the intensity to such a high degree that it is somewhat disappointing that that scene is so early in the movie. Because everything after it seems slow paced by comparison.<br/><br/>Great exchanges between the two main actors. Tom Hanks was his typical greatness, even though this role was probably not juicy enough for an Oscar. Barkhad Abdi, despite never acting before, was also stellar. He looked and sounded the part perfectly.<br/><br/>The film lags a bit after the pirates take the captain hostage. That section of the film could probably be trimmed by 5 or 10 minutes without losing much. When watching it I became afraid that the one great scene from before would be the only highlight. I was proved wrong by the strong ending. I don't want to give away too much, but the last 10 minutes or so are the other highlight.<br/><br/>Pacing issues in the middle of the movie (the hostage part) is the only issue I have with Captain Phillips. It was an intense story of piracy. Every movie has a few parts that it needs to get right in order to be a good movie, and Captain Phillps gets a 10/10 for those parts. Its only issues are in the other, less significant, parts. I strongly recommend this film."
"josephrhummel","4","8","16","5 April 2015"," well done - but propaganda like
","The film is actually well done. Quite Thrilling. Characters are well played and the story is based on real facts. The storyline is a bit simple but well organized: <br/><br/>First a prequel: You get background information about the two main characters, a Somali pirate and a cargo ship captain. Both ""getting to work"" an are boarding their ships. First Chapter: Cargo ship is running. Some security checks are made. Everithing is getting more and more exciting. Then a first and a second showdown, where the pirates are trying to enter the ship. Second Chapter: About what is going on after the boarding of the pirates. A nice ""hide-and-seek"" play between both party's. With a showdown at the end ones more. Third Chapter: Hostage drama on a lifeboat. A good and a bad Somali guy. US Army and Navy Seals involvement and final showdown. <br/><br/>If you do not care about any message the Films is transmitting, everything works fine. But if you do, the film appears to you like just one more of these unacceptable American propaganda movies. The good guys are winning, the navy seals are the heroes. ""Justice"" is given. Some small hints about the situation of Somali guys to reassure the good intentions of the director: in one or two sentences it is stated that fishing-crawlers are making everybody jobless in Somalya. Thats all. The pain and problems of Somalian populations, the involvement of US foreign policy in ""failed state"" areas like Somalia. The enormous impact of US (and other rich countries) fish-crawlers for the population and the wast problematic (horn of Africa is one of these wast-disposal sites). All these kind of scandalous stuff is not really treated. The image of Africans is something like a unscrupulous self destroying, non-rational horde with a touch of pity. But America is performing his world-police-job with accuracy. Until the last shot.... in my opinion all this smells quite Stereotyped and propaganda like. <br/><br/>I'm happy to see that filmmakers from the southern hemisphere are getting more and more involved in these kind of topics. ""Timbuktu"" is a good example. Even if Timbuktu lacks a bit the suspense of a Hollywood movie...."
"TheSquiss","10","8","16","17 October 2013"," Stunning, taut, nail-biting. First serious Oscar contender this year?
","Films are frequently, cruelly judged by their final twenty minutes. Movies live and die by the impact the final scenes have upon their audiences, regardless of the immense power or utter guff that went before. By those rules, Captain Phillips clears ten stars effortlessly. The audible expressions of emotion last night were testament to that. However, unlike many 'feel-good' films that merely satisfy at the end after hollow beginnings, the film that just might win Tom Hanks his third Oscar surfs a wave of near perfection from first light to setting sun.<br/><br/>Yes, Captain Phillips is that good! <br/><br/>Based on actual events, though how accurate is open to much speculation and a substantial lawsuit, Captain Phillips depicts the hijacking of the American container ship Maersk Alabama in 2009 by pirates off the coast of Somalia. When two boats are spotted heading at speed directly at his vessel, Captain Richard Phillips (Hanks) attempts a futile defence with fire hoses before instructing his crew to hide in the ship's bowels while he negotiates with the Somali pirates, led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi).<br/><br/>What follows is a battle of wills against circumstances with Phillips desperately trying to save his ship and the lives of his crew and himself, while Muse argues and threatens for a multi-million ransom, knowing that failure means imprisonment in the USA or death at the hands of his bosses.<br/><br/>The trailer suggests an action-packed join-the-dots drama where good must surely triumph over evil and where right and wrong are clear-cut, but with Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy/Ultimatum, Green Zone) at the helm, there is nothing predictable or cheesy about Captain Phillips. The opening scenes with Phillips and his wife, Andrea (Catherine Keener) simply establish the man and his character while eschewing obvious references and strands to be alluded to and tied up at the conclusion. But beyond the initial five minutes, the tension rises, agitation sets in and terror scrapes at the nerves.<br/><br/>There are many clichés that could be used (nail-biting, edge of the seat) to describe Captain Phillips. It is a film of true horror where we watch with fingernails digging into our palms and buttocks clenched tightly. A small part of the mind thinks ""Thank God it isn't me,"" while the bigger part is too caught up in the events to give a damn about anything else. Greengrass has excelled himself (again!) with the nerve-jangling events that are far too realistic to be comfortable viewing.<br/><br/>This is no gung-ho, ""America, f*** yeah!"", Act of Valor propaganda bilge. Captain Phillips is raw, real and difficult viewing at times. We are so used to the SAS, Navy SEALs or Marines bursting onto the scene in a barrage of gunfire and explosions to save the day that the quiet, arrival of the SEALs is unnerving. There's no panoply, just a cold, quiet, calculated arrival. They do the job and depart so silently and matter-of-factly that they could be plumbers gathering their tools after mending the sink. It is chilling to see such a perfunctory display in the midst of harrowing circumstances.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is Hanks' film through and through. He dominates with a presence that commands our attention and shakes us into a numb silence. The odd Larry Crowne aside, Hanks is a solid actor worthy of (most of) his plaudits, but his performance as the titular character has greater intensity and completeness than we've seen from him since The Road to Perdition, or perhaps even Saving Private Ryan. Phillips' terror at the hands of his abductors and the dread of probable murder are palpable enough in Hanks' performance, but the emotional maelstrom he suffers in the final act is too convincing, too real to suppress the throat lump and dampened eyes.<br/><br/>But Hanks is so convincing in part because he has fine performances to play against, not least of all former taxi driver Abdi in his acting debut. The lines may be lost sometimes, the delivery occasionally stilted, but we never once forget that he is the man holding the gun. We know his Muse is in the wrong; piracy is a crime. Period. But he conveys Muse's own rising panic that this job might just go south and, if it does, that the repercussions will be far more serious than his village simply going hungry.<br/><br/>Henry Jackman's (Man on a Ledge) score intensifies the tautness crafted by Billy Ray's screenplay and honed by Greengrass' superb direction. It never overpowers us but adds depth to the visuals and heightens the emotional state.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips works as a companion piece to the little-seen Danish film, Kapringen (A Hijacking) earlier this year. But where as Captain Phillips takes us deep into the frantic mechanics of the hostage situation from the crew's point of view, Kapringen is a slower, quieter film that covers many, many weeks from the 'safe' perspective of the shipping company and negotiators. It, too, is intense and puts the viewer on edge but in a quieter, moodier way than Captain Phillips. Regard it as preparation before the main event.<br/><br/>There is a slight possibility that Oscar may nod at Kapringen, and a nomination might be just, but it's far less of a risk to predict that Hanks will earn yet another nomination. If the Academy does see fit to award him his third Best Actor Oscar, to match Daniel Day-Lewis, rest assured, he will deserve it for substantially more than the final twenty minutes.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","1) Redefines the word ""shaky cam"" and I'm not even talking about action scenes. I'm talking about the whole film, even those scenes filmed on land. It seems that all the money went to pay Hanks and they didn't have enough left for a tripod. After the first 4 minutes of this film I needed a brown bag.<br/><br/>2) Speaking of brown bag, the opening scene is so stilted and forced, I knew that the rating of this film had to be skewed. And Tom Hanks' accent - what on earth was it? A New England or Boston accent? The word ""suck"" does not even do the atrocious attempt justice. Hanks does a good job doing Hanks - that's it. He's not a great actor - just great at his one dimension playing himself.<br/><br/>3) The story is based on a true story.... loosely. What makes me positively ill is that this hero tripe is passed off as if it was the real thing, which it isn't and wasn't. But Hollywood needs to have a hero who is greater than life, passing it off as if it was true and that ""based on a true story"" means it's basically the truth but a summary of what actually happened.<br/><br/>So if you value your time and keeping your food down, this movie may not be for you. It's really not very good and extremely amateurish. But with Hollywood tossing out dreck every month and redoing every prior film, musical, superhero and idea they can get their hands on, even this tripe looks good to the sad masses."

","Another Hollywood hijacking film. I find it hard to believe that IMDb has this film rated ahead of other films such as Munich, which was clearly in my mind a much, much better hijacking film that was also very predictable,(Both being true historical stories of course). Munich worked, even despite it's obvious predictability of the true event it documented. Captain Philips on the other hand, I knew less about the true story, but yet it seemed even more predictable, so predictable in fact that Jason Statham should have been in it. This film should honestly be rated a lot closer to the old Chuck Norris, Lee Marvin hijacking film The Delta Force, rather than being rated anywhere near Munich. Seriously, it's ridiculous people, check yourself. The worst part of Captain Philips was that it insulted it's audience and the hijackers at points in the film with it's overt obviousness. To me, this film had some good moments, but overall it's a 6 out of 10 at the very best. The also very predictable but good Apollo 13 even built far more suspense than this film did at any point. The biggest highlight here was the lead hijacker's role, other than that, this is mostly a pretty bland and overly cartoonish Hollywood drama. 5.5/10"

","I first saw this movie a few weeks ago out of pure interest. The high ratings and rave reviews intrigued me enough to give it a look see. I knew nothing about this film apart from it being based on ""actual events"". Now, like any film based on real life events, there's always two sides of the story being told. What those who experienced it say, and what we see on the big screen. Nevertheless, I went into this film with an open mind. Tom Hanks once again proves his range as an actor, although for this film it wasn't as extended as in other roles he's portrayed. The reason I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10 has nothing to do with any of the performances in this film. Everyone was excellent, including Barkad Abdi, who does incredibly well for his first time on screen ever. The reason for the low score, the story is bland. I understand that not every film needs to have guns blazing, cars exploding, or CGI in every scene to be a good film, this movie is just bland. There are a remote few times where your heart gets racing about how a scene will play out, then you get dragged on for extended periods of time where nothing happens. I mean no disrespect to anyone in this film, nor those who went through this ordeal, but this is just not the type of story you turn into a major motion picture. This is something you read about in 5 paragraphs on a headline article on Yahoo News."

You telling be the massive Maersk company knowing there have been raids could not have a few armed guards for this territorial trip? That the crew who followed protocol could not at least try to pull the ladder at it latched onto the ship? Maybe I have watched too many movies where one guy takes out a crew, but this was hard to swallow...real or not. It took me out of the movie.<br/><br/>This really was a kidnapper movie and the premeditated method of HOW to get the ransom money never discussed. It was all action without reason.

","Hanks Plays Richard Phillips, Captain of a cargo ship that's been taken hostage by a group of Somalian pirates. Right from the start the movie feels awkwardly amateurish in both the acting, writing and camera work. Hanks just looks lost, trying to find the set he was supposed to report to, but finds himself already there. The conversations between him and the crew borders on parody, not a single line sounds even remotely believable. The acting of the supporting cast was downright laughable. The utterly predictable story progression is repetitive and the terrible hand-held camera work in every scene nauseating and annoying. Greengrass should have let the tension of the moment do the work. In stead we get this overblown action movie approach that completely ruins what could have been a very decent film."

","Paul Greengrass has nearly made a very good movie. Tom Hanks puts in a lifetime best performance as the captain of a ship subjected to a fairly inept Somalian Pirate hijack. The concluding scene is arguably worth the ticket price alone but we have a rather unevenly judged journey to traverse before we get there.<br/><br/>The opening scenes as the captain leaves his wife for a month at sea are unconvincing and not really very believably scripted but the film quickly settles into itself on board the Maersk container ship that Phillips has to steer Southwards along the Somalian Coast and around the Crook of Africa.<br/><br/>We are then, in cinema verite style, (ie shaky camera) introduced to a band of Somalian mercenary pirates, brilliantly cast by Francine Maisler. The chief protagonist in this motley crew is Muse played by the raggedy and waif-like Barkhad Abdi. Throughout he engages us with his his mix of vulnerability and venom. It's another great performance.<br/><br/>Inevitably the pirates board the ship (well obviously - so hardly a spoiler) but both the build up and the time on board are strangely unexciting. <br/><br/>(Dare I say it, almost a tad dull?)<br/><br/>Without spoiling the plot the movie moves significantly through the gear box in the second half as things get a lot more claustrophobic and significantly more epic. <br/><br/>It nearly excites.<br/><br/>But it doesn't really.<br/><br/>This movie feels like a missed opportunity. Despite Hanks and Abdi it's not a gripper and it needs to be. It has no real political insight or judgement. The 'baddies' are, aside from Abdi, caricatures; at times resonant of the Islamic terrorists portrayed so hilariously in Four Lions. American imperialism is celebrated rather than challenged. <br/><br/>It has its moments (not least the magnificent closing scene) but overall it's no more than a 6/10."
"ironhorse_iv","8","3","5","6 November 2013"," O, Captain, My Captain. All Hail the Captain! Captain Phillips was a pretty good film.
","Captain Phillips is an interesting historic event biopic action thriller directed by Paul Greengrass. Paul Greengrass is well known for his series of film dealing with realistic portrayal of terrorism acts ranging from his work on 2006's United 93 to his James Bourne's films. So, when ask to make a biopic of merchant mariner Captain Richard Phillips, it made sense for him. Captain Phillips stars Tom Hanks as the captain who was taken hostage by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean during the Maersk Alabama hijacking in 2009 led by Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi). The first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years. Rather than paint the pirates as evil one-dimension bad guys, the film does show the desperation of the Somali pirates, to take on the huge ship. The film does show the complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization which I love. While, the film isn't telling us to root for the pirates; it's not telling us to boo them as well. I think the heroism of Captain Phillips makes a nice little sub-plot in the film, but is not the whole theme deserving the title. Yes, the film is mostly about his story of the events, but other people indeed play a part of the real life events such as the crew members and the US Navy. So to call the film just 'Captain Phillips' is kinda an insult to them. It's hard to spoil this movie, since its based on a real life event, pretty much everybody in the world heard about. Everybody knows what happened and how it ended. Let's remember that Chief Engineer Perry (David Warshofsky) was the one who seized the leader pirate for the exchange, and also previously disable the systems of the ship. The only thing brave, Phillips did consequentially went with the pirates on the lifeboat. The rest of the rescue, was because U.S Navy play their cards right. There been a number of criticize of the film due to this belief that Phillips looks like all out hero that single handed took out the pirates. It isn't the film fault. This controversial of what really happen those few days in 2009 been up in question since Richard Phillips wrote his autography book, ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea (2010)"" in which the screenplay is based on. Since writing it, Phillips was criticized for taking the wrong course too close to Somalia, ignoring warning emails, keeping them away from his crew. Also, they are criticize him for his lacking weapons knowledge in dangerous waters. The crew was off-route and performing a lifeboat drill when they noticed the pirates approaching the Maersk Alabama. When Phillips was informed of this, he ordered the crew to complete the drill instead of taking pirate defense stations. Then he allow the pirates to take cash on board. So a few of the crew, believe that this event was cause by Captain Phillips willful disregard for their safety to the point that they are suing the Waterman Steamship Corporation and Maersk Line for nearly $50 million. Another fact missing from the film is that they were two hijackings during an 18 hour period, as opposed to the one shown in the film. Despite these inaccurate facts, the film does keep you onboard with its near authentic story. Tom Hanks was extraordinary as the smart ass talking Captain and his skills as an actor are demonstrated in the whole film, but it's the last five minutes that is gripping. This is where Tom Hanks shows his acting chops unleashing the toll of the ordeal the Captain went through. The good thing about the film is how claustrophobic it makes you feel as if you stuck in the middle of the ocean in a floating coffin, surrounded by people that wants to kill you in a small boat. The action is great as the film keeps the audience in the film. There is rarely any slow shots. The only one, I can think of is the opening to the film where Phillips go to the airport, as it serve no purpose. It should had just start at him arriving at the boat docks. Some people think the film is bit too jingoism or propagandistic for the ill-prepared pirates to be taken as a serious threat. In this film, the pirates are portray as little dumb and weak children with guns than menacing. The four untrained and anxious guys didn't really hijack the ship, anyways as they had no clue how to truly control the huge vessel. In the end, the film has a pretty predictable outcome even if you haven't heard the news story. You knew that the pirates wasn't going to get away with the crime, so it took a lot of thriller out of the story, when coming in. In my opinion, it's no way near as interesting as 2012's Zero Dark Thirty or 2001's Black Hawk Down because in those films you can see the enemy as a threat. Maybe, if the film open up showing us the death of the Chinese crew member who was kill in 2007 in a pirate hijacking, maybe, the audience can take them more serious. In my view, it's was a bit one-sided, four malnourished men with black-market Kalashnikovs wasn't going to get a chance against the large strong modern tech US Navy. The film felt like a weird version of David VS Goliath where Goliath wins. America loves films portraying themselves as the underdogs who somehow win, in which this film lacks as the US Navy is portray like emotionless overpowered automata cyborgs creatures. It's hard to root for somebody that has all the cards and emotionless. Overall: Hard to be too invested in this film, but it's still worth checking out."

","Captain Phillips (2013) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Intense thriller about Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) who finds his cargo ship being attacked by Somali pirates and must try and find a way to survive the ordeal and this includes trying to strike up a relationship with the main pirate (Barkhad Abdi). Even if you know how this true story ends, don't let that keep you away because director Paul Greengrass and star Hanks have really created an incredibly intense and well-acted nail-bitter that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I've you've seen the theatrical trailer then you might think that the majority of the action takes place on the cargo ship but that's actually not the case and I'd say this here is perhaps the weakest aspect of the film (although it's still incredibly good). The real story happens once Phillips and his captors are out at sea; them demanding money and Phillips wanting his freedom. The director does a marvelous job at not only building up the suspense but also making us care about the characters and hate them. The Phillips character is obviously someone you're going to root for and especially with someone like Hanks in the role. The bad guys here are given a lot of character development, which was excellent because we get to understand and see why these men do this type of thing even if it might cost them their lives. There's a terrific sequence where the main pirate talks about his ""dreams"" of America. Hanks gives one of the best performances of his career and there's not a single second in the picture where you won't believe him in the role. This is especially true as the film goes on and the situation grows more tense. The way Hanks' emotions just start to break was something remarkable to see the actor pull off. Abdi also deserves a lot of credit because you just can't help but hate this guy while at the same time hope that he will smarten up so that some sort of peace can happen. The other three pirates are masterfully played as well. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is a film about survival and there are some terrific action scenes but the movie also has a heart and the character development is something we don't often see in movies like this."

","I went to see this first because it was based on a true story and second because of Tom Hanks. It turned out to be much beyond my expectations and I highly recommend this to all of us who are working hard and wondering if we are doing the right thing. <br/><br/>The film opened Captain Philips's routine preparation for his next voyage: gathering his documents, family photo and driving to the airport with his wife. While I had thought about being a seamen when I was young, watching these routine check made me wonder how dramatic this can be. But as soon as the drill began, I held my breath. How could the pirates, though armed, in a small speed boat board such a huge cargo carrier? And once they were on board, what could they do to take control? You really have to see it to believe it. <br/><br/>In a way it was like a war movie but our general was a kind and unarmed Samaritan and the seamen were doing what they could think of to protect themselves and their ship. But the meaning it portrays go much further than that.<br/><br/>This film can be seen from a few levels: on the surface, it is a pirate story. It chronically describes the hijack and kidnap as it unfolds and we follow all the tension. I sweat with the crew members on board and cheered when the Captain seemed to strike a deal with them. But the escape was narrow and soon we began to worry about the captain, and even the pirates onboard. The cinematography and visual effects is so stunning that you might feel like floating at sea.<br/><br/>On a second level, I start to wonder why the pirates act the way they do. What have happened in their lives to push them on this road of no return? They only want to go to New York and lead a better life. Why don't they go home with minimum returns and we just record one more kidnap case? And then we just steer away from the dangerous zone? But if we do that what kind of message are we sending to their relatives and their bosses? Their mother ship was a Taiwan boat they kidnapped last year so it seems they are aiming higher this round. What should shipping companies and marine ministries do with this situation?<br/><br/>On another level, I begin to look at the whole issue from a humanitarian level. Yes, the US Navy is strong and the SEALs are great heroes. With their tactics, equipment and manpower, it will be a sure win. Yes piratical activities should be condemned. But who are we to decide to shoot the pirates dead on the spot? Who are we to decide to fool them lock them up in our country when these activities happened in international waters? Do we realize that it is our excessive catching fish that drives their livelihood to desperation, then coupled with their political situation that they have been forced to do things beyond their control? They are, like us, only doing their job. And now we are wiping them out for the second time. Is there other ways out? I am looking forward to watching the documentary ""The Smiling Pirate"" which tells the story from pirate Muse's angle. He was ready for a negotiation when he was captured. <br/><br/>The accuracy of the film to reality aside, Tom Hanks is excellent as usual. At the beginning of the voyage, he strikes us as a cool-headed leader: calm, prepared, witty and responsible. Then his confidence and trust may have caused him trapped. After days of claustrophobic interaction with the pirates, he finally broke down when he realized that his life is in danger even though help has come. When the military help edging in, he was in conflict with himself – he knew he would be saved and he felt sorry for these innocent people but there was nothing he could do. Tom displayed all these different emotions brilliantly and I was on the verge of crying together with him for his helplessness even after he was saved. It would not be a big surprise if he takes the next Oscar again. <br/><br/>Excellent directing in tension building which was enhanced by the background music, tight shots and occasional shaky camera work. But the way it makes us think what kind of world we are living in is the most impressive element of this thriller. Highly recommended."
"imdb-783-507847","7","4","8","24 October 2013"," A fine piece of work from Greengrass
","The Review: The combination of the words ""True story"" and the name Tom Hanks will always result in immediate Oscar buzz for a project. But is the hype justified?<br/><br/>Captain Phillips tells the story of the 2009 hijacking of a ship by Somali pirates and the military operation to rescue the crew led by Captain Richard Phillips.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass (Bourne Supremacy, Bourne Ultimatum, United 93) takes a similar angle as Clint Eastwood did with Letters from Iwo Jima, refusing to paint the villains of the film as merely one dimensional characters with no background.<br/><br/>After introducing Phillips and his wife as they reluctantly part ways when Phillips is called to duty, we are immediately thrown in to the world of the Somali pirates.<br/><br/>Living in squalor, the pirates are ordered by ""the elders"" to get into their boats and seek out ships to be hijacked. Organised and determined, the pirates waste little time in pinpointing the lone vessel at sea and embark on their mission to approach and takeover.<br/><br/>You can guess from the title that this film is all about the experience of Captain Phillips. The film makes no attempt to get under the skin of his crew, instead focussing on the pressure building on the experienced Captain, desperate to protect both his crew and get home safely to his family.<br/><br/>Like with all of his previous work, Paul Greengrass shoots the hell out of this film with quick fire editing and a pumping score. Some have grown irritated by his shaky camera technique but his style always delivers a sense of urgency in his films, never wasting a single frame and keeping the film ticking at a furious pace.<br/><br/>The hijacking itself is an incredible piece of filmmaking. Armed with merely water hoses and flare guns, we can feel the world crumbling around the crew as the armed pirates eventually board the ship.<br/><br/>However, it is when Captain Phillips is taken hostage in a lifeboat that the film begins to falter.<br/><br/>The breakneck pace set at the start slows down to an exhausting crawl, resorting to longwinded scenes of the hijackers shouting orders at Phillips and threatening to execute him. Now I don't doubt that this happened in real life but the scenes are simply too long for the screen.<br/><br/>With 20 minutes left of the films running time, I started to feel deflated that the film had lost its momentum and simultaneously baffled at the hype surrounding the supposedly Oscar worthy performance of the leading man.<br/><br/>But then something miraculous happens. The film changes gear yet again as the military attempt their rescue which results in one of the most nerve shredding and emotional finales I have seen in some time.<br/><br/>For a mere 5 minutes of screen time, Hanks delivers a performance so raw and full of emotion it left me in tears and completely changing my opinion of the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Let us not forget the performances of the Somali pirates led by untrained actor Barkhad Abdi. Their performances are so flawless and so natural that they deserve equal credit.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is a fine piece of work from Greengrass that attempts to show a human side to the pirates rather than the usual faceless stereotypical villains we have seen in other films.<br/><br/>Reviewed By: Daryn Castle<br/><br/>Join the debate on our Facebook Group (www.facebook.com/groups/Filmsploitation) or on our website (www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk)"

","Wow, this film takes you on an amazing journey as you experience many emotions throughout it such as happiness, terror, thrill, sadness and shock. The film has such good acting done by the actors, especially Tom Hanks. He makes you feel what he is feeling through his voice, actions and expressions.

The intense moments where the right length but the drama was a bit dragged out as the story continued.<br/><br/>As the film progressed the feeling of helplessness became so clear to the viewer as they were in the middle of the ocean with little help available. This feeling added to the thrill and terror, and i have no idea how the crew would have been feeling during this experience as it was scary watching it.<br/><br/>The camera at the beginning of the film was very unstable and quite dizzying to view, I'm not sure if this is what the director was intending or they didn't realize it was an issue.<br/><br/>This film is an excellent film and one of the most thrilling films i have ever viewed and it kept you on the edge of your seat.

","When I first saw the trailer for this, I wasn't very interested and only saw it at short notice for a friend's birthday, but I was truly amazed by the portrayal (especially of Abdewali Muse)and the reality that just over 4 years ago, this happened. Some of my friends remarked that this needed more action and that it was boring, yet I found that the film had enough action and was effectively well-paced with a constant sense of fear and apprehension. As I said, the portrayal of all characters was in my opinion; perfect, the unknown actors who played the Somalian Pirates had a perfect sense of helplessness, brutality and fear for their respective characters, and Tom Hanks just oozed emotion with a realistic sense of fear. In the end, the film was near perfect, the only quarrel I have with it is that the film went on for too long, yet I felt every moment was necessary."

","Captain Phillips is a movie based on a true story, and on the book Richard Phillips himself wrote after the events that occurred in 2009: his cargo ship was attacked by Somali pirates, and after that he was taken hostage in a lifeboat, while the pirates awaited ransom and the US Navy tried to save Mr Phillips. Apparently, this movie is an Oscar contender, and many hail it as the best this year. I'm definitely not these people: Captain Phillips is a good movie, but it should have been better to be worthy of an Oscar. On the other hand, since the Oscars are often given to every Tom, Dick and Harry with no apparent reason, we might have a winner here – which, compared to some other movies this year, may truly be one of the most worthy of the award.<br/><br/>There's not much to say about the story that I haven't already said. The movie starts by depicting Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) as a family man, traveling to the airport with his wife Andrea (Catherine Keener) whom he loves very much, talking about their grown-up children and how it's never easy to part. It would have been nice to see Phillips' family again later in the movie – that would have added even more emotion to the story. Also, this is a lovely sequence, and I think people in a long-distance relationship will appreciate it the most. Mr Phillips reaches the Sultanate of Oman in the next scene, and gets aboard the MV Maersk Alabama – a cargo ship – with his crew. They know they will have to travel close to the coast of Somalia to get to their destination, so they are ready in case of pirate attacks. Unfortunately, after a first failed attempt, four Somali pirates, led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi), manage to get on board and take part of the crew hostage – and so a battle of wits begins.<br/><br/>First of all, it's nice to get a true story that's really interesting and worth watching, once in a while. Too often do directors seem to think that, if they put ""based on a true story"" somewhere before the opening credits, the movie that follows will be able to grip the audience and make it automatically feel for the characters. The director Paul Greengrass is really working hard to make you feel the tension, the fear and everything else the characters are feeling – as if you were there with them. For example, the scenes in which the pirates try, and eventually manage, to get aboard the ship are able to make you so nervous you need to take a pill to calm down. Therefore, it's really baffling how such a movie, with such a story, can get so boring so often. Apart from the fact that it's unnecessary long – over 2 hours! – some scenes are obviously lengthened for no apparent reason (except to make the movie longer?). Generally, it's very difficult to stay focused for so long, and it's even more difficult when you have nothing to keep you interested. And since even Escape Plan managed to be constantly entertaining and interesting, Captain Phillips' boringness can't be justified.<br/><br/>While, like I said, I don't think Captain Phillips deserves an Oscar as a movie, Tom Hanks just might get a well-deserved one for best actor. I've never liked him in particular, but here he proves to be a great actor, as he carries the whole movie and is impressively spontaneous and believable in his main role. Barkhad Abdi, who plays Muse, the pirate gang leader, is amazing in his first-ever role as the main antagonist. Perhaps the best characteristic of this movie is that it doesn't separate people in 'Americans and good' and 'Somali and bad'. It acknowledges there's so much more: the people who choose to be pirates don't really have much of a choice, in their anarchistic, warlord-controlled country. While we want captain Phillips to get home safely, it's cruel to leave those pirates to their fate – we know that if they go back to Somalia they will keep on living a tough life and perhaps will even be punished by the warlords that gave them the order to attack the ship. And yet, they have broken the law and nobody can really help them. In real life, Mr Phillips developed Stockholm syndrome after getting home: this shows clearly what a complicated subject we're dealing with. In conclusion, aside from the flaws I pointed out and because of its good sides, this is a good movie you should definitely see.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/"
"Hello_Im_David","8","4","8","18 October 2013"," A Very Good Movie!
","We live in a very polarized world today. Everything has to be painted black or white, good or bad. But in reality there is no such thing as purity. Our ""one or the other"" mentality is wrong. There is always a shade of gray, and Captain Phillips reminds us of this in a way that few movies every do. <br/><br/>The story is that of a freighter ship captain who is sailing around the horn of Africa when his ship is attacked by four Somali Pirates. Captain Phillips is quick to think and he ends up possibly saving the lives of his crew by convincing the Somalis to leave the ship on one of the escape boats, however in the process they take him captive. Paul Greengrass directs and he does a marvelous job of engaging the audience. This is not a passive film, but one that must be watched in Earnest. Editor Christopher Rouse deserves just as much credit as Greengrass for this. His masterful editing makes the near 2 and a half hour movie fly by and it allows the film to sustain tension until its thrilling end. Henry Jackman composed a wonderful score for the film, even if it can be a little generic at times. My one and only complaint about the film is its cinematography (by Barry Ackroyd) which relies too heavily on shaky-cam. While it gives it a sense of realness at times, it's extensive use was slightly nauseating. <br/><br/>But the heart of the movie is Tom Hanks who gives his best performance in over a decade (and maybe his best performance ever!) as the titular character. This is one of those rare films where I don't feel like I'm watching Tom Hanks at all, it genuinely feels like I'm watching another person entirely. Throughout the movie Hanks' Phillips remains surprisingly calm and level headed as he deals with these Somali pirates all the while with a gun pointed at his head, but when the action is over and Phillips is finally safe, he breaks down in one of the best acted scenes of the last few years. He does this without hardly even speaking, but by only lying on a medical table. He sits there confused, disoriented and shaking madly. He can't even hear or comprehend the questions the medical team is asking him. It's terrifying, heart breaking and even beautiful to watch, and it speaks to the amazing feat pulled off by the real Captain Richard Phillips. <br/><br/>The movie feels very similar in style to Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty, even if it isn't quite as well crafted, because it offers us a very subjective viewpoint. This isn't a ""f*ck yeah America!"" kind of movie. And Greengrass along with writer Billy Ray were very brave in portraying the Somali pirates, not necessarily as villains, but as real people with real problems. They are not presented as bad people. They are just poor fishermen who made bad decisions. Barkhad Abdi plays the leader of the Somali pirates, named Muse, and he does a fantastic job. This is Abdi's first role in a movie, as it is for all those playing Somali pirates. Once again I have to give props to Greengrass for taking the bold risk of choosing unknown and untested Somali-American actors to play the pirates, and it is a risk that payed off spectacularly. Through their performances we get to see these characters fully realized. They are not all bad people, in yet they did terrible things. Like all of us, their true character lies in a shade of gray. And that is something we need to remember from time to time. We need to know that there is no such thing as the good guys and the bad guys, despite what the super hero movies tell us. We all lie somewhere in between."

","Based on a true story, I always try to put myself in the situation and how I would react to my surroundings as the movie plays. The first thing is the feeling of fear the begins to overcome you when the Captain of the ship Tom Hanks warns the crew of the Somali pirates following them. Then as they are about to aboard you sense that feeling of despair and how you would fight to survive for your life. As Hanks deals with the Pirates, the crew is hiding in the engine room and begin to behave like some silly scary Movie spoof doing everything their not supposed to do. From this point the flick drags on and you almost are able to predict what will happen next even if you don't know the true story. After the crew is rescued, Hanks is taken in for his medical exam and debriefing. This is the scene where he is absolutely magnificent and almost brought me to tears. He portrays a person who is still in shock,unaware of his surroundings,obviously suffering from PTSD and that scene alone should qualify him for a Best Actor nominee. This would of been a pure firecracker of a flick if it didn't drag on so long."
"s_campanale","9","4","8","14 October 2013"," Movie Piracy - Greengrass gives us a tense thrilling true life tale of aquatic action, courageous captains and human hearts
","Like it's contemporary ""Rush"", this film turns real life headline events into a powerful film that both chronicles events more incredible than mere fiction could create, and also (more importantly) makes for a fully satisfying cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Based on the true-life book written about the incident, it tells the story of the 2009 journey of the freighter Maersk Alabama and it's captain Richard Phillips (Played here by Tom Hanks) who ran into trouble with the then very active Somali pirate gangs off the East African coast en route to deliver aid to Kenya. A small but determined band of pirates, led by Muse (played by newcomer Barkhad Abdi) takes over the ship, hoping to ransom it off for millions with the insurance companies, but the ships Wiley crew managed to outsmart them and make an occupation impossible. Forced to escape in the Alabama's motorized life-boat, they take the contents of the ships safe ($30,000) and Phillips as a hostage, hoping to take him back to Somalia for ransom. With the US navy taskforce alerted, a dangerous game of cat and mouse ensues both between the Navy and the pirates and between the pirates themselves, divided between the reasonable Muse, the dangerous, violent hothead Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) the worried Najee (Faysal Ahmed) and the scared new boy kid of the group Elmi (Mahat Ali) with whom Phillips forms a particularly paternal bond. As the Navy closes in with orders to stop them one way or another, the tensions rise to beyond boiling point as Phillips tries to play the disparate band off against each other from within the boat itself.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Paul Greengrass, the documentary maker who became a sensation with the ""Bourne"" series, introducing to the cinema world the now often imitated, over (and inappropriately) used and clichéd elements of ""Greengrass verite"", such as shaky cam, focus pulls, circling around, dramatic cutting between players in a situation around the world, etc. As with his previous ripped from the headlines drama ""United 93"" Greengrass' style serves the real life dramatic events well, putting us right into the action, presenting it dispassionately yet not coldly, leaving Hollywood mores and narrative tropes at home as he just tells it like it is and lets the events speak for themselves.<br/><br/>The film's structure is as you would imagine it to be. It starts off by introducing our two key players, Phillips and Muse, with a basic knowledge of their motivations and characteristics. Phillips is shown to be a loving family man (with cameoing Catherine Keener as his wife) yet aware of the increasingly difficult dog eat dog world his children will inherit. Muse on the other hand is shown as an ambitious man, full of bravado and self-confidence, yet also very much small fry in the criminal underworld he inhabits, with a boss demanding targets and empty coffers. We then follow the Alabama and the pirate ship as they cross paths. The action starts 20 minutes in as Muse's band relentlessly follow the Alabama despite its superior speed and height with a cat and mouse game that sees the pirates get a foothold. Then it is another game of cat & mouse aboard as the crewmen hide and use their superior knowledge of the ship to cripple it and lay traps for the pirates, injuring Elmi and capturing Muse. Everything seems to end with their defeat and escape by lifeboat, but the desperate Muse, who cannot bear the shame and loss of going home empty handed, takes Phillips hostage and so begins the final cat and mouse, between Navy and pirates, and between Phillips & pirates. The action here cuts frantically between the Navy warships, SEAL commandos and the smaller battle inside the boat, as Phillips tries to use reason to make them see the error of their actions, until the final confrontation and Phillip's release. Greengrass really makes you feel the tension, with a ticking clock almost audible beneath; gripping you to your seat as you wait to see how the events we know happened will unfold anyway, all aided by a brilliant score by Henry Jackman.<br/><br/>The film is neutral, without real heroes or villains (save perhaps Bilal the heavy) dramatically correct in showing us both sides of this story while at the same time not glamourizing nor condoning the pirates (though we see they are just trying to make a buck like everyone else) and makes us sympathise with them a little, even though their own arrogance, naivety, over-confidence and stupid decision making are the ultimate causes of their own doom. Also we see they are just infantry, lorded over by the big warlords and bosses who send men to fight while keeping most of the loot themselves, betrayed and abandoned when things go wrong.<br/><br/>The acting is similarly muted and unshowy, yet effective. Hanks as the title character is typically Hanksian, a strong, solid man, humble yet intelligent, dedicated to job & family, dealing with life's difficulties with good old quiet American pluck. On his crew are numerous familiar character actors, including Corey Johnson, David Warshofsky & Michael Chernus, all good. The pirates, all played by Somali emigrees, are also well played, denoting their characters well and making us both fear, loath, and sympathise with them, especially Abdi as Muse, who throughout is portrayed as Phillip's mirror image, two similar men on opposite sides (a familiar narrative idea) The Navy team is also solid, led by Yul Vazquez & Max Martini (of ""Pacific Rim"") among others. <br/><br/>An excellent, gripping, tense thriller, true life story and tale of human courage and resolve under incredible circumstances, it will make for a memorable night at the cinema and further proof of the original Greengrass at work."
"insessionfilm","10","4","8","14 October 2013"," One heck of a boat ride
","DIRECTION Love him or hate him, this is arguably Paul Greengrass' best movie to date. As with all of his movies, you need to get ready to be up close and personal. Greengrass loves having the camera right up in people's faces but it puts you right into the middle of the action and increases the intensity that this movie brings. And let me tell you, it is intense. It's not long before the drama starts to unfold and you get the feeling of ""uh oh"". How Greengrass gets amazing performances out of unknown actors, and even military personnel who didn't know they were going to be in a movie, is beyond me. And it's some of the little things that add up as well. For example, the gun marks left of Tom Hanks' head after a gun was pressed up against it, just so you know the danger is real. The use of the military was amazing, and while it's not too in-depth, it's incredible what they had to do to execute this rescue. Greengrass perhaps took some liberties with some things, but the way he tells this story is incredible and extremely effective.<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>SCRIPT The story here, like Gravity, is pretty simple on the surface. Four Somali pirates invade a cargo ship, kidnap it's Captain and try to get back home to negotiate for a lot of money. However, this story is much more complex than that. Outside of the political game that was played off-screen, it's the relationship dynamics between the pirates and Captain Phillips that bring depth to the story. We learn that these pirates are not working for themselves, but for a Somali gang Lord who is using them to get money and goods for the tribes. And it's the pressure from these gang leaders that pushes these pirates to the brink which ended up being a huge disaster. The U.S. Navy gets involved and they begin a rescue operation, which ends up being one of the more incredible stories you'll ever see. As for Captain Phillips, he's calm at the beginning and is confident when the U.S. Navy shows up. He makes some questionable decisions that really puts his life in danger but at the same time you know he just really wants to get out of there. The dialogue for this script is awesome, believable and ironic at time. Everything flows together seamlessly and it gets intense. You may or may not end up caring for any of these pirates, but in the end it's all about Captain Phillips and the amazing rescue that ensues.<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/>PERFORMANCES This is Tom Hanks best performance in a decade. He's absolutely incredible as Captain Phillips. He has the accent down, all the mannerisms and brings an emotional depth I haven't seen from him in awhile. The scene he has at the end is a reminder why he's an Oscar winner and a beloved actor. While the story from the military side is incredible, this is the Tom Hanks show and he brings it on screen. As for Barkhad Abdi, a first-time actor, let's just say if he is nominated for supporting roles, I won't be surprised. For never acting before, him and his Somali friends are amazing and steal the show in their own right. They have a lot of screen time, some back story, and even put them in a light where you may like them on some level. And it's not just the character writing. The performances make these characters a little likable, a little hatable and bring them to life. There is depth to these performances and for actors who've never done this before, they are almost flawless. When you combine that with Tom Hanks, get ready for an amazing boat ride thriller. Also just to note, Greengrass used real military personnel that didn't know they were going to be in a movie, but you can hardly tell. Just wanted to throw that out there. Grade: A+<br/><br/>SCORE The score here was done by Henry Jackman. Need I say more? Jackman is the Peyton Manning of movie composers. Or maybe that's Hans Zimmer? If not Manning, he's the Aaron Rogers of movie composers. He's always reliable and is incredible with anything he puts his hands too and he doesn't disappoint here. While not the most memorable of scores by Jackman, it brings an amazing intensity that the movie needed and has some great musical elements. I love Jackman's use of drums in the action elements to really bring it when needed. There's some African vibes to some tracks and it's the type of score that is perfect for this movie.<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS Captain Phillips is one of the most amazing films of the year so far and is driven by incredible performances from Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi. The story, while maybe not 100% accurate, is still amazing, intense and one that you'll love to see. The military rescue is unbelievable and the execution is almost hard to believe. It's like this story played out in a way that was meant to be a movie script. And the movie was very good.<br/><br/>Overall Grade: A+"
"brickmoviereviews","9","4","8","10 October 2013"," Captain Phillips
","In April 2009, the Maersk Alabama was boarded by four Somali pirates. They took control of the ship, took the money from the safe, and took the captain hostage. Hailing from Vermont, loving family man Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) receives his directions to captain a cargo ship from Oman to Kenya, going around the Horn of Africa, and straight through pirate territory. Having already been nervous, Captain Phillips' fears quickly become reality when pirates pursue and take control of the ship.<br/><br/>The pirates are first seen in their run down village in Somalia, where supplies are scarce and villagers struggle to survive the day. With no jobs around, the Somalis are forced to pillage passing ships for money. The Somalis desperation is shown when the men are fighting over who will go on the mission. The soulless look on their faces exemplifies the extent they go to just to get money, and the lack of life they have. Things seem to be going smoothly for the pirates until they kidnap Captain Phillips, when things quickly start to deteriorate.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a slam dunk. Tom Hanks is on par, if not better than his past performances in his portrayal of Richard Phillips' ordeal. Barkhad Abdi's acting as Muse, the captain of the Somali pirates, is fantastic. He comes off as calm, cool, and collected. Even when things are getting down to the wire and his crew is under tremendous pressure, Muse is wonderfully able to keep control, and Abdi does a great job of bringing his part of this true story to the silver screen. In his first movie since 2010, and only his second since 2007′s The Bourne Ultimatum, director Paul Greengrass truly put together a marvelous movie.<br/><br/>There isn't much to dislike about Captain Phillips. At times, the background music was a tad too loud and made the voices hard to hear, but other than that, Hanks, Abdi, and Greengrass really knocked this one out of the park. This movie is a definite must see.<br/><br/>Check out more of our reviews at www.brickmoviereviews.wordpress.com"
"Danusha_Goska","8","5","11","12 October 2013"," Excellent Action Adventure; Why It Is Not a Ten; Clash of Civilizations
","""Captain Phillips"" is an excellent action-adventure film. It is riveting, suspenseful, exciting, and very well-made. There are no off moments; no built-in ""bathroom breaks."" Somali pirates capturing an American ship off the Horn of Africa is a timely and fraught topic. <br/><br/>The film's verisimilitude is so powerful at times I really did drift into thinking that I was watching a documentary. There's a lot of money up on the screen: cargo vessels, beat-up pirate skiffs, ports, open ocean, Navy warships. Even so it was the performances and the pacing that kept my eyes glued to the screen. I found every last character so well played and gripping, right down to the medic who appears toward the end, that I wondered if Director Paul Greenglass had not hired real corpsmen, or real pirates. <br/><br/>Sound is used masterfully. Loud, pulsing music suddenly stops at key moments. Yeah, it's an old trick, but it works especially well here. <br/><br/>This is the kind of film I am grateful to have seen in a theater, and I am eager to recommend to friends. Even though action-adventure is not my genre, I'd re-watch this film, and that is high praise.<br/><br/>This film is so consistently excellent that one must ask why it doesn't raise to the level of a ten-out-of-ten star film. ""Captain Phillips"" touches on some of the biggest issues of our times: the collision between the First World and the Third World, poverty in Africa, jihad. ""Captain Phillips"" assiduously avoids addressing any of these issues. <br/><br/>From this film, viewers would never know that the millions of dollars in ship ransom that pirates claim goes to al-Shabaab, the terrorist group that attacked a mall in Kenya. Muse (Barkhad Abdi) offers rationalizations for piracy: Western nations stole Somalia's fish, and piracy is the ""tax"" for that. Pirates made millions of dollars through piracy. Those millions were not pocketed by the pirates themselves, who work for others. No reference is made to Somalis, in 1993, dragging an American soldier through Mogadishu's streets. Americans were attempting to help Somalis after a famine. <br/><br/>Phillips does mention that his ship, waylaid by pirates, was carrying food aid for hungry Africans. <br/><br/>None of this is gone into in any detail in the script, and it could have been. <br/><br/>Rather, the First World - Third World clash, and the clash of civilizations and religions is communicated solely through images, and, in the absence of a complex script, the images speak very loudly. <br/><br/>Somalia is depicted as a dusty, dry, hellhole. Somalis are depicted as chaotic, unproductive, violent, angry, greedy, and lawless. Somalis are dressed in discarded Western clothing and plastic sandals, or simply barefoot. They live in huts. They only things they possess that give them any power is the guns that they got from Westerners. Somalis hold life cheaply and are ready to kill and die. <br/><br/>Americans are depicted as orderly, disciplined, skilled, courageous, and productive. Americans devote massive amounts of money to saving one life. <br/><br/>When the Somali pirates manage to get their ladder against the Maersk Alabama, the image suggests the pirates as invasive parasites attempting to assault a larger, more successful organism. Whereas the Westerners have built a civilization that creates ships and commerce, the Somalis have created only violence, chaos and greed. They must take guns that they themselves can't manufacture and invade more productive peoples in order to survive. It's an ugly picture, and I can completely understand if Somalis are enraged by this film. <br/><br/>Andrew O'Hehir, Salon's film critic, apparently was enraged by the film, and he lambasted it. It was distressing to O'Hehir to watch ""corn-fed, gym-toned"" Americans struggle against ""malnourished"" Africans. That the thin Africans were holding guns to the heads of the Americans did not disturb him. O'Hehir calls the film ""unpleasant and uncomfortable."" He hated watching American military rescue an American hostage. What a sick dude, you want to say. But his view is all too common. <br/><br/>I greatly enjoyed this movie. It could have been an all-time classic if the script had offered some insight into the issues the images depicted."

","It looks like the whole movie is filmed with a cell phone by a teenager. It belongs to YouTube, not big screen. Extremely poor acting and camera work. Though based on a true story, it is hard to take it seriously by looking at some kids awkwardly pretending to be evil pirates. <br/><br/>Strangely, the movie got quite a few awards and nominations, which clearly shows that it was not not accessed on its merits. Is it Tom Hanks bias? His presence in the movie does not make it any better - he just looks like he does not belong there.<br/><br/>It is a mystery why Tom Hanks is a part of this home made video. Is he really so desperate?"

","We watched the film, and after 30 minutes, started wondering why this was supposed to be so good. Well it all became a rather boring experience, and keeping our eyes open until the end , became a bit of an ordeal. Sometimes we viewers can be seduced into overpraising ordinary story telling, when the work fails to entertain, having been over hyped up by the media. Far too long, and be sure to have the guts to check out the less positive reviews, before deciding to watch this overlong, and dull production."

","This is a pretty good movie, but if you are looking for a documentary of what really happened move along. There is a whole lot of Hollywood taking liberties with the story. Half the crew of the ship is currently in lawsuits with the shipping line because they say the captain put them in danger in his quest to maximize profits. There is no question that this whole saga was a political showcase for the United States and this movie maintains this showcase. It could be used as a recruiting tool. In summary, I found the movie entertaining and interesting, but I was annoyed with how much it veered from the truth. It would be much better if it were more factual."

","CAPTAIN PHILLIPS tells the story of the MV Maresk Alabama which was the first US cargo ship ship to be hijacked in two hundred years . I haven't bothered to research the history of American cargo ships being hijacked but I'm making a very educated guess that last time it was common place it was the British Royal Navy who were doing the hijacking which led to the war of 1812 . Therefore it's ironic that an American story is being told via a British director in this case Paul Greengrass<br/><br/>Greengrass is a former producer of the ITV flagship current affairs show WORLD IN ACTION . Afterwards he got lucky with the Bourne sequels which had shaky cam and elliptical editing . It some ways CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is an uneasy amalgamation of realist cinema and social comment and the director wastes no time in showing the difference between America and Somalia . Captain Richard Phillips and his wife get in to their car and on the way to the docks discuss their son's career plans . Cut to Somalia where Abduwali Muse is woken from his corrugated iron shed by armed khat dealers . You can see instantly the point Greengrass is making with life in America being boring but stable and life in Somalia being dangerous and potentially short but I felt this point was a little bit too obvious to be successful in any way <br/><br/>As the film continues so does the cinema verite style . The Somalians decide to hijack a cargo ship and like the Somalian plan as a film some things work and some things don't . I always wondered how it possible for a handful of pirates to hijack a cargo ship but this is easily explained by bringing a set of ladders with them ! Simple as that and the story is simply told which isn't necessarily a criticism as a game of cat and mouse is played out . It's fairly tense even if you know the outcome but one thing that constantly left me puzzled is why if you're making a real life story filmed in a realist style we have a Hollywood big hitter in Tom Hanks playing the eponymous captain . I never got the impression I was watching a character undergoing trauma and Captain Phillips was Tom Hanks being Tom Hanks which does drag the story down . As it stands I can understand why the film picked up six Oscar nominations which ended with the movie winning none of them"

","I actually served in Task Force 150, the international fleet dedicated to anti-piracy operations in the Indian Ocean and this brought back a lot of memories. We never caught any pirates but that's largely because if they saw something big, grey and pointy on the horizon they'd dump their weapons overboard and play act at being fishermen again (but I guess preventing hijacks was half the job).<br/><br/>Very interesting with a good performance from Hanks especially. How long since you saw a film dealing with the lives of ordinary sailors, the 'truckers of the sea'? Probably not since WW2 propaganda films frankly. It's interesting that Philips isn't necessarily depicted as the most popular captain in the world, very realistic in my experience, the company man who has to balance the welfare of his crew against the demands of his employers, the crew enduring long periods of isolation, danger and wearying duties at sea keen to get every penny they can in exchange for it, conscious of the value of their cargo and how important to the owners that it is delivered on time. Also a nice touch that we get to see the Somali side of things. It doesn't sugar coat it, these guys may have started out as fishermen who started hijacking foreign deepsea trawlers which had plundered their waters dry but we see that this is actually big business and organised accordingly. They're not depicted as evil (maybe that would be different today with the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Somalia?), they're depicted as human, we can identify with them if not sympathise entirely. <br/><br/>Nice to see Max Martini, one of my favourite actors from The Unit who always seems to be portraying Special Forces types. A shame they never fitted in the true story of the CIA's Somali-speaking interpreters who made their first parachute jump each strapped onto a Navy SEAL, at night, directly into the shark infested Indian Ocean so that they could negotiate Philips' release. Always cracks me up the scene where the pirate who has been taken aboard the US warship to negotiate (thus neatly reducing the number of targets the SEAL snipers have to simultaneously take out by a quarter at a stroke) is informed that his friends are all dead, Philips is free and he's now under arrest in no uncertain terms, going from holding all the cards to holding zip in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>Favourite scene however has to be when they phone up the US Navy's emergency helpline and no one answers, the sort of thing that happens in real life but you'd never see portrayed in fiction (at least the Royal Navy answers the phone even if the WREN on duty can't offer anything but hopeful advice)."

Be it the emotional outbursts of the captain or the desperation in the eyes of those Pirates, this movie is so substantial that it will occupy your mind for the next few days. The best part of the movie is that it takes off so quickly that you hardly wait for the matter to start. But even an interesting or unfortunate incidents like these, if not presented well may loose all of its substance. That is why, apart from acting one has to appreciate the effort of Paul Greengrass for the wonderful direction of this movie.

","You got to admire film directors and producers who take a gamble. With this film they could have played safe and stuck to clichés. Yet instead this film is a brave portrayal of its characters in a tense situation that is as fascinating as any piece of great fiction.<br/><br/>We have Tom Hanks playing the captain, portraying the title role with a mixture of emotions without the need to force feed the point to the viewers. Courageous but frightened, intelligent but still feeling lost. It's an intriguing position.<br/><br/>The protagonists are Somalian pirates, who rather than being written as some set of simple Bond villains, they instead are shown to be again a mixture of characteristics: loathsome and greedy, but really chancers who are ill-prepared and desperate, in over their heads. To the immense credit of the director, he has avoided some cheap simple and racist creation, and you feel you get an insight into these men's mentality.<br/><br/>This was a tense thriller, a very frightening film too. This fact based film based on true events does leave the viewer on edge wondering what will happen next.

"moviexclusive","9","2","3","13 November 2013"," As thrilling as his Bourne movies but more significant and poignant in its portrayal of everyday heroism, Paul Greengrass delivers one of the most compelling films of the year
","Even before he checked into the second and third instalment of 'The Bourne Trilogy', British filmmaker Paul Greengrass had already proved himself the master of cinema verite with his dramatization of the events of September 11 on board the ill-fated 'United 93'. And in 'Captain Philips', based on the remarkable true story of four Somali pirates who hijacked the American freighter Maersk Alabama and held its captain on board a lifeboat for five days, Greengrass repeats that same feat by taking a story for which the outcome is already known and turning it into a gripping, harrowing, and deeply emotional thriller.<br/><br/>In adapting the ship's captain Rich Philips' own memoir of his ordeal, Greengrass and his screenwriter Billy Ray respectfully retain their titular character's perspective of the situation; but beyond that - and also what makes it even more compelling - is how their movie goes beyond his amazing display of everyday heroism to explore the poverty, desperation and cynicism that drove four Somali fishermen to become high sea pirates. <br/><br/>And so the opening offers not just one but two perspectives - the first sees the middle-aged Philips packing in his Vermont home and driving to the airport with his wife (Catherine Keener); and the second, set on the beach in the pirate city of Eyl, Somalia, has leader Muse (Barkhad Abdi) recruiting his crew for their next mission which would be Philips' cargo ship. Greengrass demonstrates his commitment to tell both sides of the story throughout the entire movie, refusing at any one point to demonise Philips' captors; instead, he depicts them as ordinary men driven by political and economic circumstances to end up at odds with Philips.<br/><br/>There has always been a kineticism to Greengrass' storytelling, and this is no different. With assured economy, Greengrass brings his audience right into the heart of the crisis, as Philips is quickly confronted with the threat of two rapidly approaching skiffs bearing hostiles. What follows unfolds with immediacy and urgency, with Philips forced to adopt evasive manoeuvres in order to thwart Muse and his crew's attempts to board his ship but eventually being forced to do what is necessary to preserve as many of his crew's lives as possible. It's hardly any secret that Philips will end up on a suffocating lifeboat as their hostage, but you have to hand it to Greengrass for staging the action with such fluency and white-knuckle thrill that you'll still be caught by surprise by that turn of events.<br/><br/>Collaborating once again with cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, Greengrass hews to a familiar visual style that combines hand-held photography, quick edits and a propulsive soundtrack. Unlike lesser filmmakers which botch the use of shaky-cam, Greengrass' previous experience in shooting documentary features has honed his ability to shoot long unbroken sequences on handhelds, and that trademark style here works wonders in capturing the verisimilitude of the characters' predicaments. From the open sea to the interior of the cargo ship and finally to the claustrophobic confines of the lifeboat, Greengrass' shooting technique pulls you deeper and closer to Philips' life-and-death circumstance.<br/><br/>But this is as much a Greengrass movie as it is one of Tom Hanks. The Academy Award winner of such classics like 'Forrest Gump' and 'Apollo 13' has seen his career languishing in recent years, but as the seaman thrust into an impossible situation, Hanks registers one of his career- best performances. Putting his Everyman persona to excellent use, Hanks invites you to identify with and believe in his extraordinary struggle of courage and mettle. It's a masterful performance, one full of nuances that evolves ever so subtly as his character is forced to react with the changing circumstances and hits a peak when finally he is called upon to re-enact the captain's succumbing to post-traumatic stress. Hanks is on excellent form here, portraying Philips' fear, bravery, and anxiety in a perfectly calibrated minimalist act.<br/><br/>Much has also been said of Mogadishu émigré Barkhad Abdi's spellbinding debut, and it is indeed extraordinary. Despite possessing zero acting experience, Abdi proves a perfect foil for Hanks, especially as Greengrass turns his focus in the latter half of the movie on the edgy relationship between Philips and Muse. Ray's sharply written screenplay slowly but surely allows both characters - and us - to realise that they are mere pawns in a larger geopolitical context not within their control, and while Abdi is never less than forceful in his display of skinny bravado, Hanks complements that with his earnestness and empathy - a scene towards the end where he sits in despair recognising the inevitable fate awaiting his captors after failing to convince them to surrender is simply humbling to watch.<br/><br/>Yes, there's no doubt Philips is a heroic figure, and Greengrass diminishes none of his amazing courage even as he adds to that portrayal the humanity of Philips' captors. It is a richly textured story, told as a blow-by-blow procedural of how Philips ended up in that calamity, how he managed to save his entire crew under extreme duress and how eventually after five days he emerged against all odds with his life intact. That Greengrass can direct a taut and captivating thriller is something we already know from the 'Bourne' films, but 'Philips' easily qualifies as one of his best, because it possesses an emotional intensity that goes to the heart of the human spirit, a pure and elemental struggle against adversity for survival. Together, Greengrass and his excellent leading man Hanks make you feel up close and personally engaged through and through with Philips through his ordeal, and it is an experience you won't quite soon forget."
"IceCube","7","2","3","13 November 2013"," Very exciting and very realistic, but not high-class.
","I went to the movie with some skepticism. Tom Hanks in tiny story. The film comes straight to the point, Captain Phillips at home, then off to the ship. Similarly, the pirates, their situation at home, then off to the sea. The tension is built up very good. A few security exercises on board and even the pirates are sighted for the first time. Tom Hanks certainly can not show his whole skill, because the film does not offer enough depth. But as a conservative principle faithful captain he comes across credible. The roles of the pirates are convincing. They seem quite realistic and are not really the bad guys. Very clearly is the hopelessness of the characters that sit between their bosses who sit on land likely to take most of the money , the supposed colleagues in the pirate crew and the starving family - it's like an emotional no man's land. The United States does not appear as heroes, you can see sometimes they are helpless too - a football field large aircraft carrier vs. small orange lifeboat. My Conclusion: Great film , because exciting and realistic, from time to time a few lengths, but the 130 minutes go by really fast."

It's a movie that can be classified as an action/thriller without requiring huge fight scenes or special effects to captivate you. The acting by Tom hanks is awesome as he almost always is and he is very convincing as his character progresses through many emotions and feelings as he starts out as a confident captain but by the end of the movie he is traumatized and scared and Tom hanks displays it beautifully. The authentic simialian actors were very impressive too for not having much acting experience they were able to portray charectors anywhere from insane men focused on money to a young boy caught up in a life of crime he has no hope to escape. It is beautifully shot and directed on an accurate set and the use of a shaky cam for many shots really makes you few like you are in the movie on the ship and especially the lifeboat. Overall one of my favorite movies and though I have seen it numerous times it stills make me feel suspense ever rewatch. Would recommend 10/10"

","Unlike other similar films, Captain Philip, did not deliberately promote the greatness of the characters. Captain Philip spent the most difficult time with the crew with extraordinary calmness.

This is the fact that the birth cannot be changed but determines the future destiny! The film does not have a lot of extra pavement. It does not enter the rhythm directly at the beginning and always captures the audience 's emotions Most importantly, at the same time, pity for people born in poor countries.

It's inspired by a real life hijacking from 2009 and the movie does a fantastic job of building the tension as things progress. The story also doesn't rely on CGI or anyone saving the day to make things more exciting although we do get a huge section with Navy boats, SEALs and a helicopter but I suppose that part is true.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks character is subdued until the end when he's in shock, that's when I enjoyed him the most. He does a good job, he's Tom Hanks. We also get things from the pirates POV which was great, I felt sympathy for all of them.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","1","1","13 August 2018"," Claustrophobic and uncertain; a tense thriller that ultimately lacks depth.
","Regardless of how closely it sticks to the real-life events upon which it is based, 'Captain Phillips (2013)' focuses on the claustrophobia and uncertainty that comes about when a ship's captain has his boat commandeered by modern-day pirates, placing most of its emphasis on the tension caused by the ever-shifting relationship between the boat's constantly scared crew and their unpredictably dangerous captors. While Greengrass' signature 'shaky' style fits the source-material and lends a realist feel, it does occasionally become quite over-bearing. The generally slow pace and lack of real character development - both of which ultimately prevent full audience engagement - also reduce the feature's overall impact. It generally knows what it is, however, right up until its explosive and, frankly, gut-wrenching finale. It focuses on doing its thing as well as it can throughout and, in the end, it's this that allows it to work as well as it does. 6/10"

It is a story well told; however, the premise - apparently based on an actual occurrence - is a blow to my intelligence. Trying to fake radio assistance? Hoses as a deterrent? Seriously? Of course I don't claim to be an expert on maritime law but perhaps it's time to revise it to include sufficient means to prevent this type of piracy from happening.

"tomgillespie2002","7","1","1","26 January 2014"," Riveting real-life thriller with Tom Hanks at his best
","Not a lot hinges on whether you know the outcome of Captain Richard Phillips' true-life run-in with a small crew of Somali pirates in 2009, as, like director Paul Greengrass's other tale of real-life heroism in the face of a terrorist threat, United 93 (2006), the film gathers up enough tension to keep you on the edge of your seat. It's not as good as United 93, as the film often struggles to keep things exciting in the long moments between the action, but Tom Hanks has more than enough presence to carry the film, and here gives possibly his best ever performance. Which makes it all the more surprising that Hanks - usually a darling with the Oscars with sentimental drivel such as Philadelphia (1993) and Forrest Gump (1994) - has missed out this year.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips (Hanks) is waved off at the airport by his wife Andrea (Catherine Keener in a one-scene cameo) as he flies to Oman to take command of the Maersk Alabama, that he soon realises will take him around the Somali Peninsula. Sure enough, on the Somali coast, they are chased by ambitious pirate Muse (Barkhad Abdi) in a skiff, with a crew consisting of hot-head Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman), nervous Najee (Faysal Ahmed) and young first-timer Elmi (Mahat M. Ali). They protect the ship for as long as they can, but the pirates are soon on board demanding payment. Phillips offers them $30,000, but it won't be enough for the ruthless warlords who employ Muse, so they take Phillips for ransom.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons why Captain Phillips works so well is that Phillips himself comes across as a true hero. Not a gun-toting, vest- wearing action hero, but an everyday guy who probably enjoys a comfortable suburban lifestyle with his family when he's not at sea. He's over middle-aged, slightly portly and not particularly handsome, but most importantly he's real, and a underdog to truly root for. In the time spent in the lifeboat as Muse and his crew head back to Somalia with their prize - with Navy SEALS in tow - allows Phillips and Muse time to slowly share experiences. Muse, fabulously portrayed by the Oscar-nominated Abdi, is a simple guy as well. It's just that in his country, poverty doesn't allow for any legal trades to be a wise option, so rather than plundering the sea for the fish that American ships have already hoovered up, they steal and kidnap.<br/><br/>But Greengrass is wise enough not to over-egg these scenes, or even allow us to sympathise too much with the pirates. But he allows us to understand them, to see things from their perspective. What they do is wrong and evil, yes, but when your country is governed by violent warlords and your life depended on coming back with something of real value, it's no surprise that they do what they do. And as the gravity of the situation dawns on the pirates, the film becomes a treadmill of heart-pounding small moments, where every second could either offer up a small opportunity for Phillips to escape or fight, or it could mean that he will never see his family again. Muse and his crew have done this before, but they are ill-equipped, desperate and twitchy.<br/><br/>As exciting as all those moments are, the film's most powerful scene is at the end, as Phillips breaks down whilst being medically treated by the American military. Up to this point, Phillips is kept at a distance, seeing very little of his true character before the pirates arrive. Hanks gives a devastating, improvised performance in this moment, as he struggles to process and comprehend the ordeal he has just been through. For an action film especially, this is an immensely powerful scene, and it re-enforces the human tragedy of the story. A riveting film overall, and proves again that Greengrass can't be matched in portraying a real- life incident with such heart, realism, and thrills.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Captain Phillips - ** 1/2* Based upon a real event, Captain Phillips recreates the hijacking of an American Cargo ship by Somalian pirates in 2009. The film was slow and tedious in parts while being exciting and effective in others. Unfortunately for me the tedious far outweighed the exciting, and I found this film to be somewhat of a disappointment. <br/><br/>The film sets it's premise excellently; the short scene between Phillips and his wife humanizes the Captain and gives Greengrass space to develop. We soon come to see Phillips as a hardworking, capable Captain with a very strict handle on his crew. The tension then begins to build as the plot begins to develop, and I was very much involved with the film at this stage. <br/><br/>It is once the film gets right into the thick of its content that all the good work at the beginning is undone, and the tension begins to evaporate, causing the film to be incredibly tedious in some parts. Especially through the middle hour, I would have been quite content to fall asleep - it really was that slow.<br/><br/>Despite some of the film's weaknesses, Greengrass does an excellent job of developing his two central characters, and the pirates are depicted brilliantly; neither villains nor heroes - just men doing their job. Billy Ray's screenplay also provides for some fantastic interaction between the two men, and some of the film's best viewing comes through in the intelligent, effective conversation between the two.<br/><br/>Hanks does an unsurprisingly excellent job, and newcomer Barkhad Abdi's gritty portrayal of the head pirate is really quite astounding, more so considering that this is his Hollywood debut. If it were not for an overlong second half which completely eases the tension, Captain Phillips could have been a much better film. Despite this it is still decent - if not boring - seaside viewing."

","This is a movie of wasted potential. Modern-day pirates, crew playing hide-and-seek to stay alive, dramatic rescue. It's all there: all the ingredients for a great movie. So why is this such a flop? Perhaps it's not such a good idea to make the aggressors so realistic that they have no connection whatsoever with the audience. It was like watching actual Somali pirates, and therefore there was no emotional tension--I just wanted them all slotted. That they didn't get slotted, but managed to hijack a vast ship with basically a spear was so frustrating that I lost patience with the whole proceeding. It was...worthy. It was PC. It was just...boring."

","Captain Phillips. I tried several times to sit down and watch this movie. Three times on a plane with nothing else to do. Each time I only lasted ten to fifteen minutes before getting a headache. The camera appeared almost entirely hand held on a long lens and was constantly shaking and jerking around all over the place. Even during important dialog.(My friend in the seat next to me managed longer and when ever I glanced at his monitor throughout the film, the picture was always jerking around.) At times I had to look away to avoid getting dizzy. How on earth anyone can watch this is unbelievable. I'm sure it's a good film so I am told.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass, get a tripod!"

","My problems with Captain Phillips when I first saw it in an advance screening was the shaky camera-work and unnecessary jerky editing. I saw the Bourne movies and United 93, had no problem with Greengrass' work, but in Captain Phillips I found it to be distracting. Upon my rewatch I actually grew to accept and even, love the editing. I think it's part of the effect of the film, Greengrass makes us feel like we're inches away from being seasick. Being used to that method, I saw how closely sewn the cuts are connected. Greengrass' direction is the best of any of the films he's made; he pumps the fear into our systems. He makes the film ""click-click- click-click.""<br/><br/>While I still find Abdi unremarkable, Hanks' acting is better than remembered and I praised the heck out of him before. It's a heroic, realistic, terrific piece of acting. He's stolen the win from Matthew McConaughey for Best Actor in my opinion and I never thought McConaughey would be dethroned. It's a performance that will go on to be one of the decade's finest. The quality of the screenplay stood out more and the development of Captain Phillips himself. I got this strange vibe that Phillips strangely cares for the pirates. The most pleasant surprise was the score, I was touched by its balance of tenderness and intensity. Captain Phillips is a throat grabbing thriller that I have grown to love.<br/><br/>Updated Rating- 8.0"

","The fact that this film is based on true events that occurred not too long ago just adds to the fantastic achievement that has been accomplished with this film. This film documents the day Captain Phillips had his cargo ship boarded by four somalian pirates and how his situation turned into a hostage situation. Now I cannot believe for one moment that Tom Hanks didn't get nominated for an Oscar for his performance as this is the Tom Hanks show and he carries this film on his back and his phenomenal performance is the best thing about this movie. The Somalian pirates are the only real supporting characters that we are given and they are pretty good especially being new to the acting scene I was impressed. The story is another great positive as it feels so realistic and real even though the story could have felt boring and dull it really doesn't and you put yourself with Captain Phillips and you really feel for his situation. The script is also great and the way the pirates and Hanks deliver their lines adds to this whole experience of entrapment that this character is going through. The style of the film is similar to the story as it is really realistic and gritty and with the use of sound and performance it really truly builds the tension and sets the suspense up for this thriller of a film. This film is fantastic and has hardly any flaws with only a few more detailed supporting characters possibly helping it but overall this is a fantastic realistic film."

","Captain Phillips (2013)<br/><br/>Straight up excellent movie making about a true story with superb pace and clearly etched characters. It's hard not to like, and to appreciate the main character, played by Tom Hanks, as he does his best to keep his ship and crew safe from pirates.<br/><br/>If that's what you're looking for in a movie, this is top notch. The director, Paul Greengrass, is really expert at this kind of action thriller—he did the 2nd and 3rd Bourne movies, which are sizzling. ""Captain Phillips"" is by its nature more limited in its plot. It has to stick to the reality of the world at that time, and more or less to the facts. There have been some objections to the actual details of the movie, but I think Greengrass is right when he defends it as true to the big points, which you see (with some astonishment) here.<br/><br/>If you want some further element of surprise, or something to make you think, or discover aspects that rise above simply telling a riveting plot, you won't find it here. Except, for me, in the last two minutes of the movie. Here, at last, we not only see the depths of what the captain had to discover in himself, we see the movie take a turn in deciding what to show us and how.

","Nowadays it is obvious to see movies which were made to make money and hit the charts for couple of weeks thanks to the rumors spinning around about how good the movies and how hot the chicks are. Vampire movies, Kardashian butt maneuvering episodes appeal the audience to the auditoriums and leave the real movie fans frustrated.It is even more frustrating to see terrible movies from renowned directors and actors.<br/><br/>I knew for sure this movie was NOT going to be one of the other movies which are nothing but waste-of-money. One word to summarize this movie is INTENSE! If ever there were a lesson on keeping an audience captivated by taking them through a roller-coaster of emotions look no further than Paul Greengrass's latest thriller, ""Captain Philips"". Inspired by true events of March 2009, when Richard Philips, the Captain of a cargo ship was taken hostage by Somali pirates, this film has everything: drama, suspense, heroics In truly nail-biting fashion, Tom Hanks plays Captain Richard Philips and executes these emotions flawlessly.<br/><br/>So convincing is his performance that you would be forgiven for almost believing that you were on the journey with him, sharing his pain, courage and at times total anguish. Barkhad Abdi's performance as Muse - the leader of the pirates - is riveting, going toe-to-toe with Hank in terms of wit, and carrying out the role of 'the villain' to perfection but not in your stereotypical way as he evokes an element of empathy amongst viewers.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, it keeps you wondering and guessing right until the very end. Underlying questions keep you on the edge of your seat: what will happen to Captain Philips? Will Muse's unpredictable nature take a turn for the worse? How much longer can they survive? Nowadays, it's all too easy to leverage special effects with an A-list cast, throwing in some loud bangs and call it a thriller. I'm a firm believer that the point of Cinema is to communicate the story whilst keeping the audience captivated. 'Captain Philips' not only achieves this with ease but delivers a story rich in dialog and accurately reflecting the events of March 2009 through the lives of relate-able characters. Somali pirates' exploits are well documented in our news, however this story is palpable to such an extent that it brings you as close to the real life event as possible whilst avoiding all the associated dangers.<br/><br/>The feeling of fear setting in as pirates approach the ship, the anguish felt as Captain Philips is taken hostage, the unpredictable violence of Muse, may all be cinematic: however, as you watch the story unravel these feelings will be anything but cinematic. The words ""must watch"" are overused in our industry but if you are after an intense ride, with a wave of emotions and character depth in abundance, 'Captain Philips' is definitely a must watch. It is great to view this movie on bluray as the picture is unwavering , effects are vowen in depth . Worth every dime !Evren Buyruk, Plano,TX USA"
"chaos-rampant","Null","3","6","22 January 2014"," Our reach
","Here we have a simple world where unseen wheels turn and bring men (on both sides) out to sea. We have simple emotional urges; get there or get out of there, and just physics of space. Standard tension carries the day in the story: will the pirates board the ship? okay, but will they find the crew? okay, but will they make the hostage switch? okay but will they make it to the coast? and so on, bobbing us up and down. We have that dry and solemn tone of procedure that movies take on when they deal with the US military in the area, Bigelow's films come to mind—we're meant to see the quiet commitment to get our man back, the everyman Hanks.<br/><br/>Boring. But within those limits there is a pretty lovely spatial play, as lovely as the plot is unremarkable. Simple contrasts: in and out, close confines against open vastness, ship mechanics against the abstract sea, Somali chaos against American precision. But within that, some great eye motion, one to relative distance, to the unfolding of space.<br/><br/>If you look, what the filmmakers were looking to manipulate were our intentional threads reaching out to this man who we want to see saved, have the reaching and anticipation as visual as possible. So what they do is they try to avoid as much as possible framing omnisciently, and stretch that eye to intentional distance by having the next action fire its trajectory in that vision, and cut before completion so the motion pulls our own intentional tethers taut. My favorite bits are the view of the ship from the approaching Somali skiffs, a flare fired from the ship and seen through beams of water, and all that last part with the towing of the lifeboat towards the lights, the tether bringing back our man against dark waters.<br/><br/>Essentially, it is the same expertly calibrated cinematic machine as that which is able to swoop from the horizon and find the protagonist in the middle of nowhere. Anyone who merely reads 'shaky cam' in a film like this seems to me to have boarded the least adventurous cinematic boat: the touristy one that does a tour of the bay instead of the one that sails out to deep sea. It's still not very fulfilling once you pull back to the whole picture, but get up close and perception is its own art and richness—there will be more to say about this in a comment about Gravity.<br/><br/>So anyway, we have all that tension mounting, gears snap and whir into place. It builds up all that energy, the last part with snipers getting in position and the ship towing the boat. So the question is: do you cleanse? do you let out a little and in what direction?<br/><br/>You'll see what they did in the film. Hanks wonderfully makes his own part work, letting out just little enough for us to know that all his gears of self have snapped but his wife is there in that room after being saved. But this is because he is first given room for it, he is the hero. <br/><br/>How would it be to give the same room to the Somali captain? No politics here, not putting them in equivalent ground, just find that man in the moment of stepping into what is essentially the future, the front part of the train of civilization to his last that he leaves behind on the coast. And mine the irony of his going to America, and have the Somali actor layer on that his own journey there. It would be an exceptional thing."

The thing that plot lacks is both accounts of the story, I researched about the plot of the story and the true events explored in the film and crew members who recount there experience with Captain Phillips when the hijacking occurred some described his actions as heroic and reckless and it was sad to see that the both accounts were not portrayed in the movie. Emotion is one of the main themes in this movie that you explore towards the end when Phillips is rescued and the one pirate has been captured and 3 others shot and killed in front of Phillips he shouts and cries in the lifeboat. He is taken to a doctor where he is asked if all the blood on his body is his and he replies in a shocked manor ""No this is not blood"" repeatedly.

","Captain Phillips is a movie which is certainly well-made but ultimately unsatisfying. The production values are there, the entertainment is not. This should be a tight, taut, tense thriller. But the tension seeps away long before the movie finally draws itself to a close. The movie certainly has a captivating, true-life story to work with, a story which would seem to have great potential. But that potential is unrealized. The movie disappoints.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Captain Richard Phillips, who is in command of a huge cargo ship headed to Kenya. Rather awful attempt at a Boston accent aside, Hanks is otherwise reliable as ever in the role. And the completely unknown Barkhad Abdi proves a worthy acting adversary for Hanks. Abdi plays Muse, the leader of the gang of four Somali pirates who hijack Captain Phillips's ship. The first half of the movie, setting up the hijacking from the perspectives of both Phillips and the pirates and then the hijacking itself, works reasonably well. The second half of the film, with Phillips having been taken hostage by the pirates as they fled the giant ship in a small lifeboat, works markedly less well.<br/><br/>Initially there is great tension as hostage Phillips tries to keep his wits about him and keep himself alive while rescue plans are set in motion. But then the movie just kind of sits there. It becomes very repetitive as we wait for that potential rescue to come. Interactions between Hanks and Abdi, Phillips and Muse, are good. But the other three pirates make either a bad impression or no impression at all. The only other standout, and not in a good way, is the character of Najee, the hothead of the pirate group. His frothing rage wears thin quite quickly. Maybe the true-life counterpart really was like this but in the movie it seems way over the top. He's the designated villain but he's too villainous for the film's good. There are some things to admire about the film. Hanks is solid, the young unknowns playing the pirates do reasonably well with their roles, with Abdi doing quite well indeed. The movie looks good, it was clearly a challenging movie to shoot and director Paul Greengrass pulls that aspect of the proceedings off well. Though there is definitely the sense a steadier camera would have worked well at times, there's only so much shaky-cam you can take. Ultimately though, as with any movie, the most important thing is the story. This story had great promise but for whatever reason it just doesn't work. As the movie careens towards, and then over, the two-hour mark the tension fizzles away. You've had enough and you're just ready for it to be over. This compelling real-life story ultimately makes for a less than compelling movie."

It's just OK - and like most movies nowadays, it's over 2 hours and a bit too long.<br/><br/>Good score by Henry Jackman is the main reason for keeping the movie intense and interesting for so long.<br/><br/>Too much shaky cam (annoying especially in the beginning of the movie).<br/><br/>The cast is good.

","What's the point? Shooting a personal monument to Captain Phillips? The story is really not worth a movie. Actually Somali pirates are not a very interesting antagonist group in terms of action, but the movie does depict that well. A bit too well when comes the final part and the U.S. of A. unleashes hell to handle the situation.<br/><br/>Maybe one can appreciate that it is not a dumb Hollywood actioneer with cliché bad guys kicking everything around until the empire strikes back. But what difference does it make in the end when the Navy firepower comes into play? True story may be gripping. I'd say they are when it is more about character than about action. Here in Captain Phillips - as in United 93 - it is about action and true to life action is somewhat weak. Honesty never was a prerequisite for a good movie, but I guess Paul Greengrass's talent has been wasted on the false perception that his ability to shoot action sequences was rooted in an efficient 'honest-documentary-style' approach. On the other hand I guess Greengrass himself is attracted to real-life characters which unfortunately lead to weaker all-around action than with a movie-calibrated hero.<br/><br/>I hope Greengrass finds a hero with substance who also happens to be caught in a vortex of action.

"Dory_Darko","10","2","4","21 December 2014"," Tom Hanks at his best in a terrifyingly realistic true story.
","Let me begin by saying that Captain Phillips, as an action film, turned out to be much more than I had initially anticipated. I was expecting half drama / half moderate action film with likely a good dash of political hopscotch. It's probably a good thing then, that I knew next to nothing about the actual story, because I love a good surprise. Captain Phillips is two hours of absolutely intense and absolutely uncompromising physical and psychological anxiety. At the end of it, I literally had to sit for a minute and just breathe, because this story gripped me by the throat like few films in recent memory have.<br/><br/>For those still unfamiliar with the story – this is a retelling of a historical event; the first US cargo ship in 200 years to be hijacked by pirates. During which, its captain Richard Phillips is taken hostage by the pirates, on his own lifeboat no less.<br/><br/>I got the sense that, somewhere in between the lines it was the director's intention to perhaps create an opening for a different story to be told: that of the Somali pirates, and why they do what they do. We are told that they are fishermen, and sheer poverty has driven them to these desperate acts. However, I don't know for sure if I'm supposed to feel any sympathy for these men, if I was supposed to 'understand' their motives – if this was Paul Greengrass' intention, it didn't work. Because no matter which way you swing it, these pirates are the bad guys and that's as clear as day. No degree of poverty or despair should be held as an excuse for such gruesome acts. Then again, if this was at all the point, I'm glad it wasn't hammered down in any way. It was merely a thought, and one conveyed subtly enough for anyone to make up their own mind about this issue.<br/><br/>What is clear here, is that these men (only four of them, surprisingly) committed a terrible crime. Not even so much the piracy itself, but the kidnapping and abuse of one individual. This individual is played by Tom Hanks, and he delivers one of his most eloquent and restrained performances to date. Here is a man, a captain of a large cargo ship, who is usually very much in control of his life and a clearheaded leader of his crew – but who, in the heat of reality, is just as human as any of us and simply does the best he can, even when (in spite of overwhelming protocol) one simply doesn't know what to do. Because protocol doesn't apply to the emotions that take control of both the captain and his captors, when they face a situation none of them anticipated. This is immediately one if my favourite performances by Tom Hanks, whose strength here lies mostly in the quiet moments in between all the chaos surrounding him. You can tell that he never stops thinking, never stops analyzing his situation, no matter what the pirates do to intimidate him. He conveys it all in the eyes – all the fear and anxiety, while constantly staying calm and collected, trying to talk to his captors, never losing his head. Even when fighting for his life, there is an assertive calmness that comes across so strongly that you can do nothing but admire this man. Hanks' performance is so convincing, it almost doesn't look like acting anymore... and that's a huge compliment.<br/><br/>The same goes for the other actors, especially the men playing the Somali pirates. Before being cast for this film, none of them had any acting experience, which makes their performances all the more impressive. Then, it also makes one wonder how much of a compliment it actually is when a director literally picks you off the street because apparently he thinks that you're perfectly fit for the part of a menacing pirate, but that's food for another discussion, another time... In any case, he was right about them. These men ARE absolutely convincing and authentic. Especially the leader of the gang, played by Barkhad Abdi, is right on the money. He needs nothing more than the look in his eyes to convince you that you're right to feel absolutely terrified of him.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, Captain Phillips is very well made. My only grievance is Greengrass' typical trademark: the shaky handy-cam. Here and there it's almost enough to make you seasick, and I really wish he would ease up on this gimmick, because although it adds to the feeling of suspense and chaos, that doesn't weigh up to the headache it causes. Steady-cam was invented for a reason, mister director. Use it. Still, the other qualities of the film are easily strong enough to make up for this one point of critique. The pacing is excellent, it grips you like a pitbull and never lets go until the credits roll in. Colouring and lighting effects are perfectly used for an incredibly realistic feel and claustrophobic atmosphere. Everything feels very real and absolutely no sentimental plot devices are exploited here. Top-notch screen writing.<br/><br/>I can do nothing other than strongly recommend this film. It is very intense and at times very violent, and definitely one of the best films in its genre. And if this doesn't convince you, see it for one of Tom Hanks' best performances of his career."
"smatysia","6","2","4","9 November 2014"," No way to maintain suspense
","Well, the actors playing the two main characters, Tom Hanks as Richard Phillips and Barkhad Abdi as Muse were excellent. Particularly Mr. Abdi, as a non-professional actor. I expect that he will find a dearth of roles in the future, however. There was very little character development or exposition on any other character. Outstanding cinematography on the ocean, the port, and the giant ship. Quite a contrast, taking the action from the huge cargo vessel to the claustrophobic enclosed lifeboat.<br/><br/>But there was really no way to create or maintain mush suspense, which the film really needed, since the ultimate outcome was known to me."

","Captain Phillips is a true nail-biter which also happens to be intelligently written. It is hard to believe that anyone could go through what the good captain went through and keep it together so well, but if anyone can make such an outlandish true story seem believable, it's Tom Hanks. Special mention go to Barkhad Abdi, who plays the front man of the Somalian pirates, for playing a truly engrossing and nuanced villain. But the biggest accomplishment of the film is that it goes to show that everything can go absolutely according to plan and something could still go wrong, as showcased in the pirate's invasion of the ship. I really don't know what else to say about it. It's just really good."

","This is based upon a true story.<br/><br/>Commercial shipping seaman, Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) takes his ship, the Maersk Alabama, into the Somali Basin in the Pacific Ocean and wants to have the crew perform security drills in case Somali Pirates come around. Later the Maersk is boarded by the Somali Pirates and it's up to Captain Phillips to protect his crew and the cargo. <br/><br/>These days we see too many true stories, or stories inspired by true events made into movies and the key to an eventual good movie may be to wait things out until something happens. How much of these true or inspired by actual events movies are actually true we have no way of knowing. If we are entertained, we really don't care, do we? Well, the purists do, I suppose. But, this true story was reported via TV news, newspapers and magazines, worldwide and a book written, too, by Captain Phillips (A Captain's Duty), so we have some idea that most of what we see actually was true. <br/><br/>Whether most of what we see in here is true or not, this is an excellent, engaging and entertaining movie. The photography, dialogues, editing and acting performances were unbelievably good. This movie lived up to all the hype Hollywood put out. <br/><br/>Many reports of this incident said that Captain Phillips wanted to do security drills in case the Somali pirates showed up, but what we see in the beginning of this movie is that Captain Phillips was in the process of having those drills performed, BUT just a couple minutes into getting those drills ready, the Somali pirates show up. Okay, so maybe most of those drills were cut. We were waiting for the Somali pirates anyway. <br/><br/>You may ask why the Maersk crew didn't have guns to ward off the pirates. This wasn't addressed except for one conversation within the crew that some complained they didn't sign up to be a mercenaries. Still the owners of the Maersk knew the possible dangers. I thought some statement at the end of the movie would address this concern. Didn't happen. <br/><br/>One thing I didn't understand. Captain Phillips, at one point, gets away from the Pirates and goes into the water and didn't swim toward the Navy Destroyer and the pirates get him back. Did I miss something? You tell me. Or was this something that really didn't happen and poetic license ruled. Huh?<br/><br/>Yes, it's a good story, well performed by all, but it's the photography that really captures you. It is outstanding. Combine all that with the Editing and you have something really special. <br/><br/>The most exciting part of this is when the Somali Pirates take Captain Phillips hostage in the lifeboat and then it is here that we see the U.S. Navy and the Navy Seals come into play. You will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. Again, I cannot credit the photography too much. The photography and the Editing made this movie into something more than what we expected. <br/><br/>The movie is up for Best Picture and Tom Hanks is up for Best Actor and some of that may happen. I would go for Best Picture. (10/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only a few S-Words and one GDI was heard."
"Greywolf907","8","2","4","22 January 2014"," Chilling
","Out of all of the Oscar nominated films that I have seen so far, Captain Phillips is the one that I have enjoyed the most as a piece of cinema. While some are banging on about 'Gravity' (Dull and boring) or '12 years a slave' (hackneyed and clichéd') Captain Phillips actually delivers. A fact based story expertly handled by Brit Paul Greengrass who manages to get the story told brilliantly. The Pirates, by and large are extremely believable, and the leader of the band, Muse, is particularly chilling, giving a tremendous performance opposite Tom Hanks by the book Captain. No point in over glossing the film, it's a damn good story, well told and executed without going over the top, especially at the conclusion where the US military intervene and save the day, even that is done in a muted and subdued fashion...a clear indication that the film is directed by an Englishman as opposed to a God fearing, bible chewing flag waving American!<br/><br/>Good film, worth a look."
"DJHilliard6393","8","2","4","21 January 2014"," Captivating film with a few down moments
","Pre Review and Hype: I first saw a trailer for this movie in late 2013 and immediately knew I wanted to see it. After the trailer, it fell underneath the radar until it hit the television for commercials. I never got the chance to see it on the big screen, so I can only imagine how much more intense it would've been at the movie theater.<br/><br/>Review (may contain spoilers):<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass, director of many thrillers, takes the viewer on a roller-coaster of emotions. Starting in the beginning with a slight bit of sadness, then when the pirates are spotted during a drill it gets a little heated. The movie does a lot of the ups and downs, going from white-knuckle intense to just coasting along. Greengrass does an amazing job at telling the story and I feel as though all the ups and downs are necessary in order to fully engage the viewer to make them feel as though they are right there with the crew of the Maersk Alabama.<br/><br/>The most significant parts of the movie are so well done that I felt as though they weren't acting at all and I was right there with them. One of these parts is right as the pirates are trying to board the ship and Phillips is trying to ram them off course to avoid being boarded. Eventually, however, they get boarded and the crew has to hide in the bowels of the ship in order to not be seen by the pirates.<br/><br/>After the pirates board the ship, things start to get more interesting. As seen in the trailer, Phillips advises his crew that they have been boarded and tells them to remember one thing: You know the ship better than they do. Once the pirates reach the cabin, they take Phillips and two other crew members hostage and demand control of the ship.<br/><br/>The leader of the Somalis eventually gets bum-rushed in the Engine Room and becomes a hostage himself, as the crew radio up to the cabin and let the other pirates know. The pirates are given the opportunity to leave on one of the lifeboats with the money in the safe in exchange for Phillips, who was singled out and taken as a sole hostage. After a dispute between the two groups, Phillips has to get in the lifeboat and the pirates con the crew into exchanging hostages. However, when Phillips is in the lifeboat, they knock him to the ground, shut off the lifeboat's entrance, and plunge into the waters below.<br/><br/>I go into any more detail about the movie because I believe the rest of it is so crucial to see for yourself. I explained about half of the movie, and the rest of it is the best part. I strongly urge everyone who can withstand a little bit of downtime in a 2 hour movie to go see this movie. The plot is so simple, yet so well done that I was floored even though I had high expectations.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is such a brilliant actor. The emotion on his face and in his actions throughout the whole movie made it feel as though it were the actual events unfolding live.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10. Must See."

","Based on true events about the first American cargo ship to be overtaken by pirates in a long long time. The ship was under Captain Phillips control, the pirates were Somalian. The event is somewhat recent, taking place in 2009. <br/><br/>Now the movie premise is simple enough, ship gets taken, hostage situation, negotiations etc. The execution of it all is great. The movie slowly builds up tension and it continues to do so till the very end. The last hour or so was really tense, I was just keep wondering what will happen, who will survive etc etc. <br/><br/>Acting was great, especially by Tom Hanks. He was exceptionally great at the last scene, I really felt that moment. The pirates were great too. You actually feel for them as the movie shows you their background (somewhat) and its not a simple good vs bad guy scenario, it could have been more fleshed out though. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was good, cinematography was great. <br/><br/>8/10"
"arrfan30","8","2","4","17 January 2014"," A Stunning Movie
","The film is about the hijack of a ship named ""Maersk Alabama"" headed by Captain Richard Phillips. The film starts at a slow pace.The role of Captain Phillips portrayed by Tom Hanks who's one of the best actors in Hollywood, is depicted very well. The fear of the Somalian Pirates travels around the crew members in a gradual manner but one can see the tension steadily rising with the Captain Phillips who orders a security drill just in case. Two skiffs of pirates start out towards the ship but one heads back believing the false alarm raised by the Captain. The other skiff with 4 pirates advances.Once the pirates come on board after a little struggle, Captain does everything to keep the crew members out of sight leaving out himself and couple of other guys to the pirates.The fragile bond between the Pirate Lead ""Muse"" and Hanks starts there which would go long way in the film. This is where the film increases its pace and moves on.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks would nail any character and that's well known to everyone but the role of Pirate Lead played by Barkhad Abdi is so intriguing and natural. The role fits him very well and also made him get nominated for the Oscars,BAFTA,Golden Globe under the category of 'Best Supporting Actor'. Hanks has done a great job in bringing out the fear and tension that surrounds him in each and every situation of confrontation. The aftermath of the hostage situation is where Hanks gets to prove his real talent of acting. <br/><br/>The screenplay could have been better and there were situations that needed sharp rise. The climax might have been a bit short but nonetheless, it maintained the grip. The reaction of the ship's crew once the Captain is taken off could have been enhanced. The bridge between the first half and second half should have been better cause one tends to forget the fact that the Pirates came for the ship and took the Captain as an accident implying the fact that it focuses more on the hostage situations in the 'Life Boat' involving Hanks and the pirates.<br/><br/>Overall verdict : Captain Phillips is DEFINITELY worth a watch."

","This movie went beyond my expectations. The matter of the fact is that tom hanks was the pulse of the movie, but the actors in the supporting role especially the Somali pirates were just awesome. The kind of weapons that they used, the language and the Somalian influence in their English was commendable. Of course they are from Somalia but i have to give them the credibility for that. The way Paul Greengrass has directed the movie is remarkable, it couldn't have been better.<br/><br/>Tom hanks did his homework, studied the character. The kind of clothes that the original captain Phillips preferred the kind of footwear the body language and even the glasses that he wore, i could feel captain Phillips in Tom's performance. It is so beautifully directed and edited that at no point in the movie you feel OK so ""that scene does not need to be there"", ""this is not good"". You feel everything is in place.<br/><br/>All summed up, the movie is just awesome. But there are few scenes that make you wanna see this movie again. 3 for me were the talks between the Somalian captain and captain Phillips, the scene where they are about to shoot captain Phillips (blindfolded) and last but not the least the scene where captain Phillips undergoes medical procedure after being bought aboard. These scenes take the cake for me. My thanks and congratulations to the team of Captain Phillips to make such a masterpiece.

"Cristi_Ciopron","7","2","4","1 January 2014"," Tactlessness
","20 yrs. after 'Gump', Hanks still plays the heroic average guy, struggling for his right to blandness. Nonetheless, is Hanks a good actor? Yes.<br/><br/>With his purple mean mouth, Hanks looks unsettling, he should have played at least a version of Douglas' William 'D-Fens' Foster, the psychotic citizen. That was Schumacher's day! Here, he impersonates at length a nasty, bearded, almost morose child; verging on sulky. (Meanwhile, 'Gump' has been conveniently forgotten, and I blame the fans from back in the day, for their neglect.) Phillips, called Irish, because he's a Yankee Irish, is Gump, Doe and Ulysses into one. This is the gist of the caper.<br/><br/>There's not much to tell about the story (Somali fishermen turned pirates climb aboard a commercial ship, etc.) or the characters, either barely sketched or even seen, or convincingly bland, average people.<br/><br/>Hanks acts like a blander De Niro, and intent on playing, among a cast who doesn't (the Somali do, perhaps, but that's different). Hanks' fans, if there still are any, will be shown plenty of him.<br/><br/>There is humor ('Do I look like a beggar?', retorts one of the Somali pirates, when being offered only tens of thousands).<br/><br/>The script's virtue is conspicuously one of restraint: it abstains from glamorizing its heroic average guy. I have read an interview with Greengrass, and he knew his trade. (The interview with Ryan Lambie, Paul Greengrass interview: Captain Phillips & crime stories—'I have had a wonderful reaction, but the few that haven't liked it tend to be evenly weighted in one of those two directions. I had one guy the other day saying that it's just a propaganda for the US navy. Then I have had others saying you're way too sympathetic to the Somalis.') Politically, the movie upholds a rather right—wing take (the union guy seems a bit coward, the military are portrayed as ruthlessly determined, but they achieve their goal, and we can't feel really sorry for the Somali pirates, though they got a rough deal).<br/><br/>It's a very interesting movie, and Hanks did a good role, he looks almost handsome; and take a look at his car and luggage, and pretty wife. Now Greengrass says he meant it as a caper; I disbelieve it.<br/><br/>'Phillips' indulges in this average decency and it takes its shape, it morphs into it: not without humor, since we are shown the generic triteness of Hanks' family talks and worded feelings.<br/><br/>He is Ulysses. Like with Gump, the movie is named after him, after its protagonist, to give the true impression of who this John Doe is. The Irish is another Doe. Yet, the script lefts him quite uncharacterized, except for a few essentials. I complained that there's too little of Phillips, not too much.<br/><br/>Hanks gives his Irish a glow, an aura, against the effaced play of the rest of the cast; a glow of acting. This is all the more conspicuous, since he has no character to begin with.<br/><br/>And so, the movie appears to be not neutral, but affected, the style feels affected and precious, a commodity, a merchandise. It all begins with Hanks' unconvincing glow, with the ostentatious hammering of the Irish's decent, endearingly trite ways, the talk with his almost unseen in the frame wife.<br/><br/>We are being lectured, and in a quite conventional style; this is not the movie ease (in front of a camera, there's no ease but a movie ease, a device) from some European, or '70s American movies, but a didactic one.<br/><br/>So, the movie feels cold, empty and didactic, boosting of the national sentiment, perhaps. There is a certain lack of tact, even meanness in showing the absolute triteness as decency, etc., there's a lack of feel on the director's part.<br/><br/>The heroic average people deserved a fairer, kinder, warmer, perhaps lighter movie; their very mentioning makes the template seem turgid, basically wrong, affected.<br/><br/>There's something heartless and rude in the way the movie was thought out; the job wasn't for Greengrass.<br/><br/>The script wasn't for a _techno—thriller or a drama; it was for a chronicle. Hence, Greengrass' directing seems uninspired and clumsy.<br/><br/>Against the intended meaning, the purpose, the style proves poor, clueless, harsh and turgid. The notion of this movie is wrong, as Greengrass mistook a chronicle for a _techno—thriller or an epic drama."

","It seems that director Paul Greengrass has a singular gift that hugely benefits his decision to stay exclusive to the thriller genre. That is that he uses a shaky-cam style of cinematography with traditional cameras to create the illusion that Hollywood (and by extension, us) is there in the middle of the events. It draws you inextricably into the film, almost making you part of it. It's a trick that has never failed him. But what makes Captain Phillips such an extraordinary thriller is how much attention is paid to the villains. Newcomer Barkhad Adbi delivers a great performance as Muse, the leader of the pirates. He is shown as being out of his depth, and once the hijacking of the ship goes awry, he is not angry, but afraid. There are those back home who would see him dead if he returns anything less than filthy rich. So when Phillips offers him the entirety of cash on the ship ($30,000), Muse knows why that is insufficent. This leads to a relentlessly intense film that escalates to a standoff between a small US Navy fleet and the four pirates in a lifeboat. It is the best thriller to be released in years."

","Before I watched this for the first time, I had only heard the name of it, but I did not know what it was about. When I first learned about what it was about, I had never heard of Somali pirates and I had no idea that they would ransom boats to make money. It was very interesting to learn about that.
This movie is about a ship captain, Captain Phillips, whose ship is taken over by Somali pirates. His crew ends up being fine, but he gets taken hostage by the pirates as ransom.
I did not know anything about this story before I watched the movie. I am not sure how accurate it is either. I would have to do more research on it. It was so crazy though! I know there are a million crazy things that have happened throughout history, but for some reason I just found this one really crazy. It blew my mind that just four men with machine guns could be a threat against a whole crew of men. I had my mouth open the whole time I was watching this movie.
The director of this movie is Paul Greengrass. He did a really good job of creating suspense and tension in this movie. I was literally at the edge of my seat the whole time, and my muscles were super tense. The main actors in this movie are Barkhad Abdi, Tom Hanks, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali, Michael Chernus, and Barkhad Abdirahman. I have not seen any of these actors in any other movies except for Tom Hanks. They did an amazing job. It was kind of scary. I love Tom Hanks; he has always been a great actor. My favorite scene in this movie was when Captain Phillips was trying to get off the boat he had been captured in by telling the pirates that he had to go to the bathroom. Instead of going to the bathroom, he pushed one of the men off the boat and jumped off, trying to swim away. It was so intense.
This was a crazy and intense, but really good movie. Every scene left me wondering what would happen next. It was kind of nice that I did not know the story, because the suspense was even better. I would recommend this movie to anyone who also likes suspense and is looking for a good realistic action movie."

","This was a really good film. There may be a lot of talking but the action makes up for the talking. I like how they show where the pirates come from and how they live. It makes one feel sympathy for the actions the pirates are committing. I like the actors they chose to represent all the main characters. Something that I felt was very overkill was how many american soldiers they needed for one little boat."

","This movie hurt all the feelings inside. It was a very tense movie. I could never put myself through that much anxiety ever again. That's not to say it was a bad movie. It was just very tense and it was hard to watch. I know that it's based off of actual events and it blows my mind that something like that would happen. The Somali people were so desperate that they felt they had to take over ships and take hostages to make money. And they made a lot of money. Most demanded millions of dollars to free a hostage and many pirates took more than one hostage. These people were so desperate to make money that they would take over a boat to take the crew as hostages. Most didn't steal any of the cargo.<br/><br/>Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is just doing his job as captain when four Somali pirates board his ship and take him hostage. They demand money and Phillips gives them all the money onboard the ship which amounts to about $30,000. But the pirates aren't satisfied with only $30,000. The crew of the ship captures the leader of the pirates and try to have a hostage exchange, but it doesn't quite go the way they planned. Captain Phillips is not released and the pirates leave in a lifeboat. As the pirates get closer to land, the navy is called in and surround the small lifeboat. The pirates then demand $10 million for Captain Phillips to go free. The negotiator on board the ship tries everything he can to satisfy the pirates and get them to release the hostage. They won't budge. Phillips escapes for a matter of minutes when he tells the leader of the pirates that he needs to go to the bathroom. They let him out of the boat enough to go to the bathroom as there isn't one in the lifeboat, and he pushes the pirate standing outside with him into the water and jumps in going the other way. He tries to escape the pirates and hopefully swim over to the Navy ship. He doesn't make it and the pirates beat him up a little when he gets back to the boat. This whole time Phillips stays relatively calm. He doesn't snap until the pirates tie up his hands and hoist them above his head. Then Navy snipers shoot three pirates on the boat, because at this point the captain of the band is on the Navy ship waiting for Somali elders to arrive for negotiation. Captain Phillips really loses it after the pirates are shot. All four of the pirates were between the ages of 17 and 19 years old, and Phillips was beginning to become close with the one that had stepped on glass while trying to find the crew of the ship they'd hijacked. The last ten or so minutes of the movie is of Captain Phillips receiving medical attention from a Navy doctor on the Navy ship. You see him crying as the doctor asks him questions about how he's doing and he tries to answer her questions through the tears. When she asks him if all the blood on his body is from the cut on his forehead, he whimpers and tells her that it isn't all his. That just makes your heart break for him. He held it together for a really long time.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, but I probably won't ever watch it again because of how intense it was through the whole thing. I was feeling a lot of stress just watching the movie and I can't imagine what they were actually feeling. I know it's just acting, but I was convinced that they were all terrified through the whole thing. Tom Hanks looked a lot like the real Captain Richard Phillips, so I'll give them that much. Even if the movie wasn't totally historically accurate, it was a good movie and it go the message across."

","""Captain Phillips"" works well as a dramatic piece rather than as any terrific character study or deep, involved piece of story-telling; it is a picture-perfect exercise in execution of suspense - nobody ever really feels safe and it is difficult, due to it being of no real fixed genre or possessive of a stone-wall story, to entirely tie down as to where it will all end up as you watch it unfold. As it roars towards its finale on the open seas of the Indian Ocean, all four of the feasible possibilities that I counted pertaining to who lives; who dies and what anybody gets away with are still open to happening.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass' film, based on the true events which befell poor Captain Richard Phillips of the container ship Maersk Alabama and his crew in 2009, may very well be entitled as such, and indeed sold as a film depicting the events which involved said man, but it is really about three captains: an ordinary captain of a container ship; a pirate captain and then later a Navy captain who commands a gunship. By the end, when Phillips has been forced onto the side-lines - relegated to a supporting act in his own supposed film - the battle has moved on from its beginnings and into the uncharted territories whereby the pirate goes up against the soldier who is himself forced into his own series of predicaments and moral cul-de-sacs pertaining to who potentially lives and who potentially dies.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is the eponymous Philips, an uncomplicated man whose life story to this point the film does not seem to think important. Aged around fifty, he and his wife live in an affluent neighbourhood in the wilderness of Vermont. They drive around, worrying about the world they live in, which is becoming a more desperate place to live and apparently changing too dramatically. Are they referring to the then-recent economic crash? The spread of terror in spite of a war on terror? We cannot tell. One thing they do admit to is a worry for their adult children, whose prospects in a swelling job market appear gloomy.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a million hypothetic miles away, a Somali terror cell rapidly concoct a gang of misfits to engage in some piracy on the open waves - their target is a freighter of some kind. The Somali strand moves very quickly; is causality driven - its golden brown tones are a stark contrast to the chilly blues of Vermont. Eventually, we witness our Phillips traverse to Oman, where he will commandeer a freighter ship and take it to port in Asia.<br/><br/>Eventually, when both sides are out and on the waves off the coast of Africa, there is a coming together when Phillips' ship seems to drift away from the beaten ground of the shipping lanes and the pirates' crude radar systems reveal such a thing. One of them makes the observation that it has 'wondered away from the herd' and we realise they might just as well be back in their native land hunting some sort of animal. In a genuinely sharp piece of direction, Greengrass kept the actors portraying the crews of the container ship and the pirate boat away from one another so that their initial contact is the first time they all meet anyway... Whilst the pirates have the guns, they are clueless as to the layout of the boat, which of course the crew know inside out - this is a dynamic executed perfectly and entertainingly without being exploitative.<br/><br/>The film allows for a basic degree of characterisation between the two crews, dialogue from the pirates outline where they are coming from and why they do what they do. They are quick to stress that they are not terrorist affiliated - most likely, they couldn't give a damn what America fund the Israelis to do to Palestine: it is strictly business, but does the film dodge tackling something a little more substantial because of this? At one other point, the film affords a member of either crew synergy through thematic when one of Phillips' points out that ""...we (I) didn't sign up to the Navy"" when it seems conflict with an armed group is inevitable, while a pirate who cuts himself on a trap made form broken glass points out he ""...didn't come along for this"" Both are getting more than they bargained for.<br/><br/>Greengrass' approach to the material is to essentially begin the film as a heist picture, one wherein things do not all go according to plan for those attempting the heist; throughout the middle act, there are echoes of ""Die Hard"" as the victims of a very sudden, potentially violent, assault must use their wits to get out of it. Amusingly, this develops into a final act which seems to borrow heavily from ""Dog Day Afternoon"" for reasons I will not reveal. Not knowing a single thing about the events depicted in the film may have helped in it being as affecting as it was, but this is still a very well made drama with excellent attention to aesthetic and pacing. If you are unfamiliar with the true-story, or indeed the book ""A Captain's Duty"" which depicts the events of those fateful few days, you will no doubt enjoy ""Captain Phillips""."

","The great risk for this movie (based on a true story) was to be overly grim and rough on the audience. The potential for two hours of anguish, nightmare and psychological torture was there. Instead, Greengrass is very good in balancing drama, action and thrill, also with the great merit of humanizing the pirates (victims themselves) and focusing on the relation between them and Tom Hanks.
Hanks delivers his usual deep and friendly interpretation, and he's a great part of the success of this movie.
Overall, two hours of action and thrill that will keep you entertained."

","20 October 2013. There's seemingly a fine line between authentic portrayal and dramatic pacing and with Captain Phillips, the problem, and perhaps the only one, seems to be that authentic portrayal won out much more than the pacing so that the captivating elements of the movie were not always consistently presented. The beginning and especially the ending of the movie, one of the most penetratingly intriguing scenes in film, another Tom Hanks' Saving Private Ryan (1998) moment featured at the end of that movie, were compellingly presented in their almost vicarious, documentary style that brought the audience into a vividly convincing world, almost as if one were watching a real world quality homemade film capturing real living of particular interest on screen. Yet like a homemade movie, there were moments that seemed to stall and lose their energetic vitality so that the editing just didn't allow the audience to maintain that zestful interest throughout the movie. Even a movie based on a true events such as Fly Away Home (1996) or the fictional dramatic documentary style presentation of sci-fi horror Apollo 18 (2011) had a continuous flow to their presentations. Even as long ago as the 60s, Milton Krasner was nominated for best black and white cinematography for Fate Is The Hunter (1964) a pseudo-documentary style of an investigation into a major airline crash that presented its material in a well edited, serious, but well-paced fashion. Other well edited and audience-friendly paced movie of Captain Phillip's likeness might be United 93 (2006), the military drama Jarhead (2005), and Munich (2005), even Argo (2012). What does really shine about this movie is its focus on the primary characters and the psychological interaction and the natural ambiance about the entire movie making this authentic presentation much more meaningful and penetrating for the audience."

This movie took of on minute 10 or so, from there until the ending... non-stop suspenseful, thrilling, well acted and directed scenes with a great cast. To think that some of Somalis had never done a movie before... unbelievable. Imagine: it's your first ever part in a movie, it already stars Tom Hanks, in my opinion one of the greatest actors of all time, and you have to be intimidating and scaring him all movie long.
There wasn't a single moment in this movie where I got bored.<br/><br/>Also, let me just talk about that ending scene. So Spoilers from here.
The moment they shoot everyone in the boat, and Captain Phillips is hanging there blindfolded, and you hear nothing but the Captain, who doesn't know what happened... I thought: 'okay, wow, so that was the most intense part piece of movie I have seen in a long time'. Then they get him of the boat and take him to safety... The doctors start to examine him, and try to talk to him... Boy, the moment he breaks... I got tears in my eyes. And that doesn't happen to often. The way Tom Hanks acted made it look so real, so gripping. He should have won an oscar for that scene alone.<br/><br/>So that's my review. A thrilling, gripping, exciting, well acted masterpiece.

You can bet your house, boat, car and all your worldly possessions on anything Tom Hanks appearing in or even directing being a movie worth watching. Captain Phillips is no exception to that rule. 
Set in the pirate patrolled seas off the coast of Somalia, Hanks captains a cargo ship toward Mombasa. In a culminating battle against a band of Somalian pirates, captain Phillips and crew do their best to protect their vessel. Based on a true story, Hanks conveys well the seemingly unresolvable, life threatening plight captain Phillips individually endures. Thankfully for him the US Navy is deployed to attempt a rescue..
A great performance from the Somalian pirate cast keeps you tettering on the edge. A never knowing suspense of whether the chaos will descend into a blood bath at any moment.

However, I do not enjoy every well acted film. The film itself brings no new revelation to what happened in the incident. Indeed, if anything the film towed the administration's line and ignored controversial details that have since emerged, like ""what happened to the money?"" and the alleged multiple shots that were fired into each pirate, including those done after boarding the boat.<br/><br/>This is a nice white bread action flick you can take your family to go see."

","Tom Hanks is terrific in the title role, playing the real life captain of the Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship that was hijacked off the eastern coast of Africa by Somali pirates in April, 2009. Although the filmmakers changed some elements of the actual story to make Phillips appear more heroic - and less to blame for the incident - there is no doubt that he suffered greatly, physically and psychologically, during the ordeal. For days, Captain Phillips was the sole hostage of four volatile Somalis in an enclosed lifeboat; they hoped to receive millions of dollars in an exchange.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass and editor Christopher Rouse (who received an Oscar nomination) did an excellent job of capturing the suffocating heat and cramped spaces of the lifeboat, while Hanks portrays a wide range of emotions, mostly without words. The actor's most powerful scene is the film's last, as Hanks perfectly affects a man in shock, mentally reliving the horror of his captivity while involuntarily sobbing in relief to be freed from it all.<br/><br/>Barkhad Abdi plays Muse, who dubbed Phillips ""Irish"", in an Academy Award nominated Best Supporting Actor performance. Muse struggled to keep his own crewmates under control while resisting the pressure exerted by the United States Navy. The situation was eventually resolved by SEAL Team 6 snipers, whose skills enabled them to simultaneously 'execute' the three remaining hijackers after Muse had been tricked into boarding the U.S.S. Bainbridge (a destroyer) for negotiations.<br/><br/>The movie was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, as was its Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, and Adapted Screenplay writer Billy Ray."

","Captain Phillips starts off on a very interesting note, then somewhere deeper into its voyage, it drops to a resting point. The first hour of this film is gripping, and somewhat tense, however, the last hour is, relatively monotonous.<br/><br/>What plays well into Captain Phillips's hands is that it is a biography, but it being shot almost like a fictional action flick kind of withdraws some much needed emotional attachment and interest, at least to the level that is deserved and necessary.<br/><br/>Performances were satisfactory all around, but, I fear Barkhad Abdi may have gotten an Oscar Nomination for all the wrong reasons, because though his performance was sufficient, it wasn't really Oscar material.<br/><br/>This film hit some areas very well, but sadly missed others, and like the U.S. Navy, it struggled to target all the meaty points as needed; it seemed to have a target on one or two targets at a time, but never that elusive three, so with that said, a 6.6/10 rating would be fitting."

Once the US forces engage them, their only bargaining chip is the captain's life. The pirates have their AK-47's but they never seem managing enough to even consider pulling the trigger. The fact that the pirates speak English is a problem for the movie. A hostage taker is far less intimidating when you can communicate with him. Captain Phillips manages to seem very casual as he gives his captors a tour, and even offers them food from his kitchen. <br/><br/>You can't go wrong with Tom Hanks as the virtuous 'good soldier' who represents American model citizenship wherever he goes.

","Although it is basically a true story, I must be one of the few who did not know the ending already, since I had never heard this specific story. How much it matters if you already do or not I cannot say, but for me the film was not really about the resolution until near the end because for most of the time it is about the moment and what is going on there and then. It does this by breaking the story down pretty well into such contained but yet connected moments so that it is effective at the time and also has a flow to it.<br/><br/>There are moments where it doesn't really keep that up – some of them it needs, but others it doesn't. In the tension and in the lulls, the film does well to keep things evenly balanced so that you don't completely turn against the Somalis as if they were generic baddies, but at the same time it never pushes anything down your throat about their situation. The one thing I was surprised that it came on strong about was the military response. I'm not sure if the film was trying to make a comment by playing it quite so ""Hollywood"" at the end, but to me it did feel a bit odd in the film to have the music, camera-work and dialogue of a Michael Bay movie occurring in a situation where they were facing down a couple of guys with more feet than shoes. It still worked, don't get me wrong, but at the same time it had a generic feel to this aspect that I could have done without – particularly since earlier it seemed smarter than that.<br/><br/>What helps it in these moments (and throughout) is that Hanks is great. He plays it out in a natural and convincing way, whether he is over- confident or in shock. Much has been made of Abdi's performance and I do see why, because it is frequently easy to forget that he is acting because he does seem quite real throughout. The supporting cast perhaps have fewer opportunities for nuance but they are still convincing and play their parts well, particularly those in the confines of the lift raft.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips could have been a little shorter and been better for it and, while I don't totally see the film that others did, I did still enjoy it. It is tense and yet nuanced throughout, only really producing some aspects that don't work quite as well in the meantime."

","Allow me to start with what you likely have already read — this film is well-crafted and tense procedural about a true story. The fact that I still found it tense and exciting, even when I already knew the ending (including the oft-mentioned Captain Phillips ending scene) is a high compliment.<br/><br/>So why tell this story? I took it as a meditation on powerlessness, a film that didn't deal with heroes or villains, only victims. There's a shipping crew that is easily sought out by pirates, and there are the pirates that ultimately fail. In either case, it's not as if either side feels in control of their destiny. They're just playing to some largely unseen authority. After the crew deflects the first attempted piracy in the film, one character says that as a union member, he didn't sign up for this kind of danger. The reaction? He chose to work on a ship that went around the horn of Africa. ""What did you expect?"" he's asked. Later, when one of the pirates steps on broken glass and injures he foot, he's asked the very same question by his leaders. Even the two competing captains — the pirate and the title character — ultimately are swayed (or saved) by the power of the state. What did they expect? To be the one in control?"

In an age where superheroes, spray-painted abs and fast cars have aided in making careers, Hanks can be considered one of the very few who walked this path playing roles of ordinary men by putting up extraordinary displays of diverse talent. These men literally play off each other's talent in the cleverly written screenplay. While Hanks represent the humanity of all that takes place in the deep blue waters Ali's portrayal of Muse will represent the distance humans will go through in order to survive in an environment that they did not chose to be born into. Muse isn't the pirate we see in Jack Sparrow or Captain Barbosa. Instead Muse is the real deal.

Or even to provide basic context for the events it depicts.<br/><br/>The production is certainly impeccable. The shipboard settings, the procedures, and Tom Hanks' character are so totally believable that it's easy to forget you're not watching a documentary. (*Mild spoilers*...) Hanks' initial efforts to safeguard his crew, and to calm the pirates, are clever and engrossing. But at some point, that impetus evaporates, and we're left with a very realistic, very tense situation in which the lead character no longer plays any part other than that of helpless victim. Things unwind like clockwork, with no particular twists or surprises. That may be how it happened, but it's not how to make a great action film.<br/><br/>I did appreciate Greengrass' effort to humanize the pirates. (If there's an Oscar going for this film, it belongs to Barkhad Abdi, for his nuanced performance as the pirate leader.) But the film stops short of any real exploration of the social or political pressures behind the incident it depicts. It fails to comment on the astounding spectacle of multiple billion-dollar navy ships and SEAL teams doing battle with four guys in a dinghy. It doesn't even address the obvious question of why a valuable merchant ship, registered in the most gun-happy country on Earth, and traveling through known pirate waters, doesn't have a weapons locker, or a security guard, or a single personal sidearm.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is excellent as always, but this is not an Oscar-worthy *role*. Hanks plays on just two notes: first restrained and competent, then shifting quite abruptly to broken and terrified. This seems very realistic, and it's perfectly played. But it's just not that interesting. The script does little to analyze Phillips' eventual breakdown; it merely notes it as one more part of the scenario.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I enjoyed watching Captain Phillips, and I greatly admired the technique of both Greengrass and Hanks. But I didn't find the film particularly insightful, memorable or - considering the lack of character development or plot - exciting. It stands up well enough as a simple document of an actual event, but fails to tell me why that event might have been important enough to merit a big-budget movie treatment."

"Jerghal","8","0","0","9 February 2014"," Good All-round entertainment
","Captain Phillips is based on true events and director Paul Greengrass who has his roots in docu filmmaking has already plenty of experience in making military themed films. It's filmed in his trademark shaky-cam style: this gives it a more dynamic feel and more immersion for the audience but for some people it might get a bit annoying. Performances are all-round excellent with Tom Hanks as the venerable Captain and some unknown actors as the Somalians. A good choice as well known actors might have been distracting and less believable. It's also obvious the US military lent their cooperation to this movie as it clearly demonstrates how the American army works as an efficient machine. Some actors in this film are also real-life army personnel. In this film it's not a problem as it doesn't feel like a military promotion as some other films like Annapolis or Act of Valor. Captain Phillips will keep you entertained for a good 2 hours so it's certainly worth the watch. For me it can win some Oscars but Gravity still remains my favorite."

","Tom Hanks embarks on a tense hostage-captor battle with Somali pirates. Enough said. That sentence summarizes the epic proportions this 'based off a true story' movie has. However, due to the intricate substance of this movie, it requires some more elaboration. Tom Hanks stars in his most thrilling role yet as Captain Richard Phillips. He is a captain for the cargo ship the Maersk Alabama heading to Mombasa. The film's realism is what really captures the essence of this amazing true story. The ship used in the film is identical to the real Maersk Alabama, which gives it an authentic and genuine feel.To top that off, this film was actually shot on the open water, no studio set was used. You can't get more authentic then that. Bravo to director Paul Greengrass and the cast for taking on such an arduous task. This film relies on several close up shots of the actors, which intensifies key moments in the plot that again contribute to the realism of the film. Hank's accent in the film wavers a little bit, which is usually common for actors. The Somali pirates pulled off a wicked performance as merciless pirates who stop at nothing to get what they want. The Somali pirate captain, who was played by Barkhad Abdi,gave an 'edge of your seat' performance. He gave a lot of depth to his character. It is a 100% guarantee your heart will be racing during this film. Fast paced, high intensity and overall insanely epic.The bonus features on the DVD version of this film offers you an inside-look into the story of Captain Phillips by none other than the real Captain Richard Phillips! If you are a fan of dramatic true stories and love Tom Hanks, this is definitely a film for you!"
"SumanShakya","7","0","0","1 February 2014"," Thrilling and Gripping
","Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy fame) has directed two films on important historic events, ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""United 93."" ""Captain Phillips"" is also based on a real story (a kind of story which you would likely read in Reader's Digest under drama in real life section) where an American cargo ship is hijacked by Somali pirates and the captain is held hostage.<br/><br/>The film on a whole captures the action sequences familiar from regular Hollywood movies and is overlong, which somewhat loses the impact of the film. Besides, the film somewhat lacks the novelty of 'United 93"" in filming the events or narrating the story and isn't very different from the regular movies. Despite the over length and the familiar premises of action, the film is thrilling, gripping, and exhausting. Tom Hanks as usual makes a remarkable performance through his wit trying to deal with the pirates and save his crew. In the climax, he just excels and makes you numb. I'm a little shaky about the film's or director's chances of getting an Oscar as story wise, the film is doesn't go beyond normal; but Tom Hanks surely is a deserving nominee for best actor this year. Had the film been trimmed a bit, the film would have been a very tight thriller of the year. On a whole, I liked the film and I'm sure you would find it entertaining.<br/><br/>Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4"
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","0","0","30 January 2014"," A Film Bolstered by Two Key Performances
","Director Paul Greengrass has carved out a nice little niche for himself in Hollywood. While occasionally delving into the imaginary trappings of action junkie heaven, the majority of Greengrass's movies are retellings of real life situations. They're movies where action has been imposed on ordinary people instead of the common trope of extraordinary people put in extraordinary situations. They're suspense films that require no suspension of disbelief because they are stories we know. They're uncomfortably topical yet while being as predictable as a Scandal Maker's-type made-for-TV movie, they're also engrossing.<br/><br/>It started with his lukewarm freshman project Resurrected (1989) the true story of a British Soldier during the Falkland Islands War. His predilection with real stories and current events continued with Bloody Sunday (2002), United 93 (2006) and Green Zone (2010) all of which had a contemporary feel about complex problems not yet solved at the time of their respective releases.<br/><br/>In comes Captain Phillips (2013), based on the harrowing adventure of Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) and his brush with modern piracy. His journey starts in Oman where he is assigned to deliver cargo to Mombasa. He's aware the horn of Africa is a hotbed for pirate activity and takes every precaution but a scrappy crew of Somali pirates is desperate to make bank and set their sights on his ship, the Maersk Alabama.<br/><br/>Even if I promised no spoilers, I'm guessing you as the reader know how it ends; even if you didn't see it on the news in the spring of 2009. Still, the entire movie hinges on your ability to suspend everything from prior knowledge of the incident to prior knowledge of action-movie mayhem and just go with it. I went with it and found the movie to be thrilling and intense. Much like all of Greengrass's movies, the film was a self-contained hyper-reality that showed its audience exactly what we needed to see and nothing more or less. In the words of Joe Friday, the film gives you ""Just the facts ma'am."" The film is buoyed by two remarkably different performers playing remarkably different roles. Tom Hanks is arguably the best actor of our generation playing everything from a gay lawyer with AIDS in Philadelphia (1993) to a wise-cracking party animal in Bachelor Party (1984) to a child's plaything in the Toy Story films (1995-2010). Add to that a charming personality and you've got the closest version of a male Meryl Streep as you're willing to find.<br/><br/>In Captain Phillips his heroics didn't come from a special ability or a John McClane-esque capacity to improvise; no his instincts were drilled in him by what looks like years of training. He accepted the reality of pirates approaching his ship and does everything in his power to mitigate whatever damage they're likely to do. Yet what sets the Captain apart from any of Tom Hank's other characters is once he's past the Worst Case Scenario Handbook his mind is always at work yet doesn't know where to go. He's unsure of his actions and tormented at the thought of what the pirates might do to him and his crew. In that sense we see a person who is a hero because he has to be but otherwise is a normal Joe.<br/><br/>Barkhad Abdi's performance as the lead pirate Abduwali Muse is a whole other beast. He plays him with scary realism, a down-and-out Somali with a strong need to prove something to the world. His world-weary face, pigeon-toed introverted mannerisms and surprising physical strength underlines a contemplative mind and desperate cunning. In another life, Muse could have had the craven fortitude and industry to become a successful business leader but due to geography he has to pay his dues by ""fishing"". Captain Phillips is Abdi's first full-feature experience acting and joins the ranks of Jennifer Hudson, Julie Andrews and Jaye Davidson as a first time Oscar nominee. Before becoming an overnight sensation, Abdi was no joke, a limo driver with little interest in acting; here's to hoping he follows up Captain Phillips with something worthwhile.<br/><br/>As with all Greengrass films, there are some slight third act problems. There's only so much you can do with five men stuck on a lifeboat and Greengrass doesn't have the considerable skills of Hitchcock to keep the energy going. There are some arbitrary images of Seal Team 6 jumping out of an aircraft in darkness and while I understand the principle belligerents in this tale are men couldn't there be more than two female characters? It's a minor sticking point but it's irksome when a talent like Catherine Keener is relegated to one single pointless scene.<br/><br/>There are three reasons why you should watch Captain Phillips and they are the names of Tom Hanks, Paul Greengrass and Barkhad Abdi. Abdi's freshman performance is vibrant and uninhibited and brings to mind the intensity of other first timers like Lou Castel in Fists in the Pocket (1965) and more recently Dwight Henry in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012). Paul Greengrass's intense, grabbed from the headlines style has served him well over the past decade and Captain Phillips further raises the bar for the action director. Finally, Tom Hanks once again develops a character so real and genuine that it's hard not to admire the actor who got his start in a little seen horror movie called He Knows You're Alone (1980). And I know I'm not alone in my disappointment that Hanks wasn't nominated this year for his stunning performance in Captain Phillips.<br/><br/>https://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
"lasttimeisaw","7","0","0","29 January 2014"," a mainstream production from the Hollywood assembly line
","A Hollywood-produced, politically correct, big studio vehicle, helmed by a world-class action artisan Paul Greengrass, stars the most revered actor of his generation, Tom Hanks as the titular captain, whose screen image is a paragon of an orthodox ordinary Joe alike American hero, in this seafaring hijack inspired by a true event in 2009 at Somali waters. It is a retaliation of the vicious circle from the poverty-stricken to the hegemony which sardonically offers them the alms and simultaneously capitalizes on their natural resources and weaponry merchandising, so it is not easy to hold a phlegmatic perspective to watch the man-made terror without deploring the sad truth how things have ended up like this, for sure we should inveigh against the piracy felony, all the same we should also see through the phenomena and ferret out the nitty-gritty which induces the atrocious tragedies. We have both parties to blame and need a soul-searching examination on our own conscience. <br/><br/>Greengrass adopts an engaging procedure to re-enact the white-knuckle happening of how the ship is seized by four Somali pirates (leading by a scrawny Muse, played by the first-time actor, now Oscar-nominee Abdi), parallels the narrative from both sides, playing mind games and a hide-and-seek inside the vessel, this is the first half, culminated with the pirates take captain Phillips as the hostage in a lifeboat, floating back the Somali. Apparently from the hindsight, it is a preventable incident, considering it is a US cargo ship, no one on board is equipped with any firearms at all? From a gun frenzy country where campus shooting is rampant, it is quite implausible, but sometimes the truth is as simple as that, the pirates' boarding process is rough and ready, clearly the affluent corporate which owns the ship skimps on its defense system, although they are fully aware of the potential peril could happen anytime. Otherwise, there would be no big deal to defeat four sea marauders (one is barely a child) even they're equipped with AK-18.<br/><br/>Anyway, the second half, Captain Phillips is held captive within a lifeboat with the pirates on the billowy sea, since then, the film heavily hinges on Hank's performance to emanate the brewing desperation during the so-called ""negotiation"" between US rescue team (SEAL, frogmen are all standby) and the cornered pirates four. It is a precious platform to let Hanks finally have something extraordinary to offer, he completes it with consummate precision and sublimates the predictable fallout of the false hope. Unfortunately due to a crammed year with sterling candidates, Hanks is left out of the nomination list, quite an upsetting snub, but he plays a real person who lacks for a distinctive character except he is under an extreme situation, not showy enough is the detrimental disadvantage. Abdi is the MVP among the pirates four, not as irritable and impatient as the hackneyed short-fuse Najee (Ahmed), he is a human being with flesh and blood, he is the one captain Phillips can relate to under such circumstances, all diversities aside, basically they both work for their respective bosses and want to finish their jobs with minimal casualties. His bold final move can be interpreted as a smart judgment call, his American dream ironically fulfills in a different way, at least he can be plumb free of his ill-destined fate. <br/><br/>Nominated for 6 Oscars including BEST PICTURE (both Hanks and Greengrass are brutally snubbed here), CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is at best an unbiased recount of a man's individual struggle during a hanging-by-a-thread ride, and at worst, it is an unimaginative hostage story with jejune perpetrators wield weapons and demand unrealistic ransom, no one can beat the principled USS army, do you get the message?"
"caspian1978","5","0","0","27 January 2014"," Where is the NRA when you need them !
","Whether or not you want to attack this movie for not being a truthful depiction of what really occurred to the real Captain Philips, I can see this movie being a talking point for anyone who supports the NRA (National Rifle Association) Can't you see a Spokesperson from the NRA use this movie as an example why we need to have more handguns in the hands of ""good"" people as oppose to ""bad"" people. I do not in anyway want to support or defend the NRA on any matter, however, I can see the point of having firearms available on the boat to defend oneself against Pirates who want to kill you and take your boat. I am not an expert on the common practice and law in the world of Captain Philips, but it seemed if the crew was ""packing heat"" that day, this movie would have been a 30 minute short instead of the epic that it was. I'm sure the millions of dollars spent on the rescue mission that took up half this movie would have been saved if someone had a sick shooter next to the first aid kit for Tom Hanks to use to defend his crew. Overall, Tom Hanks gives a good performance like he has in the last 20 years. The movie is an intellectual roller coaster on the high seas. The movie starts slow but finishes strong, and the movie leaves you thinking as well as somewhat entertained. Still, the idea of having the second amendment on the boat with you against Pirates makes you kind of angry that the second part of the movie was allowed to happen. I don't' think I am alone on this....thoughts?"
"advaitkamat","8","0","0","16 January 2014"," Greengrass only gets better with each film he makes.
","Greengrass is a filmmaker who knows the importance of those thirty minutes. His style of filmmaking is perceptible. He builds his plot tenaciously, layers it thickly with emotion and dramatic tension and lets all hell break loose in the end. Scrap off the top and you'll find a textured plot underneath, neatly done and ready to be utilized for the knockout punch. 'Captain Phillips' is no different.<br/><br/>Being an ardent admirer of 'United 93', you might have already guessed how excited I was for yet another hijack-drama from Greengrass. I was positively stoked. But, you know, the problem was that the movie did not drizzle me with its magic right away. There's a long build-up involved to get the film going, give it its wheels, which details diligently how Captain Richard Phillips treats its crew. He's methodical, unerring and flinty. His crew envies and scorns him, but never doubts him. It's a well-etched character but it did not require the lengthy prologue.<br/><br/>And then, there's someone else who admires Phillips. Abduwali Muse, a young Somali pirate, winds up a crew of his own and strays into the Somali Basin to carry out a hijack. He works for a boss, who needs money, and Muse gets his hands dirty. He's determined, and even when it's a question of life or death, he stays put on his principles. He hijacks Phillips' ship after repeated attempts, and belittles Phillips' offer of thirty grand and a ship back to Somalia. I'm not a beggar, he tells Phillips, and holding the captain hostage, demands a shocking ten million. You've got to admire the courage of the young lad. He's not dangerous, he's even likable to some degree but he's like a ticking bomb that could go off any second. And go off it does.<br/><br/>For more than an hour, we see Phillips' attempts to convince the pirates to end everything peacefully, and to let everybody live in exchange for the thirty grand. The pacing is languid, but the film stays consistently engaging. Maybe the unpredictability of its guileful antagonist helps in keeping the tension palpable. Muse is diffident in his actions, he often turns to Phillips' advice when the Navy SEALS circle the ship, much to his comrades' chagrin.<br/><br/>Greengrass directs with equanimity, the air of a man who knows what he has and what he can do with what he has. He takes his time to set the tone of the film, establish his characters so well that we begin to understand them. We can predict their actions, their words, their thoughts. It's not a slip-up, that's genuinely great filmmaking. I could almost feel the dearth of oxygen when the film entered the thriller mode. Greengrass makes his characters tangible, keeps the plot rife with violent tension. And when the characters splutter dialogues, they vent some of the tension out with them. It's the kind of movie where the dialogues make a difference because they allow you a quick peek into the minds of the characters we have come to know. Shrewd.<br/><br/>But in the film's final thirty minutes, your breathing will grow increasingly ragged. Because knowing Greengrass and knowing what he can achieve with his films' denouements, I stopped trying to predict what's about to unfold. Well, the film was entirely predictable, seeing that it has been adapted from Captain Richard Phillips' autobiography, so it's not a give-away that we know how it'll end, is it? But how it gets there is something that made me stand up and applaud. One of the most unapologetically exciting action sequences I've seen in the recent cluster of films, the final showdown is nothing short of riveting. Skillfully executed, well crafted, acted and scored to perfection, the final moments live up to the kind of film 'Captain Phillips' promised it would be.<br/><br/>It's easy to find fantastic performances from each and every member of the cast in a Paul Greengrass film. And it's not a surprise that Greengrass manages to coax Hanks to give his best performance in years. I've been trying to find a word that effectively describes Hanks in Captain Phillips but every single adjective downplays his performance. I'll settle with brilliant but it's not even close, you know. Barkhad Abdi, a young newbie who plays Abdawali Muse, is equally captivating. Mr. Abdi, I'm your fan already.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are efficacious in keeping a real sense of urgency at all times, ably backed by a tightly-wound, nifty script from Billy Ray, who relies heavily on words to keep the pace as brisk as possible.<br/><br/>'Captain Phillips' is a marvelous film that definitely ranks as one of the year's finest. A bit indulgent in places and a tad slow for a thriller, but technically sound and terrifically shot by virtuoso cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, it's a vitriolic drama that smothers you with its power but, in its final moments, leaves you moved. Keep a oxygen tank handy."
"Amari-Sali","7","0","0","14 January 2014"," A face is given to the seldom news figures of Somali pirates, and the film leaves you wondering who is the real victim.
","This is another one of those films I skipped while it was in theaters since, honestly, I wasn't really looking for a film which would have had a one dimensional African, specifically Somalian, villain the same way the Russians and Chinese have been villains in action movies for decades. But, with Tom Hanks in the film and there being praise for co- star Barkhad Abdi, I gave into temptation. And honestly, while Hanks may have been the main draw, I left a bigger fan of Abdi's.<br/><br/>Characters & Story<br/><br/>The focus of the movie is Richard Phillips (played by Tom Hanks) who is an America ship captain, who is working around the horn of Africa, and meets a young Abduwali Muse (played by Barkhad Abdi) who meet in less than cordial circumstances due to Muse being a pirate trying to take over Phillips' ship. However, despite him coming off as a bad guy, Muse seemingly is a victim of circumstance. Where he lives there isn't any such thing as social mobility and the effects of globalization has taken a toll on any type of life he could have. Fishing can't really be done for the larger, and financially more powerful, nations have basically wiped that option, and being that his area is dominated, and controlled, by an unseen organization that harasses Muse's village, the only option is to be a pirate to make money and keep his people fed and safe. <br/><br/>But, when these two meet, though Muse tries to be as nice as possible. He even giving Phillips the nickname ""Irish."" However, being that Phillips knows procedure and considers himself, and his crew, smarter than Muse and his crew, you see Phillips try to play a game with them in which, quite a few times, his ego leads to him getting assaulted, among other things. But, despite Phillips actions, Muse tries his best to keep him alive so he can get the ransom money and go home, but with Phillips complicating matters, Muse ends up damn near in a life or death situation quite a few times.<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>As you may note by the story summary, and intro, I liked Abdi's depiction of the character Muse, and the reason for that is that when you watch the trailer for the film, you foresee some sad depiction of Somali pirates which you think are going to be as shallow as other foreign nation villains going against an American. But, being that this is based on a true story, of which seemingly Phillips wasn't the only one kept in mind, Muse is allowed to be a human who may seem greedy, a pirate, and etc., but as you get to know him enough to understand that he sees his options as limited and he, to Phillips' face, reminds you that his country isn't America. You are reminded there is no, pull yourself up by the bootstraps or any of those things Americans, if not the western world as a whole, take for granted. For people like him, you either fight until someone dies or do as you are told. Making it so, despite Phillips technically being the victim, I found Muse to more so be the one who I felt bad for. Even without him not necessarily shedding any tears.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>When it comes to criticism, like most films based on true stories, there is an issue with time length. Part of the reason I had an issue with the time is because after a while you can assesses Muse and his friends and you can see, while desperate, they aren't really trying to do more than get their money and go. Thus bringing the amount of threat to Phillips, as well as his crew, to a nil and making it where all there are, for the most part, are bullets shot in the air. Then, to add onto that, Hanks just doesn't command your attention in the film despite being the protagonist, and makes it so you just stop caring about him and his character.<br/><br/>Overall: TV Viewing<br/><br/>Quite honestly, though I like Abdi's performance in the film, and hope more comes his way in terms of roles, the movie as a whole was boring. Once you realize that the pirates are amateurs, Phillips has more control over the situation than them, and then they aren't willing to fully assert themselves, the film seems like a Looney Tunes film with Hanks playing a smarter version of Elmer Fudd and everyone else being Daffy Duck. Thus making this a TV viewing type film."

Why him ? You will have to wait until the end. The way he portrayed defeat, relief, shock and trauma, he made it look so genuine. And he did it so subtly. <br/><br/>Muse's character was the masterly researched aspect of this movie. One can only be in awe at the outcome the film makers were able to get out of that particular character. The claps must go to Barkhad Abdi who was rightly nominated Golden Globe.<br/><br/>The pirate crew did their job superbly too.<br/><br/>I personally would have liked to get a little more out of the other characters on the good side, both the crew of Maersk Alabama and the Navy/Seals. Probably it would have been a tad bit more dramatic ... or am I wrong ... ??<br/><br/>This is one movie that will tell every movie loving person that Paul Greengrass is a complete film maker and why the one and only "" Tom Hanks "" is .. Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>I can only wish them well at the Academy 2014.<br/><br/>A salute of 8 out of 10."

","Directed by Paul-ShakyCam-Greengrass of the Bourne films fame, ""Captain Phillips"" is a straightforward tale of brave actions of the captain and the crew of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama when hijacked by desperate Somali pirates.<br/><br/>The pace of the film is relentless and the run-time of over 2 hrs never seems long. The shaky cam is at an acceptable level and the cinematography is quite good overall. The efficiency of the US Navy SEALs is always impressive and is showcased as such here. Like with all Paul Greengrass films, the focus is more on the action and less on the backdrop or the characters. It is terse to a fault and perhaps less fulfilling in that sense, but Tom Hanks makes up for that with his acting chops as the titular character.<br/><br/>Overall entertaining fare, and definitely one of the better films of the year. 7.5/10"

","Got a chance to watch the sneak preview of Captain Phillips. It's a good movie and thumps up for Tom Hanks. Said that, its another rescue mission movie. Real life incidents and Tom Hanks make it special. Movie does keep us on the edge of seat in last 45min. Navy seal operation and snipers were pretty good. Just that we have seen it a lot on movies and it didn't feel any different. Anyway, its a real life incident and I hope they have shown on screen what really happened. And should comment about the Somali pirate casts too. They did a great job along with Ship crew. I saw 'Rush' just before this sneak preview. I would say 'Rush' was excellent, compared to 'Captain Phillips'. 7 out of 10 is a pretty good score of this movie. Must watch for all Tom Hanks fans..!"

","I am sure many will dislike me for rating this movie 1 star. I wish there is a minus; if there is, I would have given minus rating. I love Tom Hanks, I have enjoyed his movies for many years. The problem here is not the actors; they did a great job. The problem here is not the story line, I read the story line and I enjoy this kind of movie (especially when it's based on true story) but I have to say that a story is only as good as how it is shot when it comes to movie-making. I don't know how to make movies; I don't know how to handle a camera; but I don't think the person shooting this movie knows how to handle a camera, either. Movies are designed to be watched by human eyes; this movie is extremely shaky and my eyes can't seem to handle it. I stopped at minute 51 and I have no intention to continue watching this movie despite the fact that I love the story line. I don't have any intention of getting a vertigo after watching this or eye problem. People like us who do a day job sitting in front of a computer screen wish to have something enjoyable when we reach home to enjoy our evening watching a good movie. The way this movie was shot is worsening my eyes & head after long day staring at screen. I just wished the people in charge of the camera and effects did their job the way it is supposed to be.
Thank you!"
"griffolyon12","9","3","9","11 October 2013"," A Phenomenal Film
","Ripped straight from the 2009 headlines, Captain Phillips tells the story of the Maersk Alabama cargo freighter that was taken over by Somali pirates, off the coast of Somalia. The titular captain, is the real-life captain of the Maersk Alabama, Richard Phillips, portrayed in this film by Tom Hanks. Often a movie star can ruin a film that is trying to be as real as this one, but in this particular case, it's that anomaly where the movie star portrayal actually makes the film.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is shot in a very gritty, realistic way. The lighting is often underexposed and the camera-work is shaky, making it seem like you're watching an observational documentary of the real-life event, with only occasional Hollywood flourishes of subtle soundtrack to amp up tension. At first glance, you might be fooled into thinking this was a documentary, relaying the brilliance of director Paul Greengrass, making the material seem more real and not so Hollywoodified. As such, though, that is why the inclusion of a movie star, like Tom Hanks in the main role, was so important.<br/><br/>As an audience, we already have a pre-existing relationship with Tom Hanks. By having an Everyman like Tom Hanks on screen, it allows us to understand who Richard Phillips is without having to really tell us much about his personality or how he got to this point in his life. It's one of those cases where a film takes place entirely in the present, with no flashbacks or long monologues to create character, so we needed a movie star, and Mr. Hanks knocks the role out of the park. He's not so good looking it's distracting, and he is made up like a guy you could see on the street or walking around your local grocery store. That's what makes him immediately believable. Then, there's the simple fact that this role could have easily been one that a lesser actor would have chewed up all the scenery to try and realize, and you start to really appreciate the subtlety of the performance more and more. While the supporting cast of relative unknowns and seasoned character actors are believable in their roles, this is Hanks's movie. Though, newcomer Barkhad Abdi does get a few choice scenes as the leader of the pirates, Muse, even if that's the most any of the pirates get to do other than shout and point their guns.<br/><br/>While many of the characters in Captain Phillips lack much depth, in particular the pirates, the documentary-like approach to the material, and the sensational performance from Tom Hanks, make this film an intense cinematic experience. As well, with a film such as this, where it's more about the now and the horror of the situation at hand, any detours to beef up characters, would have felt forced and untrue to what the goal of this film was. This is a movie meant to give you the experience that Richard Phillips and his crew went through, and it excels in that arena. This is why Captain Phillips is a film that should be experienced by any and all looking to have a little bit of thought provoked. This is a serious endeavor that should be taken seriously.<br/><br/>I give Captain Phillips a 9 out of 10!"

","There is just too much here. Too much Shaky Camera, in Fact that's all there is just Shot after Shaky Shot that is Another in an Endless Stream of this False Realism that Directors seem to Rely on for that ""homespun"" Feel.

Who Enjoys all this Shakiness?<br/><br/>If not for that it is a Well Acted Movie but the Ending is also too much. It just goes on and on and much of the Claustrophobic Tension Wears out its Effectiveness and then some. This is an Overrated Movie that Ends Up being Mediocre at Best. There is too much shouting and Gun Pointing to the Head and more Shouting and more Gun Pointing and it really is too much.<br/><br/>Everything is Overdone and Overbaked and Drawn Out and the End Result is Exhausting more than Exhilarating and by Exit Time You Think that was OK but did it really have to do Everything to the Point of too much."
"cyhutch-1","Null","2","5","24 January 2014"," Really?
","I really appreciate Tom Hanks as an actor, so when I go to the Redbox and look for something to rent that could be a decent film, I can kind of count on anything he's in to be at least watchable and worth my time. However, this film frustrated me. Mostly because this actually happened in real life and it didn't need to happen. Then, then they add insult to injury by making a movie out of it. <br/><br/>Here's why I am scratching my head over this...<br/><br/>The shipping line, the US Navy and US government are aware there is piracy constantly happening off the coast of Africa. Yet, these large cargo ships head out there without any protection. They cannot expect the crew to be guards/mercenaries/troops, etc. Fair enough. However, why not avoid a hijacking in the first place by hiring a few trained professionals to handle a potential problem? Seems so simple to do that. All the time I am watching two motor boats with about 8 guys go after a big ship I'm thinking, ""what? can't they take care for his situation easily? Aren't prepared for this? Don't they have someone on board to take these peons out?"" <br/><br/>Apparently not. Instead, the Navy et al have to get involved, potentially jeopardizing lives, spending tax payers money, etc because those in charge did not take precautions. It made me more angry and annoyed than sympathetic. About 1/3 into the film I had to stop watching because I thought the whole notion they DIDN'T hire anyone to safeguard them was the dumbest move ever! I lost all interest at that point. <br/><br/>Note to shipping lines...hire a few key personnel to safeguard your ship so something like ""Captain Phillips"" doesn't have to happen."
"bigmarkthompson","5","2","5","15 January 2014"," Spoiled by facts
","In my opinion this movie is ruined by the halo that is the movie falsely tries to put on the Captain(Tom Hanks). Even without the controversy around the crew and experts saying that the captain was reckless and wrong, I think this movie produces very little sympathy for the Capt. <br/><br/>As a mariner, the scenes where he ignores multiple warning, ignores the crews complaints, and doesn't seem to prepare or try and avoid a likely second attack from the pirates left me with disdain for the Capt's character.<br/><br/>It is as if the film feels the need to address the facts that the whole situation was largely the captains fault; but they tries to make him a hero with every other tool in the cinematic arsenal."
"bobbobwhite","7","2","5","28 October 2013"," Ineresting, but too long
","Pretty good tale based on true events, but dramatized and fictionalized for entertainment effect. Tom was an everyman ship captain, and was more or less the way we like to see him, but his role was not as humanly personal or as special as his parts were in Castaway, or Philadelphia, for example. We did not get to see much of the Tom Hanks that is so endearing to audiences for decades, as he was more of less just a ship captain doing his job here.<br/><br/>I do not like ships so the story had to be good to interest me, and it did a pretty good job of that even as I felt the film overall was too long and tried to sustain fear and suspense beyond what was believable for full effect, and especially the long and overdone part in the lifeboat. We could only be shocked by one or more ""shoot him if he moves"" statements, but there were way too many of those to sustain a high tension and believability level. To me, it finally became tedious. Also, from the few seamen I have known,, the crew on the ship appeared much too wimpy and scared for ""real men"". However, the Navy rescue scenes were involving and well done.<br/><br/>My main questions of the story are about ship security. Tens of millions of dollars of cargo and not one gun for security on the ship? How could that be? No arms or security system at all. A few weapons and that piracy would never have happened. And, no wonder Republicans want a big defense budget, as the cost to taxpayers of providing Navy security for private business ships has to be huge, and of course, free to them. Even taxpayers who never buy any of the products on that ship have to pay for that protection. That is just not right. Those private ships should have their own security and not military security paid by the American taxpayer.<br/><br/>I am sure our gov't will get right on that."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","5","26 October 2013"," Vintage Greengrass and award-worthy Hanks
","One way to look at this movie is to view it as an intriguing chess game like what Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky used to do, calculating and anticipating each other's moves in trying to outsmart the opponent. I mean, you could, but this is all but impossible as the emotional intensity starts by building up slowly but crescendos to an almost unbearable climax that leaves you completely drained at the end. Crudely, I can divide the movie into two parts. Part 1: STALLING – cat-and-mouse game on board container-carrying vessel Maersk Alabama in which Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) tries to hide his crew from Somalis pirate leader Muse (Barkhad Abdi), hoping to stall until navy rescue arrives. Part 2: RESCUE OR OTHERWISE* – Captain Phillips as hostage of Muse and his three accomplices in one of Maersk Alabama's lifeboats (not one of those tiny inflated rubber things titular to Hitchcock's 1944 classic, but a small sea-worthy vessel in its own right) with the US Navy on its tail and SEALS air-dropped as things progressed. <br/><br/>It wouldn't serve any useful purpose for me to recount the fact based events depicted in the movie, other than to say that Greengrass did it again as in ""United 93"", creating a perfect balance between level-headed documentary and entertaining thriller. There is more here though in having a much more focused protagonist. No, two, to be fair. <br/><br/>Hank's portrayal of Captain Phillips is Oscar-worthy, never glamourized heroism, but an ordinary everyday man trying hard to fulfill his duty as captain of a sea vessel under adverse conditions. Just the last few minutes portraying the protagonist after rescue and finally collapsing into shock and fatigue is good enough to earn him another Oscar. Very impressive indeed is Abdi, Somalia native who had adopted the US as his new home and was driving a cab for a living when he answered to the cast call and won the role from a field of 800. His performance did not suffer in any away opposite a veteran heavyweight such as Hanks.<br/><br/>The support cast is equally commendable. On the US side – the crew of the hijacked vessel and the US navy personnel – character actors gave a solid performance. One the other side the three actors playing the rest of the Somalia hijackers answered to the cast call together with Abdi as a foursome. That they all know each other perhaps contribute to their smooth rapport. These are not stereotyped baddies but real people each with a distinct personality. That is what anchored Greengrass's goal as he intimated in a ""Time Out"" interview: ""We did not want to sketches of people. We wanted real people up there on the screen"". In the same interview, he sums up his mission: ""This is a story of a man trying to survive against incredible odds.also about globalization. Both (protagonists) are at the mercy of powers much greater than them, and are forced into this situation"".<br/><br/>* At a critical moment in the lifeboat, Captain Phillips told Muse in no uncertain terms SEALS's intention, ""It's all over. They would rather sink this boat than let you take me into Somalian territory""."
"purelightning5","9","2","5","25 October 2013"," This is the way the story of Richard Phillips should be experienced!
","This movie shows us the true story of Richard Phillips who was Captain of an American cargo ship, Phillips experienced being hijacked by Somali pirates back in 2009. This is a great story to build a film on and that is exactly what Billy Ray does. I have seen this movie three times now and I must say it is a masterpiece, the storytelling and acting is superb! Captain Philips is played by Tom Hanks who has once again surprised me with his amazing acting; this definitely is one of his best films. He portrays the role so well, it all feels real. I was literally on the edge of my seat in a cinema, it's that intense. Paul Greengrass has once again delivered a spectacular film.<br/><br/>One of the things I loved most about this movie is how it shows us both sides of the story to a degree where you can understand why the Somali pirates hijacked the ship but still you are rooting for Captain Phillips and his crew to win. The head of the Somali pirates Abduwali muse (Barkhad Adbi) plays a very convincing pirate with his aim to hijack a ship so he can make 'millions', he chooses Captain Phillips ship because the route his ship is taking is away from the other cargo ships unfortunately. Captain Phillips already believes that the route they are taking through the Somali basin is dangerous so he takes extra precautions which are unfortunately not enough.<br/><br/>Once again I must praise Tom Hanks for his acting, he acts like his life depends on it. He digs deep into a character showing great emotion. I can see this as being an Oscar winning performance. Now Barkhad Adbi who plays the role of Muse, I wasn't sure on him at first but he blew me away, he played the role amazing with his snarky name for Captain Phillips 'Irish'. This film can be heart-wrenching to watch at times, it's hard to watch Captain Phillips struggle through the decisions and obstacles that he faces. This film is not an action flick where Tom Hanks fights all the pirates and becomes the hero, he agrees to the terms of the pirates but makes it as hard as he can for the pirates without making it obvious. He is the hero in this movie, he does save his crew but not in the way you would expect. Phillips makes it so hard for Muse that soon he is only limited to a few options, now Muse is not dumb, he's actually quite intelligent but so is Phillips which makes this film entertaining to watch as they battle it out through wits.<br/><br/>The story of Richard Phillips is very interesting and Phillips actions were truly amazing and this film shows that in the best way possible, I have no complaints about it. If you're not interested in story see this movie anyway because of Tom Hanks, he steals the show with his great acting of the heroic man who is Captain Phillips. Paul Greengrass delivers an emotionally, tense and story driven movie that deserves to be rewarded with the highest honours. It sets the bar high for story riveting film making."

","Without any doubt, this could be an award movie. The subject : Pirates of Somalia, a hot topic and I have to say  very good put in scene. I believe Hollywood is spoiling us. I am European and the US movies always have that kind of hero theme ( sorry because of this feeling ). But lately we have very honest movies without that hero theme. That is good news for the cine critics. So, a hot news topic handled with care. Mr Greengrass keeps the tense in the complete movie, you won't turn away your head. Even the origin of the problem is touched when a scene recalls the fishing problem in Africa caused by the richest industrial fishing ""countries"". Even that issue was handled. Mr Hanks and Abdi are doing a great acting job, really outstanding ! Hanks even doesn't have to have lines to say, he is just a good actor you feel the situation. To the end of the movie he is marvelous, just outstanding. It is a thriller, but not just that; at the end you get that feeling, that feeling even you get pity about the situation of these Somalian people, these pirates, and we have to feel pity. In one way, we have caused the their situation they are in. You understand the situation the pirated ended up, the ""why"". You understand the Hank's situation and to the end he is fantastic. Just a great movie. Of course, I couldn't imagine a Hanks doing the job of Mr Costa, the captain of the cruise ship sank near Italy. This must be one of the best roles of the Hanks''s career."

","Not everyone has the opportunity to have a proper and rightful upbringing. Some get thrust into a world of crime too support themselves. Maybe they don't wont to do it, but they choose to. The Piracy Reporting Center of the International Maritime Bureau reported that in 2009 pirates operating across the Gulf of Aden and along the coast of Somalia, had attacked two hundred and fourteen vessels, resulting in forty-seven hijackings. In the mornings of an early week in April, a group of Somalians pick out their crew that will help them commandeer a cargo ship.<br/><br/>Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is transporting 17,000 metric tons of cargo on the Maersk Alabama, on course too Mombasa, Kenya with a crew of twenty. On April 8 the Maersk Alabama is boarded by four pirates, their Captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi). After failing to hijack the ship, Muse and his henchmen decide to take Captain Phillips hostage in the ships life raft for the next four days.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks once again delivers another role that is extremely noteworthy. I feel like I love Hanks in almost anything, and while watching Captain Phillips you know right off the back that Hanks will fully fulfill your expectations, but its not until some of the final scenes when the tension is so closely knitted its almost unbearable, and you're on the edge of your seat, Tom Hanks flourishes with such simplicity and you understand why Hanks is one of the top leading actors. Such a brilliant performance, he's sure to get nominated once again.<br/><br/>Barkhad Abdi is sure too be one of Hollywood's next big up and coming actors. Abdi is truly captivating, giving our leading villain a heart, and full back story without having to tell you anything. Its such an incredible performance, Abdi will most likely get nominated in the Supporting Actor category.<br/><br/>This is also Paul Greengrass's best film. Greengrass builds tension on screen so simply, without having to over work the camera, like he did previously with the Bourne sequels. Greengrass is sure to get nominated as well.<br/><br/>From the trailer I knew that I would like Captain Phillips and as the ending credits rolled, I knew that I had just seen one of the best films of the year. It literally has everything that a big Hollywood Blockbuster would have, but done very well and is a remarkable true story. Truly incredible. I can't wait to see the film again.

When he is helpless and afraid, we feel it. When blood splatters on him we want to wipe our face and when he is in shock and relieved we have confused emotions too. <br/><br/>Barry does a great job of capturing the seas and the mighty ships.

","Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is the captain of the cargo ship the Maersk Alabama. In early 2009, the Maersk Alabama is scheduled to sail around the cape of Africa. Phillips is well-aware of the threat of kidnapping by pirates. He is made more aware of this threat when he gets an e-mail saying that the Maersk Alabama is headed toward a highly dangerous kidnapping area. Before the Maersk Alabama ever sets sail, Somaili pirates Muse (Barkhad Abdi) Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) Najee (Faisal Ahmad) and Elmi (Mahat Ali) are planning the kidnapping with the aid of Somali warlord. Hufan (Issak Farah Samatar)<br/><br/>The Somalis try to board the Maersk Alabama once, and are repelled by Phillips and the crew, but on the second attempt, they are successful and board the ship. Muse emerges as the leader of the pirates, and quickly he finds Captain Phillips and begins to search for the rest of the crew of 20. The crew for their part, does everything it can to sabotage the pirates' efforts. They turn off the power on the ship, they break glass on the floor of the ship so that one of the barefooted pirates cuts his foot, and two or three of the Maersk crew even capture Muse, and they work out a trade for Captain Phillips for Muse, but the trade goes wrong, and the pirates escape with Captain Phillips, on-board a lifeboat. Now, it's up to the Navy and a Navy Seal Team to rescue Phillips. Do they do it?<br/><br/>One of the reasons I like this movie is because it is an intelligent story and not just a shoot-em-up action movie. The captain and crew of the Maersk Alabama do not have guns , or weapons of any kind so they have to use their wits and stall until the Navy sends a ship to pressure the pirates. This is an intelligent script, because it makes the Captain sympathetic, even when he is under extreme pressure of injury or death, Captain Phillips actually tends to the injuries of the pirates that are trying to injure him. The film points out that the Alabama is delivering food and supplies to Africans. Phillips even gives the pirates a way out of the crisis. This is an intelligent movie because it makes the pirates sympathetic. Kidnapping should never be condoned, but one can realize that abject poverty can lead to irrational behavior. These pirates have nothing to lose, and so they are willing to lose everything. Phillips and Muse gain a grudging respect for each other, because even while they are working at cross-purposes, they both realize that no one can get hurt or they both lose. <br/><br/>The direction also helps this movie set a tone. The atmosphere in this movie can only be called claustrophobic, you can feel the the closeness in the ship, the tightness of space, the overall cramped feeling. This is achieved by filming on an actual ship and not a soundstage. Director Paul Greenngrass is to be applauded for deciding to film this on a ship, this adds to the suspense. Greengrass knows his way around an intelligent action movie, he's directed both the Bourne Supremacy and the Bourne Ultimatum.<br/><br/>The acting is superb as well, many watching this film will say that this is a pedestrian effort by Tom Hanks, but those who say that miss one of the strengths of Hanks' career, making the common man do extraordinary things. In movies like Catch Me If You Can, The Green Mile, Larry Crowne, even Toy Story, he plays seemingly ordinary men who bring people together with his leadership. And in the last 10 minutes of Captain Phillips he gives such a virtuoso performance, so emotionally powerful that it is spellbinding. He does try to affect a New England accent in this movie, it's not very good, but that's a minor glitch in a great performance. Another standout performance was given by Barkhad Abdi, who played Muse, he was menacing, he had to be, and he conveyed that very well. He also played the role with, charm, guile, humor and intelligence. He humanized a reprehensible character, Muse wasn't taken in by most of what Phillips told him, and that made the movie even more interesting to watch.<br/><br/>This movie has everything, a great story, supplemented by superb acting and excellent directing; all make for a taught thriller that is a must-see.<br/><br/>For more commanding reviews, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"
"tavm","9","2","5","17 October 2013"," Captain Phillips was a good depiction of a recent real-life event that didn't take sides
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. This is the one in which Tom Hanks portrays Captain Rich Phillips, who was kidnapped by Somali pirates in 2009. The narrative was quite absorbing and while my friend did clap a few times when some rescues of the main character was attempted, he did not feel the need to boo the pirates as if they were irredeemable bad guys. Neither did the rest of the audience so on that note, the film did a good job in presenting the areas of gray in the characterizations. I, myself, was simply intent in paying attention to how the whole thing was presented and managed to feel quite relieved when the end came though I wasn't too emotional when that happened though I did feel some, no doubt about that. Anyway, that's a high recommendation for Captain Phillips."
"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","9","2","5","17 October 2013"," All aboard!
","Captain Phillips is the latest nail-biter of a film by director Paul Greengrass, who continues his frenetic style of filmmaking that he showed off in the final two Bourne films and United 93. Like United 93, Greengrass is putting us on board with another real life hostage situation. This time, we are crewmates on a freight ship that's being attacked by Somali pirates.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, everybody's favorite everyman, is our captain for this voyage and; as usual, he's on top of his game. I'd say this is one of Hanks' finest performances in years, possibly ever. Gasp! It's so true though. Hanks does a great job of portraying a person that has the responsibility of dozens of lives on his hands.<br/><br/>He stands up to the pirates with a mixture of fear and courage, savvy and naïveté. Hanks perfectly balances these aspects of Phillips, exhibiting the strength to stand up to the pirates and the ability to gain their trust.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of not portraying the Somali pirates as blood thirsty savages hungry for murder. Instead, they're just plain thirsty for water and hungry for food and nourishment. Their faces are gaunt and skeletal. Their clothes hang loose from their bony bodies. They resemble the ghosts of a once healthy person or grown up versions of the children we've all seen in the ""starving kid"" commercials. By humanizing the Somali pirates, we're able to sympathize with their plight and understand why people might be forced to do such a thing.<br/><br/>The pirates are played by first time actors and real Somali people who actually fled from Somalia trying to avoid the very hardships that are portrayed in the film. Casting the Somali actors added another layer of realism. The captain of the Somali pirates is played by Barkhad Abdi, who plays Muse. Abdi holds his own as he goes toe-to-toe with one of the most legendary actors on the planet. Muse seems dangerous, but you can't help but feel bad for him. You can see the desperation and fear in his eyes, but there is also a childlike innocence.<br/><br/>One of the major themes of Captain Phillips is the clash of culture between the Somali pirates and the Americans. There's no better example of the haves and the have nots than seeing the Somali pirates approaching the massive ship in a tiny wooden boat. When they finally break into the bridge and confront Captain Phillips and his crew, they might as well be from another planet.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass has a very distinct style that might not be for everybody. His use of shaky-cam, which has often been imitated and overused in the industry, works very well in Captain Phillips. It gives the film a more natural feel and works perfectly with the natural ebb and flow of the ocean.<br/><br/>Muse and the other Somali pirates are clearly the villains of the film, but the true villain is circumstance. The cruel reality that people have to do such things not because they are evil people, but because there is truly no other way."
"busdog","10","2","5","17 October 2013"," Perfection - don't expect any Oscars tho--it is too good for that
","A lesson in filmmaking excellence. When so many movies feel it necessary to lecture us about politics and/or the environment (Avatar), or try to Be Significant and Important (too many to mention, but can start with The Fifth Estate), what a blast of fresh air is Captain Phillips. What makes this film special is that everyone involved is primarily interested in telling a great, dramatic story and not with lecturing us on their own particular viewpoints. That said, there is plenty of rich subtext here about wealth, poverty, work, and other matters--this is not just empty action a la Michael Bay or even Blackhawk Down. <br/><br/>Director Greengrass has a gift for making us feel with his characters by dramatic action and gesture and not via empty dialogue. The 'villains' here are 3 dimensional--they have motives, fears and are not stupid. It is really nice to see black actors not being pandered to but rather represented as actual human beings with complex minds and emotions.<br/><br/>The true star of the movie is Tom Hanks, who I don't particularly like or dislike. But here, his acting is on another level. I do not know how he is able to convey multiple emotions with a single glance--fear, scheming and pity all at once. If you are not either in tears or on the border of tears at the end, then you may not be human.<br/><br/>Taste is taste and cannot be explained, but some critics find themselves in a quandary here. This movie does not exalt the military--it only presents the facts (perhaps dramatized of course). But we are so used to seeing the military demonized that many critics don't know how to react. The same is true of the Somali's here--again, we're used to seeing Africans being pandered to, to non-Africans vilified and blamed for all matter of things (slavery, imperialism, the high crime rate, you name it). Here, the Somali's are presented as they are--poverty stricken, desperate, and struggling. When we see their small boat up against a huge shipping freighter, this speaks volumes without saying a word. Of course what they do is wrong, but it is hard not to understand why they do it. <br/><br/>All that said, this movie works just as plain old action/drama. It belongs up there with films like Deliverance, Goodfellas, the Godfather- -movies with action, bite and substance. And Hanks delivers a performance that is really remarkable.<br/><br/>I suspect this movie will be ignored come Oscar time. Because while it will certainly be the best movie of the past 5 or next 5 years, it does not follow any particular political belief nor espouse anything at all. And for Hollywood, you'd better engage in Groupthink if you want an Oscar."
"jadepietro","10","2","5","16 October 2013"," Victory at Sea
","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>The talented director, Paul Greengrass, has successfully tackled the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and his 2009 ordeal in the new docudrama, Captain Phillips. The film tells the harrowing story of Somali pirates, armed with automatic weapons, boarding and hijacking an unarmed American cargo ship and holding its crew at ransom.<br/><br/>The director's trademark pseudo-real, in-your-face photography is front and center with his jittery hand-held camera-work and multiple close-ups used to build the tension of a hostage situation, a technique that he used so famously in United 93 and two of the Bourne installments. Using a cinéma vérité style of filmmaking, there is a quasi-documentary approach to the story which works so effectively in this film. <br/><br/>The script by Billy Ray tries to present both of of the hijacking. He shrewdly begins his narrative with some background scenes of Phillips' typical ordinary day with his wife (an underused Catherine Keener) in his suburban community and contrasts that with the squalor and poor living conditions of a Somali village, where the desperate men are forced into making a criminal choice, all this prior to the violent act that will bring both parties together. <br/><br/>Desperation is the running theme in Captain Phillips. Men with no hope and no options, forced into illegal acts of brutality. An innocent man placed into a life-and-death waiting game. The results between these two dissimilar types are catastrophic as we watch the battle of captor and captives unfold.<br/><br/>Casting is foremost if we are to believe in this situation, and Greengrass has done a exemplary job by having Tom Hanks in the title role. This is one of Hanks' best performances ever. He plays this Everyman with an earnestness and directness, trying to outwit his kidnappers one moment and sensitively understanding their plight, although the character, as written, seems a bit too heroic and courageous at times. The actor underplays the fear and carefully sidesteps the selflessness of Phillips, making him less virtuous and more human. Hanks' definitive final scene packs the emotional wallop needed to register to the audience that this is a common man placed in unusual peril, not a superhero. The lingering aftermath of this traumatic nightmare and the film's parting image of Hanks is highly emotional and gut-wrenching, distilling all of his bottled-up anguish and misery into one memorable scene.<br/><br/>As Muse, the Somali leader of the kidnappers, Barkhad Abdi (in his first acting role), brings the perfect degree of menace and tragedy to his character. His physical leanness and intense stare only adds to the suspense and the overall horror of this terroristic act. Playing the hijackers are Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysai Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali, all of which bring major support to their characters and their volatile relationships.<br/><br/>Unlike most films today, Captain Phillips is more substance than style, sans gimmicks and intrusive visual sleight of hand. The film is an old fashion drama (and I mean that in the best sense), well-crafted and sensitively told, with strong narrative drive, superb direction, and a commanding performance by Hanks as Captain Phillips. This is a great film. GRADE: A-<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"abaird625","8","2","5","16 October 2013"," A must see movie!
","This movie surprisingly kept me at the edge of my seat. When I saw the trailer I thought that there was going to be non-stop violence throughout. I was wrong. However, parents that are reading, it is very violent despite its PG-13 rating. It is rather disturbing and bloody. You have to remember though that it is about pirates who try to take over a ship. This movie was astonishing though. Quite honestly, I believe that it is Tom Hanks's best performance yet. The pirate leader was great too. That was surprising since his current job other than the movie is a cab driver in Chicago. He had won the audition. I would not recommend this movie for someone under the age of 14. It is a very mature concept for kids. The end was very disturbing and little kids would not sleep for a while. It is definitely worth seeing and I will definitely be buying it when it comes out."
"jaythejza","9","2","5","15 October 2013"," I hung onto every second of this tense thriller. Hanks was remarkable in this role.
","I went to see this movie as an exclusive Cineworld Unlimited IMAX preview screening, which was very exciting as I had been looking forward to viewing this movie after seeing the trailers earlier in the month. The movie had me gripped from start to finish; the atmosphere was crafted very well, making the viewer experience the tension and strain on a person during the ordeal both Captain Phillips and his crew endured.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is based on the book ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" written by Captain Phillips himself. The movie accounts the hijacking by Somali pirates, of the Maersk Alabama ship back in 2009. The movie highlights the relationship between Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) and the pirate leader Muse (Barkhad Abdi) during the hostile takeover of the ship, up to its thrilling conclusion.<br/><br/>I thought this was a wonderfully paced movie, firstly setting the stage for the movie, from both Captain Phillips's perspective, as well as that of the Somali pirates. While most clearly won't agree with them or want to sympathise, the movie does show you the reality of these countries. Whereas the individual may not want to commit these actions, they feel they have no other option in life and are doing what they have been demanded to do by higher powers. The only niggle I would say, is to give it a more realistic feel, some of the filming was hand held, which when watching it at an IMAX cinema, can make you feel a little queasy, but I get why they chose to film this way, it all adds to the feeling your with the characters every step of the way, feeling almost everything they do.<br/><br/>If anything, this movie is worth seeing for Hanks performance, which I'm sure will earn him another Oscar nomination, for his performance towards the end of the movie. The scenes following his rescue from the lifeboat were very intense; I did feel overcome with the emotion of Captain Phillips, during the medical checkups at the end. I couldn't help but feel so sorry & could not begin to comprehend what he was thinking at that time, completely taken over by the shock of what had happened. This as well as some of the clever things Captain Phillips did to try & save his crew and ship, from the small communications via radio to give the crew a heads up, to the info he gave to the rescue team to help them try to save him.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that you want to say is such a great film, but you have to stay grounded, as this was based on a true story, one that was a horrible event & nobody should ever have to experience that kind of trauma in their life. It's a very gritty, tense thriller, one of the better ones I've seen in a while."
"macho_mz","9","2","5","14 October 2013"," Very compelling!
","I wasn't sure if I would like this movie, (frankly, I was afraid of another Castaway), but I was pleasantly surprised! The movie kept a good pace- it kept you engaged without straying from the original story. Some people complained that it was too long, but I think they did well balancing a good tempo while putting you in Capt Phillips' shoes in a situation that lasted for days. The part I liked best was the very end. They did an excellent job of showing the emotional roller coaster an average person would be on, first thinking he was about to die, then seeing a pretty horrific scene, and finally the shock that sets in after the adrenaline starts to wear off. A great performance by Hanks!"
"msims1","10","4","14","3 October 2013"," 2009 Event Comes Alive on Big Screen
","My husband wanted to see this film more than I. The actual event in 2009, as all pirate/hostage events in the news, angered and frustrated me. Why would I want to see the Somali pirates capture an American cargo ship, threaten its crew, and psychologically damage them for life? AGAIN! But I went, and I'm glad I did. The movie starts slow, wraps you in warm, fuzzy family moments, and sets up the relationship of captain to his crew & Somalis' motivation for pirating vessels. The action, when it starts & it starts quickly, made my heart race. Overall, it made me think about why people do the things they do when they are put in situations that they choose or are chosen for them. I didn't want to feel anything for the pirates, but I felt some sympathy for them. I felt admiration, respect, and pride in the captain and crew of the cargo ship, and our Navy, which ultimately helped rescue them. I felt great sadness for Captain Phillips and for his ordeal. Had I not known the outcome, I don't think my heart could have handled the stress and anxiety throughout the movie. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is an excellent film, with fine actors and a tightly written story. It is based on a real event, and feels more like a documentary than a dramatization."
"FilmMuscle","7","4","15","13 October 2013"," Captain Phillips Drowns in its Pace
","Paul Greengrass is the creator of one of the most exhilarating and outright brilliant action trilogies out there (The Bourne Trilogy), and now, he has taken the helm behind a production, centering on a shocking true story in which an American cargo ship was captured by Somali pirates in 2009. I'll reveal nothing more because the whole thrill is not having any knowledge of what lies ahead. Now, I'll be real straightforward this time around, and it really pains me to say this, but I just was really disappointed with the film altogether. Yes, I'll give the film its props for the splendid technical aspect of it all, and I guess I'll delve into that area first before I proceed with a more negative tone. <br/><br/>As usual, Greengrass's filmmaking techniques are in a league of their own as he prefers to cut the theatrical and cinematic appearance to a minimum and immerse us in a perilous setting by engaging in fast-paced, fairly shaky camera-work. Some might complain about this method, but I find it excellently unique and applaud him on that note because it essentially is what keeps the film so tense. Vividly displaying shots of various sceneries and movements, coupled with intense music, strongly contribute to the picture's finest moments. In addition, you have the quick-cut, frenetic editing- again, at the top of its game. Greengrass has basically perfected all of these elements already in his past projects, so it's no surprise that Captain Phillips fully delivers in that department this time around as well. The production, overall, is a very wild one since the director famously casts real individuals (in whatever job positions he desires to implement into the story). You'll see actual navy officers and army nurses throughout the story, and unlike previous movies with such gimmicks, these people feel utterly convincing in their roles. <br/><br/>Then, there's Tom Hanks whom everyone knows and loves. He's definitely one of the greatest actors of our time, and his incredibly impressive resume unquestionably backs that claim up. Tom Hanks takes on the role of the captain (Captain Phillips!), hoping to lead this cargo ship to its destination until it unfortunately encounters terribly aggressive conflict. In the last ten minute alone, there's no doubt in my mind when I say that he absolutely delivers one of the best male performances of the year, and I'm excited to see him receive a lot of credit once everything is said and done this year. On top of that, we have the Somali pirates with their own captain, Muse(played by Barkhad Abdi), who also provides us with an exceptional performance, which I'm definitely not going to forget once I start considering the best supporting actor of this year. There's that abundance of menace and unpredictability in his eyes the entire time, but at the same time, we feel some form of pity and sadness towards him due to these circumstances and background that force him into this predicament and pit him against the best of the best. <br/><br/>Judging from the trailers, you feel this unimaginable detest towards the villains already, right? But seeing the film- for those who consider philosophical theories like Cultural Relativism- you suddenly and unexpectedly find yourself slightly sympathizing with some of these generally despicable and horrendous human beings (if you can call them that), but then again, you'll always be rooting for Tom Hanks' character and all those aboard the MV Maersk Alabama. The villains' objectives and determined actions, however, bring up a decently relevant point: if people have the opportunity, they'll always want more and more money in the end- that greed that unfortunately has consumed most of mankind. With that being said, all the actors involved for that matter, no matter how small their screen time, succeed in building the intensity and believability of the disastrous situation. The soundtrack, itself, is another excellent attachment, fueling the pumping suspense with that Bourne-like flavor. Whenever you want one of your scenes to completely pack a large punch, the easiest way to do so is include thunderous and beating music, which is what ultimately compliments the film's shining sequences. <br/><br/>Aside from that though , there are certain flaws of Captain Phillips that really detracted from the experience and left a bad taste in my mouth- actually a taste that truly saddened me in that I wished I would've enjoyed the film so much more like many apparently did. All in all, the feature doubtlessly suffers from pacing issues. Honestly, I can't understand how such a great amount of people found films like Gravity and Captain Phillips tense. Yes, there were particular segments that felt remarkably tense, but contrary to popular opinion, the film did not keep me on the edge of my seat the entire time, but I guess I must have ADD problems, right? Because I found myself zoning out plenty of times, and that's clearly not good in the slightest. The film didn't capture my attention the way some of my favorites this fall season have: Rush and Don Jon, specifically. I know, I know. Some will blast me for preferring those two over Captain Phillips, but I stand by my statement; the film feels dragged out, and it's simple as that- the latter half especially. And in it being stretched out is the reason why I felt it wasn't nearly as tense as many considered it to be (my bad). Some films (over 2-3 hours) pass by like no tomorrow, but this one's length certainly seemed obvious. There were some minor issues I had with the film such as the presence of some scenes being a little exaggerated in their dramatic delivery (an overly, exhausting amount of screaming and yelling) for the fullest Hollywood effect, but it's the undeniably noticeable pacing that remains the greatest trouble for the film and what sadly restrains Captain Phillips from the potential heights it could've reached when I announce my own picks and movie awards."

","While the film is a bit slow to start, once the pace begins to pick up it grips the viewer relentlessly. Some of my favorite parts of the film are also some of the most off-putting for me. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that the film is inherently a pageant of American supremacy. It may be based on a true story, but it was clearly crafted to appeal to the crowds of blindly prideful Americans that can often be heard chanting, ""U.S.A.! U.S.A.!"" at sporting events. The film briefly touches on the lives of the ensnared pirates—who have to choose between becoming pirates in order to pay warlords or be killed—but it never elaborates on the subject. The slight bit of empathy created toward the pirates is engulfed in the awe of a U.S. Naval warship, unmanned aerial drones, and a squad of Navy SEALs jumping from a military aircraft. This muted attempt to provide a balanced perspective ultimately seemed irrelevant, which was my only major qualm with the film. Still, I don't think that the one-sided portrayal of the story should dissuade anyone from seeing it. Tom Hanks' continuously powerful performance is reason enough for me to recommend this movie to frequent moviegoers. Those who only catch a flick in theaters every couple months may want to make this one a rental."

","This is the best movie I have seen in my life! A must watch...an absolutely riveting performance by Tom Hanks. In fact, this is the performance of his entire career. It is by far his most raw performance ever. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and my heart never stopped racing at 100 beats a minute. The tension was non-stop, and I was engrossed from the very opening. The ending was so raw, human, gritty and emotionally charged, the impact it had on me was equivalent to having the wind knocked out of you. I was torn between overwhelming relief, tears, chills, awe, heartbreak, with a massive knot in my stomach, and so stunned I couldn't even move in my chair...I sat literally frozen in it, with emotions running the gamut, but I was too immobilized by what I had witnessed to do anything but sit there and relive the final stellar moments I had just witnessed. I was ripped to the core. Tom's roles in Philadelphia and Cast Away were absolutely outstanding, but he surpassed them by massive leaps and bound with this role. This is a movie I will NEVER forget, and it likely won't be forgotten by others for a very long time...if ever. From director Paul Greengrass, I would expect no less than this masterpiece. The supporting cast, while being people I've never heard of, were outstanding as well, especially Barkhad Abdi...while being the lead pirate and a hostage taker, he showed moments of compassion, concern and a liking for Tom, but despite that, I felt no empathy for him. His performance was top-notch. He seamlessly shifted between human compassion and being downright callous. It was an honor to watch his performance. I will be sure to keep an eye out for him in future films as he nailed this and was brilliant. Out of the 3 hostage takers, Abdi stole the show hands down. My only regret? Seeing it 5 years after it was released. Ignore the bad reviews...this film is nothing shy of spectacular. Anyone who gives this a bad review doesn't recognize this for the magnificent work it is."

"doranbriscoe","5","1","2","23 November 2016"," More Shallow Than Expected
","Let me preface this by saying that I am normally a fan of biopics, and even more a fan of Tom Hanks, so this movie was intriguing, especially because of the generally good reviews it has gotten. <br/><br/>However, I found this film to be rather flat, to be put quite simply. The dialogue at times felt mechanical, and as the story went on I realized that I didn't feel any substantial connection to the characters, as little effort is given to build any- including Captain Phillips, whose backstory was presented altogether poorly. Instead, the film jumped fairly quickly into the action, which would be fine, except that with the length of the movie, it drags on towards the end without giving the viewer any real reason to keep his or her interest. At the conclusion, I felt, meh. Not much of anything, just that it was over. <br/><br/>As I usually do, afterwards I read into the backstory of the film, to find some reasoning as to explain why I thought it could have been better developed. I learned that not only is the true Captain Phillips misrepresented in the movie as a hero, but that there is a much more interesting dynamic when it comes to the backstory of the Somalian pirates. In the movie we are only given a few confusing scenes (without subtitles, so fairly vague) where the pirates leave their village to be picked for the expedition, and throughout the story they are not really made out to be endearing, nor unlikable either. The viewer is left unsure what to think about their fate.<br/><br/>In real life, the plight of Somalians is that of foreign ships illegally taking advantage of their shipping lanes and fish, which dissipated their fish populations. As they have relied on fishing as nearly their only means for living, this led many to self-regulate the waters as their seemingly only other option, escalating into piracy. Whether this is morally justifiable or not, I can't say, but I dislike that this film fed the audience a definitive answer without even providing the full context. If the movie had developed this aspect more fully, I feel that it would have made for a much more compelling tale, as it would have done better to connect the audience to the Somalians rather than acting as just another Hollywood film with the undertone that American lives are more important than all others. <br/><br/>I would also have preferred a better developed Captain Phillips character. Obviously after reading articles, I would have liked to have him portrayed truer to his questionable real-life self, but it's the media business so I can settle for their idealized version; but only if they develop a reason to like him, which I still wasn't given. I just felt myself waiting for the movie to give me a reason to cheer for him, but like the entire role of characters, was given an altogether two dimensional character instead. <br/><br/>The story in its full context is incredibly interesting, but the movie decided to tell the basic press clippings version, and for that I am left disappointed."
"shaunmutantdog","6","1","2","29 January 2016"," True Story or Not, it's a Hollywood Movie.
","While it would be difficult to give a movie based on the incredible bravery of a real life individual a completely bad review, it is only fair to consider this on its own merits as a movie. In which respect, it's perhaps only slightly above average. <br/><br/>I don't know how accurate a portrayal of the events is given here. Of course, the fear and tension of being in such a situation can never be fully conveyed through a medium in which peril and danger are commonplace. We all know that the titular character returned home, the prolific news coverage has ensured that we are fully aware of this event and rightfully so. From a filmatic perspective this leads to a movie where we the audience know the ending and this in itself takes even further away the sense of uncertainty and fear that must surely have been overwhelming in the real events. <br/><br/>Now most film-goers should be fully aware of the Hollywood-isation of these kinds of movies. It's easy to spot in places, perhaps less so in others. Tom Hanks role as lead seems more like a blend of high profile star and, given his status as an actor, mark of respect. This leads to a case where the Captain Phillips in this movie seems more like a Tom Hanks character than a representation of a real person. Very little is shown of him prior to the main event giving only minimal indication of the person he is, while this may be a case of respecting privacy, it further leads to the feeling that this is a Tom Hanks drama rather than a portrayal of a real event. <br/><br/>Having seen the trailer several times prior to release, I was under the impression that we may be given at least a reasonable amount of depth to the Pirates themselves. The sympathetic villains who themselves were victims of a bad circumstance driven to acts of atrocity by the trappings of a criminal empire of which they were little more than pawns. While this may have been hinted at, it was given little more than a minor recognition.<br/><br/>So what we have is a story (true, fictional or somewhere in between) of a good, upstanding, hard-working American as he survives the ordeal of capture by a group of greedy, immoral, ruthless Somalians, ultimately saved by the decisive actions of the defenders of the free world. However much truth there is to this story, it is also the perfect plot for any Hollywood movie, especially the sort with Tom Hanks as the lead. <br/><br/>In no way do I wish to devalue the undoubtedly horrific experience of the real-life Captain Phillips, nor do I wish to encourage forgiveness for those that imposed such suffering upon him. But we all know Hollywood takes liberties and we all know that this is a movie expressly made to entertain and earn money. My criticisms lie fully with that in mind. It's certainly not a bad film, Tom Hanks is, as always, on top form. Forgetting the previously known resolution, it is still tense and exciting. Even at over two hours long, it is a well- paced movie, never drawn out and never feeling over long. By all criteria I can think to offer fair judgment, it's an above average movie. Nevertheless while the real story is compelling enough to warrant viewing, this offers little more than another opportunity for America to demonstrate its greatness to the viewing masses."

","Interesting, gripping drama. The true story of a US merchant vessel being hijacked by Somali pirates, how the situation unfolds and is dealt with.<br/><br/>Meticulous plot build up, including showing some of Captain Phillips' home life plus the running of the ship. Even once the action starts, no detail is spared. <br/><br/>This has a drawback in that the plot sometimes seems pedestrian, especially after an action scene. Is very much worth it in the end, as it heightens the tension and fills you in on where everyone is, mentally.<br/><br/>Incredibly gripping, especially towards the end. You don't know how things are going to pan out, and several conclusions are possible.<br/><br/>Superb performance by Tom Hanks (but that's a given). Good support from Barkhad Abdi, as the leader of the pirates."

","I keep wanting to rate Captain Phillips as 8, but keep coming back to 7. It is a solid film, with a few minor items holding it down. I remember this event, but didn't follow the details of how the capture went down, how the escape took place, and how it all played out in the end. Knowing that Phillips lives to write this story takes a little drama out, but not too much.<br/><br/>Because the acting is inspiring. Tom Hanks is terrific, especially in the 2nd half of the film where you see him disintegrate before your eyes as his situation falls apart. You really feel his hope fade as drug- crazed pirates start to realize the same disintegration is happening to their hopes. The clash of desperation from both sides is what makes this a superior thriller, again, especially in the 2nd half.<br/><br/>The actor playing Muse was terrific, as was his band of pirates. Hard to believe he was like a taxi driver taken off the streets to play this character - he was terrific. The cinematography was outstanding, with breathtaking vistas of Somalian beaches, wide open oceans, and a huge tanker. The Director does a great job of getting the story accurate, and keeping it taut, though, the final chase scenes took a little longer than you'd like. Again, if this was done for accuracy and completeness, it's understandable. <br/><br/>All told, this one is worth your while. The last five minutes will have you climbing the walls, guaranteed. Climb aboard! Enjoy."
"Desertman84","9","1","2","23 May 2014"," Tom Hanks Delivers A Great Performance As Captain Phillips
","Captain Phillips is based on the true story of the hijack of the Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates.This incident led to merchant mariner,Captain Richard Phillips,being taken hostage in the Indian Ocean by Abduwali Muse and his crew.It stars Tom Hanks as Phillips together with Abduwali Muse,Catherine Keener,Faysal Ahmed,Michael Chernus and David Warshofsky. The account was taken from the book,A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea,written by by Phillips himself together with Stephan Talty.Paul Greengrass was the director at the helm in it. <br/><br/>The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Phillips and the Somali pirate captain, Muse during the hostage incident.Both are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship.In the ensuing standoff as well as that of the US Navy and the Somali pirates,all find themselves at the mercy of each other.It ends when the three SEAL marksmen finally get three clear shots and simultaneously kill the pirates as Phillips was about to be executed by his hostage takers.The final scenes reveal Muse is taken into custody and arrested for piracy while Phillips is rescued and treated.<br/><br/>While critics and many reviewers found this film to be a masterpiece,I myself saw many flaws in it.The scenes between the US Navy and the Somalian pirates particularly when it comes to negotiations with Captain Phillips somewhats undermine the Navy's skill in handling the situation considering that the Somalian pirates are not that knowledgeable and could be deemed as inferior opponents.The amount of time they needed and the excessive manpower used against 4 Somalian pirates before managing to save Phillips could be described somewhat more of an embarrassment and viewers may find themselves asking the Navy's capability in rescue operations.Aside from that,the constant shaking of the camera is found to be a distraction while watching it.Added to that,the tension of the film decreases and the viewer may become impatient as the film ends especially at the point when Phillips tried to escape his captors and too much Navy manpower are rendered clueless in dealing with the Somalians and the empathy for Phillips decreases at a certain point of the film.But despite of the negative things I have said,I felt that Tom Hanks delivered a wonderful performance and was able to overcome the things that I have mentioned in watching this film.He definitely provided one great performance and he exhibited range which he has never shown in his previous movies.Also,we get to see great acting by Barkhad Abdi.Overall,I would consider it one good movie but far from a masterpiece that garnered many Academy Award nominations with possible exceptions to the performances Hanks and Abdi."

Then the pirates make a second attempt and manage to board. Captain Phillips manages to keep most of the crew safe and is double crossed on a deal. Then it is him that the navy and US Seals must rescue. I also thought the dialog between the pirates was done well. It seemed legit with the arguing but they had to throw in the one crazy one that just wants to kill. That was so Hollywood.

","It's quite funny that movies which are based on true facts are most unrealistic movies. The filmmakers have the tendency to turn the truth in a piece of propaganda. Through this way they are maintaining stereotypes- and also they guarantee some success- that uncritically public it's always present in cinemas. I'm well aware of the fact that every movie has embodied some kind of propaganda. Sometimes it's made in a direct approach, sometimes it's very subtle or it can be perceived through indirect means. This movie, in a high degree, it's very ideological and has two aspects : the first, we all know, US army it's the greatest and the most serious army on the Earth and the second aspect has a subtle character: stereotypes about Somalia and its people- i'm tired to see the world cleaved in two parts : the civilized people (and good) and the uncivilized people (and bad). The word isn't black and white. Let's stop the hypocrisy."

The one thing that make this film just a film (it doesn't show the actual event...in my opinion) is how mushy the the robbers in the film, they fights each other, debates each other, and blames each other, they are too mushy to the crew of the ship. It's like the avarice they have just for a showcase in the film, not the actual event. They yammers the group until they are all shot and died, except the leader. But again, this is just film, so there is no use too regret that part.<br/><br/>And.....the last note.....is it anyone there just like me.......Have more sympathy to the bad side than all of those NAVY people???"

","This is an outstanding film, from start to finish. It's a masterpiece of acting, pacing, editing and with a perfectly-pitched soundtrack to boot. It benefits from being based on a pretty dramatic true story in the first place, but Paul Greengrass and co have treated the material intelligently to create a tense, believable and truly thrilling movie.<br/><br/>While I have no doubt that they've taken some liberties with the facts and added a good dose of Hollywood magic, at no point do things feel overdone or cheesy. <br/><br/>Hanks is predictably brilliant in the title role, with the final scene being particularly noteworthy. Barkhad Abdi, Barkad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed and Mahat Ali - all first-timers - turn in solid performances as the Somali pirates. The story is balanced and never tries to either paint the pirates as out-and-out evil, nor as hard-done-by cuddly bunnies. It simply shows, in a believable and nail-biting way, the outcome of an extraordinary set of events.<br/><br/>I only wish more movies coming out of Hollywood were so well executed, as this just goes to prove you don't need explosions, overdone CGI or ridiculous plot twists to create a piece of truly engaging cinema.<br/><br/>Very, very, very good indeed."

A raw and emotional report about the hijacking of a cargo ship off the Somali coast by pirates and the subsequent hostage of Philips .<br/><br/>Tom Hanks shows different characteristics of this Captain : an ordinary family man on his way to a routine job, a dutiful captain who strictly adhere to the rules and can rely on many years of experience , a devious man with cunning and strategic ingenuity trying to shake of the pirates and afterwards to keep them on a leash, a scared person who fears for his life and still looks for a way out of this dangerous situation and as apotheosis the way he plays a broken person who realizes that he escaped a life-threatening situation . In those last minutes Hanks shows what a brilliant actor he is. Every emotional stage he plays is as if he has already lived through it. The severe dutiful glance , the fear in his eyes and combative look. Each is believable put down and you feel involved .<br/><br/>The interpretation of the Somali pirates was terrifyingly real . Especially Barkhad Abdi was brilliant as Muse . A Somali who has to get money for his tribe and puts together a group to engage in hijacking a ship and ask for ransom. He was a character that showed a mix of thoughtfulness and determination to achieve this. He's also a leader who was able to calm down his team which walked around half- drugged all the time . With their wide open eyes and ferociously waving their machine guns .<br/><br/>Despite the limited locations that could be used in this film, it's a very tense movie and you see the situation escalate to a dangerous and violent claustrophobic journey in a lifeboat .<br/><br/>I had no idea that for such a situation such measures were taken by the U.S. military . At one point I had the idea that this had to be a very special Captain and thus the great resources were deployed . Three military vessels were deployed and a platoon Navy SEALS been rounded up to do the job. Extremely professionally filmed and unnerving exciting moments . I had no idea what the outcome of the film would be , but there isn't much choice: either survive this trip to hell or don't . It's that simple .<br/><br/>I hope that cargo ships are now allowed to arm themselves as they float in these waters , so that they can stop such an attack by a primitive motor boat. And otherwise just send an undercover team and pretend to be a reporting team that wants to interview them , after which they can be arrested. This actually worked at the airport in Zaventem ."
"eatfirst","8","1","2","30 December 2013"," Gripping, raw and vital. Exactly what you'd expect from Greengrass.
","Paul Greengrass takes much the same approach with this true life drama as he did with the stunning United 93, introducing us at the outset to two entirely alien groups of people who are preparing for journeys which will soon see their lives and fates thrown together. We are shown just enough background of the antagonists to draw us into their harsh lives without seeking to either excuse or condemn. Meanwhile we get a brief home-life snapshot of the insular, somewhat dour Phillips, a capable captain maybe, but not an easy man to get to know or like.<br/><br/>From the ramshackle group of hijackers soon emerges a de-facto leader, Muse, a tragically young skeleton of a man, played with stunning authority by total newcomer Barkhad Abdi. Once he bursts into the bridge and announces with focused intent ""I'm the captain now"" to a stunned Hanks (who he has literally just met, Greengrass intentionally keeping the actors apart during the production till the day of filming this pivotal scene) the movie plays out largely as a two-hander between this young first-timer and the highly seasoned star. To say that Abdi easily holds his own in such illustrious company is even more of a compliment than it would already sound because this may well also be the finest performance Tom Hanks has ever delivered.<br/><br/>By now we are perhaps all too familiar with the easy, natural charm that Hanks exudes on and off screen, and it can perhaps be tempting to underestimate the skill of his craft. He is a past master of essaying likable, capable, motivational leaders of men at all levels: From commanding Apollo 13, to leading a small company of soldiers in Saving Private Ryan, to simply getting the packages moved on time in Castaway. But, presumably on the basis of true accounts of the man himself and those around him. Phillips is not that sort of charismatic leader, and Hanks dials it right back. Distant, insular, sometimes a touch aggressive. Effective yes, but hardly engaging or inspiring. He does the right thing when he can, but this is no heroic portrait. Phillips is a man under phenomenal stress, terrified and just trying to cling on to self-control long enough to make it out alive. Hanks keeps an iron grip on his performance, and when, finally, the moment comes for the emotions to show, it's a desperate, almost wordless, and absolutely heartrending scene, somewhat reminiscent of the masterful sustained final shot on Bob Hoskins at the end of The Long Good Friday. Yes: That good."

After that, it became a little less absorbing and quite predictable. OK, so there isn't very much they can do to improve the story. But here is my problem. I never really felt threatened by the pirates. Their acting was great but for me they didn't do enough to make me fear for the lives of the crew members. My instincts were right as none of the crew members got injured which was a bit disappointing. Personally, it would've been a good idea to make the pirates a bit more fearsome by hurting some of the crew members. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a good movie, a 7.5/10 in my opinion.

"BharatSamra","9","1","2","22 December 2013"," A Story So Compelling, it is More Than Worth Telling
","A story so compelling and worth telling, Captain Phillips is the biographical account of one Captain Richard Phillips' actions in response to a hijacking by Somali pirates on his cargo ship in 2009. Despite accusations of the film's depiction of real events as misleading, as a standalone piece, Paul Greengrass' thrilling direction and Tom Hanks' phenomenal performance combine for one of 2013's most surprising, intense and breathtaking cinematic offerings.<br/><br/>The less you know about the factual events going into Captain Phillips, the more enhanced the experience of seeing a recreation of others' experiences will be, due to the surprising turns and uncertainty of the film's climactic moments.<br/><br/>The severe intensity and feeling of insecurity shroud your senses throughout the 134 minute duration of Captain Phillips. Like watching Breaking Bad, the sensations that the film evokes in you are indescribable, plentiful and so miscellaneous, causing you to become a servant to Greengrass' masterful filmmaking. This is how a biographical drama should feel: real, regardless of the fact that most watching will never experience the actions represented on screen.<br/><br/>An area in which the film arguably lacks is in its treatment of the sensitivity of piracy as less of a one-dimensional issue as it can often be perceived. While the themes around the social issues of Somali piracy are present, they are not entrenched into the narrative as the most memorable aspect of the film. More so, the film emphasises and brings attention to piracy more broadly as a global issue to be taken seriously. Prior to the intense hijacking sequences, Hanks, as Phillips, is consistently undermined in his concerns about the threat of piracy upon the MV Maersk Alabama, until of course the ship is successfully boarded by the four pirates. Captain Phillips favours thriller over drama, intensity over the propensity of piracy for many, but this by no means is a downfall for the film, just an observation I've spent too long writing about so let's move on.<br/><br/>Hanks' portrayal as the seemingly heroic Captain is not only one of his most memorable, but one of the most unforgettable performances in recent history. It is literal insanity how tremendously the actor clutches us all in to his character's palm, in order to give us an almost POV seat into the tribulations of his character. In addition to the film's perfect pacing, Tom Hanks' portrayal completely makes you lose track of time as your awareness is at one with the film's pace; you go wherever the Captain or Captor Abduwali Muse (brilliantly played by Barkhad Abdi) go. The film's concluding scene alone is a triumph in cinema, in acting and in emotional expression as Hanks delivers a heart-wrenching, throat- lumping and tear-inducing performance, so powerful it almost makes his acting throughout the rest of the film seem like a school play, but not quite...or at all. <br/><br/>Though not executed perfectly, Captain Phillips brings to light the darkness and seriousness of piracy. With a heavier concentration on Richard Phillips and its thriller genre, the biography based on the book by the Captain is a heart-pounding survival film that leaves you sweating, in awe and only able to reclaim your breath once the credits begin to scroll. In spite of the numerous bodily functions the film's wonderful score, masterful direction, talented actors and overall experience have you performing, they are functions worth having. Exhaustingly intense, Captain Phillips is an undoubted contender for the year's most outstanding feature."
"eshwarmail","8","1","2","21 December 2013"," Thrilling raw drama
","What's with Tom Hanks being stranded in the sea and giving a stellar performance for a character to root for? An edge of the seat thriller defying the conventional runtime with a very strong antagonist character having layers of depth that even the Dark Knight's Joker could have a run for his money. While majority of today's action thrillers rely on massive set pieces, special effects, explosions etc, it is good to see a fulfilling raw human drama between very original characters.<br/><br/>Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is your average captain of a merchant ship MV Maersk Alabama with a thinking cap and practical attitude. Muse(Barkhad Abdi) is a volatile young Somalian pirate with a devil- may-care attitude and lots of enthusiasm to out perform his peers. When Muse's hunt for prey encounters MV Maersk Alabama, the crew throws everything they have at the pirates to keep them at bay. but Muse's determination and the ship's under preparedness to handle such a situation leads to the capture. What stays in between is Phillips composure, perfect study of the situation (though initially) and his practicality.<br/><br/>Barkhad Abdi is not your typical antagonist with his petite appearance and a not so captivating voice. But his unpredictability and a misplaced courage and stubbornness makes him more than difficult to handle. Tom Hanks shows his masterclass throughout the movie saving his best for the climax. Now what comes to mind about Paul Greengrass? The man who popularized the frantic camera movements and exhaustive editing skills that we have seen from 'Bloody Sunday' to the spectacular 'Bourne Ultimatum'. But he did show some promise towards handling complex human emotions in 'United 93' that does spillover to this one too. What works for the movie is its simplicity and for good or bad, doesn't lose focus from the main subjects like dealing with their back story or the perspective of their family. Which is similar to how it is done in another of this year's wonderfully done 'Gravity'. <br/><br/>Powerful acting and a solid hand behind the camera delivers a first-class nail-biter ."

","One word, INTENSE! If ever there were a lesson on keeping an audience captivated by taking them through a roller-coaster of emotions look no further than Paul Greengrass's latest thriller, ""Captain Philips"". Inspired by true events of March 2009, when Richard Philips, the Captain of a cargo ship was taken hostage by Somali pirates, this film has everything: drama, suspense, heroics In truly nail-biting fashion, Tom Hanks plays Captain Richard Philips and executes these emotions flawlessly. <br/><br/>So convincing is his performance that you would be forgiven for almost believing that you were on the journey with him, sharing his pain, courage and at times total anguish. Barkhad Abdi's performance as Muse - the leader of the pirates - is riveting, going toe-to-toe with Hank in terms of wit, and carrying out the role of 'the villain' to perfection but not in your stereotypical way as he evokes an element of empathy amongst viewers. <br/><br/>As the story unfolds, it keeps you wondering and guessing right until the very end. Underlying questions keep you on the edge of your seat: what will happen to Captain Philips? Will Muse's unpredictable nature take a turn for the worse? How much longer can they survive? <br/><br/>Nowadays, it's all too easy to leverage special effects with an A-list cast, throwing in some loud bangs and call it a thriller. I'm a firm believer that the point of Cinema is to communicate the story whilst keeping the audience captivated. 'Captain Philips' not only achieves this with ease but delivers a story rich in dialog and accurately reflecting the events of March 2009 through the lives of relate-able characters. Somali pirates' exploits are well documented in our news, however this story is palpable to such an extent that it brings you as close to the real life event as possible whilst avoiding all the associated dangers. <br/><br/>The feeling of fear setting in as pirates approach the ship, the anguish felt as Captain Philips is taken hostage, the unpredictable violence of Muse, may all be cinematic: however, as you watch the story unravel these feelings will be anything but cinematic. The words ""must watch"" are overused in our industry but if you are after an intense ride, with a wave of emotions and character depth in abundance, 'Captain Philips' is definitely a must watch."
"davideo-2","9","1","2","28 November 2013"," Competently done, highly serviceable account of real life drama
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is the captain of the US flagged MV Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship cruising around Somalia towards the Horn of Africa. Whilst the mission is underway, Phillips receives a lengthy e- mail warning him of the dangers of Somali pirates striking in that region, which his crew all too quickly become aware of. And sure enough, from a tiny, impoverished village in Somalia come a group of desperate men, who take over the ship, plunging Phillips and his crew in to a desperate life or death battle that will test him as a leader to the very limit.<br/><br/>Only a few months ago, I noted how a big budget, glossy Hollywood production was in motion, on the subject of Somali pirates seizing cargo vessels around the Indian Ocean, in my review of a smaller budget, Danish production that had impressed me. There may be something of an arty film snob brewing in me that had me convinced this film wouldn't match that film's quality, and in a way, it doesn't. But that's because it's simply an impressive film in and of it's own. While it's inevitably on a much larger scale and has received much more publicity, it's in the hands of United 93 director Paul Greengrass, who manages to still keep something of a down to earth look to it by using a shaky cam. The way the drama unfolds does have a little more of a Hollywood feel to it than the Danish film, what with a big dramatic build up to the hijacking, rather than in the European film where we just see it happening without much fuss. But that doesn't make how it unfolds any less ominous, as there's an unnerving claustrophobia to the scenes where Phillips is on his own, glancing at the long e-mail or as we see the little ships on the radar and from the ship's deck, hurtling towards their target.<br/><br/>After all this about the similarly themed Danish film, I feel it necessary to mention at this point that this is not a remake of that film, and is an account of a completely separate real life hijacking, that being the first at sea hijacking of an American vessel in many years. Hanks is pretty much the go to guy for this kind of role, and has done his research and rehearsal as reliably as ever, getting Phillips's accent right and enveloping himself in the role and the drama it invokes. But he's playing it off against a host of young Somali talent, who may struggle to find work as high profile as this again, in key roles as the hijackers, who sadly suffer the Hollywood effects of the film by being portrayed as more hissable and ruthless than they were in the Danish film, which probably more realistically showed them as only slightly less desperate and scared than their captives, but that's not to say Barkhad Abdi and Barkhad Abdirahman don't get quiet, soulful moments to reason with Hanks and show their more human side, even if there's nothing like the borderline Stockholm Syndrome there was in the Danish film.<br/><br/>It would be easy for anyone who'd seen the Danish production to let out their cynical side and frown at a Hollywood stab at what it was trying to do, but the talent involved are professional enough to ensure it doesn't descend into anything overly glamorised or corn fed. ****"

","Remember the news about Somali pirates? This thrill ride of a movie Introduces us to the main players of 21st century piracy. While we learn a little more about the similar job motivation of pirates and merchant ship seamen during the 133 minutes of this excellent film, the main focus is the intense drama during the hostage taking and stand off with US navy. I was on the edge of my seat from the first attack on the US merchant ship to the end credits. The film flew by me thanks to the intensity and documentary-style story telling. Still, I felt the fate of Somali people and their economic misfortune deserved a few more minutes of screen time to shed some light on the pirates desperate situation.<br/><br/>Watch it if you can handle a film where there is no opportunity to feel good or at ease, not even to mention laugh, until the very end.

","Let me start off by saying that Captain Phillips is a great movie. My husband and I thought the acting was incredible and the story well written. We gave it 9 out of 10 stars. What needs to be posted online and at the movie theater is that this movie uses shaky camera techniques which can make you nauseated if you are prone to this. I got a severe headache and nauseated to the point of dry heaves due to the jerky camera technique. This is called shaky cam or queasy cam. About a third of people who see a shaky cam movie will feel nauseated. That said, I think this movie will be a heavy contender in the Oscar race. Tom Hanks will probably be nominated for Best Actor and Barkhad Abdi for Best Supporting Actor. I think the other main characters, Barkhad Abdirahman who played Bilal, Faysal Ahmed who played Najee, and Mahat M. Ali who played Elmi did a fantastic job especially since they were all new to acting. Max Martini not only played a great Seal Commander, he is very easy on the eyes. Overall, this movie was extremely good and I highly recommend. Just make sure that the shaky cam won't bother you."

","I really hated this movie. Give me my money back, please! From the start to the end, this was awful. Although, some of Hanks' previous movies are even worse, for instance The Da Vinci Code. The love-story was unbelievable. Who would love Tom Hanks' (character?) The part with the goat was also totally out of place. I mean, I like goats in most movies, but this just felt wrong. I really hope they don't make a sequel for this. His superpowers are gone, he is a normal guy now. So just let it be. The best scene in the movie was the end credits. I really enjoyed them, some of the best end credits in a long time. And why was the movie so long? It felt like I actually went on an airplane, and travelled around the world. The movie should have been set on a spaceship. That would have cut the travel and runtime considerably, and the movie into a short-film. And why couldn't the terrorists be white? I found this movie pretty offensive."

","""Everything is going to be okay,"" Muse (Barkhad Abi)<br/><br/>Yes, for Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks), everything did turn out ""okay"" as Muse, the captain of four pirate Somalis, kept assuring him. Not so for the pirates. <br/><br/>In the docudrama Captain Phillips, director Paul Greengrass has once again used his expertise with the hand-held camera and an uncanny sense of tense drama to take, as he did in United 93, an historical drama and make it painfully real. When the pirates take over the Maersk Alabama cargo ship off the coast of Somalia in 2009, the captain ends up in a motorized life-boat with the pirates to experience claustrophobia in the Das Boot tradition and a keen awareness of danger, although we know that at least he will survive.<br/><br/>The genius of American action films, especially real-life adventures involving crack American units like the Navy SEALS, such as in Zero Dark Thirty, is to keep our attention wedded to action whose results we already know. The tension aboard the unarmed ship (those defending hoses are weak) is vivid while the pirates search for the hidden crew. Yet the drama aboard the little life-craft trumps all else while the pirates argue among themselves and Phillips does a heroic turn of applying psychological warfare.<br/><br/>Hanks has cornered the film market on decent, common men in uncommon, demanding circumstances. His scene on the rescue ship is an effective depiction of a man suffering more from concern about his family than the physical pain the pirates inflict. Hanks' ability to project a love of humanity, even these pirates, is unparalleled. Look for his nomination at Oscar time.<br/><br/>Although we have seen this type of action before, notably in the excellent Danish docudrama The High Jacking last year, Captain Phillips takes it up close and personal. You can almost say you were there.<br/><br/>""I know how to handle Americans,"" Muse says. That's a hollow boast because even most of us (Congress included) aren't good at handling our fellow Americans. Except for Tom Hanks, of course."

","There are many unique aspects that make ""Captain Phillips"" a Best Picture-nominee: incredible acting, high tension, and a plot that one wouldn't think could occur yet in the 21st century. To me, however, the hallmark of the movie was its ability to make viewers ask themselves the question ""what would I do in a similar scenario?"".<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Captain Phillips"" tells the story of Rich Phillips (Tom Hanks), captain of a shipping vessel that is boarded by a gang of Somali pirates led by Muse (Barkhad Abi). Looking to strike a a huge payday from an American ship, the pirates take Mr. Phillips as their hostage. However, despite their best efforts, the pirates are constantly set back by the ingenuity and courage of Phillips and his crew.<br/><br/>The most striking experience of this whole film to me was this: Here we are in the year 2014, and we are still dealing with pirates! When people use that word nowadays, they are mostly referring to fictional characters with eye-patches flying the Jolly Roger skull-and-crossbones. The Somali pirates, though, are not of this variety. They are both ruthless and calculating, producing a visceral sense of fear that they could begin taking lives at any time.<br/><br/>Thus, while watching the movie, I was constantly thinking ""how would I handle this situation?"". At the same time, I was amazed by the ingenuity and courage of Phillips in the face of a very, very frightening situation. Being based on a true story (although I honestly know nothing about the real Captain Phillips, so I can't vouch for accuracy whatsoever), this movie has a sense of ""real- world gravitas"" to it, while at the same time producing incredibly high drama due to the unique situations it presents.<br/><br/>As far as the acting is concerned, ""Captain Phillips"" showcases some of the best. The tension between the Hanks and Abdi characters is palpable throughout, while the final few minutes of the film may be the best work Mr. Hanks has ever put up on the big screen (and what a statement that is!).<br/><br/>Overall, then, ""Captain Phillips"" is the film I would vote as ""Best Picture"" at the 2014 Academy Awards. It is a film that can be enjoyed by all, not just appealing to a particular segment. Even if you ""know what is going to happen"", so to speak (being based on a real person's experiences), the tension between Phillips and the Pirates will still have you on the edge of your seat."
"roystephen-81252","9","1","3","22 February 2016"," Exceptionally effective real-life thriller
","Hollywood is often accused of providing only shallow entertainment and not making enough films about important issues or watering them down. I don't share that point of view. It's business, of course, and the masses demand escapism, but there has always been a deliberate effort to go beyond that from time to time and that effort alone deserves appreciation. Many deep, meaningful films have emerged from Hollywood during its history, encompassing diverse important themes ranging from the very personal to the very political. Captain Phillips is one of them, and an exceptionally well-made one at that.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass has already proved with Bloody Sunday and United 93 that he is a master of real-life dramatisations, and Captain Phillips, telling the story of the hijacking of a container ship by Somali pirates and the ensuing hostage crisis, may very well be his best film yet. It is an incredibly intense, suspenseful thriller with impeccable performances from both Tom Hanks (in the title role) and Barkhad Abdi (the leader of the pirates). In the opening sequences, Greengrass masterfully builds up the ominous anticipation, just as he did in United 93. The film grabs your attention from the get-go and glues you to your seat until the very end. There are no unnecessary dialogues, additions or embellishments, and no issues are dumbed down here. The story is told in a highly effective, economical, documentary style, and the focus is on the motives and emotional reactions of the people involved so that you can truly feel and understand what they were going through.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips deserved all six Oscar nominations. One of the best films of the decade."
"bryank-04844","8","1","3","22 August 2015"," 'Captain Phillips' is one hell of a fine film and reminds us why we all love Tom Hanks. Great picture.
","Tom Hanks is back out on the water again with Paul Greengrass' 'Captain Phillips', the true story that was covered in the media a few years ago, where cargo ship captain Richard Phillips (Hanks) and his crew were attacked by Somali pirates off the coast of Africa during a delivery, and where Phillips was actually taken hostage in a tony life boat for a few days. As there have been several survival movies coming out as of recently, this one in particular can sit high with the rest of them, as Greengrass and Hanks do exceptional work and keep this two-hour long suspenseful film on the edge of your seat. I expect high box office returns for this outing as Hanks and the plot will drive people to theaters this weekend.<br/><br/>I was a little worried that 'Captain Phillips' would be an eye sore as Greengrass is known for his quick and jerky cuts from his 'Bourne' movies, but I can happily say, that those obnoxious angles and edits have been left out. The film opens up with the good captain saying goodbye to his family as he is about to embark on a little trip to haul tons of food, medicine, water, and other goods to Africa. However, his big cargo ship and crew of about 20 workers have to go through some unprotected waters to reach their destinations.<br/><br/>Phillips is a no non-sense guy and is always on top of his staff in doing their jobs. He knows the score and has been around the block a few times. He knows that he is going into these dangerous waters and even sets ups drills in case his ship is attacked by Somali pirates, who we have come to know in the news as desperate poor civilians in an anarchist country whose only means of making money is to kidnap and hold ransom foreign boats and captains for large sums of money, so that thy can pay off their evil bosses and possibly eat the next day. As Phillips and his crew are just out to sea, a large group of Somalis are standing beach-front and being recruited and heavily armed to take two small boats and attack the incoming large ships in hopes of a big financial score.<br/><br/>These Somalis must only weigh 115 pounds at the most and can't be over the age of 25. It seems that one of the groups that is recruited is led by a guy named Muse (Bakhad Abdi), who doesn't want to hurt anyone, but just survive. As Captain Phillips is running a drill for an attack, he notices two small boats racing toward his large boat and a real attack is underway. Phillips does everything he can to prevent these pirates from boarding their ship, but due to the ship's largeness, it can't turn or move fast, and the pirates soon dodge the large fire hoses and are aboard a ship of over 20 crew who have no weapons.<br/><br/>Phillips instructs his crew to hide in the engine room and keep out of sight as Muse calls Phillips 'Irish' from now on and demands money. After a bit of stalling and taking the pirates around the ship, Phillips gives in and gives Muse the $30k that is on the ship in cash. However some of the other pirates who have a super hot temper believe that if they kidnap Phillips, they will get an even bigger payday. As the navy and military have been alerted and are on their way, the pirates and crew have a standoff, but the pirates have the upper-hand here and take Phillips away in a dingy lifeboat, which they hope to make it to Somalia in under two days.<br/><br/>Soon, the military, helicopters, Navy Seals, and several warships are tailing the little enclosed lifeboat, as tensions keep building on both sides. Muse often reminds Phillips that he is just a simple fisherman looking to survive and is not out to hurt anyone, but the same cannot be said for the other three pirates in the lifeboat who are constantly beating Phillips. In the big climax of the film, we again come to realize why Tom Hanks is one of the best actors in the business. We all know how it turned out in real life, Phillips was rescued, but what Hanks gave as a performance, is nothing short of perfection in the final ten minutes.<br/><br/>His shock and terror of what had happened to him is simply stunning. He is speechless, silent, and only mumbling incoherent questions as the nurse asks him who he is and does he know where he's at. You have to see these final minutes of this film, for they will truly stay with you for a while, and the hour and a half before it only builds that tension and release. Greengrass did a great job with this film as his camera took us to a claustrophobic setting where we the audience are trying to breathe and stay calm as our hero Phillips is. And the pirates all do a decent job, if not a clichéd job here and there, but it gets the job done. Note that the pirate in charge of driving the small life boat is constantly terrified.<br/><br/>Henry Jackman's musical score amps up the suspense and keeps things moving. 'Captain Phillips' is one hell of a fine film and reminds us why we all love Tom Hanks. Great picture."

","It's got to be difficult to take a true story and make it into an intense thriller. Before watching this film I looked up the story of the actual Richard Phillips and therefore knew that he made it out okay. Yet somehow at the near end of this movie I was biting my nails at how intense this was. Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is the captain of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama. When traveling around Somalia his ship is taken over by Somali pirates. But when the cargo crew manage to subdue a weapon from Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi) the leader Muse escapes with the rest of the pirates in a lifeboat and holds Captain Phillips hostage. The rest of the movie is the US Navy negotiating with Muse about Captain Phillips's return home. This part is incredibly intense. It was still intense after I read about the real story too so Paul Greengrass did a good job. Hanks's performance was stellar as always so if you like intense films don't miss this."
"Leofwine_draca","9","1","3","11 December 2014"," Greengrass strikes again
","British director Paul Greengrass delivers the goods in this taut and terrifying true-life thriller centred around Somali pirates and the innocent civilians they put at risk. Greengrass shapes a true story of hijacking on the high seas and turns it into an incredibly suspenseful story that bears all the hallmarks of the likes of UNITED 93.<br/><br/>The thing about Greengrass is that he knows how to build suspense, and he knows how to deliver thrilling intensity. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is full of incredible scenes in which the tension is ratcheted up stage by stage, until things explode into excitement. This is a film of two halves, with the hijacking taking up the first half while the second half turns into a single-location thriller along the lines of Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT. Both halves complement each other and prove a satisfying whole.<br/><br/>I'm no fan of Tom Hanks, but CAPTAIN PHILLIPS sees him deliver a strong performance as the testy, unlikeable captain put through his paces by the Somalis. The Somali actors are excellent in their roles, and I particularly liked the differentiation of character in the pirate gang - you feel like you've got to know them come the end. The cat and mouse games between crew and pirates are expertly staged and the pace never flags despite the lengthy running time. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is nothing less than a modern-day classic."
"rmax304823","8","1","3","8 December 2014"," Dangerous Sea.
","The title is accurate; the docudrama is about Captain Richard Phillips, whose huge American cargo ship was boarded by four teen-aged Somali pirates in 2009. Phillips himself was taken hostage and kept aboard the Maersk Albama's lifeboat, to be held for millions of dollars in ransom. It didn't work. The five men were crowded into the fiberglass lifeboat for a day or two. The US Navy intervened. The pirate chieftain was taken prisoners, the others shot by Navy Seals, and Phillips was released.<br/><br/>It gets off to a rather sluggish start, ahead dead slow, except that no Master issues orders like that anymore. Our first views of the Maersk Alabama drain all the romance from our fantasies about life at sea. First of all, the ship is so long and so tall that when it's in port you can't identify it as a ship. It looks like a city, an industrial city. Second, there is no glamor on the bridge. No messenger stands by; no one at the engine controls; there's no one at the helm -- there's no HELM. The ship is all computerized. You want to change course? You push a button. Where did it all go? (Sob.) <br/><br/>As the ship's master, Tom Hanks does a decent job, brisk, efficient, calm in the face of troubled waters -- until the last few minutes, when he lets loose. He's had gun muzzles at his temple, his forehead, and his throat, and he's been whacked several times with rifle butts and been beaten with fists. He's had blood splattered all over him. <br/><br/>After the lifeboat is recovered, Hanks is taken to the sick bay on the destroyer Bainbridge, where he's checked out and treated by a female CPO. Hanks is so shaken he can barely speak. The CPO has no such problem. She can't shut up. ""Are you okay? You don't look okay? Are you okay? Does this hurt?"" There's no chance for Hanks to respond, nor is any response expected. And, while still examining the shocked Hanks, she addresses comments to her assistant in the usual detached tone of a medical provider who is describing an assemblage of organs. Soothingly to Hanks: ""You're okay now. Just relax."" In clipped, efficient tones to the assistant: ""Laceration on the right temple."" <br/><br/>Very nice scenes of ships at sea, depictions of devices to repel boarders that I'd never dreamed of, and a convincing picture of the discomfort of being aboard an unventilated lifeboat of shallow draft, bouncing around in the ocean, throwing bodies to and fro, banging their heads against the bulkheads. And no sentimental flashbacks to Phillip's dreamy life at home -- the loving wife, the happy children, the rose-covered cottage in the vale. Like Phillips, the movie is all business.<br/><br/>The movie has a tougher time with the pirates. They could have made off safely with thirty thousand dollars but decided to take a hostage and demands thirty million. So how do you handle these guys? Their looks are so strikingly exotic that it's hard to tell one from another. Yet the story must differentiate them somehow. The pirate who is most nearly sympathetic to Hanks looks a little younger than the others. They were evidently all in their teens, the youngest perhaps fifteen, but they all look older than that. The pirate chief is given some cynical remarks about Hanks' naivté, and he wants above all to go to America. He's the one who's captured, not killed, and he gets his wish -- thirty-three years' worth.<br/><br/>There are still some puzzles about the film, though it was based on an ""as-told-to"" book by Phillips himself. I got the number of pirates mixed up. Maybe that's just the result of a mini-stroke. And I don't understand why a destroyer's bridge should be lighted with blue instead of red, a pretty cavalier treatment of the Purkinje effect. We barely see the members of Seal Team Six, and we don't know what their protocol is. ""Two targets red -- one green, one fuschia."" And if the movie needed a touch of humor, we could at least have heard the most prominent radio talk show pundit in America, describing the pirates as ""just a couple of scared kids trying to get home"", a real-life interpretation of the event. Yes, he actually said it."
"gary-444","8","1","3","8 August 2014"," A compelling pirate tale
","Paul Greengrass is a fine action Director, as exemplified in United 57 .Once again, he takes a factual drama, and recreates it for film. The cultural differences between the affluent United States and impoverished Somalia are cleverly woven into the opening sequences. <br/><br/>Stateside, there are crawling six lane highways, in Somalia dirt tracks and mud encrusted Toyotas. Captain and Mrs Phillips worry about schooling for their son, a shanty, subsistence, fishing village is at the mercy of pirates with bigger fish in mind. The villager pirates tinker with rusting, beach launched, temperamental, skiffs. Captain Phillips meanders through a vast terminal in Oman to board his vertiginous container ship. The Somali dialogue is sub-titled heightening the sense of division.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is a consummate actor and assumes the persona of a ship's captain with ease. He is in command, but no swaggering hero. His pirate nemesis, ""Skinny"" Muse, Barkhad Abdi is thin, agitated and determined. When the skiff attacks the Alabama it seems an improbable contest. Although the Alabama is unarmed, it is huge, deploying fire hoses, and travelling at speed.<br/><br/>The ship's crew are remarkable for their ordinariness, with some protesting that their duties do not include pirate conflict, but the chief engineer is a wonderful stereo type, grey, wiry, and gnarled. Their Somali adversaries, all first time actors, are equally convincing as frenetic, desperate, khat chewing tribesmen.<br/><br/>Once they have boarded, a conventional cat and mouse, hide and seek, scene unfolds with potential that is fully exploited by Greengrass. The drama which sees the crew seemingly triumph, then lose their captain to the pirates, is compelling. Phillips urges them to ""Stick together and we will be alright"", advice tinged with irony as events unfold.<br/><br/>Once Phillips is taken hostage, the visceral action changes from the broad sweep of the ocean, to the cockpit intensity of a lifeboat. Grengrass is brilliant in mixing the ingredients of a traditional pirate yarn, into modern day piracy, turning out one of the best action thrillers in recent years which never purports to faithfully document events, just be inspired by them. Profanity is absent, and does not harm the story one jot.<br/><br/>Politically the film is deeply conservative. The Americans are the good guys, the Somalis the bad guys who are either killed, or incarcerated, for their effrontery in taking on Uncle Sam. The Brits don't take the original call seriously and it is the US Navy and SEALS who use overwhelming firepower to crush the pirates. The co-operation of the US military is apparent as operational warships are used to impressive effect.<br/><br/>Greengrass and Hanks neatly sidestep the controversy regarding the extent of the real Captain Phillips' heroism. Could he have done more to take a course further from the Somali coast? He is seen considering pirate warning and his route? How well did he handle the physical confrontation itself? Greengrass doesn't dodge the questions, without providing any firm answers, and Hanks assured but understated performance does not portray him as an action hero. <br/><br/>The nature of heroism for those placed unexpectedly in fraught situations is always contentious. Invariably individuals simply do their best on very limited information, with luck being an essential ingredient. One of the two pirate skiffs is scared off both by the task of boarding the Alabama and the threat of a Naval response, Muse accuses a fellow pirate of cowardice and kills him in the resulting confrontation. The act of boarding is perilous, mortally dangerous, and exciting, with four armed men taking on a crew of twenty no easy task. Are Muses's actions driven by bravery , greed, or fear of failure? Was Phillips's route chosen by bravery, greed or recklessness?<br/><br/>An immensely enjoyable piece of storytelling, this firmly reinforces Greengrass's position in the elite echelon of action film directors. He is a man who can handle a big budget, but places the story and characters first."

The movie builds the tension gradually, Hanks enjoying a battle of wit with the pirates before the inevitable confrontation, the journey in between is tense, fraught with emotion and even my other half who is not a film fan found herself engrossed from beginning to end.<br/><br/>This movie is a solid 7, but Hanks, with the latter scenes elevates this to an 8.

"MacTheMovieguy","8","1","3","23 July 2014"," a great performance from Hanks
","Based on the true story of Captain Richard Phillips, who survived a somali pirate attack on his ship, and wrote a book about it. That book was snapped up by Paul Greengrass who made it into a movie. Greengrass who uses a very gritty style of filmmaking, as already seen in films like United 93 and The Bourne Ultimatum, is excellent at directing tense situations and realistic action sequences. He's employed Tom Hanks for this effort, who is probably one of the greatest living actors. His wall of Oscars at home reminds him constantly just how good he is. He is fantastic in this film as well.<br/><br/>There's been a lot of hoopla about the performance of Barkhad Abdi, but he stays pretty level the whole film. I didn't get any fluctuations in character from him. He's a bad guy, just a bad guy with some reasoning to being a bad guy. I wouldn't have nominated him for an Oscar. I don't think it's a dynamic performance, and I think there were better performances this year.<br/><br/>The film itself is perhaps a little long, a complaint I've been having recently with a few Oscar hopefuls. This one maybe only needed 5 minutes trimmed from it, just to fix some pacing issues in the beginning. Once things get going, the film moves at a breakneck pace. But the first 30 minutes or so is a little slow. I would almost say that the second hour and forty minutes more than makes up for it, almost.<br/><br/>This really is a great performance from Hanks, who performs like he is Richard Phillips. He's always been able to fully embody the role, and become the person. You don't see Hanks, you see Captain Phillips. For Hanks, there is no script. There are only conversations and answers. Everything feels natural. He was absolutely robbed of an Oscar nomination this year.<br/><br/>Deserving of the praise it is getting, Captain Phillips is a definite must see movie before Oscar night."

","This film surprised me in such a good way that I feel almost out of words to express how much I enjoyed it. First off, we have an extremely entertaining picture, mainly due to GREAT characterization of the villains. I mean, director portrayed them in a so bad way that it seemed impossible not to feel afraid of them. Also, those actors brought reality to the characters, proving that they've been intelligently chosen. The tension is built from the get go, and once the pirates get into the ship, everything gets out of control and I couldn't think about anything other than this horrifying story. About the acting, I know several people stated that Tom Hanks was magnificent in this movie; well, not that I totally disagree with them, but I found the villains' acting to be better than his-- except in the final scene with the navy doctor, which was really moving, thanks to the actors involved and to the strong directing/soundtrack. Another good point of this film is that it doesn't try to make governmental propaganda for the USA, even if lauding its army sometimes. Besides, the movie never engages on being lame; for a moment, I thought that Phillips would be saved by the hurt Somali guy, which would feel EXTREMELY cliché, cheesy and lame. However, director Paul Greengrass doesn't appeal to this kind of false sentimentalism, reason why he deserves the biggest part of my congratulations for this project. It just doesn't deserve a 10 because filmmakers didn't bother explaining why they had NO weapons or security in the ship; I mean, they could've invented some lawsuit forbidding them on carrying loaded guns, or something. Anyways, ""Captain Phillips"" is the BEST movie I've seen from 2013 and I hardly doubt there will be any other just as great. Congratulations!"

Playing Phillips, Tom Hanks is truly the most fitting for this part, He starts off playing Captain on his vessel and it's a usual routine delivery, Phillips is a family man and comes across as general good guy. When the pirates do come you see him play the level headed leader that seems to have everything under control and running smoothly showing no signs of true panic in front of his colleagues a real true role model .Hanks gives the performance of his life towards the end of the film where we see an unexpected display of true emotion and should have set him up for the Oscar for best actor.<br/><br/>The pirates are played by new upcoming actors and come across very realistic, speaking mainly in their main tongue and little English they are aggressive and desperate and you could tell that they were willing to go to great lengths to impress their leader back home. The four Somali-American first-time actors playing the pirates are a very realistic bunch. Barkhad Abdi plays leader Muse, engaging mainly with the captain.Faysal Ahmed plays the confrontational Najee, who was the loose cannon of the group. Barkhad Abdirahman plays the youngest seemingly innocent pirate Bilal on his first pirating experience. Director Paul Greengrass did an excellent job with the film and I was literally at the end of my seat.Greengrass brought us into the film and I certainly felt a lot of remorse and sympathy for the characters this film generally made me feel something great which is rare and hard to achieve in modern film."

","What a strong excellent film. This would have to be one of Tom Hanks best. The strength in the film is amazing and it expresses excellent feeling towards the audience. The storyline is strong and true. Its accurate to the real story and far from over the top. The characters are amazing and true to themselves. Each of the Somalian fisherman are excellent and all strong individuals. The film lacked a bit of music but it was not absolutely necessary for this type of film. The US army are frustrating as usual but I can understand why. Some seriously deep tactics would have had to been put into place to successfully gain back the Captain. I would like to know what else the US army did to show the Somalian government who is really leading. Maby this was done after the incident. Regardless of this Somalia have a terrible record and the US armies quick reactions saved all passengers. The leader payed the price though. 33 Years in jail and he now has to live with the fact that it was him that caused the other three to be killed. What a sad life he is going to have. <br/><br/>Overall one of the best movies of the year. 5 Stars all the way! I would recommend this to anyone! Definitely one of my favourites! What an inspiring film!"

","This is based on a real story, but the crew from back then did not get tired trying to tell people that Tom Hanks version of the captain of the title is made making him look better than he actually was. That is something that I cannot comment on since I haven't read too much about what actually happened back then. Whatever the case, this is not a documentary and the movie does a good job creating a very suspenseful environment.<br/><br/>The villains might feel a bit over the top and there is another movie (more a documentary) that actually paints a better picture of how pirates operate or what their thinking and general life is, but this has no time to deal with that either. So while you could make a case against this movie (easily), you could also just sit back and enjoy a movie that only wants to entertain first and just put a little onto the situation ..."
"randallcameron","8","1","3","10 June 2014"," Well done, generally realistic thriller
","We were pleasantly surprised by this film. Even knowing how it ends, the suspense wore us out. It stuck fairly well (by Hollywood standards) to facts, except for the extreme time compression of a film story, and some unnecessary bits (""If you want to shoot someone, shoot me!""). Tom Hanks was capable as always. Neither he nor the crew appeared heroic, so much as people trying to make the best of a bad situation. The captain's awareness of danger and decision to stay only 300 nm offshore was depicted, along with his conviction that ""further out wouldn't make any difference"". Also, the desperate situation of the pirates, their being bullied into piracy, their conviction of being robbed by illegal fishermen, their personal lack of resources and gain (those millions go to the bossmen) from piracy all were described. The deep social pathology of Somalia's current anarchy is evident, but not highlighted. I imagine the US Navy loved this movie, but they had overwhelming force available. The hostage could lose, but the pirates could not win. Many of the reviews say more about the viewpoints of the reviewers than the movie itself. Barakhad Abdi and Faysal Ahmed were brilliant in depicting the intelligent, conflicted, and deeply messed-up characters they portrayed."

","An American ship bringing cargo to the African continent is hijacked by Somalian pirates.

Hanks shows the right emotion of a person in such a precarious situation.<br/><br/>It also goes to show you that the pirates will hurt their own people in order to attain their selfish ends.<br/><br/>Hanks gives a superb performance and is well-matched by Barkhad Abdi, a former Minnesota chauffeur, who was nominated for best supporting actor as the pirate leader in this 2013 film."
"saschakrieger","9","1","3","19 March 2014"," Life in a nutshell
","There are some who say that the most important part of a film is its ending. Examples of films which have been all but destroyed by the way they end are legion. Much rarer are the cases of films that really come into their own at the very end. Luckily, Captain Phillips, based on the much publicized case of the 2009 hijacking of an American cargo ship off the Somalian coast, is part of the latter, considerably smaller group. After his rescue, Phillips (Tom Hanks in his strongest performance in years) is taken in by highly efficient and well-trained Navy personnel who perform routine checks, ask routine questions, follow routine protocol. Phillips, however, who we have just watched for two hours working like a well-oiled survival machine, a master at adapting to any change of situation, a great tactician and relentless fighter, has turned into a zombie-like shell: words fail him, simple movements and motions become impossibly complicated. The puzzled bewilderment, the gaping hole the instinct to survive has left, contrast drastically with the self-congratulatory air of everyone else to who this has just been a successful operation. To Phillips, this is his life.<br/><br/>And so the ever-moving hand-held camera, efficiently industrious, full of unchecked energy clashes with the image of a soul that has come to a brutal halt, a personal world that has stopped turning, a heart that has skipped a beat. And all of a sudden, the same look that has just been supportive and empathic is now voyeuristic, indecent, intrusive. For the well-made thriller has revealed something existential, something essential to human nature. A primal fear and helplessness that we are so good at covering up. This ending, this emptying face will remain when everything else about this film has disappeared. And there is quite a lot to this. For the previous two hours Captain Phillips has been a gripping thriller, a claustrophobic clash of human desires and fears and needs whose space grows ever tighter: from two separate locations to a ship, a bridge, a cellar-like engine room to a tiny closed lifeboat that looks grotesquely pathetic compared to the war machinery the Navy has brought.<br/><br/>Yet inside, all of human drama takes place: there's power and powerlessness, brutality and fear, despair and hope, the first world and the third, all enclosed in literally, a nutshell. And pretty evenly distributed among the hijackers and the victims, the guilty and the innocent. There is no black or white, only the gray, the pale, ghost- like hue of the indifferent sea and sky, a vast unthinking universe in which life is merely an afterthought. They have to deal with each other: the confident, experience, smart Phillips and the aggressive, skinny, helpless Muse (Barkhad Abdi in a haunting, memorable performance). Two lost souls whose final bewilderment in the face of deadly efficiency reveals them as inhabitants of the same planet without unduly shifting guilt. Yes, the highjacker turned kidnapper is guilty, yes he is a criminal deserving of punishment, but first and foremost, he is human, just like his prisoner. There are no monsters in this battle of wills in which both are pawns as well as actors, swept around by the tides while taking responsibility and making decisions.<br/><br/>The camera is always close, hardly ever still, reflecting the hectic twists and turns of this duel, this frantic battle to survive. Captain Phillips thrives on Paul Greengrass' excellent direction, his impeccable timing, the documentary-like camera work, the hypnotic rhythm and gripping editing, the clear, pale, matter-of-factly imagery. Yes, it is a thriller and a highly efficient one. But it is one that moves from outward suspense to inner drama, just as the space narrows the inner battles come to the forefront. No matter if captain or crew or kidnappers: in the end, they all want to survive, their own worst enemy is fear. Which is ultimately the film's chief protagonist: Captain Phillips is a film about fear, about what it does to people, no matter on what side of the processes that create the fear they appear to be. Its destructive force as well as its ability to bring out a strength hitherto unsuspected, have never been more visible, its angels and devils never clearer, the key role it plays in all of human existence, never been more obvious. And its power to be at its strongest when it seems to have been overcome. It may be paralyzing, shutting down all normal processes, putting existence on stand-by. Yet it will reboot, Phillips will go to sea again, Muse will find a way to survive, to continue. And so will we. Not less fearful, but, maybe, just a tiny little bit wiser.<br/><br/>http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/"

","When Tom Hanks's name appears in the posters of a film, automatically we expect a film above par and pitched with some sharp performances. It has almost become a right to expect a good film when tom Hanks is involved. Add Oscar nominations for the best film actor and supporting actor to the mix, and your expectations hit the sky. But this time it felt like I had just eaten a bad meal from a restaurant that always delivers high quality food. It was cold.<br/><br/>Saving grace for the film was the performance of Hanks after he was rescued from the pirates. He was coming to terms with the fact that he will live, and that he has survived a bunch of ruthless pirates. After putting a brave face and facing his odds, it was a privileged to see the emotions getting the better of Captain Phillips. His sharp observation skills and maturity as an actor was evident in the last 5 minutes. If we have seen all the good work done by Tom Hanks over the years, it is not a surprise. He can deliver that with utmost precision, even if we are waking him up at the middle of the night.<br/><br/>My disappointment was with the fact that the director and screenwriter could have actually made the film more interesting on many levels. Thrilling if you may... The final stab is the fact that they did not use the talent at their disposal. Sad to see the filmmakers settling for mediocre work. The fear and tension of the sailors on board were not captured by the director. May be he was thinking, ""I have Tom Hanks, nobody will notice anything else"". Well, we noticed that you took the lazy route. <br/><br/>For a film that is so much overrated I am giving 5/10, that too for the performances of Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi."

","Captain Phillips is the true tale about an supply ship captain (hanks) who is taken hostage by Somali pirates. This film stuns me, easily one of the best films of 2013 and one of the best of Tom Hanks' films; it provides an in-depth account and provides edge-of-your-seat tension especially the scene's between Phillips and lead pirates Muse (Barkhad Abdi) which keeps you guessing whether Phillips is going to live. It also gives a look into the Navy SEALS who are trying to rescue him.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but feel a little sympathetic at the end of this film. At 2 hours long it keeps you entertained throughout and provides lots of tension especially at the climax. I think Abdi deserves a special applause as although it is his first acting role, he provides emotional depth and menace to the character; well worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>All of the cast was brilliant and it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole film, extraordinary film, go and see watch it today!"

"ViktorDrake","4","1","3","26 February 2014"," An OK movie spoilt by shaky camera work
","As the title says, I found this to be an OK film - nothing more, nothing less. On the plus side, it's a true story (with a little Hollywood embellishment), and as a tale it definitely deserved to be told on the big screen. Tom Hanks is very good (as you'd expect) and he delivers a nicely nuanced performance as the slightly world-wearing eponymous captain. Additionally, the Somali pirates are very well portrayed displaying the edgy, unpredictability of men in that situation.<br/><br/>However, on the negative side, I personally found this movie a little too long in places. For example, the sequence where the SEALS are attempting to get all three pirates in their sights before firing just seemed to take an age. So much so, that for me, it went past the point of creating tension, and bordered on creating boredom.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem for me is the hideous shaky camera work. Why oh why is this method of film-making still so popular? It's nothing more than nausea-inducing and adds absolutely nothing to the cinematic experience in my opinion. I can just about accept it during high-octane action sequences just as the beach landing in Saving Private Ryan, but when it's a shot of Tom Hanks standing on the bridge of a container ship on a calm day looking through some binoculars, why does the camera have to be swaying around the cameraman is try to play hide and seek? The shaky camera is a great way to ruin an otherwise reasonable movie.<br/><br/>In summary, it's an OK film for one viewing (provided you have a sick bag at the ready, should the camera work really get to you), but it's not something I plan to watch again. I'd give the story a 7/10, but the camera-work a 2/10. Overall 4/10. All in all, a bit over-rated."

Captain Phillips also miserably fails his attempts on shooting flares when the pirate boat is too far away, stopping at the second one, for no apparent reason. If you like unconvincing stories, this is truly a must see.<br/><br/>I rated this movie 5 stars because there are a few lines here and there, Hanks did his best with the movie and the ending actually made me feel something. I'd only recommend this movie if you've already seen everything above 5 stars."

And perplexed.<br/><br/>A ship containing millions, or more, worth of merchandise and is ""guarded"" by men with barely a hand gun, a few hoses and a walkie-talkie is just plain bad management. Probably things have changed with more and more pirate attacks, but I'm either too lazy or too uninterested to research that. All I know is what they showed me in thisincredibly dull take over film.<br/><br/>And why call the movie ""Captain Phillips?"" Is he supposed to be such an unbelievably deep and/or heroic person? Let's see what he did in this movie (this synopsis does contain some spoilers):<br/><br/>Captain Rich puts his crew on a drill. They get attacked. Cap manages to get them out of trouble. They're attacked, more successfully this time. Cap hides his men, gets kidnapped and needs some rescuin'.<br/><br/>Granted, some of that is pretty good. Amazing? No. I've seen more heroics from other ""based on a true stories"" and even some of those are just dramatic football films.<br/><br/>But, the scenery is good, the acting isn't great, but acceptable and it was a well-shot film. It just barely held my interest and always puzzled me throughout on why the film was called his name.<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: Sure, the lead pirate, Barkhad Abdi, received an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Role. Did he earn it? Hell no. He was so just mediocre in this, I think the Academy just didn't watch more than five movies this year so they had limited options. Oh, and incidentally, if he didn't shut that mouth, mine was going to open, but only to vomit. Damn, no one wants to see all your teeth and entire jaw!"

"JPfanatic93","8","1","3","15 December 2013"," The Pirates: Band of desperate folk
","2013 witnessed the release (in the Netherlands at least) of two very different films based on the exact same theme, ship hijacking (both reportedly based on true events, but not the same events). One was the excellent Danish production Kapringen which for a moment largely seemed to revolve on the reuniting of the cast and crew of Borgen but instead proved a psychological horror propelled by the sheer inadequacy of the ship's company to successfully negotiate terms with the Somali pirates for the release of the ship and its hostages. It kept the film devoid of true action for most of the film and caused the movie to keep its audience waiting endlessly for something to happen, which aptly illustrated the reality that such hostage situations usually result in a deadlock that leads to months of uncertainty for victims, perpetrators and families alike. And when all seemed resolved, Kapringen still ended on a shocking note of unexpected, needless violence to top the agony that came before. Paul Greengrass takes a whole different approach to hijacking in his more action packed yet equally chilling Captain Phillips, starring Tom Hanks as the titular character. Commanding a large freighter and sailing it around the Horn of Africa, Phillips too is confronted by armed marauders out for money by seizing commercial maritime traffic and privateering its personnel in exchange for cash. Whereas that other famous American Tom (whose last name also inspires the thought of boats, though that fun fact is totally irrelevant here) plays the occasional everyman and always fails miserably because of his star status, Hanks yet again proves up for said job despite his own famous persona and portrays a stern but decent regular working Joe, insightful as to his situation and not afraid to back down when his opponent bests him and assumes command of his vessel. The lives of his crew come first, his own by comparison he considers dispensable. Money is the brigands' objective, not mayhem for mayhem's sake, but there are no negotiations with the ship's company. While the situation grows ever more tense and a happy end seems less and less likely to transpire, Phillips plays an increasingly dangerous game of cat-and-mouse with his captors that seems only to be able to end in his own unfortunate demise.<br/><br/>Greengrass (of Bloody Sunday and Bourne fame, while also responsible for another factual hijacking of a wholly different kind with United 93) applies his signature hand-held 'shaky cam' style to great effect to get up close and personal with both Phillips and the bad guys (and to make spectators with poor stomachs seasick for sure) which delivers both visceral action and intense emotional drama. And though the movie ultimately proceeds into a fairly typical 'good guys versus bad guys' conflict, he inspires more than the slightest bit of sympathy for the perps, who are portrayed alarmingly accurate as people devoid of options. When you spend your life living in excruciating poverty in a rural area that supports no other means of employment or even food than the job of fisherman, and when western fisheries cut deals with your corrupt government to catch all your fish, what else is there to do than to go out to sea and commandeer foreign vessels in the hopes of ransoming their passengers? Somali pirates are desperate people who have no other means of sustaining themselves, Greengrass effectively reveals. The lead pirate, a skinny, intelligent young man (tremendously compelling performance by first time actor Barkhad Abdi, who commendably holds his own next to Hanks) is shown to be a man forced by circumstance to do things he needs to do to survive, but he definitely never enjoys doing them for a second. Both he and Phillips try to contain their crew from letting the explosive situation degenerate into bloodshed, something the pirate surprisingly succeeds in more so than Phillips does, as his crew attempts to regain control of their boat on multiple occasions without his say, further endangering all their lives. When the anti-piracy units of the American Navy arrive, the pirates are forced to make a quick exit in a lifeboat, and drag Phillips along with them as a human shield. It seems obvious that things can only end badly, but the movie delivers a forcibly happy end (of sorts) that does feel bitter for all present parties regardless. Captain Phillips is one-third action, one-third suspense and one-third human drama, but more straightforward in style (it's still Hollywood material after all) than its Danish predecessor, yet making for a fine companion piece to that film in showing a very different way these hostage negotiations tend to conclude."

","Captain Phillips took me by surprise. I'm not too much into these dramatic takes on real events, so I wasn't really looking forward to this film, to say the least. Sure, reading reviews, I'd seen that it had got some good wraps. That didn't make my anticipation for this film any greater.<br/><br/>Fortunately, when I did manage to see this film, I was quite surprised. The writing, acting, camera work, use of score all made this into a really incredible film.<br/><br/>The film is centered around the real life story of the hijacking of the American cargo ship, Maersk Alabama, by Somali pirates. We follow the ship's captain, Richard Phillips, an intelligent and quick thinking man, who has to protect his crew from the pirates, led by a man named Muse. <br/><br/>In terms of acting, Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi both stole the show. These two men gave performances of a lifetime within Captain Phillips. Hanks is a real, average man here, and whilst watching him, all you see is his character Captain Phillips, and not Hanks himself. He transforms himself into this man, and pulls this performance off perfectly. Abdi is equally as good, if not better. He's menacing in his role as the Somali pirate's leader, yet still human. You can't necessarily look at this man and call him the bad guy, because in reality, he has perfectly legitimate reasons for doing what he's doing.<br/><br/>The writing here, like what I just touched on, doesn't allow for characters to be simply black and white. There are no good or bad guys here, all we have are perspectives. This is something not so commonly seen in film nowadays, and I'm happy to see it. The script on the whole is masterfully constructed, and allows for good pacing, which makes this an enjoyable ride. <br/><br/>One of the faults I had with this film was the camera work. Whilst there are some amazing shots of the ship and some incredible takes with Hanks and his captors, there are also shots which feel a little too chaotic, a little too shaky. At times, it feels as if Greengrass is shaking the cam simply to remind us that Phillips is still in a state of peril, and we're still in an unpredictable circumstance! These shots are few and far between, luckily, and for the most part, I enjoyed the direction and cinematography.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips has it's faults, but for the most part, this film is brilliantly crafted, though not for the faint of heart. It's powerful, emotional and full of real characters, all who are complex and interesting to watch on screen. Certainly a recommendation. <br/><br/>9/10"

","I don't write many reviews, though I watch a lot of movies (working in the movie industry for the last 2 decades). I like to think I know a good movie when I see one. Sometimes I like to go to the back end of IMDb reviewers and read what the haters have to say. I will confess I am often amazed (and somewhat irritated)at what some people have to say about movies they don't like. They whinge and whine about the reasons why they don't like a movie, as if the film was made as a direct personal insult to them and them alone. So you didn't like Captain Phillips. Fair enough! But to claim that NOBODY should watch this movie because YOU didn't like it (you know who you are), in my humble opinion, is ridiculous and selfish. Out of 7 billion potential viewers globally, you are only 1. I like to watch each movie as if it is a stand alone feature. I try not to make comparisons to other movies of the actor/directors/genre etc have made, and then I ask myself a series of questions. Did I enjoy that? Did it evoke the appropriate emotional response? Would I watch it again? For Captain Philips the answer to all those questions (for me) is YES! YES! and absolutely YES!!! I thought Captain Philips to be a trilling true/story DRAMA. I personally have no issues with the shaky cam style of filming. For me it just adds to the realism. I thought the acting was great (kudos to the casting team), and FOR ME I found the tension throughout to build to a very satisfying conclusion, re Captain Phillips' eventual release. So in summary, I thoroughly enjoyed Captain Phillips and I would absolutely recommend it to other people. So to all you haters of Captain Phillips, or any other movies for that matter, just chill out! When did the point of ENTERTAINMENT become so personal. So you didn't like this movie. So be it. You have every right to express that opinion, however I feel it is unfair to try to influence other peoples choices with your staunch and negative opinions is just unfair. Even some of the stinker movies that I have watched (and there has been a few), I always try to pick out something good about it. If I don't like it, I will cut my losses and just never watch it again. Simple as that! <br/><br/>Captain Phillips IS JUST A MOVIE!!!!!! and a damn good one as far as I'm concerned!"

It doesn't try to whitewash the captain ignoring warnings. And the Somalis get as much screen time as anybody else. The leader is played by Barkhad Abdi who does a forceful job. He's more than a match for Tom Hanks. When he says ""I've come too far. I can't give up."", you can see his desperation. The movie is more than docudrama. It is a big time thriller."

","Tom Hanks gives an economical, terse performance in Paul Greengrass's dramatization of a true story about a cargo ship whose captain is taken hostage by a group of Somali pirates.<br/><br/>""Captain Phillips"" did not have the nail biting punch to my gut that Greengrass's excellent ""United 93"" did, but that might be due to the fact that I didn't have as much invested in this story. The adjective terse applies to more than Hanks's performance -- Greengrass is an expert at cutting out any superfluous information and laser focusing his film on the events at hand. The film is refreshingly free of the usual action movie heroics; Hanks is a regular guy who has some training in how to deal with a pirate situation but who's never really been tested until one such situation actually arises. Nothing brings this point home more than the film's concluding scenes, during which Hanks, who has held up stoically through his ordeal, completely breaks down the way any of us would. This emotional punch makes what would otherwise have been a good action movie a really good one.<br/><br/>There's something almost tragic about how misguided the pirates are in thinking that the United States would ever consider bargaining with them. Phillips the character and we the audience know that Phillips' life is expendable in a worst case scenario, and that knowledge adds an element of suspense to the already tense situation.<br/><br/>I didn't respond as warmly to the film as so many others seem to have. I thought it was perfectly fine while watching it, some scenes were excellent, but little of it was memorable.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"Laakbaar","9","1","3","24 November 2013"," Gripping, realistic drama on the high seas
","I was reluctant to go to this film. But ""Captain Phillips"" turned out not to have the plot I thought it would, and it also turned out to be a lot better than I thought it would be. I've enjoyed director Paul Greengrass's movies in the past, but this smart, modern movie is his best so far.<br/><br/>I suppose it added to my enjoyment that I really had no idea how it would end. The key moment that launched the second half of the movie shocked me. I felt a lot of anger towards Phillips at that moment for being so stupid.<br/><br/>I don't think Greengrass could have portrayed the Somali pirates more accurately. He brings these people to life for the film-goer. I wouldn't say that he portrays them sympathetically, but he definitely humanizes them. Nothing is black and white.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie is almost a propaganda film for the US military, but it worked for me completely. I'm a little tired of films that make the American military look like boobs or monsters. Some say the second half dragged on too long, but many of us have lost our sense of dramatic pacing and tension because of video games, the internet, and a diet of city-crunching superhero and robot movies. The pacing and tension in the scenes in the lifeboat were necessary for the climax.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is good in this film as a competent captain and ordinary guy, but his performance as a shocked victim at the end was quite moving. All the Somali actors also deserve recognition.<br/><br/>A highly recommend film."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","1","3","24 November 2013"," Very tense and atmospheric thriller with two great performances
","""Captain Phillips"" kept me on the edge of my seat for the majority of the film's 2 hours and 15 minutes. My favorite sequences were the chase sequences early on with the crew realizing the situation and the pirates trying to enter the ship and finally all the scenes in the capsule for the most part of the second half. The confrontations between the pirates and the crew when they finally entered the ship were okay too, but not as good as the parts surrounding them. The parts near the end create a truly memorable claustrophobic setting. The heart and soul of the film is Tom Hanks' performance. After his big rise to glory with ""Philadelphia"" and ""Forrest Gump"" back in the 90s, the years between 2000 and 2010 didn't look too great for him. However, I already thought he gave one of the best male lead performances in ""Cloud Atlas"" last year and he certainly confirms his sort-of comeback with ""Captain Phillips"". His acting is always appropriate to the situation his character is in and only very rarely over the top and even then it's more due to the script than his approach. Finally, as the film nears the end and Phillips is rescued, Hanks has his showy big moment when his tough facade quickly starts to crumble in the moving final sequence. These often make or break a movie and here it's definitely one of the highlights. Good job from director Paul Greengrass, who continues to have a near-perfect body of work.<br/><br/>Hanks gets some great support as well, especially by one man: Barkhad Abdi, who plays the main antagonist and leader of the pirate group that enters Phillips' ship. It's really a ""from zero to hero""-performance as Abdi had absolutely no experience in acting before at all. Not only hasn't he been in any other movies, he also never went to acting school. And yet, he's able to hold his own against one of the greatest actors Hollywood has these days. Impressive and I believe he's rightfully in contention for a supporting actor spot at the Oscars this year. And even if he comes short, this will hopefully be the start to a good career. Black actors are still struggling these days in Hollywood, but he brings all the talent to the table to be successful.<br/><br/>Usually I am not too big on war-related films (I didn't like ""Black Hawk Down"" and only liked ""The Hurt Locker"" a bit) and you could see this as one in the broader sense probably, but if the atmosphere is created so hauntingly also with focus on the character's psychological situation and with lots of tension, I'm all in. Another thing done very well here was the way the captors tell about their background as fishermen to Phillips and how they, in their country, don't really have another option unlike people in the US. Does it justify their actions? Obviously not. But it makes the audience at least feel a bit sorry for them and this is again mainly thanks to Abdi's excellent work in that particular scene. I personally knew vaguely about the circumstances of the Phillips case a couple years ago and that was maybe the perfect approach. I didn't know nothing, so it had been difficult to really connect with the story, but I also didn't know about it in detail which could have hurt if I had subconsciously compared the accuracy of the film towards the actual happenings. Then again, only Phillips himself knows about most of what really happened there and I hope it truly was the way he wrote it and that he didn't add too much for dramatic purposes.<br/><br/>""Captain Phillips"" is one of the best thrillers of the year and especially recommended because of the ""really happened"" factor. Also many not too well informed people may think piracy is a crime long gone and these should watch this film especially. It's by no means a perfect movie, unfortunately here and there it also has the over-the-top patriotic and self-sacrificing approach that many films of the genre have, like when Philipps screams to the captors to kill him and not the crew member that is about to get a bullet to the head, but it's bearable and just a minor flaw that doesn't hurt the overall excellent quality of this movie. Not in the slightest."

","Does anyone remember Dragnet, Big, Turner & Hooch, Splash, The 'Burbs??? All the silly but great movies I used to watch Tom Hanks in as a kid. That's who he was in the 80s, a comedy actor, doing quirky light-hearted movies. I guess there's no way we'll be seeing a sequel to the awesome Dragnet with him now being a celebrated thespian and all.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the lines of Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan (1998), his career shifted gear and he's been producing acting powerhouses pretty much ever since. We can't really complain when they come as good as Captain Phillips.<br/><br/>I'm not going to do a comparison of the movie and what happened in real life, there are plenty of other sites out there doing that. All I can say is that this is an excellent movie with enough reality and Hollywood magic to keep any movie fan happy. <br/><br/>The story sounds almost like a sequel to Under Siege but thankfully there is no Steven Seagal anywhere in sight.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) is tasked with guiding the cargo ship MV Maersk Alabama to Mombasa around the horn of Africa, a known pirate hotspot. It soon becomes clear that Phillips was right to be apprehensive. Despite their best efforts, the ship is attacked and boarded by a band of Somali pirates. <br/><br/>Although the pirates are few in number, they are armed and deadly, intent on getting a large payout. Under the expert guidance of Captain Phillips, the crew hide in the ship's engine room but things take a turn for the worst when Phillips himself is taken hostage in the ship's lifeboat.<br/><br/>The Navy as well as a SEAL team are soon in pursuit but whether they can save Captain Phillips or not is a different matter altogether.<br/><br/>This is another excellent movie and is easily up there with the likes of Gravity as one of the best movies I've seen this year. <br/><br/>It's damn tense with Hanks turning in yet another outstanding performance which really has to be seen. It's testament to his skill as an actor and dedication to his craft. The research he did into the character obviously payed off big time. This of course would be nothing if not for the great performances of his supporting cast, including Barkhad Abdi as the leader of the pirates and of course expert direction from Paul Greengrass who ensures that the action is tight and on point. Thankfully, there's no shaky-cam rubbish here for which Greengrass was previously infamous for.<br/><br/>There are no lulls, no laggy moments, just a tense, emotion and heart driven thrill ride from start to finish. It makes you appreciate your loved ones and value the time you have with them, much in the same way Gravity did for me.<br/><br/>People complain about the US meddling in other peoples affairs, acting like they are the police of the world, but for what it's worth, when crap like this goes down, I'm glad they're out there trying, not always succeeding, but still trying to do the right thing. When the Navy and SEAL team arrive on the scene, even though I'm not American, I felt grateful that there is someone that can come to the rescue when stuff like this happens. <br/><br/>I've been intentionally vague about the story to avoid spoiling the experience for you, but let there be no doubt, this really is a great film which I highly recommend to everyone.<br/><br/>Don't expect Under Siege 3, or your typical one-man-army action hero type flick.

The staging was brilliant and the acting by those portraying the Somalis was an eye-opener...the scenes in the lifeboat were harrowing (maybe a bit too drawn out insofar as the film was concerned) but the movie certainly showed how Americans rightly protect their own.

","""I am the Captain now."" A statement continuously reiterated throughout the film, Captain Phillips. Based on the book, A Captains Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy Seals, and Dangerous Days at Sea, the film Captain Phillips exemplifies a thrilling, unbelievable, and incredible story about a man and his crews overwhelming journey in the Somali basin. Played by the talented Tom Hanks, Captain Phillips begins with an intimate insight into the daily routine life of Richard Phillips, and it is only there that the film truly begins. After reporting onto the Maersk Alabama, Phillips prepares to deliver 17,000 metric tons of cargo to Mombasa, Kenya, in which he must pass through the pirated waters of the Somali Basin. There is a sensation of alarming calmness in the beginning of the film as Phillips receives emails concerning piracy, considers them, but quickly shoves those concerns to the side, as if these warnings could be an omen to the hijacking of Phillips ship. The events that consequently transpire are overwhelming and will leave you in a trance-like state as you are on the edge of your seat waiting to see who will falter and who will triumph. It is during a routine ship emergency drill, that Phillips sporadically assigns his crew, when he realizes two skiffs with armed men heading towards his ship. The drill then transforms into a reality, in which Phillips and his crew do everything in their power to steer the skiffs away. Being an unarmed ship they unfortunately fail and 4 armed Somalia pirates board the Maersk Alabama. What was once an outing to the movies, transforms into a sheer reality as director Paul Greengrass and cinematagraphor Barry Ackroyd are able to create a feeling of being on the actual ship with Phillips, his crew, and the pirates. Immediately you will be drawn into the film and overcome with imminent fear as exemplified within all characters of the film. Faking the appearance of a 'broken ship' the pirates are overcome with anger when the safe only holds $30,000 and no way of maneuvering the vessel to the Somali shore. Muse, the leader of the pirates demands to see the engine room and after obstacles he and his pirates face, they demand to leave the ship with the life boat, but not without Phillips. It is within this part of the movie you see the heart wrenching sadness and fear exhibited within Phillips as he sits in seat 15 stuck in a tiny vessel in the middle of the sea with four armed pirates heading to Somalia. Fortunately for Phillips the Navy and SEAL TEAM six track the small lifeboat and are able to strike a sort of deal with the pirates. Throughout the film Phillips appears to be calm and composed, consistently offering the pirates advice, food, water, and even medical assistance. He attempts to establish a friendly and working relationship with the pirates in hopes that he will be able to return home to his wife and children. In the event that he cannot, he writes his last words on a crumpled piece of paper, that paper in which never reaches his family. During this final portion of the film, you will be overcome with a sense of hope for Phillips' survival but also a small sense of sadness for Muse's failed negotiation tactics. Captain Phillips is truly ""an edge of your seat"" thriller, will leave you with tears at the end, and leave you with a fulfilling understanding of what it truly means to be a captain. If you are looking for a thriller, a film that captures the unique dynamic between the 'good guys' and 'bad guys' then I would strongly suggest going to the movies to see Captain Phillips. Out of five stars, I would most definitely give the film four stars for its talented known and new actors, unique cinematography, and an unbelievable feeling of reality."

Pirates come and take the captain as hostage. Eventually he is stuck on a life boat with the pirates and the captain just wants to see his family again. Luckily the navy comes but they don't want to hurt Captain Phillips so they try to trick the pirates. The movie is very intense and I was on edge the whole time. The main characters in the movie are Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks), Muse (Barkhad Abdi), Bilal (BArkhad Abdirahman), Najee (Faysal Ahmen), and Elmi Mahat M. Ali). My favorite character in this movie is Captain Phillips because he is really nice and he would rather sacrifice his own life for his crew. That shows how much he cares about other people. It really made me think about what I would do in this type of situation.<br/><br/>My favorite part in the movie is when they capture the captain because that's when the action really starts. It's not good that he gets captured but you see a lot of action after that. You see the navy show up, you hear threats from the pirates, you see helicopters in the air. Everything goes crazy! But that's what I love about these kinds of movies.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for ages 12 and up because this movie is really scary and has a lot of violence and parts that are bloody.

Captain Phillips has a great real life story of Somali Pirates who take over a ship. There is character development and a great pace in the story. I am sure there is over exaggerations, and omissions for drama and time constraints reasons. What inhibits Captain Phillips' story is the strong acting by Tom hanks.

","see the movie, on it's own terms, most excellent, does it matter that important aspects of the actual events are, at the very least, heavily disputed? - not in regard to the movie itself, the politics of the movie were not awful, more reportorial than anything, unlike ""zero dark thirty"" that claimed it was based on true events but then made up torture sequences that seemed to produce useful information (there is no proof of this). The interactions of the actors was intense, believable and dramatic. And my sense of Captain Phillips, as portrayed by Hanks was not obviously righteous, heroic or commanding, a nuanced role and good on Hanks who I often find cloying and silly. His Captain Phillips seemed to be stubborn for the sake of being stubborn, it wasn't clear what his actions were in service to frankly, pissing off the pirates, etc and apparently, according to the actual crew, this destructive stubbornness was an a major character issue/flaw, and Hanks kind of nailed it. I actually was more interested in how this played out for the pirates. Think of what they were doing, although in service to illegal activity, it was definitionally heroic, desperate and doomed as they were eventually surrounded by the US Navy. They were effectively put into a laboratory situation where it was only a matter of time. This sense of doom made the whole affair profoundly sad. Which made the movie very powerful, probably in ways that were not really intended. The Somalis often live in desperate conditions in a country without an effective government and with few ways to actually support themselves, the references to fishing were accurate as the whole piracy thing first started as Somalis tried to protect their fishing grounds from invasive fishing by other countries. Further, the cost of the US operation (which has done NOTHING to stem piracy in the area) probably cost far more than any ransom demanded. Given this background, the movie brings up huge issues regarding rich and poor nations, resource use, etc and how this inequality results, necessarily in violence, both the passive violence of poverty and the active violence of kinetic weapons. A similar movie in some aspects, although less subtle, ""black hawk down"" was also profoundly sad, notwithstanding the cartoonish gunning down of ""dark people"" by the hundreds by the hamfisted, well armed but ultimately doomed US troops. From the point of view of the movie and the actual events, well, that's showbiz, the real Captain Phillips probably was even less heroic than shown in the movie, the anti-labor scene in service to awful anti-communitarian/labor positions so rampant in the US, and no mention of the 50 million dollar lawsuit against the shipping company by 11 of the crew, a lawsuit speaking directly to Phillips incompetent and grossly endangering behavior. Again, a really good movie, just like ""a beautiful mind"" which also got major facts wrong, like the fact that the major character was gay, that he divorced his wife, etc. Unfortunately, movies stand in for history, no matter how inaccurate they are."

","Without a shadow of a doubt Paul Greengrass's take on the true story of Captain Phillips and his horrific ordeal is as fully formed and well constructed a tale as you'd ever get on film, and acts as one of the most tense and atmospheric thrillers of the year. It must be said though that the true life tale acts as a limited source material for a silver screen adaptation therefore limiting the praise that can be heaped upon it.<br/><br/>When one talks about praise concerning Captain Phillips all due comeuppance must be paid to the aforementioned Greengrass who again proves with this film that he is a true auteur at creating and constructing taut thrillers, this is even more evident in the truly flawless and heart pounding United 93. The other form of praise must go to the welcomely back in form Tom Hanks who delivers a performance that reminds us as to why he was at one stage one of the worlds most powerful and believable actors, scenes towards the films end with Hanks particularly displaying a rare on screen breakdown that many actors could only dream of. Hanks award-deserving turn is matched by Barkhad Abdi as lead Somalian pirate Muse. Abdi's turn is filled with raw and unnerving intensity and acts as a great example of natural acting talent. The material these actors and director work with here however allows for a gut wrenching first hour and a much less effective last act.<br/><br/>The way the story of this abduction unfolds as per real life events is a blistering white knuckle affair that is portrayed so well here in the film that the standard set can not last when the ordeal ventures into the small surrounds of the ships life boat, where the pirates plus Captain Phillips make there way to land and hopefully to a bounty that will suffice their criminal needs. This necessarily drawn out act of the film has some unquestionably lull scenes and one feels with a shortened length the films ability to race the heart would of been significantly sustained.<br/><br/>Greengrass' film is virtually a technically flawless constructed movie with equally matched acting ability from all involved from main players through to bit players. Despite it's filmattic limitations due to subject matter, Captain Phillips is well worth seeking out and hopefully a stepping stone for Tom Hanks to get back to quality roles he was once so renowned for.<br/><br/>4 water cannons out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","1","3","3 November 2013"," More interesting from the pirate's perspective...
","Paul Greengrass seems to live in his hectic shakycam aesthetic. With dull hues of blues and browns, he likes muddy stories of self-preservation and perseverance and tries his best not to sugarcoat the feeling with his style. While the inevitable tragedy of United 93 was more compelling and free to dodge developing characters, Captain Phillips does not have that luxury as it puts its ending on the poster. Argo has the same problem. We know how it ends yet the journey offers us no particular insight into a debate or a way of life that leads me to be bewildered at how anyone can possibly find these films exciting or tense. Tom Hanks has been receiving raves for his performance which is being called worthy of a comeback. He was good, especially in his hyped final 10 minutes, but I do feel as though he was underwritten. Hanks has always been notable for his portrayal of the ordinary man and here in Captain Phillips he's able to shed off his star persona and take on that role once more. But I don't think that's enough.<br/><br/>Sometimes I feel like perhaps the writers did too much of a good job of making Phillips unsympathetic and the main antagonist pirate Muse, played admirably by Barkhad Abdi, sympathetic. In fact, its approach to the story feels so routine and uninvolving that I found myself more compelled by the idea of looking at it through the opposite perspective. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Phillips was a villainous character, you can look at any film through the eyes of its bad guy and call Indiana Jones the villain, but that doesn't make it a more interesting film. Captain Phillips is an exception as Muse's hypothetical 'hero's journey' hits fascinating story beats as Phillips constantly gets in his way through lies, manipulation and betrayal. Not that Muse's desire is justified, but his escape from his home certainly is. And in traditional Greengrass sense he gets the ironic tragic end. But then this perspective is more of an add-on if anything and not a deliberate alternative.<br/><br/>Even so, Muse's henchmen are definitely bad and Phillips' crew are definitely good, and that's Hollywood's way of making the roles clear. It's just incredibly difficult to invest myself in Phillips' survival due to his behaviour and knowing how it ends. The only heroic act I found was protecting his crew, which he did, for a little while, then the film separates itself from that tension. In the second half, it just feels like military propaganda in the navy's near-perfect execution of a rescue mission. Fact or not, but this is the sugarcoating I know Greengrass doesn't want. Perfection is boring, flaws and obstacles would be more interesting. Muse has all the impossible-seeming obstacles. As usual, the technical aspects are reliably great, perhaps Greengrass' finest use of his shakycam which has had to grow on me over the years, but unfortunately they facilitate a bland film, redeemed slightly by its 'villain.' Really hope this doesn't end up as overpraised in awards as it already is.<br/><br/>6/10"

","This is another probable win for Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>Most important, the character Muse seem too rehearsed. He actually looks like Chris Rock.<br/><br/>The only thing the movie doesn't need are the shaky camera shots.<br/><br/>What's with that Hollywood? <br/><br/>When you have a star like Tom Hanks play the lead, you don't need these shaky camera angles to prove the movie is authentic and worth watching.<br/><br/>I hope directors would realize this. Besides, the audience would most likely appreciate conventional strategies to shoot a very believable film like this."
"ccamp89","6","1","3","2 November 2013"," Solid, but not exceptional.
","Relatively solid thriller. Manages to successfully keep the tension high for most of its (unnecessary) length. Nothing really to write home about though honestly. The performances are quite solid across the board but I didn't find them as compelling as a lot of critics seemed to. The biggest success of the movie is the portrayal of the pirate characters - they're actually (for the most part) pretty nuanced and there is noticeable effort to flesh them out. You really find yourself sympathizing with them at certain points, which is a definite accomplishment and adds some depth to the movie. This isn't essential viewing but if you decide to spend two hours with it you'll most likely walk away satisfied."

","I'm a huge Tom Hanks fan. I've watched his best movies like Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Saving Private Ryan, The Green Mile etc. but this is the best movie he has done so far in the last 12 years.<br/><br/>Based on the true experiences of Captain Richard Phillips, this is a story set in 2009 when Somali pirates were a threat to the Indian Ocean and anyone in these waters. Captain Richard Phillips is transporting cargo of supplies to needy people in Kenya when his ship is hijacked by Somali Pirates who demand millions of Dollars. This is the story of survival for the ship's crew and it's captain.<br/><br/>Brilliant acting from a brilliant actor as Tom Hanks gives one of the performances of his career in this incredible story. The acting was tremendous from the rest of the cast especially the Somalian Pirates who have never acted before in their lives and yet gave the performances of professional actors as these four actors Barkhad Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed and Mahat M. Ali who apparently were just locals who had never acted before.<br/><br/>I have only given a 10/10 to four other movies; The Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, Fight Club and The Silence of the Lambs and this is my fifth, it's that good. <br/><br/>With brilliant visual effects and a budget of $55 million this is one of the best movies I've seen in years that even had some people in tears in the cinema. I think that this will be up for a couple of Academy Awards at the ceremony next March because Tom Hanks was simply brilliant and this film has a lot about it that is worth admiring.<br/><br/>This is a true story. After the whole ordeal Captain Richard Phillips was back at sea doing his duties a year after and the leader of the Somali Pirates group leader was trialed in America and sentenced to 33 years in a Correctional Facility in Virginia.<br/><br/>Overall this is definitely the best film I've seen this year and possibly in the last few years with brilliant acting from experience and non- experienced with an ending that is worth waiting for as you pray Captain Phillips' survival. Trust me, anyone watching this movie will be praying for Captain Phillips safety as he is one of those characters you get attached to from the start of the movie.<br/><br/>A must watch for EVERYONE!"
"Anurag-Shetty","8","1","3","27 October 2013"," The most thrilling biopic of all time!
","Captain Phillips is a true story about Captain Richard Phillips(Tom Hanks), whose ship, the Maersk Alabama, gets hijacked by a group of Somalian pirates consisting of Muse(Barkhad Abdi), Bilal(Barkhad Abdiraman), Najee(Faysal Ahmed) & Elmi(Mahat M. Ali). Now, it is up to Captain Phillips & his crew consisting of co-captain, Shane Murphy(Michael Chernus), Mike Perry(David Warshofsky) & the others to rescue themselves & stop the pirates from stealing the goods & money from the ship, at any cost. <br/><br/>This movie had me on the edge of my seat, almost all the time. The first fifteen or twenty minutes of the movie may feel a little dragging however, the movie gets extremely engaging soon enough. What's even more interesting about this film is that, it's based on a true story. It sends shivers down my spine thinking, that Richard Phillips actually went through what he went through in the film. Almost the entire film takes place on water. That doesn't mean that we should compare it to Life of Pi(2012) or Titanic(1997). This movie has a completely different genre & there is no need for unnecessary comparisons even though, Titanic is based on a true story as well. The action is subtle & not too gory or graphic. Your heart actually goes out to the crew of the Maersk Alabama, because they go through such a horrifying experience. The performances, especially by the newcomers is what makes the film. Tom Hanks gives a solid performance as Captain Richard Phillips. Barkhad Abdi is mind blowing as the main antagonist, Muse. Barkhad Abdiraman is great as Bilal. Faysal Ahmed is impressive as Najee. Mahat Ali is spectacular as Elmi. Micheal Chernus is effective as Shane Murphy. Catherine Keener is fantastic as Andrea Phillips. David Warshofsky is adequate as Mike Perry. The supporting actors are good too. Captain Phillips is worth a watch. If you're a fan of Tom Hanks then, it's a must watch!"
"DexIMF","8","1","3","26 October 2013"," These waters run pretty deep.
","""It's gonna be alright, Irish.""<br/><br/>That's what the leader of a frightening gang of Somali Pirates, Muse, keeps telling the Captain of the ship he's just hijacked, when in fact, it's his own need to keep hearing those optimistic words, again and again. He's a man, one of the many, who is doing things he does because he doesn't have any other way around it. There is no time to question morals for him, and yet he is still miles away from what you may call an amoral human-being. ""We are not going to hurt you. We are not Al-Qaeda."" , he keeps reminding.<br/><br/>As these pirates have boarded the ship and captured Captain Phillips on gunpoint, one of them asks about the ship's nationality. ""It's an American ship."" , replies the Captain. One of the pirates shouts gleefully, ""America! Yes!"" There are such subtle snark and commentaries throughout the film which makes it much more than an average thriller. At a certain point in the film, as Captain Phillips and Muse are building an empathy for each other, it transcends into one of those Michael Mann-esque moments where there is no individual sense hero or villain, just two guys, on very opposite sides, finding much more in common between themselves than they might have thought earlier. ""We've all got bosses.""<br/><br/>Tom Hanks could not have had better opportunity to show the subtlety of his performance than the arc of the titular character in this film. He embodies and introduces us to the character as a confident, alert and pragmatic guy, but as the things get more dreary, you can sense the breakdown and hopelessness on his face. I wonder about the sequence of shooting the final scene with Tom Hanks. It feels perfectly natural collections of emotions the character goes through after all the actions that went before. It also marks as one of the best moments in the actor's career.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass has developed a certain flavor of hand-held cameras in his films. I guess it's one of the things he has kept from his experience with Documentaries. It does help in creating a sense of realism in the film, but ultimately it was because of bravura performances and intensity of the screenplay which got me absorbed in the film than the Documentary aesthetic.<br/><br/>The film's editing is jarring and urgent just like all of the director's films, but it needs a certain clarity and grace. The film's weak moments are those when we are broken from Captain's or Muse's perspectives. While I can understand the need of keeping the story in clarity about the rescue operation, it's cringe-worthy when these scenes are presented in stylization that reminded me of Bourne films. In a way, it takes the realism away. For some moments, anyway.<br/><br/>What starts as a slam-bang action thriller about a hijacking situation turns subtly into the play of ambiguous duality and parallels with relevant political undertones. It asks the questions it should ask, but also never taking one side or turn preachy on audience. It's one of those films that take more depth in post-contemplation than during watching the film itself."
"parallel_projection","8","1","3","26 October 2013"," A pulsing, slow-burning, and emotional thriller
","Captain Phillips, which came into theaters on Oct. 11, tells the true story of the eponymous captain whose cargo ship was hijacked by Somali pirates masquerading as fishermen back in 2009. Directed by Paul Greengrass, it starts off rather slow, taking a while to give all the background information and set up the story. Once it gets going, though, the film turns into an intense rescue mission and moral quandary that is impossible to turn away from.<br/><br/>Greengrass does a fine job at directing, but his hand-held camera-work is incredibly shaky and at times nauseating. That being said, almost the entire film takes place on the ocean, so the direction does do a fantastic job at immersing the viewer further into the situation at sea.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, who stars as the titular character, gives his best performance in over ten years. He portrays Phillips as an average, slightly arrogant man thrust into a highly unusual and stressful situation. Phillips—who the pirates nickname ""Irish"" due to his heritage—is never directly referred to as a hero. Rather, the lengths he goes through to keep his crew safe are presented as completely natural, and are not particularly highlighted within the film. <br/><br/>Throughout the entire film, you can literally see the fear in Hanks's eyes—this isn't acting, this is more than that. While terribly afraid of the pirates who take him for ransom, he definitely feels sorry for them, and goes to lengths to help them settle the situation calmly. At one point in the film the film, Phillips asks the pirate leader, Muse, ""There's got to be something other than being a fisherman or kidnapping people."" To that, Muse replies, ""Maybe in America, Irish, maybe in America.""<br/><br/>Moments like this present the pirates as actual people, simply doing their jobs and trying to bring money back to their villages and leaders. Barkhad Abdi, who portrays Muse, comes out of nowhere to give the standout performance of the film. He holds his own against Hanks the entire time, and while he certainly makes Muse into the villain of the film, it's clear that he really has no choice but to occupy this position. He gave empathy to a character that could have turned out be just another stereotypical villain, but instead was elevated to a complex, desperate human being.<br/><br/>Both actors are definitely in serious contention to snag an Oscar nomination come January, and I suspect the film will get a few more as well. I'd also like to point out the brilliance of Henry Jackman's score, which serves as an intense, pulsing backdrop for the action that takes place on screen. <br/><br/>Overall, while 'Captain Phillips' takes a while to get going, the wait is well worth it. The film turns into a complex moral thriller that, despite potentially knowing the ending due to the fact that it is based on a true story, remains very intense throughout."
"devonblank","10","1","3","26 October 2013"," Increased respect for actor already at the top
","I came into the film having only seen Hanks in the Toy Story series and Forrest Gump (you could say I'm sheltered when it comes to watching films). My respect goes even further for Tom Hanks after watching this film considering that Forrest Gump is my favourite of all time.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is thrilling, emotive and leaves you gripping the seat as if on a boat on the cusp of a wave. Hanks is exposed to give a very 'naked' performance - the camera is nearly always in his face and in saying that this film certainly isn't for the faint-hearted. The Somali pirates recruited for the film were particularly impressive given their limited (if any) acting experience, as well as the music which, if repetitive at times, added to the tension. <br/><br/>I urge you to watch this film as it will almost certainly be either your favourite Tom Hanks film or your film of the year. I would also recommend being in close proximity to a bar as a stiff drink will be required to wind down."

The last scenes of the movie are simply breathtaking, and the most wonderful thing of it is the transparency of each character's emotions, and the mix that there is.<br/><br/>And it is still in this last scene where you can actually see the timeless acting from Tom Hanks! His versatility to play out very distinct, but huge rolls is incredible. Whether it is from Andrew Becket to Forrest Gump, or Captain Miller.<br/><br/>It is a fact that he does appear a lot on the screen, but that's just all about the relevance of the character... The movie is about the experience in first hand of the Captain, so no wonder that he's the one that ends up showing his face more often on the screen. If something like that would happen in real life, I would believe that that was how it went down.<br/><br/>Besides being a great story, the problematic that it addresses is still recent, and well portrayed and ends up getting in touch with a reality that it is not that known to much of the audience.<br/><br/>In the end, I would advise you to go watch it on the cinema if you can. Even if you're not, I would recommend you to watch wherever you can! It is smart, well-written, with an amazing acting (not only from Tom Hanks, but from the Somali Pirates as well) and a very recent and interesting theme."
"thefadingcam","6","1","3","25 October 2013"," A very competent thriller with a great lead
","Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips is an effective commercial thriller with a great lead by Tom Hanks. The movie tells the ""true"" story of a US ship that was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009, and its captain who gives the movie its name. Being this story true or not, manipulated for Hollywood or not, Captain Phillips works as a movie, even if it is nowhere near the Bourne series. The way Greengrass works his limited set is very good, and he proves once again that he is one of the few masters of the shaky camera technique. If you are looking for a well directed, entertaining and legitimately suspenseful thrill, this is definitely the movie for you, but certainly nothing more than that. Don't try to see meanings where they don't exist. Globalization, poor/rich culture dichotomies? Maybe, but is it relevant? Haven't we seen all that hundreds of times before, and better?

"Hellmant","8","1","3","18 October 2013"," An impressive film with many flaws.
","'CAPTAIN PHILLIPS': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass's Oscar hopeful based on the Maersk Alabama hijacking of 2009, which was the first American cargo ship hijacked in 200 years. It's told from the point of view of the ship's captain, Richard Phillips, and based on his book 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea'. The events of the story have been greatly contradicted and detested by Phillips' crew, creating a controversy around the film. I doubt the movie is a truthful telling of what actually happened in any way but it's still a good film. Greengrass's direction is once again masterful and the script by, Billy Ray (who's also co-written films like 'THE HUNGER GAMES', 'FLIGHTPLAN', 'HART'S WAR' and 'BREACH', which he also directed), is intense and involving. The film is too long and drawn-out and filled with Hollywood clichés but it builds to a breathtaking conclusion and Tom Hanks, as the title character, gives one of the best performances of the year (and his career).<br/><br/>The film takes place in April 2009, off the coast of Somalia, onboard a container ship called MV Maersk Alabama. We first meet it's captain, Richard Phillips (Hanks), as he's driving to his ship, in America, with his wife Andrea Phillips (Catherine Kenner). We know little about him other than he's worried about how current times have gotten much tougher for younger generations. We next see him at sea with his crew as he prepares for the worst and is then attacked by Somali pirates. They're led by a skinny young Somali named Muse (newcomer Barkhad Abdi). We also meet Muse at home, first, where he's barely surviving (like everyone in his community) and is forced into piracy. Phillips is able to ward off Muse and his men momentarily but they later board his ship and terrorize his crew. The captain does his best to protect his men and get the pirates off his ship.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips' crew say they were highly offended by the film and that it was ""just horrendous"" to see a Hollywood movie depicting the arrogant and reckless Phillips, that jeopardized their lives to save time and money, as some kind of a hero. He was actually anything but and received several e-mails warning him of the piracy in the area but kept them from his crew and went off-course anyway (into pirate areas, despite his crew's cries not to). I usually don't have a problem with filmmakers taking creative license, and changing source material or true events, but in this case I do think it was distasteful. To make a film about a seemingly immoral man, who put his crew into such a torturous life-threatening situation and present him as a hero is morally wrong and offensive to the people involved. Just judging the film as a fictional movie though, and not based on any real people or true events, I do think it was a well made film. Flawed in pacing but strikingly moving in character development and, like I said, the ending is amazing. Hanks is truly astonishing and the film does do a good job of depicting the Somali pirates in a sympathetic way and showing how they were forced into a horrible situation they couldn't get out of (just like a lot of us). The filmmakers also casted inexperienced Somali actors in the pirate roles (through a worldwide casting search) and they were all good and convincing in the film (especially Abdi). The movie is an impressive film with many flaws, and can be seen as offensive, but it's still worth the watch in my opinion. It probably doesn't deserve all the Oscar hype (or future award recognition) though. Except for Hanks.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4"

","The film from Paul Greengrass, who is known for Bourne Series & Green Zone, is about the real life incident where Richard Philips , captain of a merchant mariner, was kept hostage by a bunch of Somalian pirates. Now the film is all about the survival drama which is portrayed in a realistic manner that suits to Paul's style in films like Green Zone.<br/><br/>The positive side of the film is that rarely we see films which belongs to the category of thrillers that doesn't possess a single cinematic moment. Now this can be seen as a negative by the usual action-thriller fans expecting loads of biffs n bams. Even-though the film carries lesser drama of strategy behind the walls like ""Zero Dark Thirty"", it does convey similar feel, especially the navy operations implied to rescue. From the title, its extremely clear that the movie's focus point if Captain Philips and nothing else. Billy Ray has structured a script in a character driven mode. Its about how he pacified the situation and took charge at points in order to save his vessel as well the crew followed by his struggles when he was kept as hostage. Now since its a portrayal of real incident with zero moments to trespass beyond realism, Paul's smartness to narrate a thriller with an emotional quotient is the highlight of the movie. The climax scene filled with tension and the manner how navy team displayed their professionalism in finishing off the matter was a treat to watch.....especially the ""execute"" scene.<br/><br/>After watching this movie, I felt only Tom Hanks can portray Captain Philips. The manner at which he tried to pacify and negotiate smartly with the Somalian pirates was simply outstanding. Barkhad Abdi as the captain of the Somalian pirate group conveyed a fear in the minds of the audience though his performance. The rest of the cast comprising of the other members of Somalian pirates, Merchant vessel crew and Navy team delivered outstanding performances.<br/><br/>Barry Ackroyd's cinematography reminds you of those shaky realistic shots mostly seen in such kinda films. Christopher Rouse editing kept the movie tight and at an even pace. Henry Jackman's score wasn't exceptional so as to be noticed but did maintain the mood of the film.<br/><br/>Its a survival drama with bits of thrills here n there captured in a realistic manner with Tom Hanks delivering yet another outstanding performance.<br/><br/>I'd be amazed if Hanks doesn't get another Academy Awards' nod."
"Robert_duder","8","1","3","20 October 2013"," Solid thriller that is more powerful being based on a true story
","In the last week I have seen both films that seem to be the frontrunners for some Oscar nods and both times I must admit I was a little underwhelmed although I should be used to that from Oscar contenders. Gravity was a colossal disappointment in a number of ways (see my review) and Captain Phillips let me down just a little as well. Now please don't get me wrong, both were entertaining and I did enjoy Captain Phillips. It had some riveting, edge of your seat thrills, a solid story and some truly great performances. That being said I thought it was a good movie, but not a great one. It didn't really evoke any huge emotions from me and as glad as I was to see Tom Hanks back on the big screen and he was good, he didn't truly shine until the last five minutes of the film but more on that in a moment. Certainly knowing this was based on a true story that wasn't so long ago it made the film even better. I cringed at the intense scenes and the actors who portrayed the pirates were good, though again I felt like they fell short of being truly great. The film was good all around but I supposed with all the hype about it I wanted GREAT! I wanted mind blowing and it didn't meet those expectations.<br/><br/>I remember when I was completely convinced that Tom Hanks was thee greatest living actor in Hollywood. He can be funny, serious, intense, dramatic and romantic all at once. Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Terminal...I could go on but those are some of my favourites...the man is a master of his craft. But it has been awhile since he's had a great role and this was a good role for him. He commanded the screen and was as good as he always is. The moment when he is rocketed into true Tom Hanks stardom is the last five minutes of the film. That sounds ludicrous but the scene of him being finally recovered and saved and his break down was moving and powerful and honestly if they gave him an Oscar based on that...then so be it. Its remarkable that the men playing the pirates are complete newcomers. I had heard what a remarkable job Barkhad Abdi as the leader of the group and he was good. I wouldn't say he was amazing but considering this is his first role, he isn't an actor by trade and he absolutely made the role authentic. The rest of the pirates played by Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed and Mahat M. Ali did a good job as well. All three are completely new to the big screen and they were perfect for their perspective roles. The only other notable role was that of Shane Murphy played by Michael Chernus. I actually thought his performance was very weak and felt forced and over-acted. Next to Hanks he seemed like an amateur and didn't fit the tone of the film very well unfortunately.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass absolutely liked gritty realism and uses his infamous chaotic shaking camera style which apparently a lot of people hate. It didn't bother me in Captain Phillips and I didn't find it overly obvious. 99% of the film is on the freighter or in the smaller life-raft and the pacing of the film is fine. I thought the scenes in the life-raft dragged just a little bit but a lot of time was spent in there so he was making sure the entire story was told. There is some controversy over whether or not Phillips was as heroic as the movie portrays him but this review is not about that, this is about the film and whether or not it entertains and it did. It is captivating, easy to watch and if you want a great survival thriller then this will fulfil that. Is it Oscar worthy? Not in my opinion. Its a solid movie that is being way over-rated in my humble opinion. Still worth checking out because it doesn't disappoint. Don't for a minute take this as a negative review, I simply want to address the accolades the film is receiving. All around good, falls short of greatness. 8/10"
"kluseba","7","1","3","20 October 2013"," Four new star actors are born
","""Captain Philipps"" is an American action-drama inspired by but not closely based on actual events. The real Captain Philipps acted a lot less heroic and more ignorant than in this movie adaption that simply tries to do what many recent Hollywood movies do. They portray the hard but honest everyday life of a seemingly normal American citizen who suddenly faces big challenges and becomes a national hero. In times of governmental shutdown, economical problems and a slowly progressing decline as the world's most important nation, the people needs a few new heroes to believe in American society again. <br/><br/>In this movie, you see how democratic institutions, dominant military forces and social cohesion defeat corruption, exploitation and selfishness in the worst among the developing countries. The film presents the United States of America and Somalia as complementary antitheses which feels a little bit like lazy propaganda. <br/><br/>While the main villain constantly expresses a positive opinion about the American dream and how he could have a better life in that country, I must though admit that the movie also shows us the dark sides of some typically American values as individualism and weapons happen to be completely useless to resolve this movie's issues. Diplomatic elements, earthiness and shrewdness are the key elements leading to a predictable happy ending instead of a loner's brute force. <br/><br/>Apart of its minimal propaganda tendencies and the predictable ending, I didn't like the character of Captain Philipps at all. I'm not sure if Tom Hanks wanted to portray an arrogant and unsympathetic old bourgeois but if this was the intention of the makers, his acting is simply perfect. If the intentions were to create a sympathetic main actor, he completely failed though. It's hard to tell but usually, this kind of movie tries to create an emotional connection between the main character and the viewers and this movie just doesn't manage to build this up. From the beginning on, I had no connection with the main character and didn't really care about his fate.<br/><br/>Another small but important element I didn't appreciate was the fact that the main villain's English was so good. It's more than just a surprise that a pirate living in a desperate country ridden by a bloody civil war for more than two decades is able to speak English so well. I'm not sure if a young man like this ever had the chance to go to school at all. That's why this little detail and the general profound interactions between Captain Philipps and Muse feel a little bit too fabulous to me.<br/><br/>The movie's strengths are elsewhere. First of all, this film is filled with incredible tension and especially the claustrophobic and uneasy last third feels very intense and real. The acting is only one part of the gripping formula. The great soundtrack, the efficient light effects and the out-thought camera positioning create this nervous feeling. <br/><br/>The movie starts as a documentary in the first moments, slowly turns into an atmospheric thriller towards the middle, then it gets a refreshing action boost between the second and last third and it ends as an oppressive chamber piece. This mixture is very well balanced by the makers and the movie never gets boring in my opinion. Even though the content of the script is sometimes flawed, its general segment linearization is of the highest quality.<br/><br/>The film also has its dramatic and philosophic elements as the villains aren't just brutal criminals but four very young and sometimes naive men who have no choice but to go through this hell to stay alive and take care of their elders and own families. The acting of the four Somalian pirates is simply outstanding and especially the performance by Abdi Barkhad is absolutely authentic and intense. Sometimes, the movie doesn't feel acted at all as if the real persons were replaying the tragic events that really happened in a slightly transformed way. This is where the movie almost looks like a documentary of the most intense kind.<br/><br/>Despite its little flaws, this movie is truly intense and feels authentic. The first third has a few lengths but the last two thirds will keep you on the edge of your seat as almost no other movie this year. While the story itself and Tom Hank's acting aren't very good, the claustrophobic atmosphere and the incredible performances by the four young African actors are worth a few Academy Awards.

","Captain Phillips may just be one of the best films of 2013, this is a solid film, from the creative directing from Paul Greengrass all the way to the performances by the actors and I'm not just talking about Tom Hanks' portrayal of Captain Richard Phillips, I'm talking about the ENTIRE cast (But Tom Hanks' performance was phenomenal as always). But the cinematography on the other hand could have been done better, but that's just in my own opinion. I honestly don't want to say too much and give anything away (even though we all should know how it ends since it was all over the news back when it happened in 2009) but this film is 110% a must see for anybody who enjoys films based on true events, or for people who like movies with Tom Hanks in it. And who doesn't like a film with Tom Hanks in it anyways?"

","Two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks is the face of the 57th BFI London Film Festival, as the maritime thriller Captain Phillips and the biographical comedy, Saving Mr. Banks bookends the 11-day event.<br/><br/>British director, Paul Greengrass has built a reputation for dramatising events of terror (United 93, Bloody Sunday, Green Zone). He remains consistent with Captain Phillips, as he presents us with an adrenaline-charged rebirth of a real life hijacking.<br/><br/>Based on true events and the book A Captain's Duty, co-authored by the real Captain Richard Phillips, this biographical blockbuster is an intricate dramatisation of the 2009 capture of the U.S container ship Maersk Alabama, by a crew of Somali pirates – the task was to transport food and drink from Port Oman to Mombasa, Kenya. However, the vessel's course was set to travel through the pirate-infested waters of the Somali Basin.<br/><br/>At the very beginning, we are introduced to the security-conscious Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks), an experienced seaman who sets out to navigate a cargo ship round the horn of Africa. Soon after, the narrative shifts to Somalia where we meet a clan of pirates who live under gang rule. Muse (Barkhad Abdi), a fisherman-turned-pirate who dwells in little village on the Somali Coast, occupies a cold-hearted demeanor and his general icy glare earns him the title of pirate captain; with his visceral behavior, Muse is close to meeting the same screen magnetism as our beloved Jack Sparrow. Skinny and feeble but with a mindset that's as strong as steel, the Somali- American newcomer pulls out a performance that forces even our front-man to raise his game.<br/><br/>Greengrass' intentions were to offer a fair and balanced account of the events and although Billy Ray's screenplay seems to be weighted in Phillips' favour, the director stated during the LFF press conference that, ""We haven't created characters that didn't exist; we haven't created great sways of the story that didn't exist."" He continued, ""I am very comfortable that this is a fair and accurate account of this event and I will stand by the methodology I used.""<br/><br/>The piracy situation rapidly plummets into a kidnapping, as the bandits make off in the Alabama lifeboat with Cpt. Phillips as their hostage. Now a tactical military operation, the USS Bainbridge intercepts the lifeboat and Navy Seals are called in to execute a highly strategic rescue operation. Although this may seem like an unfair fight with the US Navy taking on an armed quartet of buccaneers in a lifeboat, Greengrass, together with cinematographer Barry Akroyd, keeps us in suspense as to which way the tide will turn.<br/><br/>Amongst the chaos, the cinematography finds time to linger on the beauty of the everyday, which effectively juxtaposes the brutal editing and maintains its strong sense of urgency. Akroyd allows the spectator to get so close to the action that they themselves are at risk of suffering seasickness.<br/><br/>This typically Greengrass affair doesn't afford in-depth characterisation as it would impede the relentless pace of the action; we are full steam ahead. Its music is extremely evocative; It heightens the emotional dimension and encourages Captain Phillips to reach its well-crafted and overwhelming climax.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' performance as an average Joe, who demonstrates extraordinary fortitude and resilience, is focused, powerful and emotionally attached; we are privy to an acting tour-de- force that's sure to be in the Oscar's trajectory. Ultimately, Captain Phillips is a triumphant, albeit dizzying tale of human resolve, which by-the-way showcases both military and acting excellence.<br/><br/>Enjoy your coffee!<br/><br/>www.moviematrix.co.uk"
"slicedbread117","9","1","3","17 October 2013"," A true story thriller that truly thrills.
","The first time I saw the trailer for Captain Phillips, my thoughts were racing on how this movie, starring Tom Hanks and based on the true story of the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in over 200 years, would fare under the pressure of retelling such a tale. My original thoughts were quite skeptical, it didn't seem as though the film would be able to provide the type of real-life thrills that the actual hijacking did. Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, I am going to give the obvious gold star of the film to lead man Tom Hanks. Portraying the title character, Hanks is the sole elite level actor in the cast and because of this, he completely and rightfully steals the show. We first see Captain Phillips as an everyday family man, worried about is children and wife and by the time he reaches his vessel, the MV Maersk Alabama, we can see that the thoughts of possible pirate attacks are also running through his head as he runs drills and reads instruction guides to help prevent from pirates. This lead me to believe that upon the eventual attack, the Captain would be a stress-ridden mess but the exact opposite transpires, as Hanks portrays the calm and collective manner that a captain should have. Hanks continues to display his award-winning acting talent throughout the rest of the film, which clocks in at just over two and a half hours long. Every emotional string is pulled as the movie progresses, and Hanks is the center of nearly every one. From sadness, to frustration to pure heart-racing moments and in the closing minutes of the film, Hanks gives an emotional performance rivaling that of his beloved performance in 2000's ""Cast Away"". Tom Hanks proves that age is just a number when it comes to his raw ability to evoke numerous emotions in his viewers, and could be on his way to another Oscar for Best Actor.<br/><br/>Every great thriller builds itself up for the eventual finale, and Captain Phillips does just that. The movie starts off slow, letting you get to know the crew and ship just enough to not bore with nonsensical back story that a movie such as this doesn't necessarily need. We see the ship's eventual hijackers in Somalia gearing up to move out on their mission to bring back money to their leader Hufan. The film doesn't provide to much information on exactly why these pirates are seeking out the American vessel, and this is both good and bad. Bad because it could leave viewers slightly confused on what is going on, but good in the sense that it leaves mystery and fear behind the pirates. The movie continues to build anticipation, and when the first gun shots are fired, the movie really kicks in. Eventually the NAVY Seals get involved with the situation and even more intensity is added as the movie gets into its final moments. The say the least, the action is defined by the pressure built between the Captain and Muse and his crew, and less on hundreds of bullets flying across the screen, and because of that, the genre ""thriller"" is put to use perfectly.<br/><br/>As I say, a movie is only as good as it's villain, and newcomer Barkhad Abdi plays antagonist Muse, the leader of the pirate group. Muse and his crew are relentless and scary, and the surprising smarts of Muse force Captain Phillips to adapt to the situations much faster and it makes for a wonderful and exciting game of chess between the two leaders.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass, best know for his work on The Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum, deserves a shout out for his ability to produce and capture intense and thrilling moments that give this film a sense of realism that many true-story movies fail to do. I was highly excited when I discovered Greengrass was directing and he did not fail to deliver.<br/><br/>When it's all said and done, Captain Phillips is defined by it's edge of your seat moments, relentless antagonist, emotional prowess and phenomenal performance by lead actor Tom Hanks, all built on the fact that this film is based on a true story. This is a film that will undoubtedly help Captain Richard Phillip's story be remembered and stored away in the books of American history.<br/><br/>9/10"
"jerry-worley76","10","1","3","15 October 2013"," As Real As You Could Ask
","This is a film of relentless tension and believable action, crowned by a masterful performance by Tom Hanks as the title character. I won't presume to compare the film's authenticity to what may actually have happened when Captain Phillips' freighter was hijacked off Somalia. It is usually a bad sign when the military provides its hardware in films such as ""Top Gun"" and similar action epics. Here, there is no macho, stupid dialogue or over-the-top heroics. The Navy is portrayed as professionals, and the camera work stays close to all actors and keeps the adrenaline pumping. Tom Hanks' portrayal of Captain Phillips is that of a thoughtful, humane individual trying to protect his crew. The unpredictability of his situation is truly frightening. A film that is a masterpiece of its kind."

Everyone played their part as if they actually lived the moments. Tom Hanks as always was a master at this role. The new comers Faysal Ahmed, Barkhad Abdi and Mahat M. Ali they were marvelous. The nurse at the end of the move gave me chills at how good she was at taking care of Tom. The movie was 2hr plus, but it didn't feel like it at all.

","Captain Phillips is based on true events that happened back in 2009. A cargo ship on it's way to Mombasa, Kenya was hijacked by four Somali pirates. Captain Phillips and a few other men are held hostage and terrorized in the control room while the remaining crew members lock themselves into the engine room. One of the pirates decides to search the ship and the crew is able to capture him. They make a deal with the remaining pirates to release Philips and the other crew members. In exchange they will let the captured pirate go, give them the money they have in the safe, and let them escape in a life raft. Things go awry however and the pirates end up taking Captain Phillips hostage and escaping in the life raft.<br/><br/>Even if you are already familiar with this story and what happens Captain Phillips makes for some intense cinema. Greengrass does a nice job of balancing the chaos on board the life raft with the cold efficiency of the navy seal team. It makes for a compelling edge of your seat thriller. Once things start the action movies quickly and there are very few wasted scenes.<br/><br/>Hanks has received some much deserved awards for his acting chops in the past but the 3rd act of this movie might very well be the finest performance he has ever put on film. Don't be surprised if Oscar comes knocking again.<br/><br/>To read our full review head on over to 3guys1movie.com"

"Jaron_Marquis","8","1","4","29 July 2014"," Solid movie
","Hanks completely disappears in this role. a great debut performance for others as well. We're in the steady hands of Paul Greengrass, a director fully aware that convincing crisis stories and biopics with supporters and antagonists involve conflicting interests and passions.As in many films of this genre, fiction or fact, finesse gives way to firepower force, and though the real-life outcome is fixed in advance, the voyage is exhilarating. The script, adapted from the book written by the actual protagonist, is not romanticized or glossed over with overreaching sentiment, and Greengrass' direction matches it with a style that is consistently tenacious."
"zlswl","9","1","4","7 June 2014"," Excellent acting and story. It is worth watching
","As usual, Tom Hanks perfect for this role and excellent acting.<br/><br/>A real life drama that was well shown in this movie. I don't care about what people are saying in regards the message the movie is trying to give or portraying certain cultures this or that.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is the reality of Somalia. Some people there decided to become pirates and attack merchant ships saying they have the rights to charge them fee (ransom) for using their waters.<br/><br/>Completely illegal on international law but totally right on the eyes of the people there who tends to blame the western world for all their problems."

","Paul Greengrass's Captain Phillips is the riveting true story of the 2009 hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama by the pirates of Somalia. The movie stars Tom Hanks who brings the real life character of Captain Richard Phillips to life on the screen, and also in one of his best performances which too bad for him he did not get an Oscar nomination for his Oscar level work in the film. Director Paul Greengrass has crafted a film that goes on a par with JFK, Munich, Thirteen Days, Mississippi Burning, and The French Connection. Though historically accurate throughout, this movie made my list of the top 10 films of last year because of how well this movie was done. What a wonderful piece of work!"
"joe-garibaldi","8","1","4","4 June 2014"," Tense, Thrilling, Thoughtful and Tragic
","I saw this film very recently, and was simply stunned by just about every every aspect of it.<br/><br/>From the quiet, ordinary life we are introduced to, it is difficult to see how things ended up so badly. A pleasant lack of music at this point brings realism and involvement, and the conversation Captain Phillips has with his wife shortly before leaving sets up the more 'thoughtful' layer of the film; our world is changing, fast. The story of Captain Phillips shows us how there can catastrophic consequences when extreme poverty clashes with extreme wealth.<br/><br/>Once our ship leaves port, and the characters have been introduced, the tension really starts to build; it certainly won't stop until the credits roll. Visuals, music, (and most importantly) acting are all top notch, with a special mention going to Barkhad Abdi, who plays the pirate Captain, seamlessly going from determined, to frustrated, to desperate. As a viewer, you become immersed in the situation, especially from this point onwards. Somehow I found myself rooting simultaneously for both Captain Phillips and Muse (the pirates' leader). You sympathise with their struggles, and are angry for their flaws. Everything in this film feels really alive.<br/><br/>Towards the end, events spiral rapidly out of control, and one can't help but feel sorry for our characters;the film does a great job of telling us who the real enemy is, without feeling preachy or obvious; I'll give you a clue here: it's not the pirates. As for the end, it proves to be both shocking and tragic, despite being predictable for a while. I am relieved yet sad; <br/><br/>This film proves two things to me: It IS possible to create a thriller with interesting characters, minimal CGI whilst also providing food for thought. Things aren't as 'black and white' as they are made out to be, more many different shades of grey.<br/><br/>Experience this film as soon as possible- but be warned, the description of 'unbearably tense' is NOT an exaggeration."

I found very interesting how the US Marine and the SEALS affronted this Somali kidnapping situation. There were some special elements of their strategy to save Captain Philipps. <br/><br/>The film soundtrack was perfect combined to each scene. Last but not least only director Paul Greengrass could adapt this true story with good timing of suspense. He also succeeded in creating a dynamic final countdown. <br/><br/>Final vote 8/10 that matches exactly the IMDb rating."

","Some people recommend this film so I take a shot. I was expecting maybe be similar to Cast Away, that I like.

I don't know, is like I don't care. Maybe was the acting or the awkward dialogue between Tom Hanks and the hijackers. Generally I like tom hanks but this time I think he didn't make a good job. Hijackers also feel fake. At least in some parts.<br/><br/>Hard to really feel immerse on the story. And some parts are excessively long that make you think ""What I am waiting for?"". Mostly on the last 3rd of the movie.<br/><br/>At least there is a happy ending, as the real story.<br/><br/>Quite some people seem to like it anyway, so even when I don't recommend it, I suppose you could still give it a chance and watch it.<br/><br/>Is not terrible.

The movie starts of with the suspense when the Somali pirates hijack the ship and the frightening music starts rolling. The dialogue was very well written, with meaningful lines in it. You could really feel the emotions of Captain Phillips. The acting from Tom Hanks is phenomenal, he deserves an Oscar for his performance. The performance from the actors who played the Somalis could have been better. Besides that, everyone did a fantastic job in their respected role. In the last scene, the Navy Seals came to rescue Captain Phillips and had to go through a course of events with the Somalis. That whole scene was extremely intense!

","Judging by the excessive use of ""shaky cam,"" it's obvious director Paul Greengrass, competing with live news coverage during the 2009 Somalian hijacking of an American-run freighter ship, wanted to make a suspenseful thriller that doesn't seem anything like a motion picture.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays the title character with a sturdy, determined aura, realistic as that perpetually moving lens. Before the emergency situation, Captain Richard Phillips literally runs a tight ship, and, at least according to the film, he's got a bad feeling after hearing they'll be sailing near Somalian shores without any backup – his unsure expression is warning enough.<br/><br/>So, along with the fact this is a highly documented real-life story, it's no surprise when two ragtag boats, mere specks compared to the gigantic freighter, approach quickly – the first of several involving situations has the crew trying to keep the ""remora"" from grabbing hold of the ship's side, which would allow the armed pirates entry.<br/><br/>Once on board we meet our antagonist leader up close. Perhaps the most unattractive villain in film history, it's explained by the fact he's no actor. Resembling an emaciated anvil-faced llama, half-morphed into a sharpened scythe, ""Muse"" is an edgy, unpredictable and surprisingly sympathetic foe who builds his own jagged momentum. Instead of taking an easy sixty thousand dollars, Muse – goaded by a more outspoken and lethal henchman – wants a couple million.<br/><br/>The best scenes occur aboard the freighter as the Somalian pirates, along with a poker-faced Phillips, descend into the lower decks to find the missing (or rather, hiding) crew...<br/><br/>Then, once the pirates kidnap Philips alone, cramped in a lifeboat resembling a mini submarine, the intensity continues – Hanks wields his reliable chops and, despite some obviously-written dialogue, the spitfire conversations between the good guy and the baddies enhance the contained, claustrophobic, do-or-die atmosphere<br/><br/>Sporadic alleviation from the Navy Seals aside, the third act, unlike more energetic scenes aboard the big ship, is a prolonged nail-biting experience that you might wish resolved... a lot quicker."

","(Note: There are two very slight ""spoilers"" herein but not at all able to spoil your enjoyment of the film, maybe just the opposite).<br/><br/>I just don't get it why in the IMDb.com quotes from the movie they missed the best one:<br/><br/>CAPTAIN to Pirate: ""Kenny, what do we have in the safe?...Thirty thousand dollars? ... In the safe we have thirty thousand dollars. It's yours.""<br/><br/>PIRATE: ""Thirty thousand dollars? What am I?

Fast paced, well acted (impressive work by the Somali actors!), good camera work, no unnecessary F-words, not one. <br/><br/>It is over two hours but you will not notice how the time has passed. This is not some cheesy Hollywoodish made up hostage movie. It is based on a true story. The film is impartial, yet kind, in telling a story where one can even feel empathy for the pirates, the human side of their misery bringing misery to others by attacking ships and their crews. Yet, not for a second the over-the-top, annoying preachy leftism, so typical for Hollywood flicks.<br/><br/>Another question that I kept not finding an answer to was why are these crews unarmed when they cruise in such dangerous waters?

","Captain Philips, based on a true incident, narrates the story of the eponymous captain of the US merchant vessel Maersk Alabama that was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. On a voyage from Salalah in Oman to Mombasa in Kenya, the ship finds itself inexplicably isolated off the Somali coast and thus becomes an easy picking for some amateurish pirates looking to make big ransom bucks. In a heart stopping sequence the four teenage pirates come in a flimsy skiff and board the gigantic cargo ship. But when US government responds by dispatching two warships, the youthful enthusiasm of the pirates turns to desperation as they realize that they are being out-gunned and outwitted. The demeanour of Captain Richard Philips (Tom Hanks) also morphs from bravado to fear as he is taken hostage in a claustrophobic lifeboat, that becomes the centre of much of the action in the latter half of the film. Our sympathies also tend to waver, which may not be the intention of the director though. <br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass extracts outstanding performances from Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips and débutant Barkhad Abdi as Muse, the leader of the pirates. The camera bobbing up and down on the ocean might induce seasickness in the weak of heart, but is primarily responsible for holding you on the edge of the seat for most of 134 minutes. In the final analysis, it is the very human and humane performances of both Hanks and Abdi that prevents the film from degenerating into the tired and familiar heroic American formula. Captain Phillips shies away from delving into the uncomfortable questions that could have transformed it into a greater film."

","I'm not going to give away anything, but I think most people know the outcome of the pirate attack. What impressed me the most is the reality of it all. Everything seemed very realistic. A lot of movies deliver extreme action and violence, then the affected characters just walk away like nothing happened. Not this movie. You can really feel the emotion and mental stress that real people would be in, in that situation. Really great acting, and not just from Tom Hanks. The Somali pirates were just perfect.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint would be that the movie was out of focus for at least 10 minutes. That was almost certainly the fault of the local theater.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8 because I thought the movie was 7 but the acting was a 9."

","... you're gonna take me hostage<br/><br/>With apologies to Sophie Tucker. I have to confess that I've never been much for Boy's Own Paper type 'adventure' stories but I found this movie easy to take whilst it stopped short of having me grip the edge of my seat. We do, of course, know how it comes out but it's not too difficult to suspend your disbelief. There are, of course, questions at the back of your mind even as you're watching but the quality of the film and the performances don't allow these questions to neutralize what is on the screen. The obvious question is WHY, after all the publicity, all the recorded hi-jackings etc, does ANY shipping company permit one of its vessels to sail SLOWLY and with no arms on board, in waters that are notorious for Somali pirates. My second question - where does a dirt-poor country like Somalia acquire 1) high-speed boats and 2) seemingly endless supplies of arms - is probably easier answered by those in the know. A third, possibly equally futile question: why couldn't a crew of what appeared to be around 50/60 strong prevent a mere FOUR pirates, albeit armed, even board let alone capture their vessel. I pose these questions only because this is a TRUE story rather than the imaginings of a writer."

","Captain Phillips, for those of you who are aware of the American cargo ship hijacking incident occurred a few years ago, in 2009, the movie is the portrayal of a true story of the Captain, Richard Phillips' heroic guidance to lead his crew away from the hostile situation from the pirates. It's extremely rare to see a film with this scale and cast to deliver a message across of such sensitive contemporary topic.<br/><br/>Let me start dissecting the film begin with the antagonists which play a brilliant roles in the story. Barkhad Abdi's performance as Muse, the 'captain' of the pirate motorboat, is simply stunning. His performance is an impeccable portrayal of Somali pirate who would hijack the cargo ship at any costs, even death which is the formidable spirit within this character which stands out the most amongst other pirates in the film. Nevertheless, the screenwriter Billy Ray has given so much complexity in the antagonists which become the crucial drive of the movie. Faysal Ahmed who plays Najee, is the fiercest and strongest of them all, a masculine type character who incessantly threatened to kill Captain Phillips and often irritated by the Captain's talking. Mahat Ali's role as Bilal is a sporadic pirate and the youngest of the pirates, seems indecisive and inexperience at times which has built interesting relationship with the captain. The character seems to be more compassionate and adopted less aggressive approach to the hostages which has established a vivid relationship with other characters.<br/><br/>The confrontation between Hanks and the pirates intrigued by the negotiation of the ransom or robbery as it appeared so. The mind tricks he plays when the pirates' motorboat approaches the mother ship, the amount of control that Muse dictates to attain when he get on board, all of these details of the story is all unraveled in the film expertly. It's not often to see such movie with such abundant intensity and tension throughout the entire 134 minutes and it has given me a thrilling cinematic experience in the course of the film. <br/><br/>I have always admired Hanks' work and the diversity in the roles he's played throughout his acting years. From Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, Catch me if you can, to The Terminal, Hanks' has constantly found a way to exceeded audience's expectation and bring out the essence and complexity of the character. Playing the captain of MV Maersk Alabama is no exception, his acting inject realism to the protagonist which is vital to execute the film seamlessly as the film is based on a real story of a realistic hostage situation. Through the film, we understand that Richard Phillips play numerous roles in his life other than just the captain who is responsible for the operation of the cargo ship. Though his prominent role is the captain, he is also a father and a husband which might seem orthodox, yet it has again brought realism to the fate when someone's on the verge of dying and leaving people he cares about behind.<br/><br/>It is noteworthy of the techniques deployed in the film, the use of shaky hand cameras which could be irritating and abusive in times. Yet, it is ingenious that Paul Greengrass decided to adopt such technique which ties in with this contemporary issue of American ships hijacked by African pirates. Such experimentation of cinematography is prodigious for the film; it's been filmed in a way to depict a sense of documentary film which allows audiences in. The use of camera has also given us a sense of the tightness of the space within the mother ship and the emergency lifeboat which pirates use to flee back in later phase of the film. One of the reason why I admire Paul Greengrass's films is the sense of the topic he choose to film yet bring a captivating and new cinematic experience to the audience. Greengrass has again unveiled his awareness of the contemporary issues dealing with the society and tie those ideas into the film brilliantly."
"JackCerf","7","1","7","14 October 2013"," Nothing Personal Just Business.
","""Wolves are only what God made them,"" said Bismarck of the Polish nationalists of his day, ""but we shoot them just the same."" That's pretty much the message of Captain Phillips. Starting with Phillips lamenting to his wife that the world is growing far more competitive, and that it's no longer enough just to meet the requirements of the job, the movie segues immediately to a harbor in Somalia, where warlords drive pirates to sea, idle and desperate men clamor and bribe to be recruited to a pirate crew, and issues of leadership and priorities are worked out by a good stout whack over the head with a monkey wrench. Both Phillips and Muse, the pirate captain, have crewmen who complain that this stuff is tougher than they thought it was going to be. Both have parallel problems – Hanks in figuring out how to placate and mislead the pirates while not getting killed, Muse in figuring out what to do as his plans go increasingly awry. Late in the movie, when Phillips suggests that Muse take the $30 thousand in the ship's safe, let him go, and cut his losses, the pirate replies ""I have bosses."" So does Phillips, whose bosses sent his unarmed ship ship through pirate infested waters in the first place. Everybody's got to make a living, and ransoming first world merchant ships and their crews to the insurance company for millions is a lot more lucrative than fishing, even if not much of the money trickles down to the guys in the boats who do the dirty work. The model has worked plenty of times before; Muse tells Phillips they got a $6 million ransom last week. He thinks there's no reason why it shouldn't work again. As he tells Phillips when he boards the Maersk Alabama, ""No al-Qaeda here. This is business."" But the United States doesn't do business – especially not a new half-African President elected on a peace platform who thinks he has to look tough for the American public and the rest of the world.<br/><br/>The pirates remind me of the Penguin characters in the Madagascar movies. There are four Penguins: a captain who is forceful, always planning, and always optimistic, but nowhere near as smart or in control as he thinks; a steady, reliable guy who handles details; a hothead who wants to smash things up; and a wide-eyed rookie. So here. Muse has a steady helmsman-mechanic, a hothead increasingly eager to shoot somebody as the walls close in, and a wide-eyed rookie completely out of his depth. Like the Penguins, the pirates' dash and nerve get them into situations they can't handle, involving technology they don't understand. Muse's mantra as things spin increasingly out of control, is ""everything is going to be OK."" It's less to keep Phillips calm than to reassure himself.<br/><br/>The driving force of the plot is shameless fraudulent concern. The unarmed Phillips tries to mislead, stall and distract the pirates not only by playing dumb but by offering them food and medical care for their wounded man. Once the Navy is on the scene, the officer in charge is told to string the hostages along with food, water and promises until the SEALs can be flown in to do the necessary shooting. If he can trick them into surrender, so much the better. If not, the SEAL commanding officer is happy to pose as the insurance company representative until his men can get the pirates in their sights. His lies are plausible because he knows the pirates' names, their home port, their clan, and their clan elders, information probably obtained through the usual channels by which ransoms were negotiated with the Somalis. We've been watching Lenny Briscoe and assorted hostage negotiators lie like this to suspects for years, so we'd know exactly what's coming even if this weren't a true story. Sometimes it doesn't work out. This time it does, even it leaves Phillips shocked and blood-soaked.<br/><br/>Hanks does the fine job you'd expect of him, but it somehow falls short. You sympathize with the character's plight, but the man himself seems oddly unengaging. The rest of the Alabama's crew are barely sketched in, even though they played a key role in defeating the pirates' initial plan and forcing them off the ship. The Navy captain and the SEAL commander are just functions of their job. When he wants to, Greengrass can bring faces in the crowd to life with a few strokes, as he did with the passengers in United 93. I get the impression he wasn't really that interested in the American sailors. The Somalis – all played by Somali-Americans from Minneapolis – are a much more interesting lot. In particular, Barkhad Abdi, who plays Muse, comes close to stealing the picture from Hanks. He's as chewy a villain as Magua in Mann's Last of the Mohicans, as Madame Defarge, or, for that matter, as Satan in Paradise Lost. While the real Muse is doing 33 years in federal prison for piracy, it looks like Abdi might just have a future in Hollywood. Such is life."
"aharmas","10","1","7","13 October 2013"," A New Classic and Hanks at HIs Very Best
","2013 is beginning to look a lot like 1939, a year full of films that will live on as classics. In spite of all the duds and overpraised movies that we have seen, a certain domestic comes to mind... We have seen some excellent movie making, sometimes a week after another. Here is the real life ordeal of a man who must confront death face to face, endure major physical and psychological trauma under very dangerous circumstances. One couldn't imagine Tom Hanks to give such a performance at this stage of his career, but he manages to surpass most of the work he has done before, and that's quite an achievement.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips and his crew fall victim to a group of desperate pirates near the coast of Africa. This group's enterprise at its best clumsy, and we know things will not turn out very well. The Somalians look famished, desperate, fearful, and hungry for some type of financial sustenance. Their existence is at the mercy of crime lords who constantly abuse them and demand more and more from people who are barely surviving. It's hard not to pity them, but it's also hard not to feel empathy for anyone portrayed by Hanks, and from his early scenes, this character carries with him a strong sense of decency and fairness. It's almost impossible to not feel his rights have been compromised by society's screwed social and economic woes.<br/><br/>Greengrass keeps the reins tight throughout most of the film, with the help of hand held cameras, some marvelous editing, and spare background music. Here it all depends on the performances, the direction, the way nothing relies on posturing and lethargic storytelling. Here the tension never lags, the film is saturated with emotions that have us involved. Every word counts, every turn is relevant. There is no wasted minute.<br/><br/>Hanks is present in every frame of the film, and we can see how good he is at portraying intelligence, sympathy, and a little bit of duplicity as he tries to find a way to save himself and his crew. It almost works most of the time, but even he can't foretell what surprises might come his way. He survives because he is both lucky and resourceful, and from the amazing last fifteen minutes of his performance, one might even believe that he didn't realize how close he was to dying.<br/><br/>It's hard not to be impressed by the many layers of his performance, and I am still wondering where a double was used, particularly in the underwater scenes. I wouldn't be surprised if Hanks didn't do that himself. Much credit for the consistency of the performance should also go to the actors playing the Somalians. They are not simple sketches. They look and act like real people, people at the end of their ropes, searching for a way out, but they do know they can't escape their fates. It's not when, but how they will finally succumb, and it's heartbreaking to see their demise.<br/><br/>There will be plenty of talk about the last fifteen minutes of the movie, a departure from the typical movie ending. Here a human being is portrayed very realistically, and Hanks will no doubt be rewarded for his astonishing work here. He has kept our attention for nearly two hours, but what he does at the end is unbelievable. You will probably feel every ounce of emotion as he acts his heart out. Here is a master at work.<br/><br/>""Captain Phillips"" deserves to be seen, studied, and admired. It showcases the best work by many in an industry that keeps challenging us with disappointments and too many gimmicks. In the end, it's a good source material, a good adaptation, and the best talent all together that prove that there is still room for much wonder in the Silver Screen."
"west_stuff","9","1","7","13 October 2013"," Very well acted and realistic.
","This movie was a nail-biter from the start. I felt that it gave a full, balanced view of this event. I like that it started out showing the situation from which the Somali pirates came into attempting to pirate this ship. It showed why they were so highly motivated to put themselves and everyone else at risk in order to attain the ransom money. Every person in this movie did an excellent job of acting. Of course Tom Hanks was crazy amazing in his role. How that guy does it, I cannot imagine. We felt like we were right their with him the entire time. I highly recommend this movie. It is important for us to see what things are like outside of our realm of reality here in the U.S. This was a true event and the situation in Africa and off the shores of Africa is real and important as we are all in this together. There are still pirates but apparently (and hopefully) the cargo ships are better armed to defend against such attacks. See it!!!! Love Tom Hanks!!! Never saw a Tom Hanks movie that wasn't amazing. ... except maybe DaVinci Code."
"jhoop81","9","1","7","13 October 2013"," A movie that is well worth the price of admission
","I'm sure Tom Hanks will be up for an Oscar with this role. But man I'm telling you that capt of the pirates deserve an Oscar or at least a Oscar nominee for best supporting role or something. I've never seen him before until this movie but I'm telling you he really is the reason this movie is like a fun roller coaster. Hanks is brilliant as well and his character play in the last 15 minutes is sure to make you jerk/hide a tear. Just a great movie through out and if you are about to have a movie date or outing and you are looking for a movie that is worth admission this is the one without question. One that will get off to a suspenseful start pretty much 10 minutes into the movie, and from there will just lure you in more and more with action, suspense, and drama. And occasionally or maybe I should say about 5 or 6 times the entire movie you will chuckle at what really is not meant to be comedy it just comes out that way given how the characters appear. But trust me this movie does not in anyway need to be funny to sustain its high level of suspense action and drama. It is just fine with all it offers. Enjoy people and you can thank me later :) !"
"ferguson-6","7","1","7","12 October 2013"," Fighting Irish
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Paul Greengrass seems to thrive on finding the line for unbearable tension and hectic, claustrophobic action. He gained fame for helming The Bourne Supremacy and The Borne Ultimatum, but this one has more in common with his excellent United 93. Somehow he keeps us gripping the armrests despite knowing full well how the story ends. That is a talented filmmaker.<br/><br/>What adds to the stressed-filled fun here is that the world's greatest everyman, Tom Hanks, meets his match with fire-eyed Somalian pirate Muse, played by first time actor Barkhad Abdi. The scenes pitting these two against each other are fascinating studies and the perfect example of vastly different worlds colliding. Hanks plays Captain Phillips, who is charged with guiding the cargo ship Maersk Alabama through the pirate filled waters. Phillips is not the warmest of guys, but seems to be a competent captain with respect from the crew.<br/><br/>Most of us remember watching on TV in 2009 as the 5 day sequence ended thanks to yet another perfectly executed Navy SEALs rescue mission. Greengrass does a terrific job of reenacting this moment. The other two moments that are sure to leave an impression both involve Mr. Hanks. The initial scene on the bridge as the pirates assume control of the ship ... when Muse tells Phillips that he is now the captain, we see a flash of surrender in Phillips' face. A stunning scene for both Hanks and Abdi (and congrats to Abdi for going toe to toe with the acting legend). The other scene worthy of discussion occurs after the rescue as Captain Phillips is escorted to sick bay to be checked out. His ""in shock"" actions are startling and very brave for an actor. Some may argue that Hanks took it too far, but I would encourage you to put yourself in that lifeboat and determine just how courageous you would be. Abdi also has a scene where he first discovers this is an American ship. He reacts as if he has won the lottery.<br/><br/>Some scandal surrounds this story as there is a lawsuit against Maersk and Phillips brought by members of the crew. The contention being that Phillips knowingly steered the ship too close to the pirate waters in order to save time and money. Phillips went on to write a best selling book recounting the ordeal and he also returned to his job as ship captain. Hanks was the perfect choice to play Phillips as the story is more about a regular guy being thrust into an extraordinary situation. Phillips is no superhero ... he doesn't disarm four pirates. Instead, he uses guts and a will to live ... things we all hope we would exhibit should we ever find ourselves in such an awful situation."
"cartmanandme","10","1","8","12 October 2013"," Thriller, Adventure, and Action all into one
","Great movie based off of a true event. Yes, the real captain was not as heroic as the movie, but Tom Hanks does a terrific portrayal possibly (Oscar nominated). Everyone knows the ending of this event, but the movie is a huge suspense nonetheless. The authenticity with the Somolian pirates and their language makes everything believable. I highly encourage people to see this movie. Tom Hanks never disappoints and I wouldn't be surprised if the movie was nominated for other Oscars like best sound and cinematography. Regardless of awards the movie has a lot of ups and downs and accurately portrays the feelings of fear and even courage among this attack. The time might seem like a factor, but it goes by quickly."
"PacificHeights","Null","1","8","12 October 2013"," Tom Hanks Is Back
","Paul Greengrass has released his latest work, Captain Phillips. It is based on the real-life events of Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks). While sailing the American owned MV Maersk Alabama through international waters off the coast of Somalia, his ship is hijacked and he is taken hostage by unpredictable, chaotic Somali pirates with automatic weapons.<br/><br/>The story is well-written and expertly crafted by writer Billy Ray. The cinematography is superbly handled by Barry Ackroyd with editing by Christopher Rouse. The loud, effective, pause filled music is by Henry Jackson. <br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a devoted husband and father. He accepts assignments far from home to provide for his family. This same sense of protection and obligation is evident in the way he leads his crew. He is firm, but always fair. <br/><br/>This movie is action-packed and well-paced. The script, cinematography, music, and acting seem real, expect for the two obligatory PC moments with the pirates. The final twenty minutes are filled with some of the most raw, real, and heart-breaking acting I have seen in years. Tom Hanks, love him or loathe him, has an Oscar nomination in his future with Captain Phillips."

Also, the movie needs a lot of reality checks. Amateur pirates who dont know how to use guns, with no shoes, attacking a US ship almost with no plan. The US ship full of valuable cargo has no weapons, no security? And many many more. This movies looks like a cheap propaganda movie, below the likes of Top Gun or Rambo.

"Diablo1616","8","0","1","26 March 2020"," Not a great one but still a good one !
","This is one of the toughest, most naked performances of Hanks' stellar career. It's sometimes painful and heart wrenching to watch. He's an Everyman, per usual, but he's not also a savior or a hero. He doesn't suddenly develop super strength and overpower the bad guys. He's just a guy in charge of a boat and its passengers.<br/><br/>The four Somali-American first-time actors playing the pirates are a very realistic bunch. They play with wild-eyed and feral intensity, really scary. Barkhad Abdi plays their skinny foolhardy leader Muse, engaging Phillips in a deadly chess game, toe-to-toe. Faysal Ahmed plays the hot-headed Najee, who was the loose cannon of the group. Barkhad Abdirahman plays the young recruit Bilal, getting himself a baptism of fire on his first time out.<br/><br/>When I saw the name director Paul Greengrass in the credits, I understood why the sense of tension and urgency were so well-conveyed. This was that familiar sense of excitement we felt in his previous films, like the last two Jason Bourne films or that suspenseful 9/11 drama ""United 93"". He really knows how to make military operations exciting on screen, as he did for the Army in ""Green Zone"" and the Navy SEALS in this film.<br/><br/>I have to admit I was on the verge of getting seasick with the shakiness of the camera, but luckily I held on despite the two-hour length of the film set at sea.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a different sort of adventure drama, with a topic not too commonly tackled in a mainstream film. We hear of these events on the news, but this film brings us right in the middle of one. We will feel the tension building as the pirates were approaching. We will feel the fear when the pirates were on board. We will feel the desperation and the frustration of being trapped in the middle of the open ocean with no help immediately forthcoming. If you are up for such a realistic experience, then this film is for you.<br/><br/>8/10 !"

The entire plot of the movie is that a container ship sails toward their destination on a day that just seemed like any other regular day. SomalI pirates begin racing toward the ship and try to climb on. The pirates are after millions of dollars and captain phillips is just trying to return everybody on the ship home safely. I genuinely don't know anything related to somalI pirates or anything about this movie and how it connects to history in any way. The history part of the movie was pretty boring in my personal opinion. Paul Greengrass was the director of this movie. The main actors were Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, Faysal Ahmed, & Mahat M. ALi. The only one that i've seen in other movies is Tom Hanks. All of them were amazing actors, but from seeing Hanks in multiple other movies, he´s by far my favorite actor. I liked how the pirates climbed up on the ship. I think they were very clever with how they did it. I didn't like the sound. A Lot of it was just yelling and the sound was awful.

","Tom Hanks stars as Captain Richard Phillips, commander of the Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship that got raided by pirates in 2009. The pirates in this case are Somalis led by the intense Muse (newcomer Barkhad Abdi), who are looking for a payday substantial enough to justify their efforts. Despite all attempts made by the ship to throw off the pirates, they do get on board, and they manage to get off again holding the Captain as a hostage. Soon, the military has intervened and the situation actually gets even more stressful for our hero / victim.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass does appear to be something of a stickler for realism. Although we are assured that this true story did receive some dramatic embellishment for entertainment purposes, it does feel fairly true to life. We get to see cool heads prevail as the ships' crew turn the tables on the pirates at times, but not every event will swing in their favour. Commendably, the pirates are not rendered as one-dimensional bogeymen, but very determined individuals who don't seem to have a lot of options in life. (Their boss, a warlord, clearly isn't the kind who will take failure lightly.) As a result, we see a rich gallery of characters, several of them based on real people, acting as human beings and not infallible superheroes.<br/><br/>While there is enough subtext going on to make this more than a mere action-thriller, rest assured that Greengrass and company absolutely do NOT skimp on the thrills. ""Captain Phillips"" has plenty of genuinely riveting and exciting sequences, with first-rate editing (by Christopher Rouse) and pacing to make up for any flaws that viewers may perceive with the script or execution. The films' second half often takes place inside the cramped lifeboat, and kudos to the filmmakers for their excellent job at cranking up the tension within closed quarters.<br/><br/>Hanks is solid as usual, offering a level-headed and pragmatic lead performance. The three men playing Muses' compatriots have great energy, and the supporting cast includes such familiar American faces as Catherine Keener (in a brief cameo as Phillips' wife), David Warshofsky, Corey Johnson, Chris Mulkey, Yul Vazquez, and Max Martini.<br/><br/>Based on a book that Phillips wrote with Stephan Talty; text at the end details the fate of the two main characters.<br/><br/>Well worth a viewing.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

","Could there be any better portrayal of a real life dangerous sea situation than this? I have been watching movies for years. I have seen some real good movies but never felt this compelled to make an IMDb account just to review them. But this time, i couldn't help but do it. <br/><br/>With Tom Hanks playing the lead role, the movie had to be good. But i think the director is who needs to be applauded here for this phenomenal work of impossibleness. I was literally feeling that i'm there in the sea. I was feeling the waves, the gun shots, the fear, the tension, everything. I am still shook while writing this review.<br/><br/>The climax, when Captain Phillips couldn't speak a word, such a shock he was in. That moment when he started yelling that he can't take it anymore. Those last 10 minutes got me crying like never before. I can only imagine how petrifying it must have been for actual Richard Phillips. <br/><br/>This act takes courage. Hats off and respect to real Captain Phillips for saving lives of all his crew members jeopardizing his own and to hang in this unimaginably terrifyingly difficult situation. Amazing piece of work by US Navy as well. Nothing but a huge respect for all commanders of this rescue operation for perfect plan considering infinitely many factors that could've made it go wrong if not taken care of. Taking head shots in a wavy ocean, making sure they don't miss, making sure the wind plays the role they're expecting. It looked easy, just aim and shoot; but i can only imagine how much skill and experience it must have required to plan and execute it with ZERO error.<br/><br/>Hatsoff to each and every person involved in this operation.<br/><br/>Coming back to the movie, it'd be a injustice if Barkhad Abdi (captain of pirates) is not mentioned in this review. Though he was portraying the Pirates role, but this movie could never have been as good as it is without his flawlessly impressive performance. His character would actually make you feel terrified, such intensity and perfectness he has portrayed. <br/><br/>In the end, to every person out there in the universe, this movies is a MUST WATCH!!!!!!"
"TheLittleSongbird","9","0","1","8 October 2017"," A tense fight for survival
","Although it was very positively reviewed and Tom Hanks and Paul Greengrass have done some great films in their respective careers, there was the uncertainty as to whether 'Captain Phillips' would be my cup of tea.<br/><br/>The good news is it very much was. Although it does stray from the facts quite a bit, 'Captain Phillips' takes a remarkable and harrowing true story and tells it in a way that's utterly gripping and full of tension and emotion. It won't be for all taste-buds, especially for those who don't like shaky cam, but it is very easy to see why 'Captain Phillips' was and still is received so positively. It's not quite a masterpiece or flawless, it does go on a little longer than necessary which occasionally bogs down the pacing (15-20 minutes shorter would have made a difference) and, although there has been far worse abuse of the shaky cam technique, some of it does get excessive and leaves one feel a little sea-sick.<br/><br/>However, 'Captain Phillips' does more right than it does wrong and boasts some of Greengrass's best directing in one of his best films and one of Hanks' best performances in recent years. Greengrass keeps the tension levels high, maintaining urgency and the more violent moments are explosively powerful. He is particularly good in showing the increasing desperation when things go wrong as well as the horrors of the situation. Hanks is at the height of his powers here, boasting some of the most powerful acting he has ever given, particularly in his very poignant final scenes.<br/><br/>One mustn't overlook Barkhad Abdi, who brings intensity and vulnerability to a character who seems like a villain at first but turns out to be much more than that. The rest of the acting is fine, though Hanks and Abdi are the ones that dominate.<br/><br/>'Captain Phillips' is well made, while some of it is excessive there are other instances where the shaky cam heightens the drama and dizzying intensity. There is an audacious grit throughout. The music pulsates thrillingly without being repetitive or overbearing. The script is thought-provoking and has tightness and also nuance that stops things from being patronising.<br/><br/>Story-wise, 'Captain Phillips' is riveting, there is a heart-pumping urgency throughout and the tension, claustrophobia and desperation escalates and increases to nerve-shredding effect in its best moments. The emotion of the final act crescendos thrillingly and heart-wrenchingly and it is enough to bring tears to the eyes. So much its honesty, pathos and power, Hanks gives it everything to these scenes. The characters are hardly neatly black and white while motivations and character decisions are clear and logical.<br/><br/>In conclusion, tense and powerful, highly recommended. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

I put it on in the background whilst I worked on some writing I had to do purely for the noise.<br/><br/>That never got done; I ended up glued to my television screen.<br/><br/>I'm not going to lie or sugar coat this movie. It starts off really, really slow. It doesn't really pick up and become entertaining until around the first chase, which is around twenty minutes, half an hour in, if I remember rightly. From there, however, it really picks up and had me glued to the screen.<br/><br/>The acting in this is absolutely stunning. Tom Hanks did amazing. I felt so many emotions for his character, and connected to him - and isn't that what you're meant to do for characters on the screen? Connect and want to help / look after / etc? Everyone in this film acted really, really well and I was honestly taken aback by the quality of the acting itself. The casting director did such a brilliant job choosing the leads and the supporting cast. Each actor did such an amazing portrayal, and they deserve a round of applause for sure. Hanks portrayal of shock and (what I assume to be) post traumatic stress disorder was absolutely unbelievable. He did wonders in this role, and I'd love to see him in more things like this.<br/><br/>The plot itself is well known, I suppose. A ship taking cargo to Africa, being hijacked by Somalian pirates. It doesn't sound great, but let me just say, the suspense in this was absolutely amazing. My heart was pounding and I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie when things got faster. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.<br/><br/>This was, overall, an amazing movie and it's definitely one of those that you need to watch and form your own opinion on for sure. This is such a beautiful movie, it deserves so much praise."
"princessekarling","Null","0","1","19 April 2017"," True Tale of Pirates
","The 2013 film, Captain Phillips by Paul Greengrass is an overwhelming thriller that you can hardly believe is based on a true story. Tom Hanks is an amazing fit for the real man, Captain Richard Phillips. And Barkhad Abdi, in his debut acting gig couldn't have been more perfect for the role. In its opening weekend the film made over $25 million, and is still a major hit today. Tom Hanks has been in over 70 films, but he says that this is the most petrifying film he has ever filmed, this quotation explains it all. ""We literally went through the same thing the real crew went through. We heard them coming and getting closer and when they finally arrived they burst onto the bridge and we saw these incredibly skinny, living, breathing guys for the first time. They are the thinnest human beings you've ever seen and they're incredibly scary because their heads are huge, their teeth are really bad and they're waving automatic weapons in our faces and screaming at us. I can tell you it raised the hair on the back of all our necks. We were truly petrified."" The director kept the actors portraying the pirates away from the set so it was a shock to the actors, and their natural fear would come across on camera. A tactic most directors are afraid to use.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is based on the 2009 hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama, which was the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in 200 years. The pirates invade the ship in a shocking way, and once on the suspense builds to no end. From being shot at, to hit, to screamed at in a foreign language, the experience was nothing but terrifying from the beginning. After the pirates decide they are going to take Captain Phillips until they get what they want, the movie hits a point of no return. After being loaded into a lifeboat with pirates, and ejected into sea, there are many twists and turns with an ending that shocks the viewers.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks couldn't have portrayed Captain Phillips better. After visiting him in real life, he took in his advice, his strength and his realness and made the portrayal real. But the star of this show is the acting by Barkhad Abdi. For his first acting job, he portrays the power, the intensity, and he brings the fear to the film. He has been nominated for many awards for this part, which is amazing because it was his first ever acting position. <br/><br/>The filming techniques used for this film were very real. The scenes that are most intense are filmed in the most intimate areas. The lifeboat scenes were genuinely filmed in a lifeboat, in the middle of the ocean. This real aspect brings the truth to this story that everyone appreciates. The panning of the camera allows for the viewer to see everything happening, which is crucial to this film because there are so many things happening with each character and setting. If you haven't seen this film, stop what you're doing and go and watch it."

","In the trailer, Captain Phillips comes across as a drama. That's what I was expecting, and it is certainly that. And Tom Hanks, in the lead, does what he so often does. You will totally forget that he is Tom Hanks. Surprisingly (to me, at least), Captain Phillips is also loaded with action and suspense. Once it gears up, it runs nonstop to the end and never lets up. Add to that one of the best recent soundtracks I've come across (you cannot appreciate this film without theatre surround --- it takes place on the open sea, and it's NOT a small screen movie). Finally, Captain Phillips makes an honest effort to tell all sides of the story. We understand exactly why the pirates do what they do, and their story is told as well as that of anyone else. This is a really, really good movie."

","""Captain Phillips"" had high expectations to live up to for me being one of the movies that I had actually read the book. Though the movie was released back in 2013, it still maintains its position as one of my favorite movies 3 years later. The movie was brought to life by the creator of the Bourne Series, Paul Greengrass, so I expected nothing less than to be on the edge of my seat the whole film. <br/><br/>In ""Captain Phillips"", Captain Richard Phillips (played by Tom Hanks) is captain of a container-ship labeled the Maersk Alabama. As he travels the most despised shipping route around Somalia, he is caught in a predicament when his boat is attack by armed Somali Pirates. The pirates, just like the sailors, also have specific roles and ranks. The crew of thieves is led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi) who says one of the most quoted lines of the movie, ""Look at me! I am the captain now!"". Tom Hanks (Captain Phillips) and his entire crew are taken hostage by the pirates who demand millions upon millions of dollars. Captain Richard Phillips is forced to think of a plan that gets the pirates off the ship and frees his crew, however he himself wasn't so lucky. While watching this film I was in constant anticipation of what would happen next. It almost was like every time the captain and his crew took a step forward, the pirates pushed them two step backs. The true climax occurs during the last 20 minutes of the movie which allowed me to leave feeling satisfied with the ending, which is not the case for most current movies.<br/><br/>Just like the Bourne Films and many other of Paul Greengrass's works' the cinematography is extremely well thought out with the help of Christopher Rouse and Barry Ackroyd. Both Christopher and Barry have both been nominated for Oscars. <br/><br/>What makes the ""Captain Phillips"" so gripping is the fact that what you're watching is based on true story! There is a certain degree in irony in that such a beautiful piece of cinematography grew out of such dramatic events."

","The film is based on actual events with American Captain Phillips being taken hostage by ruthless Somali pirates in the ocean. Newcomer Barkhad Abdi earned an Academy Award nomination for his first acting role and it was well-deserved. Abdi nails the complexity of his character Muse, the Somali pirate. Abdi was captured by the ship at first and held captive. Captain Phillips became a hostage getaway. Tom Hanks played Captain Philllips with believable and earnestly. He portrayed him as a father and husband and a fearless leader who wanted the pirates to leave his ship behind with his men aboard the ship unharmed. Captain Phillips tries to get Muse to surrender to the authorities. Just like the men aboard the ship, Muse has bosses who would kill them rather than understand that they only had limited amount of money like $30,000 but their bosses would want more. Abdi and Hanks play very well as amateur and veteran in scenes. The film was believable especially about the fear and terror aboard the ship. The director did a terrific job in recreating the situation."

","I wasn't particularly looking forward to watching Captain Phillips as the subject matter didn't really appeal to me, but almost from the opening credits, I was completely hooked. It is a masterful, towering movie of excitement, drama, suspense, shock and ultimately intense emotion. In my humble opinion, it is far and away finest performance by Tom Hanks. Based on a true story, the film is about a gigantic, ocean-going container vessel being hijacked by a tiny band of desperate Somalis, and the immediate aftermath of this daring but utterly criminal act. We get to know the two main protagonists: Captain Phillips, (Tom Hanks), who is the strong, silent and incredibly brave master of the vessel, and the Somali hijack gang leader, Muse, (Barkhad Abdi).<br/><br/>I cannot write much about the plot without spoiling the story for those of you who haven't yet seen it, but suffice to say that it romps along at quite a pace and things develop in dramatic and unexpected ways. I can guarantee that you will never become bored for one millisecond while watching this exciting and brilliantly acted movie. All the cast are totally believable in their roles, and there are no one- dimensional or 'plastic characters' – not even in the US Navy. The cinematography and direction (by Paul Greengrass) is so realistic that sometimes you think you are watching footage of the actual event.<br/><br/>Even though we in the west deplore these hijackings and hostage taking, the film manages to perform an incredible task – it actually succeeds in evoking a measure of sympathy for the plight of the Somali perpetrators, and in particular, their leader, Muse. In the end, few watching can fail to be moved by the physical and emotional torment of Captain Phillips and if you leave the cinema dry-eyed and also without a feeling of being uplifted by the turnout of events, then you are not human.<br/><br/>I note that the user reviews on IMDb are almost 100% unanimous in their high praise of this very worthwhile and 'must-see' piece of entertainment."

However, perhaps because of this, the result is very exciting, even if you know how the affair ended.

This quality is due to acts of restraint that is being conducted throughout most of the film's attempt to connect and ""Captain Phillips"" as a whole is expected to avoid the kind of heroic and commonplaces. Hanks plays the movie guru who does his job. He demonstrates efficacy but also some cold, but it reveals an essential component of professional effectiveness, especially in times of trial. Since Hanks conducted so throughout most of the film, the exposure of humanity and the fragility of the character he plays is so effective. I assumed the role of being the best player not notice the work and effort he invested in them, and to Captain Phillips, ""it's just a good movie, this ability comes from one of the peaks, even when restraint is replaced with emotion erupts."
"sandnair87","9","0","2","8 February 2016"," Paul Greengrass is Without a Doubt The 'Captain' of This Ship!
","'Captain Phillips' opens in Underhill, Vermont, as our titular Captain Richard Phillips prepares to depart for Africa, bemoaning the elevated levels of competition that force him to take ever more dangerous assignments. He is the pragmatic captain of the Maersk Alabama, a freight ship tasked with transporting materials across Somalian waters. Cut to a beach in Somalia, where we are immediately engaged in a more cutthroat form of job competition, as penniless men offer meager bribes to gain employment as pirates. Here, we meet Muse, a violently ambitious pirate, who is seen as low on the totem pole of an assemblage of money-hungry pirates until he overpowers one of them physically, and then assumes leadership of the group. They observe ships on the water like hyenas waiting for one to wander from the herd, and when the Alabama's course takes it away from the primary formation, they seize an opportunity to pursue – and then capture – the ship for purposes of thievery. Phillips' attempt to prevent the hijacking is a failure, and four pirates, including Muse, manage to get on board with heavy artillery. And from that point of time, it's a splendidly mounted, nerve-racking thrill ride, building to an almost unbearably tense climax.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a prime example of Hollywood's unrivaled ability to rapidly reprocess a story from headline to marquee. Captain Phillips' aesthetic is vintage Paul Greengrass: cinema of the moment with a festering voyeurism so insular it barely seems to exist beyond the boundaries of the frame. He brilliantly employs his punishing brand of verisimilitude to immerse the audience in a situation that many wouldn't want to experience even vicariously. The script, adapted from the book written by the actual protagonist, is not romanticized or glossed over with overreaching sentiment, and Greengrass' direction matches it with a style that is consistently tenacious. From the first shot to the last, you feel that tremendous security you get when you are sure that the filmmaker is in total control of his material, as he mixes gritty realism with some stirring military ops for an edge of the seat piracy thriller.<br/><br/>The movie is anchored by performances as easily as it is by narrative details. The shy and unassuming Barkhad Abdi, steps into the role of Muse with sublime exactitude, and his eyes occupy a quality that suggests he isn't simply reciting dialogue; it's as if he believes he is participating in the conflict. Tom Hanks gives Captain Phillips a thoroughly human portrayal, convincing us how an ordinary man does extraordinary things in the face of death. He puts every ounce of his charm to good use but digs deep into a character with such raw and emotional fervency that there is little hint of us consciously accepting it as a mere performance.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a gripping, grueling, agonizing, brutalizing, kick-punching motion picture, but beyond the technical thrills and vise-grip tension, it also is a dynamite lesson of the human psyche."

Of course, I'm sure that it wasn't entirely accurate, as few films of this nature are.<br/><br/>There have been quite a few challenges by the crew members of the ship which is the subject of this film, contending that Phillips is not the hero which the film portrays him to be. Well... Those crew members were there, and I was not. It's just as likely that they are telling the truth as that they are lying, as far as most of us are concerned.<br/><br/>So... On the merits of the film itself... It's a pretty good flick, and it's believable. It's tense. It's certainly not an ""Action Film""... definitely more of a drama. It's basically a broad character study of Captain Phillips and a couple of the Somali pirates. Why are they here? Why are they doing this? What are their true goals and motivations? That kind of stuff.<br/><br/>These character studies do get interesting. The Somali characters let a few clues slip about the situation at hand... ""I have bosses, too"" ... etc. One gets the feeling that the REAL antagonists in this film will never be seen... and, in fact, they are not.

","Sometimes movies almost write themselves. Many of us who remember following the news of the 2009 hijacking of the commercial ship Maersk Alabama and the kidnapping of its captain may also remember thinking how the saga played out much like a movie. Then, 2013 gave us ""Captain Phillips"" (PG-13, 2:14). Of course, there's much more to the story than those news reports were able to tell us at the time. A quick internet search would give you the history of this event, but I'll still restrict myself to just setting up the plot, as I'd do in any other review, in case you want to see the story unfold as if for the first time.<br/><br/>Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is the Maersk Alabama's wise and experienced captain, guiding his cargo ship down the coast of eastern Africa when the vessel is attacked by Somali pirates. Phillips knows that these are dangerous waters and even has his crew drill and prepare for a potential piracy situation, but no one on the ship imagines that it will actually happen to them. When it does, both captain and crew show bravery, resourcefulness and smarts that stymie the pirates' plan to hold the ship for ransom. This leads the pirates to use the ship's enclosed life boat to get away, but with Captain Phillips as their hostage. This sets up a race against time with the U.S. Navy working to save Captain Phillips before the pirates can get him back to Somalia and ransom him to secure the payoff that they feel is their due.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is superb. Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances of his impressive career. Every fear, every calculation, every bit of pain is etched across his face, while his righteous defiance undergirds it all. The pirates are played by four Americans (and real-life friends) of Somali descent (impressively led by Barkhad Abdi) and are all first-time actors. Still, they imbue their characters with an authenticity that makes us fear them and a humanity that stops short of making us sympathize with them, but helps us understand them. Paul Greengrass (who also directed the 2nd and 3rd movies in the ""Bourne"" franchise and the underrated ""United 93"") again shows that he's a master of tension and pacing. He makes this story fascinating to watch, even if you remember what happened during those four dramatic days. ""A"""

","Captain Phillips, the gut-wrenching story of a merchant vessel captain taken captive by Somali pirates, who was rescued by a Navy SEAL team in the Gulf of Aden. Some moments of high drama, with a little PC nod to how rough it is for young Somali thrown in (probably close to true). The take-down of the pirates was great action, but was far enough from what actually happened that it sort of spoiled it for me (sorry if this spoils it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie), but is still a great movie to watch, as it does give a good sense of the danger to world merchant shipping from piracy. Some great nods in the flick to the commercial greed that motivates the practice. Great shots of Navy ships and personnel in action."

","As the movie starts Phillips is on his way to perform his duty as a Captain of ship. This movie shows the intelligence of a Captain and his sacrifice for his team. Being careful while taking charge as a Captain( Tom Hanks ) uses all his tactics when he got to know that his ship is going to be attacked by Pirates. Despite of all his tactical moves the Somalians captured the ship. This is the next phase of the movie. Here comes, Barkhad Abdi as a Somalian pirate who does anything for money. His action is at its best. As usual the two time Oscar winner Tom Hanks lived the character of a Captain. The Gang of pirates entered the ship evading all the attacks by the ship crew. This shows the undaunted spirit of the pirates. As they can't capture the ship because of the intelligent maneuvers by the ship crew. At last, on a deal in which they have to leave the ship they cheated and kept Tom Hanks as a hostage. The US Navy will try its best to get back Tom Hanks. But the decision of the SEAL leader at the end is marvelous. Then, Captain is back with his family. This is a good narration of a life story."

Proffecianalism is polished through out years filming in some of the best movies Hollywood has ever seen. <br/><br/>3) ordinary life of a ship captan. Not many of us can understand it clearly, but it seems that Mr Hanks mastered it easily. <br/><br/>Also, would like to thanks all the other actors (the ship's crew and the Pirates) for their great performance and remarkable play. Thank you guys!"
"andrewschmid","8","0","1","28 August 2015"," Fantastic Movie, Poor Dialogue in Beginning
","Captain Phillips was a brilliant movie, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. The storyline is so powerful and emotional that I thought that it would be incredibly difficult to create a movie that could convey the emotions and feelings. I am happy to say that the movie surprised me in that I felt the emotions and really connected with the characters. The movie portrayed Captain Phillips very well, and the ending scenes were so packed with raw emotion and pain that I began to tear up (which is quite rare for a movie).<br/><br/>The sole reason why this is not a 10/10 for me is that in the very beginning of the movie there is a dialog scene in the beginning that is awful. On the ride from his house to the airport or dock, Captain Phillips and his wife discuss how the world is changing and their kids' lives. I guess that this was meant to foreshadow the plot and make us see another side of Captain Phillips, but this is not just the worst dialogue in the movie, but it is some of the clunkiest dialogue I have ever seen. As a person who really focuses on the dialogue when rating movies, this left a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the film. For nearly every fantastic conversation in the rest of the movie, I would think back to this scene and wonder why it was so horrible. The worst part was that the scene could have been cut out altogether and the story of the film wouldn't change at all.<br/><br/>As nearly every other review will tell you, the movie is great as a whole. The rest of the film is beautiful and full of important moments. I would be hard-pressed to find a spot that could have been cut out without harming the movie's plot line. The characters are well developed and there isn't a person who doesn't belong in the story.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a great film."

","LOVED IT! I wish I didn't need to write 10 whole lines, as truth be told I don't often read anyone else's entire review..... but I understand that there is a difference in making a useless comment and offering a legitimate review for the benefit of other viewers. I only read IMDb reviews to determine if the majority of people watching thought the movie was worth watching. It is for that reason I like to keep my note short and to the point. The movie was the best I've seen in a while. I was a translator in the military and I love watching movies like this. LOVE them and this one was great! Tom Hanks was awesome (!!!!!!!!!) and his character is by every possible definition a hero. A hero gets everyone he is responsible for out alive with as little violence as possible. <br/><br/>As far as other people have written with regards to showing a softer, more understanding side to piracy........ I have to say I don't think it's necessary. The pirates in this movie were truly terrifying and got a fitting end. Yes, there are much more complicated issues surrounding the unsettling reasons that lead to piracy but every story doesn't have to be a sympathetic discussion on why someone became an a@@hole. I think some things are clear cut, if you want to engage in violent behavior, armed robbery, kidnapping, battery, etc......you sort of deserve to be shot in the head."
"vishaal811","9","0","2","8 June 2015"," A Solid Thriller
","The premise of this movie is based on the real-life story of Captain Phillips. It involves the invasion of the ship by Somali pirates who are looking to make a quick buck. Here, they capture Tom Hanks and use him as a hostage in order to get their money. The acting is pretty realistic and Tom Hanks is memorable as he is able to display the raw emotions of a survivor. The US Navy is shown quite professionally which makes the story much more credible. The movie is well-shot and visually it has a gritty look. The young Somali actor deserves credit for having a brilliant screen presence and giving an authentic portrayal of pirates. Most of the movie involves negotiations between the three pirates, who had taken Captain Phillips as their hostage, and the officials of the US Navy whose objective is to bring back Captain Phillips and not allow the pirates to escape. The movie is quite exciting and worth a watch."
"Screen_Blitz","9","0","2","17 May 2015"," Fantastic, nail-biting biopic thriller puts you at the edge of your seat
","Paul Greengrass, a visionary filmmaker who rose to fame for giving birth the exhilarating Bourne trilogy has returned to the director's chair to tackle a much different story than a gun-totting CIA agent hunting down the bad guys.The picture is a re-imagining of the terrifying event that took place in the Indian Ocean in April 2009. That story was the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama by the hands of Somalian pirates. The victim of this startling event was Captain Richard Phillips who made a courageous, if questionable choice for putting his life on the line for the sake of his crew members. The inspiring event are greatly transpired by Greengrass who reprises his signature use of documentary-style filmmaking and top-notch direction to plunge viewers into the shoes of the titular character stranded in a terrifying situation, one that meant life or death. And Greengrass scores what transcends to a heart-pounding, survival experience without straying into the territory of extravagance. Tom Hanks plays the title character, who leads his crew on a voyage to Kenya, only have to his cargo ship, the MV Maersk Alabama hijacked by Somali pirates who take him and his crew hostage in exchange for money. The pirates are lead by the hard-edged Captain Muse (played by Barkhad Abdi) who along his petty crew then takes Captain Phillips hostage and threatens him in tension-fueled battle of wills with the no one to help him but the U.S Navy who arrive to the rescue. <br/><br/>Paul Greengrass effectively crafts a gritty, nail-biting that's destined to lead viewers gripping at the edge of their seats, and the only aspect sugarcoating the terrifying true event maybe the PG-13 rating (there is one gruesome moment). Regardless of us knowing what the final outcome will be, it is a scary ride to sit through. Greengrass takes on the task of building up the atmosphere through the first twenty minutes while establishing the central character as a smart, humanized man who's unaware of the unspeakable terror that awaits him. From the opening minutes of the arrival of the Somali Pirates, the film quickly steers from a calm slowburner to a heart-pounding, tension-ridden powerhouse as Captain Phillips is unpleasantly pulled into a fateful battle of wills and sacrifice against the sadistic Captain Abduwali Muse. That is where a bold, uncompromising performance by Barkhad Abdi comes in, with his audacious line ""Look at me, I'm the captain now"". Abdi boasts a spectacular sense of menace in his role that bravely becomes a helping hand of the suspenseful atmosphere. With Phillips captured and incarcerated by the Somali pirates in a small boat for the majority of the second half, Barry Ackroyd successfully captures the claustrahpobia and the heat of the central character's conflict with documentary-style cinematography that's become a staple to Greengrass's filmography. As with Tom Hanks, he does an amazing job with capturing the humility and fear of his real-life inspired role, something many could expect from a two-time Oscar winner.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a mesmerizing survival thriller crafted with diligence and substance by visionary director Paul Greengrass who knocks the ball out of the park. This is a tension-fueled ride with blistering suspense and uncompromising performances by Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi. To satisfying results, the film pays an inspiring tribute to the terrifying story."
"georgecoffeynewyorker","9","0","3","25 April 2015"," Great film, Can see why it got several Oscars
","I can see why Captain Phillips won several Oscars in 2013. It tells the true story of a Captain Phillips whose ship Maesrk Alabama was hijacked by Somali Pirates. Philips(Hank) warns the crew, of the impending hijack. They successfully prevent them, however on the 2nd run, they climb aboard the ship. Captain Phillips himself is put into the Lifeboat, as the plans weren't set out as thought. Very well performed. I actually felt Captain Phillips emotions, me heart racing etc., etc., Well played and acted out. Classic quote as well: ""Look at me, ""(Somali Pirate), ""sure""(Hanks), ""Look at me, I'm the Captain Now""(Somali Pirate). I always repeat this."
"Christopher_Reid","8","0","2","21 April 2015"," Engaging and tense with very good acting
","Tom Hanks carries this movie. I don't know how, I think it's his humanity. He's vulnerable but not weak, clever but makes mistakes, professional but afraid and he takes risks. His life doesn't seem exciting but it seems real. He doesn't want to die, he doesn't want his ship to get taken over or stolen from. We see the struggle between his rationality and emotions. He's in most scenes and makes them worthwhile. Gives us a lens to see them through, or something like that.<br/><br/>I was worried the movie might be boring, the same old formula I've seen too many times. A tense hostage situation, culture clashes, people crying and shouting and arguing, making dumb decisions, jumping between extreme emotional states. Why do we even watch this kind of stuff? And the whole thing's on a boat? How is that going to be entertaining for a whole movie? Well, somehow it works pretty well. I think mainly because it feels completely real and it's sincere. No phony emotions or speeches or moments. It's generally quite exciting because the stakes are high but there are so many different possible outcomes. You don't know where the film is going or how it will turn out. The situation changes over time. There's often good news and bad news.<br/><br/>Was Captain Phillips reckless for going through areas known for the presence of Somali pirates? Maybe, I don't really know. It does seem unnecessarily risky. Is the movie about his braveness or toughness, his ability to survive? I'm not sure. I think it's more about the experience itself. It's an intense ride that doesn't stop. Sometimes scary, sometimes more calm. It gives a new context to your regular life. Shows what you're made of, brings out a different side of you. Maybe you'll like what you'll see and maybe you won't. You might not have known you had that inner strength. You might have deep regrets about what you did on that fateful day.<br/><br/>The final scenes are the most powerful, after things have been ""resolved"". We finally get a break from the highly strung events of the past couple of hours. We start to see it all in context, the reality of it, that it wasn't a dream or a nightmare. We realise how intense it all was. I often find I sweat more after I stop exercising. Similarly, it seems the shock only really hits the characters after the events of this movie are over.<br/><br/>The camera work does it's job and isn't distracting. There is no preaching or forcing of us as to what to think or feel. The focus is on characters, choices, arguments, escalating tension, hidden motivations, lies and attempts to uncover them. The 4 pirates are all new actors and they do incredibly well. They're just people but they're edgy. They are certainly human but perhaps from a casually violent background that is difficult to comprehend and understand.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie achieves what it sets out to do. It captures a variety of emotional states, you can argue about how things might have turned out differently and whether people made the right decisions or not. This is not a deep movie but in many ways it's quite a powerful experience. It was far more engaging than I had expected."
"jimbo-53-186511","8","0","2","14 March 2015"," Fantastic performances from Hanks & Abdi and just a brilliant piece of cinema all round
","I vaguely recall hearing about this story back in 2009 and remember being quite shocked by the events that had occurred. When I heard that these events were being adapted into a film I was keen to see how it panned out and I was pleasantly surprised by how good this film actually is.<br/><br/>I'll admit that I was initially concerned about watching this film due to the fact that it is about 130 minutes long. I was worried that there would be a long and boring build-up before getting to the 'meat' of the action, but that really isn't the case here as the film gets going very early on - so there's very little opportunity for getting bored. Another thing I liked about it was that it kept me guessing; I'll admit that I was impressed by the battle of wits that ended up ensuing between Captain Phillips' crew and the Somali pirates. It was an intense cat and mouse game and more often than not Phillips' crew would employ a brains over brawn tactic. I must admit that this film was far from predictable and really did keep me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Next we come to the acting performances; I'm sure many people have already commented on Barkhad Abdi's performance as Muse (the leader of the Somali crew) and he truly was brilliant. The academy clearly also acknowledged his performance by Oscar nominating him for best supporting actor (although he didn't win). I'm still finding it hard to believe that this was his debut picture. What a start!! Any actor (regardless of experience) who can hold their own against the great Tom Hanks will always get the utmost respect from me so Barkhad Abdi I take my hat off to you sir! Then we come to Tom Hanks; a man whose reputation proceeds him and he's still continuing to deliver the goods. I think part of what makes this film work is that the actors are so good that I sometimes forget that I'm watching a film and I just found myself immersed in the action - I felt like I was there on the boat with Hanks, I felt his pain and anguish and really cared for his character and all his crew. I really love it when filmmakers can get me this involved with their work and as mentioned this is due to a combination of non-stop intensity and believable and gritty performances from all involved.<br/><br/>As well as all the above, Captain Phillips also benefits from some beautiful cinematography, sharp editing & directing. Even though I praised the film for not having a long and boring build-up, I still felt that it's still perhaps a tad too long at 130 minutes, but that is a very minor criticism. Aside from that, the film was pretty much flawless.<br/><br/>This is an excellent film that lovers of biopics or just general lovers of cinema simply shouldn't miss. Maersk Alabama was the first ship to be hi-jacked in over 200 years and I really hope nothing like this ever happens again. Captain Phillips takes you on an emotional and intense journey that you won't forget about in a hurry."
"nalimradek","9","0","2","8 March 2015"," Fine acting performance from Tom Hanks and a near perfect acting debut for Barkhad Abdi.
","When this film came out, the plot, the setting, the choice of actors all seemed to tick the boxes for me. A tense nerve-wracking thriller based on a true story and the best bit of all, featuring Tom Hanks, one of the most talented and influential actors of all time. This seemed like a perfect opportunity for Hanks to shine and deliver another one of his near perfect portrayals and I can now safely say that this film exceeded my expectations because of his performance and his co-star Barkhad Abdi's, who single-handedly each provided two near perfect depictions of the hero and the villain.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a tense, nail-biting thriller that tells the story of Richard Phillips and his run-in with Somali pirates whilst delivering cargo on his ship. This film revolves around two key settings, SPOILERS AHEAD....<br/><br/>On his ship and on a lifeboat that the pirates commandeered from Phillips' cargo vessel. Not going into too much detail surrounding the story at each point, I'll only say that the scenes on the ship aren't as tense as the scenes on the lifeboat but are extremely nail-biting nonetheless. Near the end of the film, again, SPOILERS AHEAD....<br/><br/>When Hanks' escapes the lifeboat with the help of the US Navy, he gives a performance that can only be described as being worthy of an Oscar. Also a particularly chilling scene that involves the demise of the pirates shows Hanks portray Phillips' emotions at that point perfectly.<br/><br/>On the other hand, his co-star, Barkhad Abdi delivers a blood-curdling interpretation in his role as the main Somalian pirate, 'Muse'. Despite Abdi having no experience in acting, his portrayal of the titular villain ultimately earned him an Oscar nomination despite constantly being overshadowed by Hanks. Don't get me wrong, he delivers an extremely powerful performance but when you put an Oscar winning actor like Tom Hanks in with an actor with little to no acting experience, it's quite obvious who'll be the better of the two.<br/><br/>Overall this film provided a tense cinematic experience that combined the outstanding acting of the two main stars with the horrifying real-life ordeal of Captain Richard Phillips. The film itself was a rarity in that it featured an Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks and was good enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. However this film had one minor flaw that people might find extremely irritating, which is that despite the story being completely true to life, all the little details in the film weren't all correct. Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and I consider it to be one of Hanks' finest pieces of work and is definitely a potentially Oscar worthy film."

","There are two standout performances in this.. Barkhad Abdi as the pirate leader and obviously Tom Hanks himself. Abdi was phenomenal given that this was his film debut, he showed why he was cast as this role in the worldwide search for it. <br/><br/>There are so many moments throughout the film which I loved involving the two actors. <br/><br/>I thought a nice touch my Greengrass was the way it ended with the nurse telling Captain Phillips that ""everything was going to be OK"".. because this repeated the words spoken by the pirate leader to Captain Phillips throughout his capture. It made me smile.<br/><br/>The scene that proves to me why exactly in my head I deem Tom Hanks as the best actor, is actually that last scene. I have actually read too that the scene wasn't actually in the script, that it was improvised! For those unfamiliar with the scene or who have forgotten it, it is the scene where Captain Phillips has been brought aboard the US Navy ship at the end after being rescued, and is brought in to get checked out by the nurse on board. Personally I feel that it is astonishingly brilliant performing.. especially given that it is improvised and was just added in last minute. In those minutes of watching Hanks speak with the nurse, you see how what he has just endured throughout his capture has effected him enormously... as he struggles to comes to terms with being free and answering simple questions. It's so powerful to watch and I'm not ashamed to say my eyes welled up watching this film both times at that part!"

","Captain Phillips 8.5/10- Based on the real-life hijacking of the Maesrk Alabama, Captain Phillips is a brilliantly directed film by Paul Greengrass with riveting performances by Tom Hanks and the newcomer Barkhad Abdi who plays Muse, the leader of the armed pirates.<br/><br/>The movie is great largely because of the always great actor, Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks, who plays Captain Phillips, might have had the best performance of his career since ""Forrest Gump."" Barkhad Abdi makes every single person in the theater believe that he actually is an actual Somali pirate. Paul Greengrass does not just show captain Phillips as the good guy and Muse as the bad guy. He gives Muse heart, he shows how the pirates are still people too and it works like a charm. The design of the ship and the life boat was extremely realistic . Captain Phillips is one of the most intense movies of the year and it keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire movie guaranteed. I dare someone to fall asleep in Captain Phillips. I forgot about the pirate incident that took place a few years ago and seeing this movie got me to remember how intense of a situation it was for Captain Phillips whose heroic actions saved his crew. The movie made me feel like I was there and it did not even seem like it was a movie as much as someone filming the actual events with a very good camera. Captain Phillips is one of those movies that everyone goes to the movie theater to watch, one of those films where you completely forget everything going on in your life and you are just watching a movie. This movie was a great start to awards season and this is bound to be nominated for several Oscars and even win a couple. <br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a great movie that anyone with a brain can enjoy and it is no doubt worth the ten dollar ticket admission.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"
"dfa120374","8","0","2","16 January 2015"," Absolute First Class Action Drama
","I'll admit that when I first saw trailers for this movie I wasn't too impressed. It just looked like an average run-of-the-mill ""based on true events"" drama. I'm glad I changed my mind, though, as Captain Phillips is one of the best movies I've seen in a LONG time.<br/><br/>Firstly, the casting was absolutely spot on and for his first acting event, Barkhad Abdi is absolutely fantastic and is well deserving of all nominations and awards he has received for his role as Muse, the lead Somali pirate. The other three actors - Barkhad Abdirahman as Bilal, Faysal Ahmed as Najee, and Mahat M. Ali as Elmi - all do a stand-up job also. As for Tom Hanks, well, what more can be said really? He delivers once again.<br/><br/>You might think that at almost 2¼ hours long it's pretty drawn out, but nothing could be further from the truth. It doesn't take long to get going and the suspense just continues to build from there on in.<br/><br/>I've actually read reviews about how ""unbelievable"" it is that only 4 pirates manage to board & take over such a large cargo ship. I guess these people never knew that this film is actually based on true events and it wasn't just a matter of Hollywood hamming up another storyline. Even if it was a Hollywood thing....the Pirates had semi-automatic rifles and handguns so compare that to the cargo ship's water cannons and NO guns and it would have been relatively simple for these pirates to have boarded such a big vessel.<br/><br/>When watching the film, you kind of feel a certain amount of sympathy for Muse because of where he comes from and his background. I know that that doesn't condone his actions of pirating, but he does actually draw a certain amount of sympathy. Then again, if he was a hothead like Bilal it might have had a different feel to it and been a different story.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is one of those classic must-see movies and is actually deserving of the ""must-see"" tag. Absolutely fantastic film that deserves every plaudit received."
"The Grand Master","9","0","2","8 January 2015"," Excellent movie and a strong performance from Tom Hanks
","Captain Phillips tells the emotionally charged true story of the titular Captain Richard Phillips who is caught up in a hijacking when a small crew of Somali pirates take over his cargo ship the MV Maersk Alabama in April 2009 while at sea in the Somali Coast.<br/><br/>The story also tells both sides of Captain Phillips and his fight to survive and to keep his crew alive, as well as the Somali pirates led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi) who are desperate to capture the cargo ship and its crew in order to hold it to ransom. In order to stay alive and keep his crew alive, Phillips must match wits with Muse and his gang of pirates, as well as count on the US Navy and later the Navy Seals to rescue him when the pirates later take him hostage on a lifeboat.<br/><br/>This movie is certainly not aiming to be a version of Die Hard or Under Siege and make out anyone to be the hero of the movie. Tom Hanks (well known to frequently play ordinary characters in extraordinary circumstances) gives a strong, compelling and certainly a very memorable performance as Captain Richard Phillips. It was a shame that Tom Hanks did not receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance as this is certainly one of his best performances right up there with Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and Cast Away.<br/><br/>Barkhad Abdi gives an excellent performance as Muse, the intelligent Somali pirate who leads his small crew to hijack the cargo ship. Considering the fact Barkhad Abdi had no prior acting experience, he is excellent and he received a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. I do hope to see him in another movie or TV show.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is very tense and suspenseful (in particular the last 30 minutes is very intense). The movie captures the audiences attention and does not let anyone go for one moment. There is not a dull or wasted moment in the entire movie nor does it seem overlong at any stage. This is certainly an excellent example of no-nonsense filmmaking at its best. Paul Greengrass (well known for The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum) does a brilliant job as a director. I knew some of the background of the story previously but not the entire story. Captain Phillips tells the story very well and won't be forgotten any time soon.<br/><br/>9/10"
"siderite","8","0","2","6 January 2015"," Oh, I thirsted for a good realistic movie
","The movie addresses a real case, the pirate hijacking of a US cargo ship near the Somali waters. Tom Hanks plays very well, as expected, although I found his character not very challenging most of the time. There are some scenes, though, that required an actor of Hank's caliber and he totally pulled through.<br/><br/>Another thing I appreciated was that the film doesn't go over the top with drama or special effects. It is mostly a character driven film and both Hanks and Abdi are very good in their roles. As far as I could dig up, the film is also pretty realistic, true to the actual events. Needless to say, this is exceedingly rare in American ""based on real events"" movies.<br/><br/>An interesting fact is that this ship was the first US ship to be hijacked by pirates since 1815. It would have been a big blow to US if the pirates would have succeeded. The film hints of this in a single scene where the rescuers are instructed that Philips getting to Somalia is not an option, otherwise it is pretty difficult to understand why three US battleships participate in the rescue of a single man and why they were prepared to sink the rescue boat if the negotiations would have failed.<br/><br/>All in all I am not sorry that I watched this film. It needs a certain ""real events"" mood to enjoy it thoroughly. Well acted, well directed, I really needed a movie that was not disrespecting the viewer with pure fantasy or/and a shitty script and trying to compensate with pretty explosions."
"g-bodyl","9","0","2","22 December 2014"," A Lightning-Tense Thriller!
","Captain Phillips hearkens upon a story based off contemporary global issues and one of these issues is pirates. Not Blackbeard-style pirates, but more along the lines of modern Somalian pirates whom prey upon ships in their waters. This movie is a riveting tale about once incident in 2009 and how the Americans, led by Richard Phillips and the pirates try to outfox each other. The film is nothing short of tense and taut and if the film was even tenser, your mind would explode in half. This is the cat-and-mouse game at its finest. The acting is great and I even liked the shaky-camera route, as the film does have some Bourne elements to it.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass, the man behind the Jason Bourne sequels and United 93, directs a film about a captain of a merchant ship, Richard Phillips is taken hostage by Somalian pirates, led by Abduwali Muse. Trying to stay alive and make it home safely, Phillips must stay ahead of the game and predict every move Muse will make.<br/><br/>The film has fantastic acting. Tom Hanks is splendid as always and one of the emotional scenes involves him in the very end. As good as Hanks is, it might surprise you that newcomer Barkhad Abdi matches everything Hanks delivers and their scenes together are just powerful. It's very uncommon to have an actor come out of nowhere and be nominated for an Oscar. That's how good Abdi was, especially when going head-to-head with Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>Overall, Captain Phillips is an excellent movie that sheds light on how piracy is a problem in Africa/the Middle East and the dangers they pose on American ships. The film is written very well and it has some of the best dialog of 2013. The interchange between Hanks and Abdi just shows it all. Like what he did in United 93, Greengrass takes a true story and keeps it grounded without sacrificing any of the emotion that is required to keep the characters interesting. This is another success for Greengrass and a taut, tense thriller on the whole. I rate this film 9/10."

","It's a thrilling movie, I enjoyed it. What bothers me though how the story was supposed to affect me—sympathy for the good guy (victim, ie. the captain)—but Captain Phillips confused me by maneuvering this feeling toward the antagonists.<br/><br/>From the start of the movie to the finish, I have more sympathy toward the antagonist. It seemed from the start, the protagonists have all the benefit; from the number of them (crew), the familiarity of their own vessel's territory, then the number of the military and how effective their communication as opposed to the four antagonists.<br/><br/>If, hypothetically, you forget that the antagonists are the one who take over the vessel, then maybe you'll hope that they're succeeding their venture. It's weird that it seems the captain acted so much as he's in authority. Moreover, sometimes it insulted my intelligence—wasting time finding other crew? Negotiating by coming inside alone into the military vessel?<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is thrilling and I enjoyed much as well as it bothered me, because it threw all my feeling over to all directions throughout the entire movie's duration."

Plus, we know nothing or feel nothing towards the captain's family,its genuinely only between the captain and the three pirates.

","The ever political and sometimes controversial Paul Greengrass directed Captain Phillips after making his disappointing rant of film Green Zone. Teaming up with Tom Hanks and writer Billy Ray Captain Phillips tells the true story of the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama and the ransoming of Richard Phillips, a merchant sailor by Somali pirates.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is one of Greengrass' more balanced films showing regular people playing a small part in international system. The American navy is treated respectfully, doing their job when trying to save one of their citizens and the pirates themselves are painted in more shades of grey, making them more human. Greengrass is strong with true life stories and Captain Phillips plays to his strengths, realism and looking at wider operations. Captain Phillips is a very well acted film and Greengrass' shaky cam is toned down, making the cinematography much more effective.<br/><br/>Greengrass keeps a fast pace going throughout the film, with the best part being the pirates attacking the ship and the crew having to outwit the heavily armed men. There is a slight dip when the action moves to a lifeboat, but picks up again when the Navy gets involved.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a big improvement to Green Zone and stands along side with United 93 as Greengrass tells the story of a real life event."
"camloveless","8","0","3","24 September 2014"," Good action thriller with great acting throughout the film.
","Captain Phillips<br/><br/>According to the Navy, there has been nine successful piracy attacks this year opposed to the 34 successful in 2011 and 68 in 2010. In 2009, the hijacking of Captain Richard Phillip's cargo was reflected upon in a series of books he wrote to inform other people bout his drastic day at sea. In 2013 director Paul Greengrass acquired these stories and began to contract another heart throbbing film Captain Phillips. Phillips, played by world famous actor Tom Hanks, portrayed a significant amount of bravery during the hijacking of his cargo ship by Somalian pirates. <br/><br/>The film is mainly about a group of men who work for the union and are ordered to deliver cargo to Mombasa, Somalia's neighbor. Under the leadership of Captain Richard Phillips, the men work hard and stay strong despite being attacked by Somalian Pirates. The pirates are not knowledgeable of the ship or much technology and Phillips uses that to their advantage to help alleviate the situation. The Somalian's know the territory and recognize U.S tactics and refuse to give up.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass did an absurd job choosing his cast and using Tom Hanks who has starred in many popular movies. Hanks is not known for being in thriller movies, but does an incredible job in Captain Phillips. Greengrass held a casting call in Minneapolis in which 700 people tried out for the final spot, Abduwali Muse. Muse was the leader of all the Somalian Pirates who's movie famous line was ""I'm the captain now."" He made a brilliant decision by picking Barkhad Abdi, a Somalian native who moved to Minnesota when he was only 14. Captain Phillips was Abdi's first in the film industry and he definitely started out with a bang. He ended up winning the screen actors guild award for the best supporting actor and an Academy award for the best supporting actor.<br/><br/>In my opinion Greengrass did not use much of a suspenseful tone. I think the movie needed a little more of a buildup of suspense so it could have more of the thriller aspect to it. Greengrass did create good suspense when the pirates hitched their latter onto the boat. The background noise went silent when this happened.<br/><br/>This film is so intriguing because everyone's image of a pirate is Captain Jack Sparrow who is a witty, funny, drunk and sarcastic pirate. Very few people realize that piracy is a true threat to ships traveling through the horn of Africa. The Somalian people live in poverty and piracy is one of their main ways of bringing in money to the community.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Greengrass did a tremendous job showing the world a real life situation of what Richard Phillips and his men struggled through. The actors he picked were perfect for the way he needed to relay the story to the world. Hanks and Abdi both did phenomenal jobs even though Hanks did not win an Academy award and Abdi did. Life is challenging in many parts of Africa and piracy is a common method of bringing in revenue. People should see this movie to create a better image of real piracy in their mind. This movie did an outstanding job displaying how Somalian people live in poverty and piracy is okay in their culture. So if you ever find yourself in the horn of Africa, watch out for pirates! Captain Richard Phillips and his crew displayed an immense amount of courage throughout the hijacking of their cargo ship."

","You demand an excellent Thriller with never pausing tension and tons of action, but not that typical pointless fight-scenes? - Hollywood serves this blockbuster.<br/><br/>There aren't a lot of movies that put you constantly under such a thrilling pressure without drifting into ridiculousness or missing story-development. This is not the typical action like oh, the main character is in danger all of the time, but hey, he's the main character so he won't die now"". Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) could get killed any moment and there aren't any vanilla fighting-scenes - they're unarmed civilians kept under control by pirates. So even if you aren't into action packed movies you'll enjoy this one none the less. Only a few films hold the tension on such a high level over the whole timespan, looking at this steady grip it's comparable to Gravity"" (2013).<br/><br/>Sadly the first half of the movie isn't as excellent as the second half, it's still unquestionable good, but not so overwhelming. If the start would be as well as the end this could be 8/10 easily. So there are some wide environment shots and close-ups in the beginning (the port and pirate camp etc.) with the typical army-inspired text describing location and time - come on Hollywood, why has every action film the exact same pictures you can't distinguish from others (this film has only few of them, but still it could've been without them). <br/><br/>Then there's Tom Hanks, starts to shine in the second half, why can't you give us that performance from the beginning? Sure he's good, but grows into a astonishing act only second half of the movie. I mean Captain Phillips probably got some emergency-training and the adrenalin does its job, but god, if there are some crazy pirates firing around like they don't care i'd sh*t my pants for sure.<br/><br/>Something i absolutely dislike about the film is the camera movement: Unsteady and restless, used to intensify the action. It's OK for the second half and you won't notice it after a certain time, but it's really disturbing in the beginning and doesn't fit the first half of the movie. You can overlook it, they have to use the same camera style cause of consistency (and there's no turning point where you can change your way of filming to express the change), but it's still a mistake.<br/><br/>Despite some additional unmentioned minor flaws (like this scene: Captain Phillips shouts a short sentence, repeats it two times, but the Somali don't realize what he says and don't get suspicious, even while they were talking English kinda well the whole movie), Director Paul Greengrass (known for Bourne-films) creates a very good action packed thriller, giving the main character more emotional depth than he usually does. I recommend this movie to everyone.<br/><br/>================================<br/><br/>my IMDb-rating scale <br/><br/>10 over the top / 9 perfect / 8 must see / 7 extremely good / 6 very good / 5 good / 4 OK / 3 so-so / 2 bad / 1 don't watch it ================================ <br/><br/>Additional Info: <br/><br/>The film was shot on real ships in the water instead of a studio with green walls and Tom Hanks even got seasick during the shooting - thumbs up! <br/><br/>I compared it to Gravity"" (2013), cause the tension curve is similar, but Captain Phillips"" doesn't have any artistic or stylistic components Gravity"" is known for."

","Based on the true story from 2009 of a cargo ship captain being hijacked by pirates.<br/><br/>Based on the true story from 2009 of a cargo ship captain being hijacked by pirates off the coast of Somalia, Captain Phillips is film full of suspense. Tom Hanks plays Captain Phillips as he prepares the best a person can prepare for the inevitability of pirates attempting to take his ship ransom.<br/><br/>Quickly the movie sets the foundation for Captain Phillips background, a captain who is doing a dangerous job, despite his wife's wishes, because there would be a line of men willing. Simultaneously the foundation is set for the pirates, boat loads of Somali men volunteering to hijack a ship, because this is a somber reality of life with no true alternative for livelihood. The crew, Navy, and audience wait as Richard Phillips is put in the perilous position of negotiator and hostage. The pirates are never as brutal as they have to be and the American crew members are never as heroic as they need to be.<br/><br/>Hanks does a more than adequate job as a sympathizer to the pirates, trying to get everyone out of the situation intact and alive. This selfless and heroic character is probably not accurate to the real Captain Phillips persona, but necessary as a counter view to the pirates' story. I found myself identifying with the pirates, hoping they would have some sense, despite knowing the end to the story. This is thanks in part to the main Somali pirate, Muse, played by Barkhad Abdi. I am thankful he has received as many accolades as he has, though not a trained actor, he turns out a multi-layered character under tragic circumstances.<br/><br/>This movie easily could have been a one-sided telling of the brutalities of the pirates, instead you get a multidimensional story that is more about the current effects of globalization than the thrilling encounter.<br/><br/>More reviews can be found at our website."
"johnnymurphy15","7","0","1","6 August 2014"," A solid thriller which explores both sides.
","The debate on the effects of globalisation is increasingly becoming an issue as time goes on, and while this is not a film about globalisation, it is certainly something which highlights the effects without being too overbearing about it.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks stars as Captain Richard Phillips, who is in charge of a container vessel delivering aid somewhere in the African continent. While crossing the Somali waters alone and unarmed, they are pursued by Somali pirates led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi) who intends to board the ship and hold them to ransom. After what is a rather thrilling chase, they board the ship and make their demands through Captain Phillips. After much deliberation, the pirates are given the money in their safe amounting to $30000. When the pirates leave in the lifeboat, they take Captain Phillips hostage as Muse makes demands for more money, which gets the American Navy involved.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass handles the film well. He succeeds in telling the story very clearly from many vantage points. We see the points of view of Captain Phillips and the key members of the crew, the pirates and the Navy. The cinematography reflects the frantic situation experienced from all these vantage points with the use of hand-held camera. The editing is fast paced and shows us the full story so the audience is never lost. As mentioned before, the main theme of globalisation is hinted at. At the start of the film, Captain Phillips is having a conversation with his wife Andrea (Catherine Keener) about his concerns of the increasingly competitive nature of the job market and how much more difficult it is for this generation in comparison to how it was in his day. Also later on in the film, Muse explains how he was a fisherman before he became a pirate. When corporations took all the fish from Somali waters, there was no alternative but to resort to crime for survival. It gets more interesting when Muse starts to loose his grip on reality. It seems to me that over the years, his demands have increased in proportion with his ambition of living a more Western lifestyle. He wants enough money to escape his impoverished nation. Of course, as the Navy are executing a perfectly planned operation to rescue Captain Phillips and making the situation more hopeless for the pirates, Muse continues to believe he is winning and that he is going to accomplish what he has demanded.<br/><br/>There is also the whole irony of how the pirates are hi-jacking a vessel which contains food and water help will help their people. The reason why aid is sent to these countries in the first place is because of globalisation, which is also the reason why these men take to the sea to rob American ships. For me, it explains the hopeless cycle of greed and crime, two integral benefactors of globalisation. While we make efforts to help the countries most effected, it is doing very little unless this cycle is eradicated.<br/><br/>The performances are very competent by the two leads. Tom Hanks as usual puts on a very solid performance. He pulls out more of his acting chops in the final half hour of the film. There were moments when I thought he would say something like 'You can't kill me, I have a FAMILY..I HAVE KIDS!' Fortunately, Paul Greengrass refuses to yield to this kind of cheesy sentimentality, instead opting for more human performances. Barkhad Abdi I feel had the most memorable role. I liked the fact that the pirates/terrorists were portrayed as desperate human beings resorting to crime rather than monsters which so many stupid action movies stoop so low by contributing to the continuity of this ridiculous narrative that the West are victims of an evil ideology hell bent on taking over the world.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a solid, well made film which reflects these times without rubbing it in your face. It is not set to be a classic, but a thrilling watch all the same."

","It's very hard to find thrillers these days that are actually thrilling the entire film. In Paul Greengrass's 'Captain Phillips' expect to be enthralled in the film the entire time. Tom Hanks plays a captain of a cargo ship headed from Somalia to Kenya in order to supply food for the hungry. The ship is sailing smooth until a group of Somali pirates hijack the ship, leaving Captain Phillips to become a leader and create a peaceful solution. The entire time you see the difficult situations Captain Phillips has to make in order to protect his crew. When the U.S. government gets involved in the story, expect your heart to beat a little faster. The intensity Paul Greengrass captures provides pure entertainment that isn't forced in the slightest. His artistic vision makes this film seem like your watching a videotape from the actual event, instead of a brilliant motion picture starring an Academy Award winning actor. The editing makes it feel as real as possible. The pirates are amazing, especially the leader played by Bakhard Abdi. Tom Hanks gives another Oscar-worthy performance as Captain Phillips. What's really special about this film is that the screenwriter Billy Ray doesn't portray the pirates as the ""bad guys"" and Captain Phillips as the ""good guy."" He tells a story in the eyes of many people and provides genius character development. Any storyteller can watch CNN and make an intense true story a film, but Billy Ray really tells a story instead of an event. Even knowing how the film ends due to watching the real news story I was still shaking rapidly due to the intensity. Not a single second of the film is over-done. Every actor is cast perfectly and you'll see a great story of leadership from Tom Hanks as American hero Captain Phillips. If you want to see world class film making and have fun at the cinema, check this one out."
"martochary","6","0","1","26 May 2014"," The script has a couple of issues, but it's still good.
","I did like this movie, I suppose. It's pretty well acted, VERY well directed, and I really liked that we get some brief moments of sympathy with our antagonists. The introductory scene showing the Somalian's way of life right after we're shown our main American character's: clever. Some throwaway lines here and there makes you realize what our protagonist is going through is what these people go through on a daily basis and I applaud this movie for humanizing terrorists instead of making them evil for the sake of being evil. AND begin subtle about it. That's not something you see every day in a Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>Now, I do have some problems with the script... The story needs the protagonist to be an incompetent genre-blind idiot. Otherwise, HOW THE HELL WOULD 4 PIRATES ON A MOTORBOAT YOU CLEARLY SAW COMING TAKE OVER A CARGO SHIP? You mean to tell me that an American crew, American, you know, the kind of people that would blow up their own buildings as an excuse to justify blowing up other countries, HAVE NO GUNS WHATSOEVER? Knowing that getting attacked by terrorists was a possibility in Somalian waters?<br/><br/>And then we have an opportunity to make a hostage exchange and the captain is not smart enough to realize that these people aren't satisfied with 30000 dollars and will try to kidnap someone, so he just jumps into the freaking boat WHILE THEY STILL HAVE LEVERAGE like a moron? If you're dumb enough to fall for that, sir, you DESERVE it.<br/><br/>And finally, TWO army ships, with an operation involving at least 70 people and all sorts of fancy military tech, just to rescue ONE GUY? It's not like he's a diplomat or a minister or anyone important, just some guy. Are you kidding me? Children die by thousands in Africa, women all over the world are being kidnapped for human trafficking but we need 70 trained professionals and at least 100000 dollars in fuel and equipment just to take one guy back from some terrorists because he was dumb enough to get caught, against all odds. Oh that's right. Because he's white and American, people care.<br/><br/>Again, it isn't a bad film, far from it, but the script needs our main character to be an idiot and the US army to be willing to spend a small fortune to get said idiot back, otherwise the film would end when people did the sensible thing and just didn't let the Somalians board the ship to begin with. It kept bothering me and ruined the experience."

Tom Hanks is perfect as the Captain, who we learn is methodical and thorough, and cares about doing things right. The early dialogue with his wife and his crew show him to be quiet but firm and respectful. Hanks plays this with fine focus. (SPOILERS NOW) There's a lot of business on board (including an emergency drill involving pirates) before the real deal turns up, and then the film shifts gear and gathers speed. Director Greengrass controls this to a tee, never letting the tension slacken for a second. The rescue/climax when it comes is electrifying, so tense and emotional (my wife said I looked awe-struck) that I was on the edge of my seat. As for the final scene in the medical bay, it had me weeping. The Captain's fragile mental state and the quiet dedication of the medics was very touching, and when Phillips distractedly thanks the doctor and she responds with a gentle 'you're welcome', I thought I would start bawling out loud. The second time he thanks her she gives the same gentle response and gee, I just let go. What a film. Thanks to all involved."

","Captain Phillips 5 turkeys/stars Captain Phillips is a thrilling, pulse pounding film that will leave you on the edge of your seat and gasping for breath. Captain Phillips is based on the true story of Captain Phillips, whose cargo ship was boarded by pirates. Phillips was taken hostage in the lifeboat and was eventually rescued by the Navy SEALS. The cast and crew clearly knew what they were doing with this movie. The cinematography was perfect- the lighting was never too bright or too dark to see, the camera was steady throughout the film. Transitions were smooth. The effects were well done, rarely gratuitous. The faces of the dead pirates after they had been shot was like something out of a horror film and the blood was everywhere but not excessive. One of the best aspects of the movie was the score. The music was fitting and was able to successfully fade in and out without a becoming a big distraction. The actors did a great job portraying their respective roles. Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi make you feel for their characters. I was so nervous that I felt like my stomach was being put through a shredder. When I finished watching, I was shaking. The scene after Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) realized that the pirates were dead and he was alive was one of the best scenes I have ever seen. You could feel the distress and panic radiating off of him. The character development was astounding. The development wasn't like in most movies though-the protagonist becoming a better person, instead the characters devolved and became more and more violent. In the beginning Captain Phillips just wants to get the pirates off the ship and be on their merry way. But later in the submarine, Phillips is more willing to use force. At one point he throws a pirate overboard in an escape attempt. The dialog is, for the most part, well scripted. Hanks repeats himself over and over several times in the movie. It's mostly things like ""yeah"" or ""I'm okay"" but after a while I learned to ignore it. Some viewers may have a problem with the changes made from the original story-Captain Phillips knowingly went off course to deliver supplies quicker (that's how the pirates found them), never told Muse to shoot him instead of Shane or the other members with him in the control room, tried to escape when the guard was peeing instead of telling them he needed to go. The crew also sued Phillips after. However, the majority of the events remained unchanged and make for a compelling watch."
"Turfseer","7","0","1","4 May 2014"," Suspenseful high sea rescue drama succeeds in spite of slight slowdown after the midpoint
","'Captain Phillips' is British director Paul Greengrass' convincing recreation of the kidnapping and subsequent rescue of Merchant Marine Captain Richard Phillips by Somali pirates in 2009. Greengrass manages to make things quite believable by no sleight of hand. Firstly, he films most of the story on the high seas, utilizing a sister container ship, filling in for the Maersk Alabama, which four Somali pirates managed to board as it made its way to Mombassa, Kenya in the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Greengrass employed three other successful strategies to give the film a heady verisimilitude. There is of course the casting of Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips, a no-nonsense New Englander, who heroically survived a brutal kidnapping. Hanks conveys Phillips' stoicism early on as he ensures that his crew practice drills to prepare themselves for any potential pirate incursions (notably Phillips dispenses with the stoic demeanor at the end of his ordeal and becomes very emotional--probably Hanks' best scene in the entire film). It should be noted that Phillips' crew in real-life, faulted their captain for sailing too close to the Somali coast, which they alleged, put them all at risk. But I believe Phillips' analysis when he comments early on in a meeting with the crew, that they could have been thousands of miles from the coast, and still could have been subject to attack.<br/><br/>Greenbrass also utilizes the sister ship of the USS Bainbride, the Truxtun, along with most of the Navy crew, who also make the eventual rescue operation quite believable. Finally, the casting of the four Somali pirates, neophyte Somali-born actors, who moved to the US when they were young, and who Greengrass found after a casting call in Minneapolis, added greatly to the film's overall realism.<br/><br/>The expository scene where Phillips says goodbye to his wife at the airport, goes on a tad bit too long but things are off and running when he arrives for duty as skipper on the Maersk Alabama in the port of Salalah in Oman. Greengrass then cuts to Somalia where the inciting incident occurs. The four pirates led by Muse (aka 'Skinny'), who eventually successfully board the Maersk and kidnap Phillips, along with another group of pirates, are beholden to a syndicate (headed by a warlord). While they are forced to do this gang's bidding, they don't go grudgingly, as engaging in such nefarious activities as a pirate is viewed as a 'badge of honor'. <br/><br/>Once Phillips is on board the Maersk Alabama, we become privy to just how much knowledge is needed to run a container ship of that size. The first half of 'Captain Phillips' involves the attack and subsequent boarding of the ship by the pirates. As depicted (and as it happened during the actual event), the first attempt to board the ship was a failure. Phillips ends up bluffing one pirate group back to their mother ship after pretending that the American Navy is already on their way. The second group, headed by Muse, decides to try again, and using a ladder, manages this time to successfully board the Maersk. All this appears quite exciting on screen and in watching the Blu-ray extra documentary about the making of 'Captain Phillips' afterward, one must commend Mr. Greengrass for not only his technical expertise in filming the attack scenes but also directing actors who had no actual prior experience manning skiffs on the high seas.<br/><br/>Most of the events depicted in 'Captain Phillips' actually happened but here and there, scenes are concocted for dramatic effect. I'm thinking particularly of the scene where the Maersk crew intentionally leave shards of broken glass near where they're hiding below deck, which leads to the injury of one of the pirates after he steps on the glass, cutting his foot. <br/><br/>After Muse is captured by the Maersk crew and the exchange for Captain Phillips goes awry, the second half of the film begins. The scene inside the cramped lifeboat is perhaps the weakest. Greengrass attempts to establish the personal relationship that develops between Muse and Phillips with Muse claiming that Western companies destroyed their livelihood as fisherman by basically cleaning out the ocean's stock and Phillips rightfully maintaining that no way in the world, Muse and his unpleasant band, were fishermen. The pirates argue over a lack of the local narcotic khat and Phillips attempts to put a bandage on the injured foot of one of the pirates (again, an injury which did not happen during the actual event). There's little tension in the lifeboat scene and Greengrass probably should have compressed it, perhaps partially as a montage, utilizing the film's tension-producing score.<br/><br/>Things pick up again with the arrival of the Bainbridge and the exciting sequence of events, leading to the rescue of Captain Phillips. Before three of the pirates are taken out by Navy marksmen and Muse is tricked into boarding the Bainbridge, to 'negotiate' a ransom, Hanks acquits himself quite nicely where he attempts to escape by diving off the lifeboat and swimming for his life. Greengrass doubles down on the suspense when the pirates tie Phillips up and put a gun to his head, right before they're dispensed with.<br/><br/>Greengrass makes a big point of not being jingoistic after the SEALS take down three of the four pirate crew. Nonetheless, one cannot completely disagree with Andrew O'hehir, writing in Salon magazine, when he remarks that 'Captain Phillips', has the ""calm technological blankness of a Navy commercial, without the 1970s waka-waka guitar."" AS O'hehir sees it, there are ""billions of dollars of cutting-edge military hardware and hundreds of corn-fed, gym-toned Americans on one side, four malnourished men with black-market Kalashnikovs on the other.""<br/><br/>Still, one can see no justification for piracy. The emotional impact on Phillips is evident in the great final scene as Phillips begins sobbing, as he's being treated by Navy medical personnel. It's a compelling ending to the suspense that comes before."

","If you want to see anything like quality acting then you better watch Tom Hank's movies, one among his best movie is 'Captain Phillips', Hanks is just incredible in his performance, and to speak about the plot it's a true incident of Capt. Richard Phillips that bought on the screen but it has been portrayed fantastically, thumbs up for the director and Screen writer Paul and Billy Ray for their fine work, Tom Hanks is just superb he had acted as if he had actually been caught by those Somalian Pirates , and even Abdi who played a Somalian Pirate was good in his performance, the story and portrayal was heart touching, you might have seen lots of such movie but you like it a lot because of its real and practical way of presenting, it put my mind to think, 'how will you react when you are stuck in such situation', it's worth to watch."

","Director Paul Greengrass creates two worlds that we know are bound to collide. That they do so slowly and predictably says more about our ""one world"" than it does each of theirs. There is nothing unforeseen or surprising to each of them. In America, a husband goes to work abroad on the sea last talking to his wife about their kids' future and in Somali a pirate is cajoled by machine clad rebel leaders who are summoning up the mental strength to take on the big giant of their universe, a cargo ship (backed by the U.S.A no less). There are no families or any sense of infrastructure. Tom Hanks' understated approach as Captain Phillips actually matches his Somali pirate Captains' demeanor, played by Barkhad Abdi. So it is circumstances that make them different, not intentions. Both want to keep things calm but have trouble containing their own crew at times and at others themselves. The sound is incredible and drives the heart pounding action and suspense, but the impressive depth of character for those on the pressure-cooker of a lifeboat are truly behind the real terror. The decisions really feel ""on the spot"" and we have an easier time comparing into these pirates due to the careful direction, avoiding the action fill fallout from the thinkers among us."

","All politics aside, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS has a gripping plot with excellent all-around acting and cinematography. The storyline is straightforwardly simple, without a lot of extraneous nonsense. Even though the audience already knows basically what will happen and how it will most likely wind up, there are a number of unexpected minor twists. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS also gives a very convincing portrayal of life on a modern U.S. freighter. Regardless of how faithful to the actual story it is--and there are always some changes in that area--I also like the fact that there are no unconvincing heroics (hair's-breadth rescues, etc) here, with a very believable and effective ending.<br/><br/>Some may not like the micro-view this film gives, without anything in the way of news flashes back home, the reactions of the crews' families after the hijacking of the ship, etc. That would, however, have detracted from the tension and forward motion of the film and unnecessarily complicated things. Still, a little more on what happens with the MV Maersk Alabama and the pirate mother-ship later in the story would have been a plus."

","There are moments in Captain Phillips that are truly suspenseful. When the Somali pirates board the ship for the first time is edge of your seat like tension. There are many moments like that that showcase Director Paul Greengrass's ability to create tension effectively. The Somali pirates are truly terrifying, even after learning that they aren't that experienced hijacking ships and kidnapping captains, in fact it makes them all the more frighting because they don't play by the book. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips is gripping to say the least, the fact they haven't tried to make him John McClane in Die Hard on a boat helps us to relate to him as a human being face with a life or death situation. Hanks manages to convey a sense of cunning, trying to out- smart the pirates, and fear, when he knows he's out of his depth and simply gives in for a few moments. Its this back and forth nature that makes us root for Captain Phillips when he's winning and when he's almost admitted defeat.<br/><br/>Its sad then, that Captain Phillips simply vars in to unnecessary boredom a couple of times throughout the film. This is caused by Greengrass simply holding on to the tension of the scene to long and giving us no relief. Understandably, this is supposed to be s non stop, intense film, but with no relief we simply start to not care, the tension simply withers away because you aren't moving the scene forward. I feel the 2 hour and 18 minute runtime could have been trimmed down to 2 hours because of the amount of times Greengrass does go past the breaking point.<br/><br/>Overall, Captain Phillips is a fantastic film. Greengrass does jump the shark, trying to squeeze as much tension from a scene as possible, many times throughout the film. But Tom Hanks gives such a realistic portrayal of a man faced with impossible odds and the fact that the film is tense and thrilling for the most part. Captain Phillips manages to work on so many levels."

","Other comments, above, describe the film production as an exciting drama based on the events of a real incident. After seeing the DVD, several things have impressed me. There are appear to be three levels to this story; first, was the actual event that occurred off the Somali coast, second, was the book publication that referred to the event, and, finally, there was the film, produced from the book.<br/><br/>Each of these levels captures less of the story. The actual event included all the crew and pirates in real life, and was proceeded by the surrounding history of the government and people of Somalia. The book version had to be a condensation of the actual event. The film version was the result of further editing, and possible revision for dramatic effect. A previous review (tieman64) above, added background and context to the actual events that were missing from the film.<br/><br/>""But as everyone knows, to the point of being smugly annoying, that is not ""all there is"". The Somali pirates are largely a result of Western companies dumping nuclear and toxic waste off Somalia's coast, coupled to severe illegal over-fishing by foreign super trawlers (300 million dollars worth of seafood stolen from Somalia each year). The United Nations would itself release numerous reports blaming toxic waste for mutations, deaths, diseases and illnesses within Somalia. Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, the UN envoy for Somalia, would say: ""There is uranium, lead, cadmium, mercury, industrial, radioactive, hospital and chemical waste killing Somalis and completely destroying the ocean."" Why can companies do this? Because Somalia's government has all but collapsed, thanks to Western Empires deliberately destabilizing and developmentally arresting the nation, funding warlords, dictators (Siad Barre et al) and instigating proxy wars with border nations. This has been going on, uninterrupted, since the late 1950s; any local government body not beholden to Western corporate interests, and which attempts to nationalize resources, will be destroyed. '<br/><br/>Not knowing the book, I cannot comment on its version.<br/><br/>The film version may have been good drama, but was deficient on history, and for this viewer, disappointing.

","Captain Phillips (2013) ""Incredible Acting and a Fascinating Story"" 9/10<br/><br/>This film tells the incredible true story of Captain Richard Phillips who captained a cargo ship that was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. Told from the perspective of Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) himself, the story recounts his ordeal aboard the ship and the ways in which he bravely deals with the pirate leader, Muse (Barkhad Abdi). <br/><br/>Set nearly entirely aboard the ship that Captain Phillips took charge of, there is a dramatic tension running throughout the film, even before the story really kicks off. What really makes this film so good is knowing that the story is true and you can't help but be captured by the bravery and courage demonstrated, and the realisation that these events are still so current, so memorable from news stories not too many years ago. It is no surprise that this film was highly nominated for Academy awards: Tom Hanks gives an outstanding performance as Captain Phillips, a heroic and likable character that offers a surprising flip side to the way in which the Somali pirates are viewed and offering real compassion and understanding in a way that is truly admirable. However I felt that the limelight was stolen by newcomer Barkhad Abdi with an impressively convincing and complex performance as the hijacker's leader, again offering the chance for the viewer to change their preconceptions with a persuasive character. <br/><br/>I highly recommend Captain Phillips, it's gripping, thrilling and really changes your perspective on the situation throughout through some incredible acting.

","Not too many movies strike a chord with me, make me think and reflect upon the movie for days or weeks after, or even force me to re-watch the movie in the same way that this movie did. ""Captain Phillips"" is an incredible movie with talented actors and a plot so thrilling that I was literally shaking at times during the film. The suspense that heightened as the movie progressed certainly contributed to the success of this movie and the effect it leaves on the audience.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks once again delivered an exceptional performance as the captain of the ship. I thought his performance particularly excelled at times when the thrill was extremely high, but also in the denouement of the movie, when he was being looked after by a doctor. I would like to name out the actors who played the role of the Somalian pirates, as they all deserve a standing ovation for their contributions to this incredible production: Barkhad Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali. Despite ""Captain Phillips"" being the first movie they ever played in, these four actors delivered mind-blowing performances. Surprisingly, they knew each other very well before the movie as friends in Minneapolis, and I am really happy that they had the opportunity to co-star with each other in this movie. I do not think that anyone else would have been able to play the role that they pulled off magnificently. And to Barkhad Abdi, wherever you go from now on, you will always be the captain.<br/><br/>What I really loved about this movie was the reflection of reality, as this was a story told by the real Captain Phillips. I feel comfortable watching a movie and knowing that what I see on screen is similar to the actual events. With that in mind, when I reflect on the movie, I am not only reflecting on what I saw on screen, but also on the real-life events. I felt that in the film, the Somalian pirates had a firm goal, which was the reason they decided to invade the ship in the first place. Throughout the film, I saw evidence of the existence of a warm heart that the pirates possessed (it was clearer in some than in others),and they were not as mean as their mission would suggest. However, whenever their goal of acquiring millions of dollars was threatened, they would react strongly.<br/><br/>I am definitely surprised that this movie did not take home an Oscar this year, but not surprised at all that it was nominated for 6 Oscars and not surprised that Barkhad Abdi took home a BAFTA award either. I saw this movie twice, the second time just couple days later, and I even liked it more the second time than I did the first. I would highly recommend this movie.

","This modern day pirate thriller is a nail biting hit movie, even though the true events of the 2009 abduction are familiar to most viewers and the outcome is known from the beginning of the historic story. Tom Hanks playing Captain Phillips, the commanding officer of the Maersk Alabama, gives the best performance of his career, in my opinion. Hanks demonstrates the strategic thinking, compassion and intelligence of Captain Phillips as he deals with a Somali pirate take over of his ship. A trio of Somali pirates portrayed by Somali men brings a startling realism to this movie. Especially noteworthy is the performance of Oscar nominated Barkhad Abdi,who was one among a tribe of Somalians who were involved in the piracy. This movie is memorable because the people who were involved are alive to testify to it's authenticity, the scenes were action packed and the story itself is so well told as to become even more compelling over time. Captain Phillips will definitely be popular for many more years beyond 2009, when the high seas adventurous events occurred, while other movies made in 2013, awards notwithstanding, will be easily forgotten."

","""Captain Phillips"" is the true story if the hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama cargo ship in 2009 by Somali pirates and is based on the the book ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" written by Captain Phillips himself. It tells the story of the hijacking of the 17000 ton container ship with a crew of 20 by just 4 Somali pirates in a skiff and the subsequent dramatic rescue of the kidnapped Captain by the US Navy. It was the first hijacking of an American ship for over 200 years. If it were not all true it would be hard to believe and could look like a typical American film with an unlikely plot where the US military come to the rescue and all ends happily. However, the fact that this is a true story and the excellent directing by British director Paul GreenGrass (of Bourne Ultimatum and United 93 fame) make this a film that is definitely worth watching. Add to this some excellent acting by Tom Hanks as Captain Richard Phillips and newcomer Barkhad Abdi as ""Muse"" the leader of the Somali pirates.<br/><br/>I was amazed that 4 poorly equipped pirates in a small boat could so easily board and take such a large ship. The ship was equipped only with water hoses to fend off the pirates and also used flares. I was amazed that given the known threat that the crew were not armed as with suitable weapons it would have been easy to deter the pirates. Only on subsequent research did I discover that at that time Insurance companies did not like cargo ship crews being armed as it led to a greater perceived liability - however now most such ships do hire private armed security teams. On first impression the rescue finale by Navy SEALS would also seem like typical American nonsense - but check it out - it is true - it is actually what happened and how the crisis was actually brought to a close. What makes this film better than average is the excellent directing where the Captain is portrayed as an ordinary man - not a hero. The interplay between the Captain and Muse is superbly done. Muse is not your typical baddie either - it is clear that his (and his associates) are driven to this way of life. He calls the Captain ""Irish"" after he reveals he is American Irish and there is an excellent line where Phillips says to Muse ""There's got to be something other than being a fisherman or kidnapping people?"" to which Muse replies ""Maybe in America, Irish, maybe in America"". This sums up the disparity between the lives of the Captain and his crew and the Somali pirates.<br/><br/>I am not always a fan of Tom Hanks but there is no doubt that he is a fine actor and this is one of his best performances. And credit must go to Barkhad Abdi in his first film and being nominated for best actor in a supporting role. The US Navy is very impressive but not overplayed in the normal heroic form but rather as an effective and coordinated force. Apparently it is a requirement of the US military that if they take part in a film then they are portrayed in a positive manner so perhaps Greengrass was a little limited in how he could portray their role. The finale is very dramatic and the effectiveness of the seals cannot be understated. However, what we see if an effective disciplined force and not the usual gung-ho nonsense we see in many US films. I believe that many of the Navy roles were actually played by actual Navy personnel.<br/><br/>One issue is that it does not make it clear that Captain Phillips may not have been as good as he was portrayed as he had apparently ignored directives to keep at least 600 miles from the Somali coast and was just 250 miles out when hijacked. One of the crew member subsequently brought a legal case against the Captain. But again, given that Greengrass using the Captain's own account of the hijacking to base the film then it is understandable that this fact was avoided. Overall I would recommend this film for some fine acting and well directed drama. The plot would be full of holes if it were not all true so there is little negative that can be said there.<br/><br/>After the hijacking Muse was taken to the US and tried for piracy where he is now serving a 33 year sentence. All 4 of the pirates were between 17 and 19 years old."

When the pirates suffer an engine failure it looks as if Phillips and his crew have got away but the next morning the pirates return and four of them board the Maersk Alabama with the intention of taking it back to Somalia for ransom. The captain and the bridge crew are captured but other crew members set about disabling the ship. The leader of the pirates Abduwali Muse begins a search of the ship and is ultimately captured by the crew. An arrangement is made to swap him for the captain but this isn't respected and the four pirates escape on the lifeboat, taking Capt. Phillips with them. It isn't long before the USS Bainbridge is on the scene and things get tense as they negotiate while Navy Seals prepare to take drastic action should the pirates not surrender.<br/><br/>This film is based on a true story but even if you know the outcome it shouldn't effect ones enjoyment of what is a genuinely tension filled thriller. Director Paul Greengrass does a great job capturing the action; the fact that it was filmed at sea rather than using green screens only improves matters. The cast do a fine job; most notably Tom Hanks as Capt Phillips and new comer Barkhad Abdi who was brilliant as Muse. His character wasn't a cliché movie villain but nor was he overly sympathetic.

","And just when I thought pirates hijacking a ship would be even more cliché, boring, and sad, I found this movie: a total opposition to the three negative adjectives I mentioned earlier. It's a spectacular visual account of Captain Phillips' and his crew's tragic encounter with Somalian pirates. The realism of the camera angles and shakes, the flawless acting of Tom Hanks as a captain inexperienced with pirate attacks, and the pirates and their not-so-evil personal backgrounds; they all mash up into one heck of a movie, indeed.<br/><br/>So the movie starts off simple enough: another overseas cargo delivery is appointed to Captain Richard Phillips. He, along with his new crew, however, is oblivious to the fact that the very ship which he is about to sail is being targeted by a tribe of Somalian pirates who are eager to board it. Here's the thing, though: these Somalian pirates do NOT play the really bad guys - the hackneyed evildoers that rob for the sake of misfortune upon others; they play the desperate ones; the ones who are forced to do this for the sake of feeding their own families. It's a clever move by director Paul Greengrass to behold unto the audience a new kind of feeling: a feeling of ambivalence.<br/><br/>The ambivalence, which soon turns to pity and understanding, towards the armed pirates was only felt by Captain Phillips himself. He had followed through with tactics to hamper the pirates' endeavors in finding the rest of the crew (placing broken glass on a barely lit stairway, for example), but immediately regretted them and soon began to treat a pirate who had fallen for the trap. This is what makes Phillips unique among the other non-Somalian characters in the movie: his double-sided view of the situation. Everyone else (the cargo crew, and the Navy SEALS who, by devious methods, eliminated the pirates in the end) had one- sided perspective and considered the Somalians the true enemies. This was an interesting method to isolate Captain Phillips, the main character, from the rest of the characters; it was a method that I appreciated and enjoyed greatly.<br/><br/>Finally, the camera shots and angles for the movie were astonishingly realistic. It was successful in making the audience detect the gravity of such a hijacking, and moments when death called for some of the characters. The cameramen did not emphasize the beauty of the background that most other movies would have done, but focused more on the situation and its outcomes: a very still and smooth angle represented peace and a short respite, and trembling camera shots showed the fear in the characters' souls.<br/><br/>Indeed, a movie like this deserves its place in the list of top thrillers; it shows that the cameramen didn't have to be elegant, the Somalian pirates didn't have to be heartless, and the Captain didn't have to be one-sided like all the other terrorist-loathing captains. It's an experience by the real Captain Phillips that was well executed, and broke the walls of many stereotypes about Somalian people, pirating, and terrorism. An admirable and guileful way to change the views of the audience, is it not?"

","Too long. Boring! What movie did you watch? CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is based on true events and adapted from the book A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs and Dangerous Days at Sea by Richard Phillips and Stephan Tally. In 2009, Somali pirates highjacked the American cargo ship Maernsk Alabama almost two hundred miles off the coast of Somalia and kidnapped its commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips(Tom Hanks). The events made international headlines and some of the rescue presented live on TV as it happened. Phillips had his crew practice drills in case of emergency or attack, never really expecting the actuality. The world became very real for all aboard the container ship, when the Alabama was under attack from two small boats. One managed to later board Phillips' ship, a band of Somali pirates led by a man called Muse(Barkhad Abdi) demanded money, much more than what was on board. After shots being fired and a bit of manhandling, Phillips convinces Muse and what was left of his small crew to board a lifeboat and leave with the money. Phillips was taken hostage and things grew more unpleasant. Hours and hours go by as the Navy and a special force of Navy SEALs try to make Muse and his crew realize that their efforts were fruitless. If this movie wasn't already terse and white knuckle anxious...the SEALs waited for the right moment to present itself. The rescue is not just dramatic, but gut wrenching. Many could not understand Hanks not getting an Oscar for his efforts. Also in the cast: Michael Cernus, Corey Johnson, Max Martini, Barkhad Abdirahman, Yul Vasquez and Catherine Keener."
"djestic03","10","0","1","15 March 2014"," A Masterpiece!
","Not sure how this can be topped: most people will already know the story, so the movie has the task of keeping interest and building tension without cheap tricks and manipulative gimmicks. The story and conflict is multi-leveled, and must be developed while building tension. Hanks gives the performance of a lifetime. The visuals must give us a feel for the vastness of the ocean, the immenseness of a cargo ship, the majesty of our overpowering Navy, danger and desperation, yet successfully play small ball with a cramped lifeboat and villains from another culture. Some say there are better movies, but I'll bet those movies started with a clean slate. Keeping the tension and interest at a high level throughout, and Hanks' 2nd half presentation of a desperate man--and his nuanced yet believable 'breakdown' scene--make this worthy of 10 stars to me. This was a real group effort, from screenwriters, actors, directors, and cinematographers. Other movies can be AS good, but none can top this."
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","9","0","1","15 March 2014"," A bare bones thriller
","A bare bones thriller: no ridiculous special effects, or stupid character behavior. A small (main) cast of just Tom Hanks' character, and the three pirates for a lot of the run time gives the film a more focused feel. Hanks doesn't turn the character into a hero who saves the day, he's just a normal human being trapped in a situation far beyond his control. He's scared, yet he tries to remain calm; he even shows signs of developing Stockholm Syndrome at times: most memorably, as he tends to the injured and bleeding foot of one of the pirates.<br/><br/>The best scene: the final scene, where Phillips, in a state of shock, is walked to a medic for evaluation. The sound goes into a tunnel, and everything sounds quite far away, while happening right in front of his face. Phillips is clearly disoriented and unaware of what is happening around him. After being injured myself, shortly before this film was released, I can relate to those sensations, or lack thereof. It brought back too grim memories for me, but added to the realism of this film.<br/><br/>Another plus is the hiring of unknowns to play the three pirates. Casting recognisable faces would have given the audience a bit of familiarity to the pirates going into the film, and dulled the edge to their characters.<br/><br/>Worst scene, the only bad scene, is the first scene, of Hanks' character and his wife driving and talking, boringly. A needless connecting device leading into a first rate thriller."

","Tom Hanks, it's good to have you in the captain's chair. <br/><br/>The two-time Oscar winner hadn't quite found his footing since turning 50, but ""Captain Phillips"" proves that with the right role, there aren't many actors you'd rather have playing the good guy. This titular role lets Hanks' average joe qualities shine, not to mention his strength of presence and demeanor.<br/><br/>Captain Richard Phillips is a cargo freighter captain with a no-nonsense attitude. While maneuvering the Maersk Alabama down the coast of Africa, two small boats of Somali pirates show up on radar, and despite everything Phillips does to shake them, one of the boats, led by the utterly determined Muse (Barkhad Abdi), manages to get on board.<br/><br/>Seeing as it's based on a real-life 2009 hijacking, ""Phillips"" could have no better director than Paul Greengrass. Here's a filmmaker that made ""United 93"" an emotional, captivating and suspenseful at a time when everyone felt a September 11 movie was too soon. Again, Greengrass brings that palm-sweating play-by-play account that keeps the audience on edge despite a known outcome. Even if you don't know how the story ends, you know the ship gets boarded from the trailers, and even that first set of sequences remains totally gripping. And it's real-life suspense; very little of what Greengrass does manufactures tension in a Hollywood-like way.<br/><br/>Billy Ray's adaptation of the real Phillips' book also doesn't overstep at all. There are a couple Hollywood moments, and some scenes in which Hanks and Abdi frame the events with some food-for-thought dialogue, but ""Captain Phillips"" feels especially down to earth. Even the way the film depicts the Navy doesn't glorify what they do very much.<br/><br/>Narratively, ""Phillips"" is a straight line with an upward trajectory and maybe two lulls in the tension. There is no trickery or plot twists, but we remain blind to just how the events will unfold, analyzing who has the leverage in this hostage crisis at every turn. So simple and straightforward, yet so captivating.<br/><br/>Hanks does in fact give his best performance in years, though the role is tailored perfectly to his strengths. Phillips is an unsung hero who with courage and resolve attempts to do whatever he can to manage the situation, including making some risky, dumb moves. He doesn't just flip his bravery switch and he flinches time to time. Hanks does this kind of humanity effortlessly.<br/><br/>""Captain Phillips"" sticks mostly to a suspenseful retelling, but Ray's script doesn't lose sight of the value of this story. Most films of this nature are content to leave the ""foreign aggressors"" faceless and nameless, but their conflict, their objectives, their feelings are a significant part of the film. This isn't a piracy situation for the sake of an entertaining plot, there is a motive here; real Somalis did this because it's what they felt they had to do.<br/><br/>Rarely do non-fiction and suspenseful entertainment cross paths, yet Greengrass usually finds them both in his crosshairs. ""Captain Phillips"" proves once more that history and current events don't have to be boring while giving Hanks the vehicle he deserved.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","This was one of those films I watched without having a clue of what happens in it. I knew it was called 'Captain Phillips', I knew Tom Hanks was starring in it, that's it. I hadn't heard of the 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking and had no clue what the movie was about.<br/><br/>I urge anybody to watch movies this way, especially good ones. It makes the whole experience much more interesting and surprising.<br/><br/>For those of you that don't want to watch the movie this way and would like some plot details, here we go;<br/><br/>'Captain Phillips', is about the 2009 hijacking of the Maersk Alabama cargo ship by Somali pirates, and the efforts of the ship's captain to keep the crew safe while attempting to reason with the pirates. As you can probably anticipate, the situation escalates.<br/><br/>I won't give you any more details than that, other than what follows is emotional, tense and absolutely gripping. The greatest part of the movie is the acting, Tom Hanks is exceptional as the eponymous hero, the final scene in particular was one of the greatest performances I have ever seen from him.<br/><br/>But the BAFTA award winning Barkhad Abdi (a real Somali actor playing a the pirate ringleader) deserves just as much credit. His performance does that beautiful and rare thing of creating a character that morphs throughout the film, as the situation around him changes.<br/><br/>It is a testament to Abdi's performance to portray a opportunistic criminal without an ability to speak much English and still feel like he is just as much a victim as Captain Phillips and his crew.<br/><br/>The over-used shaky camera work is here in abundance, but it seems we must accept it as an inevitability at this point. The film as a whole is nerve shredding and brilliantly made, and only falls short of being top of the Oscar heap by focusing on only a few aspects of the logistics and emotions behind all the people involved and affected by the hijacking.<br/><br/>Less talented actors would have made this a merely enjoyable film. The cinematography is good, but not as good as in '12 Years A Slave'. The script is good, but not as good as 'American Hustle'. <br/><br/>A strange example of a film that is as good as it ever could be. The situation is interesting but not mind-blowing enough to make it into a classic, but I encourage anyone to watch just for the incredible performances from Hanks and Abdi. I will be interested in seeing what is next for his career."

","Or at least it should be. It's not just the hijacked boat movie the advertising made it out to be; the action moves from ship to tight- quartered lifeboat and even into the roiling waters.

Tom Hanks is reliably terrific in the title role and embodies the no-nonsense Captain.

","Trying to hate this movie is very hard. It is a true story,and is fantastic. Tom Hanks plays the part as if he was Captain Phillips himself. Summary: A captain's ship is overtaken by Somalian pirates, exploring the sea for ships to hijack. The captain hides his crew, and does the bet he can to protect them from whatever comes their way. He depicts acts of courage, honor, valor, and more. However this movie is fairly violent in some places Cast: Tom Hanks name alone gives the movie a great recognition. But due to supporting cast member, Barkhad Abdi's name being mentioned at the Oscars, you should know that this guy is for real. I'm his first movie, he impresses me thoroughly. Rate: 8.2/10. Recommendation: ages 12+ & I recommend to see this movie, or to buy/rent it."

","Based on truth, pirates off the Somalian coast hijack cargo ships and hold ships captive for insurance money. Sad, but true - it still happens now, it is often cheaper (in money) for the ships to pay the Ransom than sail out of the way. The owners of the ships, crews and pirates all know this creating a very dangerous environment.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays the captain of such a ship. A normal guy trying to fight off young kids who are given AK-47's and a few pennies for their efforts. Since the merchant men are unarmed, it's an unfair battle, but Cpt Phillips uses his wits and what few resources he has to save his crew and ship.<br/><br/>I found the movie to be balanced - it presents all sides of the problem; the crew who are put at risk, the Capitan and even the pirates. The ending is rips your heart out. Hanks really did an excellent job there."

","Captain Phillips continues a long association with biopics for Tom Hanks. He has arguably the best performance of his career as the titular character, a cargo ship captain. Hanks never once loses poise in his role, always remaining calm and collected. His heroics are impeccable, and he truly propels the film forward. No one else could have done this well in this role. The rest of the cast also performs well, with Barkhad Abdi delivering a stunning debut as Muse, the pirates' ringleader. <br/><br/>Paul Greengrass does not get in the way of these wonderful performances with his direction. Instead of opting for grandiose editing, he focuses on making Captain Phillips realistic and down-to-earth above all else. His great cinematography makes the film feel like a documentary due to its slight shakiness and occasional sharp cuts. There are also many close angles used to allow the actors' subtle features to be seen. Overall, Captain Phillips is a stirring biopic that will be a treasure to almost every moviegoer because of its incredible acting and non- distracting direction."

","Captain Philips - 2013 Cast: tom hanks and barkhad Abdi Director: Paul greengrass<br/><br/>Synopsis: Captain Philips is a multi-layered examination of the true story of the 2009 hijacking of the container Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates. Based on a story the film focuses on the Alabama's commanding officer captain Philips and the Somali pirate muse who takes him hostage The two men are set on an unstoppable collision course when muse and his crew target Phillip's unarmed ship in the ensuing standoff both men will find themselves at the mercy of the forces beyond their control. Review: I think this film is a fine piece of film making from one of the finest director around who previously directed 2 of the Bourne movies. At just over 2 hours long it is a very good tense story that goes on at a nice pace, though I would have probably watched it for another hour it was so exciting. I never took my eyes of the screen and the film never lost my attention. I think the most powerful aspect of the story was watching the relationship between Captain Philips and muse develops throughout the film, it goes from a hijacker and a victim to two men who understand each other and the fact that muse is a thief not a killer. I never fully felt threatened that muse was going to kill Philips because he understood he was no killer and the most frightening aspect of the film where the other 2 pirates who seemed more unpredictable than muse. However barkhad Abdi gives and incredible and scary portrayal of muse and so do the other actors playing the pirates. I was not fully aware of the real story so there were a number of shocks in this film for me for example I thought that the whole main part of the action would take place on Philips ship I was genuinely shocked when he was kidnapped in the life boat and the main part of the film took place there. I have to say that tom hanks has given some memorable performances in the past in films such as the toy story films and Forrest Gump but his performance in this film is outstanding and defiantly one of the best performances of his career. Overall I think the film was epic and thrilling from start to finish and it made me really think of what a terrifying event it would have been for the people who were involved in the real story and happily as we found out over a year later captain Phillip's would take to his ship and on to the sea yet again I would give this film a 8.5 out of 10"

","In the 90's, you were pretty certain that any film with Tom Hanks would see him at the top of his game. The range of roles he got obviously helped, but for a few years he really did ace most of his movies. All good things come to an end and most of his recent efforts seems to have been a bit lame. It's good to report that Captain Phillips sees him back on the top of his game!!<br/><br/>The film follows the true story of a cargo ship captained by Richard Phillips through the pirate waters of the Somali coast.

I have to confess that I didn't know the real story beforehand, so that really helped watching as I had no idea what was going to happen. Well worth a watch!"
"WheelzFourReelz","9","0","1","2 March 2014"," This is an absolutely intense ride that you don't want to miss.
","Captain Phillips is based on the true story of Somali pirates attacking a cargo ship. And Captain Phillips captains the boat. Go figure. Now, I discovered this movie in a weird way. I was at my friends house and we were about to go to an event with the neighbors. We were just about to leave the house and I passed by the TV. I glanced at it, walked passed it a little bit, stopped, turned back, and watched the whole commercial. It was a commercial for Captain Phillips. After I saw it, my thought was, ""I WANNA SEE THAT!"" So I did. Here's what I thought. Like I said in the intro, this move is based on a true story where Somali pirates invaded a cargo ship. That is a cool premise on its own, but the fact that it actually happened makes it all the more interesting. And it gets to a level that I was not expecting. I'm not going to spoil it, but let me just say most of the captivity does not take place on the boat. And I think that works. The acting in this movie is superb. Everyone did a great job. Tom Hanks did amazing, especially at a scene at the very end of the movie. He pretty much hits his lowest low at that point and it's effective. The Somali pirates also do a great job and they're brand new to acting. That's right this is their first movie ever and I think they're actually pirates. Either that or the director didn't tell Tom Hanks that they weren't pirates so that he would be at his best. Either one works. This movie is shot very well, too. This movie was created by the director of the Bourne trilogy, so you know it's going to be shot well. It has a lot of shaky cam, but it's the kind that works (Take that, Michael Bay!). This movie will definitely be a contender for Best Director at the Oscars. My only complaints about this movie are, for one, there are some parts where the movie slows down a little. It doesn't detract from the movie at all, but it can get a little boring. It also feels to run a little bit too long. I think they could've cut out about fifteen minutes or so. Other than that, it's very superb. Overall, Captain Phillips is a fantastic movie. This is definitely in the running for best picture at The Oscars, though I think it will lose to Gravity. If you haven't seen Captain Phillips, watch it. It's fantastic."

","Based on the real life story and book by Captain Richard Phillips, Captain Phillips is an authentic recreation of the events leading up to the hijacking of an American freighter ship on the high seas by modern day Somali pirates in 2009. Directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum), the film is a non-stop edge of your seat entertainment that puts you in the midst of a seemingly hopeless situation. Tom Hanks and a talented supporting cast bring the participants to life in one of the year's best films.<br/><br/>Phillips is a responsible commander of a freighter with a small crew. As he boards his ship and readies to embark at sea, a group of Somali men prepares to search for nearby ships to board and hold hostage for money. As the freighter nears the Somali waters, the pirates give chase and the race is on as Phillips follows a series of procedures to elude and repel the invaders. When the pirates board and take control of the bridge by force, the dynamic has shifted to a hostage situation. As the Somali, who are smart and cautious, search the ship for other crew members, it becomes a tense game of cat and mouse. Led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi), the pirates want money even as US military forces come to the rescue. A tense standoff leads Phillips and his captors to the freighter's life boat and a race against time to save the brave captain.<br/><br/>Phillips and his crew take creative steps to make this hijacking as difficult as possible. They even follow a protocol for securing the ship from boarders by running drills and taking extra precautions. Phillips himself proves resourceful even when alone with his captors by making innocent suggestions that have ulterior motives and meaning.<br/><br/>The scene where the pirates take over the bridge is well shot and has a real time feel. Nobody shoots docudramas better than Greengrass with his rapid edits and hand-held cameras. He conveys a sense of progressively worsening desperation and hopelessness. Henry Jackman's score matches the intensity of the film.<br/><br/>Like the concluding mission in Zero Dark Thirty, the final sequence here is meticulously detailed and ratchets the suspense to an unbearable level even though most people know how these events transpired. The play is the thing, and Greengrass executes the finale like a true, military SEAL operation complete with preparations and tactics. The climax is a brilliantly edited moment of split second timing, patience, and decisive action. It affects the audience on a visceral level where so much is at risk.<br/><br/>Hanks (Saving Mr. Banks, Philadelphia) is completely convincing as Phillips. Abdi is authentic and menacing as Muse, all the more impressive since he was a total amateur when cast in the role. You even feel a bit of sympathy for Muse because he comes from a place of poverty where there are few options in life, and you come to realize that he is a person under extreme pressure from his bosses on the mainland. In fact, utilizing mostly unknowns aside from Hanks, works to the film's realism. The other Somali men are each given a chance to shine and have unique personas which makes what happens to them a shared experience.<br/><br/>You also wonder how Phillips' wife and family are reacting to the crisis but you never see them despite Catherine Keener's brief role as his wife at the beginning. That could have raised the stakes a bit more emotionally.<br/><br/>By the film's stunning resolution, there is an emotional release in Phillips that the audience shares. It is in these last several minutes that Hanks draws you into his heartbreaking trauma. It is here that he excels in an emotional performance in an emotional film, where a brave man said and did the right things under extreme duress."

","When someone heard the word ""pirate"", funny, drunken-style walking, outwitted Captain Jack Sparrow will hit in their mind. But everyone will have a chance to experience with unfunny modern pirates in director Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips. Captain Phillips is based on the actual event of Captain Richard Phillips' cargo ship, MV Maersk Albama, hijacked by the ruthless Somali pirates in the sea in 2009. <br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass have already shown his directorial abilities in previous actions thrillers, the ""Bourne"" sequels and United 93 (another real event about one of the planes hijacked on 9/11). Captain<br/><br/>Phillips is flawless with excellent choice of Oscar-winning Tom Hanks as the title role of Captain Richard Phillips, and again Greengrass prove to the audience with brilliant use of unfamiliar faces on screen as he did in United 93. Captain Phillips is definitely his intelligent choice of casts especially introducing Barkhad Abdi who amaze audiences without having any acting experience throughout his life. <br/><br/>Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) drives to the airport, and in the same time, he calm down his worried wife Andrea Phillips (Catherine Keener) who is not willing to let him go at this time since she is afraid of her husband to encounter with the danger of pirates in the sea. This introductory scene is first and only scene of female cast involvement throughout the run time about two hours before the ending scene with the real-life Navy Corpsman Danielle Albert. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks portrayed as a selfless, calm and concerned Captain for his crew is perfection, and definitely one of his finest performances of his career. He brings plot to plot with his outstanding performance which he convinces the audiences unable to see him as Tom Hanks, but the character. <br/><br/>Captain Phillips and his men make their best effort to escape from hijackers which, somehow, reminds the image of Tom Hanks in 2002 crime thriller ""Road to Perdition"" as a concerned father making the best effort to save the life of his son form the gangsters. <br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a prepared guy for the Somali pirates and he does a little research with them while he transports his large cargo containers from port of Oman to Kenya. The hijackers are poor fishermen who fight with hunger every day of their lives, so they dare to do anything to fill their stomach. The brief scene of monitoring how the pirates live will make you feel sad about their poor lives, how they do for their living. By seeing houses they lives and their appearances will make audience to understand the reason of hijacking ships to do for their living (the only way out from poverty). <br/><br/>Sympathy of these hungry guys will not last too long after the four armed pirates land to Captain Phillips' cargo ship. Unknown cast Barkhad Abdi stars as Muse, the leader among four pirates, surely will make you angry seeing his character on screen. Muse is the best evil character since Daniel Day Lewis' Bill ""the Butcher"" Cutting in Gangs of New York (2002). <br/><br/>Evil character, Muse, is well done by newcomer Abdi; he convince with his as if like a real Somali pirate or whether he has some pirate experiences in his real life. Abdi is an excellent choice of director Greengrass; no one can replace his part. He has a unique appearance, and also he can bring the audiences with his strong impressions and strange accent till the end. He can make it possible to equalize with Tom Hanks in every scene they are together. Captain Phillips will prove that this man can really act. So there is no wonder Abdi is nominated for Academy Award for best supporting actor in his film debut as Muse. <br/><br/>Phillips and his men keep heads up and do their best to avoid the upcoming danger. Despite their best efforts, four armed pirates land to unarmed Phillips' boat. The captain cannot do anything, but just watching them climbing to his boat with their hungry eyes. Captain Phillips makes some negotiation with Muse;however, failing of negotiation between Captain Phillips and Muse leads to keep Phillips as a hostage in order to make a ransom. <br/><br/>Near the end of the movie, Tom Hanks again does his Cast Away style swimming shirtless in the sea, but in this time he swims in the sea escorted by Navy Seal Group. Muse's quote ""I'm the Captain now!"" which he said in the first time meeting with Captain Phillips is the best line in the entire movie will make everyone uneasy to get this line out of their heads. This intense thriller is beautifully written and excellent choice of dialogues. Editing job is fantastic; it simply is Oscar worthy. Captain Phillips is one of the best edited movies of the year.<br/><br/>The entire movie goes with non-stop action; it will lead without leaving off from the screen till the end. Overall Captain Phillips is done a pretty good job in cinematography with perfectly and carefully designed of the whole reconstructions. Hand-held cameramen also make fine shots when they capture the right time of the characters' impressions most obviously in shouting and arguing scenes of characters. Sound effects make the movie more intense thriller that will make you grind your teeth."

","Popular culture meant that piracy has always been romanticised. But in the real world, piracy is a real and serious issue and is happening. One such example took place in 2009 when container ship Marsek Alabama found itself to be a victim of hijacking off the Somali coast, a known hotspot for maritime piracy.<br/><br/>Experienced ship captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) had been tasked to take command of MV Marsek Alabama, which is an unarmed container ship docked in Oman with the orders to sail through the Gulf of Aden to Mombasa, round the Horn of Africa. Meanwhile in Somalia, a team had been selected for preparing to head out to sea with the mission of hijacking a ship.<br/><br/>With the route MV Marsek Alabama was taking, a warning system was issued to the ship on the possibility of piracy activity. Wary of what could happen when the vessel is off the coast of Somalia, Phillips decided to ramp up on security around the vessel and having practice drills with the crew. It would be during a drill where the vessel would be chased by Somali pirates in two skiffs. One of the two would be fended off after Phillips had outrun them and when he had called for support.<br/><br/>But the day after, one of the two skiffs would be returned with four heavily armed pirates led by its own leader Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Adi) but with the ladder hastily welded the night before. Despite the best efforts from Phillips and his crew, the Somali pirates managed to board and capture the Marsek Alabama. By this time, the crew were hiding in the engine room as Phillips had told them apart from cutting the ship's engine power to while he had been captured by the pirates themselves. Even if Phillips had tried to negotiate with the pirates, they were insistent on wanting to head for the engine room.<br/><br/>What happened in the film is actually based on the real-life events of the MV Marsek Alabama hijacking in 2009, the first time an American cargo ship had been hijacked in two hundred years. But it is also based on the experiences of experienced ship captain Richard Phillips who captained MV Marsek Alabama when it was hijacked from his book 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea'.<br/><br/>What took place in the film may look dry at times to the viewer who may not be familiar with the workings of the maritime industry, but it helps to shed light to the challenge which has always plague the industry when it comes to piracy on the seas especially off the Somali coast. But what happened in the film is a reminder of how it can turn into a matter of between life and death, where it was exemplified by Tom Hanks's character. For how he did in the film is something recommended and worth the watch, alongside with the man who played the leader of the pirates in Barkhad Adi."

","Nominated for 6 Academy Awards in the upcoming Oscar ceremony (Film, Supporting Actor, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, Sound Editing and Sound Mixing), the based-on-fact hijack drama CAPTAIN PHILLIPS somewhat surprisingly missed out on Best Actor (some critics claimed this was double Oscar winner Tom Hanks' best-ever performance) and Best Direction (Greengrass is credited with inventing a new style of kinetic thriller with his BOURNE movies). Although I have watched – and suffered through – both PHILADELPHIA (1993) and FORREST GUMP (1994) in the past, I have yet to watch the director's previous Oscar nod, the similarly-sourced- and-themed UNITED 93 (2006) or, for that matter, any of the reinvented Ludlums.<br/><br/>Whenever I read in the news of an international ship being overtaken by African pirates, I could not help thinking that anyone who unwisely ventures into such all-too-obviously dangerous waters deserves whatever fate he encounters. Watching this movie only reinforced that notion – although, to be sure, Hanks is shown doing his utmost to ditch his pursuers and, once they successfully board his vessel, trick them; thankfully, we are also spared any teary-eyed flashbacks to Hanks' domestic life on land when he is individually kidnapped and beaten up.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the film is both gripping (the initial game of cat-and-mouse between the hiding crew and the advancing Somali pirates) and moving (when Hanks breaks down after being saved by the Navy Seals); however, apart from being overlong at 134 minutes, my enthusiasm for the partly- shot-in-Malta CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (Hanks was constantly ""tweeting"" about his stay over here last Summer) was decidedly marred by two of the most obnoxious villains in screen history (including Oscar nominee Barkhad Abdi – whose role seems to run out of steam in the film's latter stages anyway and, incidentally, his constant referral to Hanks as ""Irish"" is just unbelievableas I doubt anyone in Somalia has ever even heard of the country!) who are not only unattractive to look at (if that sounds racist, sue me!) but their constantly hysterical and (no doubt, for veracity's sake) unsubtitled declamations got on my nerves long before the fadeout!"

"SgtPluck","7","0","1","24 February 2014"," One of the better thrillers of the year.
","The word ""realistic"" is one of the most misused in all of film criticism, being attributed even to CGI spectacles such as Gravity. Early reviews of Paul Greengrass' Captain Philips have praised it for its realism, but a more accurate term to explain the film's appeal would be ""believability"". The film is very much a Hollywood thriller (down to text on the screen informing us as to the differing locations of various scenes), but is to the credit of Greengrass and his cast that it manages to be genuinely exciting whilst remaining within genre parameters.<br/><br/>The film casts Tom Hanks as Richard Philips, the captain of the Maersk Alabama-the first US cargo ship to be hijacked in over 200 years. Hanks proves an excellent choice for the role, with his familiar screen persona of normality making it easy to see Philips as an ordinary man forced into a nightmarish situation through no fault of his own. It's easier to believe that a middle-aged man with grey hair and beard might be terrified and fear for his life in the face of Somali pirates. The casting of unknown Somali American actors as the pirates hijacking the ship adds to this sense of believability, with Barkhad Adbi being particularly impressive as their leader Muse. Adbi does an excellent job with a role that could easily be a caricature, hinting at the desperation which drives the poor into piracy. This desperation is mirrored on the American side, with the film wisely maintaining a focus on the claustrophobia and paranoia which develop from being trapped on a ship hundreds of miles from civilization. The dynamic between Philips and Muse is what makes this film compelling, with their mutual dedication to their thankless tasks being visible throughout and hinting at the similarities between how the two captains handle their crews in crises.<br/><br/>It is when the film moves away from this to include events happening away from the hijacking that it lags,with cutaways to Navy bases distracting from the tension of the main plot and the frequently thrilling action sequences(the boarding of the ship by the pirates merits particular praise, with the ingenuity of the pirates making clear why the Americans fear them so). Whilst some sense of the bigger picture about piracy is probably necessary to grasp the context the events of the film take place in, it's not what makes the film work. What lingers in the memory instead is the sense that both sides were as scared and vulnerable in real life as depicted here,making this film one of the better thrillers of the year."

","Before and after the real time events of Captain Phillips and the Maersk Alabama, I kept wondering to myself why these cargo ships and other maritime vessels don't protect themselves with real live artillery aboard ship. The feeling was reinforced here having to watch the captain and his crew try to fend off the Somali pirates with high pressure water hoses. It just doesn't make sense to me. It's like we don't live by our wits or common sense any more and it's very frustrating because it seems to me that this event could have been prevented.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, there's no doubt that this was a suspenseful film and technically very well done. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, but the way Captain Phillips was depicted, he was a no nonsense, get off the boat if you're not satisfied kind of guy. I guess I'm not used to seeing Tom Hanks being that aggressive. As the story unfolds, we begin to realize that the real Captain was indeed a hero who put his own life on the line for his crew and his ship. Very admirable.<br/><br/>I was curious to see how the rescue ended based on the news reporting of the time and how I visualized the event. I may be wrong, but the way it was made to seem at the time was that the pirates were careless in showing themselves and making themselves a visible target to SEAL snipers. That notion was dispelled here, as the execute order couldn't be given until all three pirates were sighted in at the same time. The outcome, relying on incredibly precise timing and even more incredible skill, would in most movies be considered a matter for suspending disbelief. Here it's a matter of historical record. This was a riveting story."

","As a rule of thumb, I'll see pretty much anything Tom Hanks makes. This one didn't disappoint...all along the intensity gradually increases. You kind of know what's eventually coming...force against force that will result in Capt Philipps' freedom or death. Of course, we knew he survived the ordeal, but the gripping suspense really takes over. My heart was pounding the last 20 minutes or so...culminated by the scene inside the rescue ship when the (real) Navy Corpsman examines Capt Phillips. Hanks' performance was Oscar-worthy...no doubt.

","Paul Greengrass has directed two of Hollywood's best action movies when he sat in the director's chair for The Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum. This time around though he tackled a real life situation and the result was something quite phenomenal. I would say most of the movie is good, but due to the incredible shots by Greengrass's camera the film only gains quality. Tom Hanks plays Captain Phillips, a man who in 2009 was captured by this Somali pirates and faced a life threatening equation. The experienced Hanks handles the character well and gives a very human side to him. This isn't a particularly hard role, but let's just say that besides Tom Hanks, there are only a handful of actors who could have pulled off what he pulled here. The revelation is obviously Barkhad Abdi, who puts some so called ""Hollywood"" actors to shame. He shows a lot of maturity in a demanding role for someone with his inexperience. My favorite part of the film was without a doubt the directing approach by Paul Greengrass. It is the kind of work that I believe should have been nominated at the Oscars and it is truly a shame. Captain Phillips is a very entertaining thriller and overall it delivers. Dramawise however the movie lacks a bit since I don't believe it to be the best worked angle. It is dramatic but not to a great extent.<br/><br/>Rating 7,5/10"
"lee_eisenberg","7","0","2","18 February 2014"," Thanks for nothing, Siad Barre!
","Paul Greengrass's ""Captain Phillips"" emphasizes the battle of wits between the title character (Tom Hanks) and the Somali raiders. The movie makes clear that the raiders aren't evil people; living in an impoverished, war-torn country, they get forced to work for a local warlord. As main raider Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi) reminds Phillips, the opportunities in Somalia aren't the same as the ones in the US. Siad Barre's destruction of the country's economy and foreign countries' fishing in Somali waters didn't help matters.<br/><br/>If Abdi becomes the first Somali to win an Oscar, then he'll deserve it. He shows Muse as a desperate man, seeing Phillips only as an agent of Somalia's impoverishment. I recommend the movie."
"migueloliveira-16","7","0","1","17 February 2014"," Captain Philips
","--Minor Spoilers--<br/><br/>Excellent performance from Tom Hanks in this one, as we come to expect from him. In this movie he's the captain of the container ship MV Maersk Alabama cruising along Somali coast and heading to South Africa. In the way the ship is intercepted by Somali pirates and the story develops from here. <br/><br/>This is not the usual action movie where the hero saves the crew from the evil pirates, this is a more realistic movie, there is no hero, just the captain trying his best to have his crew safe. Phillips (Tom Hanks) is a well developed character in my opinion, but I think Muse (Barkhad Abdi) could have been more developed from the start, because we never quite understand his motivations until late in the movie. Nevertheless the screenplay is well written and moving. I didn't quite understand some of Phillips actions while on the safe boat because all he had to do was wait, but I guess he started to feel sorry for the pirates so it's OK.<br/><br/>I was very moved by the last scene where Tom Hanks makes a extraordinary and believable performance, my god, I was really impressed (I shouldn't be because, well, it's Tom Hanks...) and no doubt his performance was the best this movie offered."
"christian94","6","0","1","17 February 2014"," Not up to par with ""A Hijacking""
","With favourable reviews, buzz from friends, a fine lead actor and director, I may have fallen victim to high expectations for this one, but in many aspects this under-delivered.<br/><br/>Firstly, a year before, Tobias Lindholm's ""A Hijacking (2012)"" did a much better film on the subject. The Danish drama had better tension, storytelling and all around acting. It also capitalized on the situation back in Denmark, not only on the boat to give it a real multi-layered, multi-prong approached that worked. <br/><br/>Secondly, the running time doesn't work for me, as there is a considerable time focused on the US assault team planning to attack the highjakers while the core subjects of the film (the captain, crew and hijakers) lose focus. It is also too Hollywood American gun-ho a la ""Zero Dark Thirty (2012)"". Time and pace was much tighter in ""A Hijaking"" at 103 mins or even Greengrass' better film ""United 93 (2006)"" at 111 mins vs this longish 134 mins. So the beginning and middle of ""Captain Philipps"" were engaging enough, but I could have cut down 15-25 mins easily and even take more time in the epilogue if any thing. Not sure why this movie was nominated for editing or even best adapted screenplay, especially when ""Prisoners (2013)"" only got a cinematography nod.<br/><br/>Thirdly, I just saw ""Cast Away (2000)"" again and Tom Hanks' talent is mostly unutilized here comparing to his skill and range. The only redeeming feature of ""Captain Phillips"" that saves it from average is the incredible scene with the nurse when he is in shock. That scene alone is almost worth the hit-and-miss movie, but it doesn't quite save it either.<br/><br/>I am not sure why this movie is so well received and regarded, but I dare anyone to compare it to ""A Hijacking"" and still find it better."

","Review: What intense drama! This is a very well made movie that is intense from the beginning till the end. The director done a great job by making the audience feel that they are on the ship with Hanks. Personally, I couldn't believe that a shop that was carrying so much cargo, didn't have any security or weapons on board, especially as they were going through a territory that was known for kidnapping, but that just my personal opinion. The whole cast made the movie feel real and the director put together a brilliant cast, especially the Somalians who get just as much screen time as the Americans. Anyway, this is definitely a movie not to be missed.<br/><br/>Round-Up: After watching the documentary on the DVD, it's amazing how much the director had to take into mind to get the story close to the true story. On top of the fact that a majority of the film is really set on a real boat and at sea, I think that the movie is extremely well put together, especially the ending when Hanks breaks down. As usual, Hanks is brilliant as Captain Phillips and I couldn't see anyone else playing his part. I'm glad that the film nearly quadrupled its budget, because it really does deserve it after all of the work that was put into it.<br/><br/>Budget: $55million Worldwide Gross: $218million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there movie about a group of Somalians who kidnap a boat and it's crew for ransom. 8/10"
"kgprophet","6","0","1","12 February 2014"," Ugh! Great Film but Two Hour Rule!
","I don't really care what kind of justification a director gives to clock a singular subject of a movie such as this over two hours. In fact, this is the first film Greengrass has released over that magic threshold. Why do I make such a big stink about this? Because we the audience have a natural clock, there is a limit to our patience when telling a story. Here Capt. Phillips goes 10 minutes over, and it is very easy to see where those trims could be made. Especially in the third act. Again, I don't care if it accurately, minute by minute, recounts what happened. Time condensation is still being done, and although I never read the source material, I would seriously believe some events and time were condensed for the sake of pacing. On the positive side, I would give serious consideration for an Academy Award for Editing. The tension feels real throughout. You have to give credit, between the shaky cam documentary feel to the sharp cutting, that the pacing never lets up. It is just there are obvious points of repetition, especially when the cast is confined to the claustrophobic lifeboat capsule. The many hours actually spent in the craft is more than abundantly portrayed with the redundant arguments and monotonous shots of Tom Hanks just sitting there.<br/><br/>The story up to that point is well presented with little chaff. Hanks has the problem of selling his character to an audience that may remember him as Captain Miller from ""Saving Private Ryan"". In other words, how well can we buy that this guy doesn't have any military experience, no combat time? There is not much Hanks can do other than to wear those more frightened emotions in situations of confrontation and not let his legacy strain credibility.<br/><br/>Minor Spoiler ahead.<br/><br/>In fact, it takes other members of the crew to grab one of the bad guys and show the toughness that one might expect out of our lead.<br/><br/>Minor Spoiler finished.<br/><br/>By the time he is the lone hostage away from the crew in the lifeboat capsule, the screenplay has done a good job at showing the true heroism of the captain, who is trying to keep the crew out of harm's way by sacrificing his own safety. With so much riding on Hanks and how much he can disappear into the character, the movie's success and award nominations speak for themselves. Some controversy has arisen over whether Hanks should have been nominated for an Academy Award. The problem comes from the fact that the filmmakers chose to portray the actions of Captain Phillips with a great deal of accuracy, meaning it doesn't include any breakout performance.<br/><br/>Minor spoiler ahead<br/><br/>However, the end scene after Hanks is rescued is a very human moment that connects very well as he tries to overcome the shock.<br/><br/>Minor Spoiler finished.<br/><br/>Greengrass as a filmmaker continues to impress with the energy and realism he injects. It is with reluctancy that I no longer will see one of his films in the theatre because of my problems watching his shaky camera style. But I will still watch them eagerly on DVD. I actually think this style of cinematography is appropriate for this recreation of real events. But I challenge Greengrass to take on a subject where maybe just once he sees what happens when he puts the camera on a tripod."

","'Captain Phillips' is an interesting little film. It's based on the true story of the real life Captain Phillips who was taken hostage by Somali pirates. The film portrays Phillips as a hero, but this has since come under dispute by people involved with the real life incident. Regardless of whether these claims are accurate or not Phillips story makes for a damn fine film.<br/><br/>It must be noted that director Paul Greengrass never goes over the top in portraying Phillips as hero. He's nothing remotely similar to the likes of Bruce Willis in 'Die Hard' or Clint Eastwood in 'Dirty Harry'. He's simply a man who finds himself in a terrible situation and acts accordingly and well. Even if the odd detail is touched up here or there to fit the film better I really don't see the issue. Any minor controversy really isn't warranted.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Barkhad Abdi has received an Academy Award nomination for his performance and it's well deserved. The fact that this was his first ever acting performance is astonishing. He brought a realism to the role that I suspect many actors who had decades of experience under their belt would struggle to achieve. His story is quite truly inspiring. Tom Hanks on the other hand has been robbed of a nomination in my opinion. He was brilliant throughout, but in the final 20 minutes he delivers some of the highest quality of acting imaginable. His final scene is mesmerising. I feel if a scene or two earlier in the movie had been tweaked a touch, to give him more of a chance to shine, he would likely be there with a nomination next month as well.<br/><br/>It's a fascinating story, told in excellent style by Greengrass that deserves to be seen. It deserves its nomination for Best Picture but probably doesn't quite have the guns (pun intended) to take home the award. Hanks is usually pretty reliable when it comes to signing himself on to quality films and this is no exception."

I'm not going to get into inconsequential technical or minor accuracy stuff. And frankly, I wasn't even really aware of any - only that which I have read on here. Do I wish that a movie about a true story would be made that is 100% accurate and depicts things as they actually happened? Yes, of course. But I think that the movie depicted the captain and the pirates in a fair way. Some people have complained about really picky things. If that's all they can find wrong with this movie, then that tells you something - that this is a good movie.<br/><br/>I watched this movie when I was tired and let me tell you, I DID NOT FALL ASLEEP. And I was laying (lying?) on the couch while watching, which is very conducive to falling asleep for me. The movie kept my attention the entire time. From the moment the pirates boarded the ship, I was pretty much always on the edge of my seat. Not only did the pirates take Captain Phillips hostage, they took me as well. I was pretty much crying at the end along with Captain Phillips. I really felt and understood his emotions.<br/><br/>This movie was much better than I expected. Although I love Tom Hanks, I initially only thought it would be kind of good. I wasn't real keen on watching a movie with seemingly mostly Somali pirates, especially, tbh, skinny, sweaty & stinky-looking ones with bad teeth. Sorry. But I love Tom Hanks (who doesn't) and I had heard good comments about it from others, so I chose this one. I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>Irish, I mean, Tom Hanks, you did it again. And boo to the Academy for not giving you an Oscar nod. The ending scene put the cherry on top and you should have received a nom for that alone. I was crying along with you. The scene seemed very real to me. To the person who played Muse, I saw you on a talk show and found you to be very likable. You did a great job in the movie and congratulations on all your success.<br/><br/>And lastly, just seeing the military ops in the movie made me verklempt and brought tears to my eyes to know that there are people like this in real life who train and work hard to prepare for situations like this. Say what you want, but this is a great country and I am very proud of it and all those who serve it. THANK YOU <br/><br/>Seeing only four pirates in a little tiny boat board that huge ship and take it hostage really boggled my mind. I can only hope that after that incident, those ships are now equipped with weapons for protection.<br/><br/>Be sure to eat any popcorn you get before the movie starts and finish it at least within the first few minutes.

","First of all, in my view, if Mr. Hanks were to be seen in 2 or 6 films per year and they were as good as this one then all of them deserved a full menu of award nominations. That the Academy decided that Mr. Hanks was to be overlooked for best actor award shows once again that it has had its rudder shot off and it is adrift. More than this, the Academy, to which Hanks has graced so many films, honouring the craft of acting, has shown that it is without sense and is not above trashing one of its greatest stars. Shame on the Academy.<br/><br/>This is a really good action adventure based on a true story. There are so few weak points in this drama that they do not merit mention. To say that the end of the film is one of Tom Hank's finest film moments would not be so much of a spoiler as a loud standing ovation. This is why we love this man. <br/><br/>A deeply disturbing film on some levels, stolen as it is from the yearly toll of hijacked shipping both in the Somali arena and in other areas of the world. Cargo carriers are forbidden to carry arms, which they could use to defend themselves. Hence, so many are taken over by gun wielding pirates of the seas. This film is not in defence of or is a critique of why Somali's take to the oceans to launch piratical attacks. It is a drama that forces human beings into collision courses, with long premeditated plans tossed overboard, with chaos coming down all around. This is the world we live in and it is not pretty. <br/><br/>I would watch any film with Tom Hanks in it. He is a joy to watch. The Somali actors were also very convincing. As I say, a very well done drama and worth award considerations."

","Once this gets going, it keeps you glued to your seat. ""Captain Phillips"" is based on the story of the Mearsk Alabama, which really was captured by pirates off the coast of Somalia in 2009. As the title suggests, the movie (based actually on a book written afterward by Phillips) focuses on what happened to Phillips after he was taken hostage and held for ransom, which negotiations being conducted by the U.S. Navy.<br/><br/>After a brief introduction, which serves primarily to introduce us to Phillips as a family man, most of the movie is set either on the Maersk Alabama, or in the lifeboat the pirates use to escape and in which they take Phillips. Perhaps it's merely because we know what's going to happen, but even as the scenes aboard the ship start out slowly and calmly, with Phillips merely taking command, there is a sense of tension. There are warnings of piracy activities in the region, and as the Maersk Alabama begins to track the pirates on radar, that tension builds, leading up to the takeover and hostage taking.<br/><br/>The experiences of Phillips on the lifeboat are harrowing. Hanks does a superb job with the character - his most powerful scenes coming at the end, as he's released back into U.S. custody and gets taken to the warship's sick bay and begins to break down as he's examined by a doctor. Those scenes are rife with emotion. It's impossible not to be drawn into the character at that moment and to begin to wonder just what the experience would have been like. It really was a brilliant performance by Hanks, who built the character slowly but surely over the course of the movie, leading to that final scene.<br/><br/>Some of the Maersk Alabama's crew members have challenged the accuracy of the film. Some have suggested that Phillips was not as much of a hero as the film suggests and that he was, in fact, to some extent to blame for what happened by not listening to warnings to stay 600 km off the coast of Somalia (the Maersk Alabama was only a little over 200 km off the Somali coast when this happened.) I can't vouch for the history, of course, except to note that it's obviously filmed from Phillips' perspective, being based on Phillips' book about the incident. As a movie though, this is in fact quite gripping, and it's one of Hanks finest performances. The movie even manages to take a fairly even-handed approach to the pirates, not portraying them as evil but rather more as desperate people living in a desperate part of the world. (8/10)"

","Captain Phillips is based on the true story of how Captain Richard Phillips got abducted by Somali pirates. From the beginning, the suspense sets us in the mood of the story. And with talent like director Paul Greengrass, the suspense is pulse-pounding. I'm not much of a fan of shaky cam, but like with the two Bourne films Greengrass directed, the technique is used to make it more suspenseful instead of dumbing it down and giving you a headache like The Hunger Games. The one who should be congratulated the most for this incredible film achievement should go to Tom Hanks, who gives an astounding performance as the title character. The last 15 minutes of the film is where he really nails it, especially in the very end. Barkhad Abdi also gives an incredible performance as the Somali pirate leader. Being based on a true story, Captain Phillips does what a biopic should go; give the facts and not sugarcoat it. What an incredible modern film achievement!"

It's one of those movies where you know the ending, but can't wait to get there. All parties involved, from actors, director, cinematographer, were spot on.

","Captain Phillips is one of those intelligent yet simple thrillers, which without much gunpowder or even brains, get you hooked in just a few minutes. Such films are a rarity these days. But there is more to it than just a survival thriller.<br/><br/>Captain Richard Phillips is a merchant merchant mariner, whose ship is hijacked by 4 Somali pirates. Captain Phillips unsuccessfully tries to negotiate but end up being a hostage.<br/><br/>Global capitalization is a topic which hasn't been brought up in many movies. As I said, Phillips is not just a survival tale but it questions the effects of global capitalization, and the countries' drive and greed for power and control. Countries like Somali try to survive the death race started by other superpowers.<br/><br/>The story not only lets you feel what Rich is feeling, but also the pirates' perspective. Which makes us wonder, where they really bad? Why won't they just give them the money? Muse's character is so intelligently crafted that the viewer only empathizes as much as Greengrass wants him to. Barkhad Abdi compliments this by a splendid acting performance.<br/><br/>This film is the perfect example of 'acting with expressions and eyes'. Tom and Barkhad, compliment each others' performances throughout the film, and their eyes do the talking. Tom really outdid himself by portraying a shocked and traumatized captain at the end. It is very disappointing that he didn't get nominated, but I guess it was due to competition, all the nominations for best actor are simply marvelous. I guess its time the academy needs to extend the number of nominees for major categories other than best picture.<br/><br/>Direction: Greengrass is great, a strong narrative and a strong hold on the film. He easily gets us hooked in just a few minutes. I haven't seen any of his previous works as of yet, thus the hand held camera really gave me a few headaches and dizziness, maybe it was done to give the viewer a more 'seasick' effect.<br/><br/>Script/Story: Superbly written, minimal dialogues. A simple screenplay, but the film is more about expressions than dialogues.<br/><br/>Acting: Tom is back, and he is at his best, he deserved a nomination. Barkhad Abdi was good for a newcomer with no experience whatsoever, though I don't see him wining the Oscar. Rest of the cast was equally good, especially the Somali actors.<br/><br/>Music: The score had a striking resemblance to inception's score. I mistook the composer for Hans Zimmer, until I checked it. But further reading, I came to know that Zimmer was involved but remained uncredited. Nevertheless an amazing score, if not Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>Overall a nail-biting and strong believable thriller. As it isn't a mind twister of a thriller it can easily be enjoyed when you want to rest your head after a long day of work."

","This is one of my top 5 movies of 2013, and it is an incredibly great film. Firstly I was in doubt to watch it, but then I was so attracted and I couldn't get off the screen. I loved the cast. It was awesome. Especially Hanks and those pirates. Even though my favorite this year is DiCaprio, Hanks did a great performance, definitely one of my favorites. I loved the performance of Barkhad Abdi as well. I hope we will see him in other great performances. Especially the last moment, the trauma-thing, he did it so well, I was heartbroken. All the Oscar nominees are well-deserved but I am so disappointed Hanks was left out of the race, because he actually deserved it more than some of the other nominees. The screenplay is really awesome. It's based in a true story of course, and all the time it made you think ""Oh my god, this actually happened"". Just in the time you thought everything was going well, there's a twist which changes the whole story. You'll never get bored and you'll be waiting eagerly to know what happens in the end. It was well-written and perfect, it got immediately to the point of the movie. The soundtrack is awesome, it goes perfectly well with the situations in the movie, it gets more and more intense. All in all, this is a MUST-SEE. I give it 10\10 :)"

","This is the movie based on the real incident which has happened in 2009 at the Somalian coast. This movie is to save a captain life from the captive of Somalian Pirates. I was reading many things regarding the hijacking of ships while ship passing through near the coast of Somalia, but this particular movie gives me the clear picture of what is happening actually at the time of hijacking of a ship. One of the interesting things here that, the way captain attitude towards the pirates. Tom honks makes this movie really thriller one and I think no actor can perform like him as he makes it better one. The ship started from the of unknown port, I think it is from the Shalala Oman, with full of container loaded in the ship. Then it starts a smooth journey till them rectifying the pirates coming towards them. In between director didn't forget to shows us what is happening among the pirates. They are simply recruiting the young and minor boys from the crowd and whoever knows how to handle the gun they can go with them for hijacking a ship. All hijackers are majority from the fisherman and they will not have any proper education and majority of them are wrongly motivated by someone with a particular interest. Each group of pirates will be having a boss and they have to cover the quota in each week. One of the noticing things here that they are all are from the Muslim background. Then ship started journey, pirates people are started journey from the coast in a mother boat with all facilities including gun. They will be starting in a boat till they find out the ship, and if they find out any lonely ship they are starting in a small speed boat to reach to ship as fast as possible. When the captain of container ship noticed it, he will be very hurry to get assistance from the outside including the marine coast guard. At the first attempt, pirates could not make it up because of lack fuel, but they went and came second time. When they tried to approach to the ship, Capitan and crews were tried to resist them, but everything went on veil and they entered in to the ship. At the initial moment itself they tried to threaten the captain. Before the pirates come in to the ship, captain gives the direction that all crews should be gone to engine room and whichever places where they cannot easily identify them. Then they started to search for the crews in order to make them as captive so that they can bargain for the money by using them. But pirates could not find them, while the captain of the pirates where searching in the engine room, the crews makes down him with their physic, that went on well and they tried to barging by using him, but the highly experienced pirates can easily detect any moves and finally managed to escape from the ship by a life boat with captain Philippe. So they makes him captive and then started to move to Somalian coast. Then the ship started to follow the lifeboat. Till then the information of hijacking of US ship might have reached in the land they started to make operation to free the captain from the captive of the pirates. The captain behavior towards the pirates would be the friendly one, but the return like hostile attitude. Finally by the intention of discussion with older relatives of pirates, the marines will take the leader of the pirates in to the US force ship, but it was mere intention, nobody will be there. In between the force started to make a operation, and they will execute the operation, from the three pirates killed they will freed the captain. At that time Captain mind will be completely out of order and it has taken little time to calm down. Then they will inform the pirates leader they had killed 3 of his colleagues and I u will have to face a trial in US. Now still he is facing 33 years of rigorous imprisonment in the US jail. This movie is completely thrilled one and director makes his role very well."

","Exhilaration and suspense are the general orders of the day. From stem to stern, Tom Hanks' performance skillfully steered this thriller through a gauntlet of anxiety, continually cudgeling the viewer with twists and turns. The perpetual to-and-fro between Captain Philips and Muse (Barkhad Abdi) are brilliantly orchestrated. Understood, the pirate leader is caught between a rock and a hard place. Let me see – should I cry for him and his crew? Are you out of your freaking mind? I am happy to say that very little sympathy is afforded this nautical terrorist and his cadre of cut-throats. Kudos to Paul Greengrass for not falling victim to the tempting Hollywood practice of elevating the immoral while, at the same time, condemning the moral – well done. To those who seek excuse for these corsairs, might as well recast history one step farther and rethink the wisdom of Nuremburg. What is wrong is wrong. Is the movie over-the-top? Who knows – who cares – it was a quality movie and good entertainment. I can only watch it once but I do recommend it to others."

","Look at me, look at me (well maybe you can't) but I am the pun captain now. Because I am going to hold you hostage with a plethora of puns in yet another film review voyage upon my pun-man ship. Please don't jump off!! OK, I am going to bring you my insight of the masterful movie ""Captain Phillips"". The film is based on the real life 2009 incident where cargo ship capitan Richard Phillips was taken hostage on a cargo lifeboat by four Somali pirates. Tom Hanks pitch-perfect starring performance as the title character was on board as one of the best acting efforts of the year. It's too bad the Academy rocked the boat when they left Hanks off the Best Actor Oscar nominee list. Newcomer Somalian actor Barkhad Abdi's freshman effort as the Somalian pirate leader Muse was a gem. Abdi's facial expressions alone were worthy of all the acting accolades his performance has received. Director Paul Greengrass has once again proved that the green is always richer on our side when he is orchestrating suspense action films based on true stories. Greengrass anchors ""Captain Phillips"" quite swiftly, just as he perfectly piloted ""United 93"". Billy Ray's screenplay was very compelling and included what probably is the movie catchphrase of the year ""I'm the captain now"". So whether you pirate this movie or not (recommending the latter of course), you should take a look at ""Captain Phillips"". ***** Excellent"
"sjohnson134-878-955038","5","0","1","28 January 2014"," The Hijacking of the Maersk Alabama
","The 2013 film Captain Phillips is adapted by Billy Ray from the 2010 book A Captain's Duty: Somali Prates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea, written by Stephan Talty and Captain Richard Phillips, but was originally inspired by the 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking by four Somali pirates led by Abduwali Muse on the Indian Ocean. Captain Richard Phillips was a merchant captain of the cargo ship Maersk at the time of the hijacking. The book tells the story of the hijacking and the capture of Phillips by the pirates, and not only does it tell his harrowing tale, but how his family, living in Vermont, was dealing with the drama unfolding on television. With 30 years of experience at the time, he tells in the literature of how he attempted to keep the crew hidden and safe, with only himself as a possible hostage. All of this led to the drama of many days in the Maersk's lifeboat with the pirates. The U.S. Navy, aware of the hijacking, put together a very large force, with tensions rising and Phillips fearing for his life. The ship was headed for Mombasa, Kenya when the four young pirates attacked and managed to board the ship. Having received training in dealing with piracy, the crew (14 of them) was taken into what was called a secure room by the chief engineer Mike Perry. Using tactics to avoid being board proved ineffectual and the pirates managed to take the ship. With all the systems shut down, the entire ship went black. It is here that Captain Phillips and several other crew members were captured and where the pirates learned that they could not control the ship. With Perry outside the secure room, he managed in the dark to take the leader of the pirate's prisoner and other crew members stabbed one of the pirates in the hand. Negotiations by the crew and the pirates fell through and the captain with the pirates went into the lifeboat showing them how it operated and fleeing the ship. The USS Bainbridge arrived and took the ship to its original destination. At this point, the lifeboat was surrounded by not only the Bainbridge, but the USS Halyburton. Here Phillips attempted to escape but was recaptured. Attempting to hook up with their comrades and trying to anchor near Somali shores where they could hide the captain, and let them land quickly if the lifeboat was attacked. The Maersk arrived in Mombasa, Kenya with the U.S. military escort. The lifeboat was then persuaded to be towed by the Bainbridge. A marksman opened fire and killed three of the pirates on the lifeboat; Phillips was rescued while the fourth pirate, Abduwali Muse, was aboard the Bainbridge and treated for an injury, was arrested. Muse was eventually taken to America for trial, charged as an adult (he was 18-years- old not the 15 or 16 he was trying to convince the court), and was sentenced to over 33 years in prison. The lifeboat, bullet holes and all, was donated to the National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in Florida. This book is very detailed explaining the captain's attempted escape and his rescue by Navy SEALs. The film is faithful to the literature and the events that took place during April 2009 and is a literally translation with some dramatic fictionalization taken by the director Paul Greengrass and screenwriters to make this a thrilling suspenseful action movie and to bring alive events that took place; even though, many who may have viewed this film already knew what had happened. Tom Hanks plays the role of Richard Phillips very well, but Barkhad Abdi is excellent in his first movie role as the Somali pirate Abduwali Muse. The plot and storyline as I have already stated follows the overall sequence of events that transpired during the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama. There is little difference between the film version and the literature's version of what happened. The dialog is crisp, but it is hard to understand with all of the yelling particularly in the lifeboat between the pirates. The use of intertitle cards was helpful, but had to be read to understand what was transpiring between the characters and distracted from the viewing of the film. Costumes and makeup appear to be accurate, again to bring the film to life; camera angles and the cinematography was handled well by Greengrass and Barry Ackroyd, with fine editing by Christopher Rouse to have the movie become the suspenseful film that it has become."
"cleary-joshua","10","0","1","26 January 2014"," The fact that it's true that makes the film even more unbelievable, supplementing the experience of the film rather than causing it...
","The second Paul Greengrass review I've written today, and it's odd how two of his films, ""United 93"" and ""Captain Phillips"", can be so similar in some respects, and yet so original and different in others. Both films are ultra-realistic and emotionally charged, telling stories of real events. However they both have so much merit to them for different things. One of the things Greengrass does best, especially here, is making you care about the story itself, the performances you're watching, and not the fact that it is a true story. It is the fact that it's true that makes the film even more unbelievable, supplementing the experience of the film rather than causing it.<br/><br/>""Captain Phillips"" tells the story of Richard Phillips, played by Tom Hanks, and how the container ship that he manned was hijacked by Somali pirates. You are shown the character of Phillips in great detail beforehand, especially his keenness on safety and following things by the book. When the pirates eventually manage to come on board in what is a heart-in-mouth sequence, Hanks is at his very best, managing to carry across both a large amount of fear and an attempt to seem calm. It is simply baffling that Hanks didn't get a Best Actor nomination for this, since he is consistently brilliant throughout, most of all in the very cathartic final scene where he breaks down during his medical.<br/><br/>The brilliance of the film comes through two things: you constantly feel like you're in the midst of all of the action and, despite the fact that you know how it's going to end, you have no idea how it's going to get there. When the pirates, played extremely convincingly by mostly first-time actors, are about to leave the ship, it feels like the film's about to end, and it could have there. I was incredibly glad that it didn't, since the second half is even more white-knuckle than the first. The claustrophobic confines of the lifeboat are terrifying, and you're constantly trying to figure out how Hanks is going to escape. The answer to this is through Navy SEALs, and a second fantastic sequence takes place during the final rescue attempt.<br/><br/>As always, Greengrass doesn't glamourise the events at all, and a lot of it is thrilling, gory and hard to watch. The original story of Phillips wasn't covered as widely in the UK, so I was fairly unfamiliar with it. It doesn't matter that it's true, and that's the real success of the film. You care about the characters there and then and are constantly in the moment, rather than considering the time that it actually happened."

","Though based on Richard Phillips' book 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea' which is the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years, the screenplay by Billy Ray (The Hunger Games, State of Play, Color of Night) is so brilliantly written that the 134 minutes of this 'docu- drama' tear through the mind at terrifying speed and there is not a moment when the audience can breathe without fear of missing the action. Of course, much of that is due to the impeccable direction by Paul Greengrass (The Bourne series, United 93, Green Zone, etc), but the kudos land directly for the extraordinary performance by Tom Hanks, in what many of us believe is his finest performance on film, along with 'Philadelphia'.<br/><br/>Because it is history, everyone knows the story: a multi-layered examination of the 2009 hijacking of the U.S. container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on a predestined collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship. In the breathtaking standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.<br/><br/>Greengrass had the right idea in casting completely unknown non-actors as the Somali pirate crew: Barkhad Abdi (born in Somalia but living in the US and serving as a chauffeur when he was cast with no acting experience at all), Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali – each is wholly credible in the tense drama both on the big ship and in the claustrophobic life boat where they hold Captain Phillips hostage. The entire cast is very well enacted, keeping the tension and the sense of terror at facing a battle for which they have never been trained.<br/><br/>This is a superb piece of filmmaking and why it was snubbed by the Oscar nominations is a conundrum.

"anthonymora2","9","0","1","26 January 2014"," Captain Phillips
","Captain Phillips is one of the most intense films I saw last year. Like Gravity, which premiered very close to this film actually, this thrilling drama shows the potential and very real dangers that come to these kind of occupations. Tom Hanks plays Captain Richard Phillips, I've always been a huge fan of Hanks, and his performance in this film, particularly during the last like half hour, brought me near tears. You don't see Tom Hanks in this role, you see Richard Phillips, you believe his performance the entire way through. You felt his pain, fear, and anger in every scene. It really was a shame he didn't get an Oscar nom for the role in my honest opinion. Another plus was the performance of newcomer Barkhad Abdi, the head pirate, Muse. Most the people I know who have seen the movie kinda pushed aside his performance, but you gotta see that this man is NOT a pirate in real life, he's a professional actor. This is his first movie role, but every second he's on screen, you don't see an actor, you see a Somali pirate, who is both intimidating with his long glares, but at the same time can deliver a line like ""I've come too far, I can't give up."" with enough acting talent that you can see this is just a man who needs money to get by back home. Even the crew of the Alabama ship did great. You believed these men were just a boat crew in way over their heads, but through the chaos, kept straight heads and avoided making typical, stupid decisions that a lot of secondary characters seem to do in movies like this. <br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass is someone whose work I've always enjoyed, I even like Green Zone a bit. A lot of people give him crap for the shaky cam in his past works, which CAN take you out of some of the action scenes, but for the most part Captain Phillips is a movie is great to look at. Even in tight spot scenes like in the engine room or the lifeboat, you'd expect to see nothing but blurred images and hearing action. However, intense action parts are well directed enough to where you soak in every suspenseful second. <br/><br/>The music is another plus for me, as is just the grand epicness of this film. I seen hundreds of explosions and car chases in movies, but the pirates attempt at boarding the Alabama and Tom Hanks firing off flares in an attempt to defend his fortress was one of the my favorite action sequences of 2013. Captain Phillips also has one of the most thrilling ending in all of film, I couldn't breathe, I was sweaty, and literally jumped up during my first even second viewing. <br/><br/>The only real complaint with this movie is that, at 134 minutes long, it felt a bit longer than it is, but a lot of it is just build up to the film's amazing climax. So I can't really complain. <br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a film that is definitely worth a viewing, with excellent acting, some great directing and just being an all out thrill ride. I give it an A."

","The movie is inspired by the American cargo ship called Maersk Alabama's hijacking that took place in 2009 on the eastern coast of Africa.

One was very much realistic about ransom negotiation and the other one was a clean entertainer on the opposite.<br/><br/>Maersk Alabama is the first American ship to be hijacked in over 200 years. Tom Hanks as captain Richard Phillip was brilliant. He continues to give his performances on the variety of roles in his movies compared to any other actors. That is why he's one of the rare actors in all fine movies of his.<br/><br/>As a formality the movie begins with the story where the captain Phillips' journey commence from his residence in America. After he flee to Oman to take his ship back to his country, he encounters the threat from a small group of pirates. Once the ship was held by the Somalians pirates the series of incidents occurs before the captain is taken as a hostage in a lifeboat. Then after there's no drama, everything was remarkably shown in those crucial parts with a slightly drag in ending. But the tensions were very well captured and wonderfully exhibited to us.<br/><br/>With an excellent direction from the director of the Bourne movie series, this movie came in his another top-notch. The movie had plenty of thrilling scenes takes you to the edge of your seat.

It was like someone from Maine imitating an old person from Boston, poorly. I thought his accent was going to annoy me all the way through the movie but it didn't. The movie is so well made and the basic story is so captivating that I forgot about his accent very quickly. The movie's plot line is quite focused.

","Tom Hanks apparently likes to star in movies where he saves the world/other/himself - apart or en suite - and he does it always well, irrespective of the script's quality. The movie in question has a solid basis in the form of biographical book, but the narrow venue and 2 hours 10 minutes combined make several scenes slow and dull to follow. And if you know the story behind, including how the hostage situation ended, there are now twists and you have to follow the events mostly taking place in small and half-dark premises - not so interesting if the scenes are long or recurring. However, dramatics in still in place, events seem realistic, and the conglomerate Maersk obtained free publicity (or was in the list of funders?).<br/><br/>As for performances, Barkhad Abdi as Abduwali Muse, pirate leader is also worth mentioning (well, in the beginning, I had difficulties to discern the Somali actors, but soon Abdi stack out). But the other characters-performances were uninviting to me, partially due to brief appearance on screen.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely worth watching if you like action taking places in a limited space of vehicle. Otherwise, you may experience decline in attention or would like to use fast forward function."

","As much as we as the audience know beforehand – spoilers alert – that Captain Rich Phillips survived the ordeal at sea back in April 2009, the movie chronically bringing the incredibly dangerous situation to life and holding your heart until the last second of the miraculous rescue. Captain Phillips is superb at portraying not only the desperately hijacked and kidnapped Americans, but also at bringing depth into the lives and desperation of the Somali pirates. You are disgusted at the senseless crime, yet couldn't help but feel for the pirates, essentially teenagers who were under the control of crime lords, lived in poverty, and never given a chance. It is heartbreaking to hear Muse repeatedly mumble ""everything is gonna be okay"" as if he himself is trying to desperately grasp any last hope while watching a train wrack in slow motion.<br/><br/>Great acting from Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi. Good directing and script overall. My only complaint is the movie went overboard with the ""US military saves the day"" propaganda.

","""Captain Phillips"" follows the story of the 2009 hijacking of the Maersk Alabama by Somalian pirates and the kidnapping of its captain. Its a very simple story but its one of the best movies that Paul Greengrass has ever made along with his great two ""Bourne"" movies. The action and suspense is incredibly tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the final climax of the movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives one of his best performances as the everyman Richard Phillips. Hanks gives the character such emotional intensity that by the time the movie is over you might just be as in tears as he is. But the standout performance is newcomer Barkhad Abdi as the lead pirate Muse. Abdi portrays Muse not as a stereotypical villain but as a naive man who's very desperate to get what he wants so that he can leave his life of destitution far behind him. You cant help but feel some sympathy for him since you get the idea of what his situation and life is like early on in the movie. Hanks and Abdi play off each other very well and share some poignant scenes together especially towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Greengrass's trademark shaky cam is used to very great effect without disorienting or confusing the viewer during the action scenes. He keeps things incredibly tense and when the movie slows down, the camera focuses on some powerful acting.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie because it is just that good and I would definitely rate it as one of the best movies of 2013."

","Captain Rich Phillips (Tom Hanks) was taking his American cargo ship on a routine voyage off the coast of Africa, when a small band of armed Somali pirates boarded the ship. While most of the crew stayed hidden, the pirates took Captain Phillips hostage in a lifeboat.<br/><br/>This movie, based on a true story, is extremely intense and exciting, so frightening, I don't think I could have watched it on the big screen, but on DVD, it was riveting and enlightening. There isn't any real violence until the very end, but the drama is kept at a unbearable level by the non-stop yelling of the pirates. Their leader is played by Barkhad Abdi in his first acting role. He is outstanding and deserves his nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Tom Hanks delivers a powerful performance, remaining calm and providing a balance to the pirates' hysteria.<br/><br/>The script manages to elicit sympathy for the pirates because of their miserable lives; they live in abject poverty, forced to hijack ships by their warlords or die. The movie is excellent and highly recommended."

","Tensed documentary real case presented in a movie. Diverse plot compared to what is out from the big screen recently. Sometimes even that is enough. Not in this case.<br/><br/>Unpleasant adventure of cargo boat and his crew. With unpredictable end. The real end of a true story showing the absurd world we are living in. <br/><br/>Unprotected cargo for millions of dollars floating with unprotected crew and not very maneuverable and fast ship. The reaction of the signals of help is ill-timed. The big army potential of the State is showed not when was necessarily to prevent the harm but in the end of the story. Would be the same if the used it in the beginning? To me, the captain could wait with the signal flares and use them when the pirate's boat is next his ship. Also he could escape with diving deeper and emerging more far. But all this is real story so it can not be a critic to the movie. We can also hardly accuse those kidnappers who were forced to act and were constantly saying ""all good Irish, all good."" <br/><br/>Tensed action with a thrill till the end. We saw a lot from the secrets of the craft of arming and their new toys (drones, night vision, tactics). When we add too all said another my favorite actor – as people say, who can act every role, the male Maryl Strip – the result is really good.<br/><br/>http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/"

","Tom Hanks takes the helm in this intense recreation of a Somalian pirate raid-turned-kidnapping on the open seas. Although it's most intently focused on the high-stress elements of the experience, which admittedly make for some gripping, powerful footage, I was most impressed with how even-handedly the film treated the Somali interlopers. While making no excuses for their actions, it successfully conveys an understanding of the pressures and motivations that would drive someone to attempt such a brazen assault and, ultimately, lends sympathy to their plight. Hanks is, predictably, excellent throughout as the stern-for-a-reason captain, though his New England accent seems to drift away with the tide as events unfold. His emotional breakdown near the end of the ordeal is particularly memorable and stirring. Although the plot doesn't cover a lot of ground, Captain Phillips is nonetheless effective at ratcheting up the drama and delivering a charged, uncomfortable, claustrophobic atmosphere."

","Captain Phillips was not at all what I expected it be, especially since I had not seen any of the previews prior to seeing this movie. However, because I am such a big Tom Hanks fan, I decided to give it a shot and boy am I glad I did. I had no idea what the movie was about until my boyfriend told me that it was based on the true story of the pirates taking over a ship in 2009, a story I remember seeing on the news.<br/><br/>Well I just got finished watching this movie and it was great! It moved at just the right pace. Held my interest the whole time. The actors portraying the pirates did a convincing job in their roles as the villains. They acted with such passion which help to bring some realism to the movie, almost as if I were watching a documentary. <br/><br/>Needless to say, Tom Hanks has given yet another Stella performance in a role.

","Paul Greengrass known for the Bourne Series and United 93 like tense, dramatized, sometimes real life events directs another movie with the same premise. <br/><br/>The real event of ship hijacking by Somalian pirates in 2009 is dramatized in this movie. As usual, the director rises tension levels to a fever pitch and you are on the edge of your seat in the entirety of the film. The constant cat and mouse struggle between first the Somali pirates and the unarmed crew members of the cargo ship and then between the pirates and the entire US Navy and Navy Seals is heart stopping to say the least. Two honorable mentions in the acting department. Tom Hanks as Captain Philips is impressive as always. The last 10 minutes of the movie where Hanks is shell shocked by the events was top class acting to say the least. Newcomer Barkhad Abdi who plays the Pirate leader is the revelation here. He is tough, mean and yet there is a humane side to him. He knows what he is getting into and yet he faces it with all conviction.

","Paul Greengrass is a director who in his 2006 movie UNITED 93 made my heart pound and my arms tingle to the point that I imagined I was having a heart attack or stroke, and began agitatedly searching my pocketbook in the dark of the theater for a quick aspirin– even though I knew the plot outcome. Coming from a documentary background this British director, screenwriter and former journalist did not disappoint with his newest thriller, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS based on the 2009 true story of the hi-jacking of the US container ship, Maersk Alabama by a group of Somali pirates – the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years. What makes this movie more than just your routine anxiety-provoking suspense drama is the beauty of Barry Ackroyd's camera work, slowly alternating between clear, chromatic aerial shots of the sea, the sky, the ships to chaotic, frenzied close ups of confusing claustrophobic moments - placing us, the audience in the center of the action and at times making me literally seasick.<br/><br/>CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is also a David and Goliath tale – the desperation of the Somali fisherman- turned pirates in small skiffs attacking a huge cargo ship; they who have nothing to lose as their meager livelihoods have been usurped by wealthy global conglomerates gobbling up their natural resources. They are beholden in these kidnapping ventures to their ruthless Somali ""warlords"", and risk their lives preying on vulnerable targets in international waters in order to sustain themselves economically, to the point of taking on the full force of the US Navy and Merchant Marine. The contrast in physiognomy between a robust Tom Hanks as the Captain and the bone-thin, almost skeletal appearance of the pirates makes the distinction between ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" frighteningly apparent.<br/><br/>The movie opens up in a small town in Vermont supposedly giving us some insight into Captain Richard Phillips' (a stoic and vulnerable performance by Tom Hanks) life and family. But this short introduction is a weak, commonplace beginning to a film, which thank goodness, grew more ""uncommon"" as I continued watching. The Somali actors were excellent, particularly Barkhad Abdi as Muse the fiercely determined, burning cavernous-eyed leader of the group, and a nuanced, sensitive performance by Mahat Ml Ali as a 16 year old young man whose innocence had not yet been patinaed by the harsh reality of hostage-taking.<br/><br/>CAPTAIN PHILLIPS left me feeling conflicted - relieved that Captain Phillips was rescued, and dispirited by the nature of the wide gulf that separates humankind. This chasm was accentuated cinematically, and metaphorically by the vast expanse of the open seas as opposed to the brutal confining architectural space of Phillips captivity. By the end of the film, I did not know whether to weep from joy or cry out in anguish for the abjection of lives lived in hopelessness."

","You may need to bring a defibrillator with you, as this film will make your heart beat so fast that it stops! The movie follows Richard Phillips; a cargo ship captain and the true events of the 2009 Somali pirate hijacking. Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Ultimatum, United 93) expertly captures the events on screen as it happened with complete- realism filming on an accurate ship, with the same army vessels and the sea also aids, obviously.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays protagonist Captain Phillips and we are shown the story through his perspective, from the first day of departure right through to the end. Hanks, already a two-time Academy-Award winner stuns and gives a performance equal to if not better than Forrest Gump, which we assure you is quite hard to do. In a recent interview with Hanks he states that in preparation for his character he met with the real Captain Phillips, discussing what really happened, to which Hanks replies 'We will probably do things that you didn't do, we will probably say things that you didn't say, but what I want to do is get a real version of you'.<br/><br/>The end third of the film is in fact so perfectly performed by Hanks that it captures the true human feelings: both physically and emotionally. How would you deal with your last living moments? What would do be thinking about? This entire sequence adds to its chances of successfully securing Oscars' for both Best Picture and Best Actor.<br/><br/>First-time actor Barkham Albi, playing the lead Somali pirate is simply sensational. His character Muse, is multi-layered pirate with both a violent nature, yet soulful. His showcase line (which is heavily seen in the trailers) – 'look at me, look at me. I am the Captain now.' In context to the scene in the film this incredibly performed. Screenplay- writer Billy Ray (Flightplan, The Hunger Games) crafts the Somali pirate characters expertly, bringing further depth to an already engaging film.<br/><br/>The entire 133 minutes running time of the film is shaped into a documentary-drama style and as mentioned shows these extraordinary, but sadly true events as it happened. Paul Greengrass makes great use of hand-held camera whilst in the small confined corridors and lifeboat, adding to the real shaky hostage effect. Hanks in a additionally said he had to ask where the camera was on set as he 'never saw them!'. Even though you know how it all ends, Captain Phillips is a tension driven classic that constantly keeps you on the end of your seat.<br/><br/>Read more of my reviews at - www.gonewiththemovies.com"
"dromasca","8","0","1","29 December 2013"," much more than an action thriller at sea
","There are a few good reasons for me not to like Captain Phillips. I am not a big fan of 'stories inspired by real events', especially when they try to follow closely the 'real events'. This film is based on real events, was made only a few years after the events occurred, and according to many accounts is quite accurate in following the real story. Yet the story does not get lost at any moment and tells much more that a docu-drama. It is a real strong drama by itself. I also dislike stories where unarmed and empty-handed heroes succeed to subdue armed and superior forces. There is no such thing here, the fight that is taking place (and there is a hell of a fight) is much more about psychology and about the power of will and spirit than the power of muscles and arms. Here is an American anti-hero rather than an American hero who survives and overcomes because of his anti-hero forces.<br/><br/>I did learn a few things about modern piracy that I did not know. Commercial ships - it appears - are not carrying arms and their crews look more like a gang of corporate technicians (they even are organized in unions), even when they sail oceans infested by pirates. This makes the boarding of a huge American commercial ship by four machine guns armed Somali fishermen turned into pirates and the subduing of the American crew of 20 possible (I avoid using 'credible' because it really happened). The resulting confrontation which becomes a thriller at sea makes 'Captain Phillips' a well paced and smartly filmed action movie, and the suspense is in the air all the time. Even as we know how it ends we are curious to understand how director Paul Greengrass (who directed both the real facts inspired United 93 as well as part of the fiction Bourne films) will lead us to that end.<br/><br/>One of the reasons of the success is no doubt named Tom Hanks. He can do no wrong and we all know it. He does even more here. If there was no concept of super-anti-hero before he just invented it. There is much more in his facing of his captors and the dialog with their leader who is so well acted by Barkhad Abdi that I had to go to Wikipedia to make sure that he is indeed a professional actor and not a fisherman from the coast of Somalia, maybe even one turned pirate. What we have here is a reflection about power. Who has the power? the guy with the gun? the guy with the bigger boat? What are the limits of having at hand the best technology and the best army, being able to launch satellites, send helicopters and deploy the best armed forces - does this ensure the safety of your (our!) mode of life? Great questions, and there are no definite answers in this piece of real history brought to screen, but the film has the huge merit of asking them."
"maximkong","6","0","3","29 December 2013"," A Fine Film Doing its Best to Stick Close to Reality, but not a Wholesome One
","When it comes to films premised on true events, a key priority in my ratings would be how close the film is able to convey what has happened in the real-life accounts. I have studied various accounts - testimony of Capt Philips, the director, the disatisfied crewman and the sole survivor of the Somali pirate group - I think the film has done its best to compress a 5-day ordeal into a two-hour movie and remained focused on the essence of the story, despite dramaticizing certain events.<br/><br/>To me, the true magic of Captain Philips lies in Tom Hank's acting performance of despair and trauma during the final 30-minutes of the movie. The performance from the Somali supporting actors was another surprise to me, even though I can sense some hints of stereotyping.<br/><br/>Tom Hank's version of Captain Philips was too talkative (as a hostage), making the Somali looked like they were easy targets for manipulation. Like other American-military theme based films, Captain Philips is still a victim of romanticizing the American glory, as the balance was being overly skewed towards the perception of the Americans (especially from a talkative Tom Hanks). It was reported that the Somali survivor's accounts was not captured in this movie. I think the film would have been more realistic if it was made in a slightly different feel, allowing the pirates more room to express their intentions and/ or how they feel about their actions.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment of all was that the movie does not fulfil one criteria to be having >8/10 rating - it is not wholesome. I am not talking about the fact that it ignored the accounts of some other crew members, or the account of the Somali pirates. I was referring to how the film doesn't do enough to fit into the bigger picture. Although both factors would help make the film better, I understand the limitations this film had. Captain Philips was one of the most dramatic newsflow (that involves just an individual, essentially) since the Obama administration. It was portrayed in the movie (which did happened in real life) that a dozen of SEAL guys and a big US Navy warship were up against a small lifeboat of 4 Somali pirates. What happens to the other ships captured by other pirates that probably summed up to 200 crews as hostages? It was reported by NY Times that ""Every country will be treated the way it treats us,"" Abdullahi Lami, one of the pirates holding a Greek ship anchored in the pirate den of Gaan, a central Somali town, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying in a telephone interview. ""In the future, America will be the one mourning and crying."" Honestly, the movie could have dedicated 10-20 minutes for that."
"Gordon-11","Null","0","1","29 December 2013"," A great film!
","This film recounts the hijacking of a US cargo ship by Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa back in 2009.<br/><br/>""Captain Phillips"" is an action packed, adrenaline pumping film. It wasts no time, and action already kicks in fifteen minutes into the film. It's a film of survival, the constant struggles to survive is well portrayed. However, I think the best scene is the last scene, where Captain Phillips is examined medically. It turns the run of the mill action film into a major tear jerker. It turns Tom Hanks from a fearless captain who calmly battle the pirates, to a human being overwhelmed with emotions. It is such a powerful scene, and sets ""Captain Phillips"" different from just a mindless action film."
"xdamaxxx","7","0","1","22 December 2013"," Captain Phillips
","There's no denying that Captain Phillips is a superbly made biopic. Paul Greengrass' distinctive lens captures a powerful, immersive portrayal of the true story of Captain Richard Phillips, who was taken hostage by a group of Somali pirates after they hijacked the container ship Maersk Alabama in 2009. This film gets a lot of things right. But it also comes across a few speed bumps along the way.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips can essentially be broken up into two separate films; the first half leading up to the hijacking which could be better, and the second half regarding the tense situation between Phillips and the pirates in the cramped quarters of the lifeboat which is flawless.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks hasn't delivered a performance that has received serious Oscar buzz in years and, I'll be honest, he is fantastic in this film at times. Like I said, the second half fires on all cylinders and he has never been better. He attempts to hold his composure while the tensions flare among his captors is some of the best acting I've seen all year. But in the events leading up to that, his performance seems a little forced, as if he is giving an imitation of Phillips rather than being him.<br/><br/>Also giving terrific performances are Barkhad Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali, as the pirates. None of these men had ever acted before and were selected from approximately 700 candidates. Needless to say, I think the casting director nailed it. There has been Oscar buzz for Abdi's performance as the unspoken leader of the pirates, but I wasn't as impressed with his individual performance as I was with the scenes involving all of the pirates arguing over their next move.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Billy Ray (The Hunger Games) does a good job at structuring the scenes. It's clear that the dialogue is an integral part of this film, unlike most action thrillers made these days. What I don't understand is why he didn't delve more into Phillips relationship with his family, or why he even included it at all. The film opens with Phillips conversing with his wife (Catherine Keener) on his way to work. He sends an email to here while on the ship after the first hijacking attempt, and that's it. It really confused me as to why they decided to use this at all. I did find it funny that they billed Keener second in the credits, even though they weren't listed by order of appearance.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass is best known for making action movies with a lot of shaky cam and that is evident again in Captain Phillips. Shaky cam normally doesn't get on my nerves and Greengrass is one of the few directors to have mastered the technique. Of course, cinematographer Barry Ackroyd (The Hurt Locker) should be credited for using it to its utmost effectiveness. There are times when the movie would be better off titled ""Claustrophobia: The Movie"".<br/><br/>I know people challenge the accuracy of the film. Some of the members of Phillips' crew have reportedly stated that Hanks' portrayal is way off. They have said that the real Richard Phillips knowingly put his ship and crew in danger by ignoring reports of pirate attacks in the area and sailing within the recommended 600 miles from the Somali coast. I understand where they are coming from, but I just wanted to see the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, Captain Phillips is a great film to watch. But some unnecessary scenes and slow pacing for the first hour or so hold it back from being so much more. But it's still a real thrill with good performances, outstanding camera work, and a finale that will leave you speechless and seeking a cardiologist.<br/><br/>FILM GRADE: B"

It very quickly takes a turn when a bunch of pirates board the ship and fear mixed with commotion breaks loose. <br/><br/>Made in a slightly documented style, the film revolves around pirates from Somalia opening up a whole new outlook at why a native Somalian would turn against mankind in such a brutal fashion. The pirates are portrayed with emotions and a history proving that they are indeed human.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks leaves the audience spellbound with his amazing acting.

"YJLcool","8","0","2","7 December 2013"," A detailed and realistic hijack-survival film I've ever seen
","Based on the book ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" written by Captain Richard Phillips, the film Captain Phillips tells the story of MV Maersk Alabama hijacking incident, which involves the captain's capture and hostage-taking by four Somali pirates in April 2009.<br/><br/>Although the film may be inaccurate (some of the crew members of the ship accused the film of being inaccurate in facts and does not tell the true story), but it's the most detailed and realistic hijack-survival films I've ever seen. The film successfully shows the constant struggle for survival in a life-or-death situation.<br/><br/>As usual, Tom Hanks delivers one of his best performances in this film, after realizing that the pirates are just poor and desperate Somali fishermen, he feels despair of his failure to convince them to surrender after knowing the inevitable fate awaiting his captors. In the emotional final scene, I find myself in tears during Hanks' powerful portrayal of a man experiencing post-traumatic stress. <br/><br/>However, the story is predictable, progressively slow and takes some time to build up to its climax. The details of the hijacking and subsequent hostage taking feels overly long and might put off a lot of audience. The shaky-cam technique, which is typically used in most Paul Greengrass' films in an attempt to make the film more realistic doesn't help much...even making it worst at times and hurt the film.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not the greatest drama film ever made, but it's worth a watch to those who want a realistic, detailed, emotional drama which is 'based on a true story' (we can never know how true it is, are we?). It's not for those who seeks simple hardcore Hollywood action entertainment (otherwise you'll be disappointed)."
"Panthersmith96","10","0","2","7 December 2013"," Tom Hanks really put in all his effort into this film.
","Fyi, this is my very first review:) This is a movie based on a true story. I cried at the ending where C.Phillips was finally rescued by the Navy. 3 Navy snipers shot the Somali pirates at a perfect timing when C.Phillips was blindfolded and tied up. He was attended by a medic and was really really in shock state. Near the middle of the film, C.Phillips looked like he wasn't afraid at all! But in the end, he revealed to be so terrified that he would try all means to escape. At the end of the movie, it wrote that the real C.Phillips actually went back to sea after a long recovery period. After thinking back through the movie, I wondered if the actual C.Phillips was in a worse situation than what the movie turned out to be. To sum up, Keep getting better Hanks!"

Tone - The film did a good job of depicting an awful situation realistically. Often times a film can be either preachy, or propaganda, but this film showed the audience a view from both sides and allows the audience to be the judge.

"asariel13","8","0","3","5 December 2013"," A wonderfully tense movie: gripping a refreshing manner
","I would recommend it for its cinematic value over its story.<br/><br/>The characters are intense: the unpredictability of the pirates, the desperation of the captain; they compliment each other so well, and surprisingly in a way that doesn't paint it all black and white. The pirates' desperation isn't conveyed ""terrorist-like"" at all but rather incredibly human. For all that their aggressive nature throughout the film keeps shocking you, the movie never tries to convince you that these are terrible men, but rather shows them as humans who have been pushed to the edge, one can almost relate to and come to understand them.<br/><br/>The camera work was great: erratic and short-burst scenes imitate that loss of controlled and peripheral vision that you too would lose in this sort of stressed situation. And the score throughout the film is also highly suiting, but just indistinct enough to never overpower the visual.<br/><br/>Finally a word on the issue of propaganda. I honestly feared this, the wide angled-panoramic shots of the navy ships, the sniper scenes... from the trailers it all looked like it could become one of the Michael Bay movies, ""courtesy of the us army"".. but to my pleasant surprise the Navy scenes feel dry when pitched against the much simpler yet emotion-laden and suspense-ridden scenes of the pirates and hostages. In fact, I felt that every scene that switches to the navy felt awkwardly cut and dry, almost like the movie purposefully makes those scenes forgettable. <br/><br/>While obviously (and I'm guessing this will have been for product- placement / sponsoring purposes) the film doesn't escape without a little bit of a sense of ""the great navy"", in the context of the film as a whole though I felt that these short, chopped and emotionally cold parts were completely overrun by the loaded acting of the pirates and the captain.<br/><br/>All in all a gripping and suspenseful movie, definitely worth watching!"

"armaani_katerpillar","9","0","2","5 December 2013"," A Must Watch Film. A Testament to Hanks and Greengrass's Mastery and Another Surprise Performance
","Captain Phillips is a biopic based on the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates in 2009, which focuses on the relationship between Richard Phillips and the Somali pirate Captain, Muse. Greengrass has managed to make a film that not only explores the myriad of consequences as a result of globalization but that is also a hair raising thriller. There are very little back stories presented for the two main characters in the film, Captain Philips and the Somali pirate leader. However enough is revealed for both that leaves a sense that both these individuals are just ordinary, normal people and (in the case of Muse) forced to embrace a darker aspect of life which their lifestyle commands. Paul Greengrass manages to capture this very effectively in the opening segments of the film. The movies beginning isn't all too interesting and just aims to establish the lives of both the main characters. <br/><br/>Even before the pirates board the ship there is nerve wracking tension. This whole scene, of the pirates attempting to board the Alabama and the crew fighting back was expertly crafted by Greengrass. The constant suspense and anticipation of whether the captain will manage to evade the pirates yet at the same time knowing that the pirates will eventually succeed. It needn't be mention that Hanks' performance was instrumental in conveying the scenes impact. He brilliantly portrays a balance between a sense of fear but also a veneer of courage by initially dismissing the pirates as harmless, which leads on to the next point. Paul Greengrass cleverly added points in the initial hijack that aimed to bring a false sense of relief to the viewers: the fact that the pirates temporarily retreated, how half were scared off and the water hoses and firepower of the crew apparently managing to hold the pirates at bay. However all this fabricated hope was slowly diminished as the crew and the atmosphere became riddled with panic and the obviously when the pirates attach the ladder to the side of the ship, a moment with a lot of gravity behind it. <br/><br/>The leader is immediately established as Muse by his control over his comrades and his more developed command of English. Both the title of the film and the first forty five minutes after the initial hijack suggest that the film is just about a captain and his crew fighting against a group of ruthless pirates. During the second half, however, it is understood that the pirates are as much as the victims as are the crew and captain Phillips and all that distinguishes them is their weapons, which are equally as unless because they are fighting an unknown enemy. This unseen adversary is the mind games and anxiety. The anxiety is the type of the thrill most common in the film. The pirates are faced with complicated decision, yet have awareness of naivety. However none of this is more troubling for Muse, played brilliantly by Barkhad Abdi. He is a very complex character and like Hanks, Abdi successfully finds a glance between a ruthless and threatening pirate but also being a sympathetic and surprisingly charismatic individual. That's what made his character so effective. No matter how vicious he seemed, he managed to convey the idea that Muse was just as human as everyone else. All this and the relationship between the captain and muse is explored in the late second half of the film whilst they are in the submarine and it is also where their relationship breaks down. Muse is pressured by his comrades, most notably Bilal, played by Barkhad Abdirahman, who also threatens Muse's leadership. During this segment of the film the tension is almost electric. The relationship between Phillips and the rest of the pirates begins to become strained and there is a constant fear as to whether Phillips will survive the ordeal. This is what makes the film so astonishing. The anticipation of what the pirates will or won't do and not knowing what will happen as a result of these actions. It also during this scene where the humanity of all the pirates, most notably Muse is established. There is a scene where Muse admits he has no choice at what he is doing and the desperation in his voice and actions indicates a much more profound and humane character of Muse. <br/><br/>The Navy seals involvement also provided tension and also more mind games: mostly who was going to be fooled by whose tricks and this is left to the very end. It also highlighted the reliance of the hostages on the Navy seals. Greengrass manages to create a portrait of the pirates as being cornered animals and although the question was no longer will the pirates be caught but when, it left a feeling of an imminent outburst by the pirates in a last attempt ditch attempt to make it out. <br/><br/>Overall Captain Phillips is a sophisticated and brilliant film. The character development and exploration was expertly handled and executed and the performances of Hanks and Abdi combined with the veteran techniques of Paul Greengrass to create endless tension and excitement equal an almost flawless piece of work. Greengrass also does well at grounding the film, in that it doesn't glorify or idealize the hero or exaggerate the villainy and evil of the antagonists but instead states that they are just individuals like you and me. However, if I had to pick one flaw in the film it was that the tension between Bilal and Muse was not delved into further but this was a minor element to an otherwise great movie."

","I will admit that I haven't heard anything about this real story until I heard about the movie. But, with me saying that, I'm really happy I was able to watch this film because emotionally I was fully into this movie and really liked this film.<br/><br/>If you have previously watched Paul Greengrass's previous films, he shoots his films in a shaky cam style that for me, at least, delivers on the realism of the situation. This is the case with this film because there was never a moment where I was taken out of the film as every single moment in the film felt real. The interactions between the characters, the hostage situation and the raw performances given by the entire cast really worked and were well delivered. Once things start to kick off, the film never stops on delivering the intensity and I found myself really invested with the film. There was never a moment where my eyes were taken off the screen.<br/><br/>I really can't say anything much about the performance except that everyone does a great job. Tom Hanks really gives a good performance and does deserve an Oscar nod for his role. He was able to give a raw performance to where I totally forgot that I was watching Tom Hanks acting, as he became the character. Also, there is a moment in the climax where I was completely shedding tears nonstop based on his performance alone. This man has a resume of great performances and for me; this is in the list of good performances delivered by this great actor. Now, this movie wouldn't have worked if the actors portraying, as the pirates weren't intimidating and they were able to give performances better than my expectations. These actors were able to appear frightening, very demanding and you will find yourself being scared of these guys. These characters aren't your typical villain and actually do have characteristics to them that you can see as they kidnap Hanks's character in the lifeboat. Throughout this lifeboat scene, the 4 actors and Hanks were able to deliver on the tension and will have you wondering what will happen to the captain; even wondering if he will survive.<br/><br/>This film was extremely well made to where I have little to nothing negative to say about the film. The only negative that I might have to bring up is that there is a moment where it did slow down, just for a little while, when the characters are on the lifeboat. The movie is a little over 2hrs. long and was well told. However, if they cut out only a gist of the scenes on the lifeboat, then it would have added more positive reaction to people who thought it was a little long. <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and this is definitely one of the best films of 2013 for me."
"genrobs84","9","0","1","4 December 2013"," Tension Roller-Coaster
","There have been few movies I've gone to where at the end I feel the same as the character(s). ""Captain Phillips"" is now one of them. The entire film is what I'd call a tension roller-coaster. In the beginning the tension is almost non-existent. But, because we know the story how it happened in real life, we're already ""suspenced"" by anticipation. As the film progresses we see how Phillips, his crew, and the US Navy, went to great lengths to keep the pirates at bay by cunningly surreptitious means. The tension rises and falls as the pirates become increasingly paranoid of their counterparts until it crescendos so loud it's as if you're suffering alongside Phillips right there.<br/><br/>When it stops, the shock is almost too real. Tom Hanks' performance of Phillips and the end of the crisis shows exactly what can happen to a person when they walk out of a life and death situation alive. The disbelief is so overwhelming, your mind goes numb. He did it so well, I thought for a minute he really was in shock.<br/><br/>The story is not just about Phillips and how he handled the ordeal. The film periodically focuses on all the captains involved in this event: Phillips, Muse (Somali captain), the US Destroyer captain, and the SEAL commander. It reminds those who are not captains of men to ask what would you do in such circumstances if it were you? If you were a leader of men burdened with a dangerous task, how would you handle it?<br/><br/>Finally, I'd suggest readers not fall for the hype others have posted about this film. You know who you are. It is not about ""'Merica"" and how we kicked a$$. It's about real men and the danger they faced. Of course, there are some artistic licenses, but that's a given with Hollywood. It's still an astounding story, with incredible acting, and nail-biting excitement."

","Pirates named ""Blackbeard"", big men with beards and cutlasses cutting a swath as they board galleons, stealing gold doubloons and anything else shiny to hand.<br/><br/>Long gone, consigned to the history books? Change the protagonist to a thin desperate Somalian man named ""Muse"", with a motley crew of young men in high speed skiffs, armed with AK-47's and a penchant for hostage treasure and we are bang up to date.<br/><br/>Instead of three masted treasure laden galleons, the rather more prosaic merchant cargo ship is the target, if the vessel is American flagged, all the better for the ransom demand.<br/><br/>Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is an ordinary man, attempting to make ends meet at home and worrying how his kids will find their way in the world. His day job is commanding the American flagged MV Maersk Alabama. Effectively a delivery truck on the high sea's, moving goods from here to there.<br/><br/>In this case, that journey traverses arguably the most dangerous sea in the world, not weather related but with the inherent risk of boarding by pirates operating out of Somalia, ""run"" by lawless warlords.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips checks the ship, kicks the tyres and sets off, safe in the knowledge that the risks are low and the maritime emergency team is ready to protect and assist if required. The crew are less enthusiastic, he calmly reminds them they signed up for the trip, if they want out, he can sign papers when they arrive at Mombasa.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a decent man, looks after his crew, does not want trouble and tries to always act in a professional manner. Once Pirates are encountered he takes initial steps that may be enough to repel the boarders.<br/><br/>Once the later scenes unfold, ""Muse"" (Barkhad Abdi) proclaims ""I'm the captain now"". Using the moniker of ""Irish"" to describe the demoted captain, they search for the ships crew who have been well drilled for just such an eventuality.<br/><br/>The film plays out as a cat and mouse game with high stakes, with Phillips presented with situations he cannot rationalise in the usual way. He wants to help, negotiate and find a way that ""Muse's"" repeated mantra ""everything will be OK"", will actually come to pass.<br/><br/>When offered the safe contents of $30,000 the new captain declares, ""Do I look like a beggar?"" A decent man is out of his depth in such circumstances and Director Greengrass puts his leading man through the ringer, taking his nail bitten audience along for the ride. Both protagonists are completely believable, there is sympathy on both sides with a screenplay that does not pander to either predicament or attempt to preach in anyway.<br/><br/>Phillips is just doing his job, as are the pirates in their own way, each with their own bosses and performance expectations. Nobody is likely to win and real world sentiments are perfectly judged by both director and screenwriter.<br/><br/>As always, Hanks anchors the film with a superb every-man performance but is comfortably matched by the first time performer Abdi, who in physical appearance and acting ability, personifies who you might expect in such a situation.<br/><br/>The later scenes are intense, with closing situations that stretch naturalistic acting ability to the limit. There is nothing to dislike here if the subject matter interests you and it should, as here is a metaphor for the wider world and the harsh new realities we all face.<br/><br/>It is clear from early on, that ""everything will really not be all OK""<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Highly recommended thriller, based on the true story of the first American cargo ship taken by pirates in two hundred years.<br/><br/>Intense, completely believable and with pitch perfect performances from all involved. Coupled with an intelligent director and screenplay, this represents one of the best films of 2013.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"

","This is a very good movie. 'Movie' enough that it's enjoyable from a movie-lover's perspective, and realistic enough that you feel you've seen a fair representation of events, as much as any movie can give. Thankfully avoids the gratuitous or bloody violence that afflicts so many modern pictures, while leaving you in no doubt about the potential for extreme violence that the characters have.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks again? Yes, but he tones down much of his characteristic affability, and is very believable as the captain of the cargo ship. (As with George Clooney in The Perfect Storm, Hanks happened to bare a strong likeness to the real captain of the ship, so was pretty much ideal.)<br/><br/>The plot is closely based on a real hijacking of a large cargo ship off the Somali coast in 2009, and the key role of the Captain in manipulating the hard-bitten hijackers and get his ship, his crew and himself to safety ... however, events spiral out of control, thwarting both his and the hijacker's best laid plans, and other forces appear on the scene to raise the stakes even higher. It's hard to say too much without edging into spoiler territory, so if you don't know anything about the actual hijacking, I'd suggest not finding anything out beforehand to get the most from the movie, but even if you do, you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>The whole cast gives a pretty flawless performance, somewhere between United 93 and Zero Dark Thirty in tone. Barkhad Abdi as the cool, dedicated and desperate pirate leader is mesmerizing, and is a sure Oscar tip. The American crew give such a polished, realistic performance that you can't help placing yourself in the situation, and wondering what you'd be doing or thinking.<br/><br/>The film is well paced, the two hours passing easily, with no spurious padding. It's simply a good movie - not a great one, but good.<br/><br/>I say not 'great', simply because while it entertains, thrills and informs (to an extent), it didn't leaved me 'moved' afterward. I'd have personally liked to have seen more of the hijackers' back stories. I've had a number of good friends from related backgrounds (not Somalia, but Nigeria, rural Zimbabwe and township South Africa), and I think their first reaction would be, 'It's good, nice to see some realism about what some people have to cope with, but we're not all hijackers you know!'.<br/><br/>So, to sum up: top draw movie, ace performances, a little more Africa back story might have helped."

"jwhittier16","8","0","1","2 December 2013"," Captain Phillips Film Review
","Captain Phillips is a stunning action/adventure film featuring Tom Hanks, and Barkhad Abdi as captain Richard Phillips, and Somalian hijacker Muse. The movie takes place in 2009 on boats off the coast of Somalia and it stages the hijacking of a large American cargo ship. This thriller starts with Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) leaving his rural Vermont home in route to the airport. He is flying to the Arabian peninsula to lead the crew of the MV Maersk Alabama, a massive American Cargo Ship. After several security briefings on the topic of hijacking the boat heads out on its long voyage through Somalian waters. Meanwhile in Somalia Muse (Barkhad Abdi) is required by his tribe to make some more money, and creates a crew that will hijack a boat for a ransom. After one failed attempt on Phillips' boat, Muse's crew is out for blood. They successfully hijack the boat, and then manage to get off with cash, and Captain Phillips as a hostage. The movie gets very intense as both the U.S. Navy, and Phillips' crew chase the pirates, hoping to stop them, and save Phillips before its to late. The film features an action packed ending that is hard to believe. The acting in this film was amazing. Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, and both of their crews show emotion so effectively that the viewer feels like they are on the boat with them. These actors played their characters so effectively that it was like they weren't even acting, it came naturally to them as if they had been in this situation in the past. The viewer will find one great example of this upon viewing the final few scenes of the movie as Captain Phillips is held hostage. The use of camera angles in this film really helped to make it the emotional, and thrilling film that it was. Most notably the use of close up shots on the hijacking crew portrayed just how desperate they were to gain their ransom for the captured captain. There was also a great use of high and low angle shots. The high angle shots were used to show the power the hijackers had over their captives, while low angle shots were used on Phillip's crew to show just how helpless they were. Overall I felt that this film was a great action packed thriller that does not disappoint. I would recommend it to any viewer who enjoys a lot of suspense, and an incredible ending. Tom Hanks knocked his role out of the park, and the great use of camera angles made it that much better. Once again I would recommend this movie to all fans of thriller/action movies."

","Fridays are getting better with an exciting pick each week. With 'Gravity' fever still soaring, we are treated with another intense and immersing drama with 'Captain Phillips'.<br/><br/>The plot does not waste time in unfolding the main event. The true story of 2009 hijacking of an American cargo ship by Somali pirates, has Captain Richard Phillips on board as in-charge. He is experienced and knew the dangers of entering the waters infamous for recent hijacking incidents. So when his ship is actually taken over by pirates his senses are in full action. The flick follows his decisions and tricks he uses to survive when he himself is taken as hostage.<br/><br/>Apart from being a convincing reproduction of the true events, what makes this movie great is the sense of realism attached to it. Its hard to remember the last time I could have vouched for the intelligence of every character in a movie. Everything makes sense and we are pardoned any overt heroics or histrionics.<br/><br/>What I found interesting is that even the pirates have a personality of their own. Check out the self proclaimed Captain of the pirates - Muse. He is confident, brave and strategic. His fellow call him Skinny but watch him as he takes over the ship and follows his own plan - he's intimidating. Everyone is wooing Tom Hank's performance (I'll come to that), but for me this guy steals the show. Played with conviction by Barkhad Abdi, this pirate hijacks the movie single handedly.<br/><br/>Has Paul Greengrass ever made a bad movie? His style as a director is clearly visible in this flick. He will always be remembered for his semi documentary approach. With two Bourne movies and a 'United 93', 'Captain Phillips' is another laurel to his CV.<br/><br/>And then, Tom Hanks. Throughout the period of tension he shows the calm approach of the Captain. His portrayal has an astounding effect on us. It is in the last few minutes of the film that he gives a performance that reminds us of a tour-De-force that was 'Cast Away'. It made my eyes water and made me feel the restlessness and shock that the character went through. Wait for the awards season, a nomination is certain.<br/><br/>Thrilling rescue sequences and powerful performances makes 'Captain Phillips' worth our time and one of the best movies this year.<br/><br/>P.S. : Alert - This is an engrossing movie. Buying popcorn is definitely going to be a waste. Enjoy."

","Now I did not dislike this movie. I'm a good movie watcher, I don't go in with any knowledge/trailers or any of that and just absorb what is given to me. So at first I was very immersed by the style, I quite enjoyed the perspective of the captain on a big ship and enjoyed the atmosphere in the first part of the movie.<br/><br/>However the movie lost me as soon as the pirates boarded the ship, I had no context of why the captain stayed on the deck, why a ship of such size has no guns, why they were the only ship that was not next to the other ones. The other pirate ships played no role(regardless of how the real story unraveled, I am judging this as a movie and not on its accuracy), pretty much all the characters were bland. <br/><br/>There was a point in the movie where I thought it would go in an interesting direction(again, I had no idea it was a true story) where he might go back to Somalia and see what the pirates live like(that's why I thought there was some movement in understanding the pirate perspective at some point). But the movie just turned into some overblown sensationalist retelling of how great the US military is... I am not really easy to sway, but I got the impression they wanted people to walk out thinking something like ""what heroes the seals are!"". <br/><br/>This military loving is something which should perhaps be evaluated with a more sober eye."
"hkauteur","8","0","1","8 November 2013"," HK Auteur Review - Captain Phillips
","The most noteworthy aspect of Paul Greengrass' canon is his ability to create immediacy, which is the key ingredient in Captain Phillips. The surface explanation behind Greengrass's crackling visual style is simply that he shoots hand-held. The truth is much more complicated than that. What's behind Greengrass' method is not merely the shaky cam, but his ability to create reality and punctuate immediate tension in his dramatic filmmaking. He understands that people receive information in fragments all the time and has found a way to incorporate that human reflex into a cinematic experience. So even with the fast cuts and shaky photography, the audience is able to follow what's going on. It is emotionally connective.<br/><br/>The set pieces in the first half of the film are visceral and tense. They feel like they're happening right before us and we are immersed into the crew's helpless dilemma. There's a significant genre shift in the second act, as the film becomes a rescue mission procedural. It goes on a bit long by the end. The first half is definitely more fun than the second half, if only because the crew members become less active in the latter portions.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plunges into the title role in a way I haven't seen in years. The trademark Tom Hanks movie star charm is removed and what remains is Hank's everyman quality. Captain Richard Phillips comparatively is a relatively colder character compared to Hank's past roles, which frees him up to embody the role. The last few moments of Hanks' Captain Phillips in shock dealing with the aftermath is breathtaking. It's a great human moment, though overall the entire performance is probably not Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>The Somali pirates are well casted. It's baffling how the filmmakers found these actors in a casting session in North Carolina. They rise above their skinny appearances and rough-hewn looks and each individually play dimensional characters. Greengrass builds an interesting group dynamic between them and gives them a backstory that suggests that they are not intentionally evil people.<br/><br/>Something noteworthy is how Greengrass depicts the military in a cold neutral fashion that doesn't take political sides. They aren't glorified like they are in Michael Bay films. The military here is functional and follows procedures to get the job done. There's a lot of room for audiences to bring in their own views about the response time of the coast guard, the military's handling of the rescue or the harsh circumstances of the Somali pirates. Although interested in world issues in a journalistic fashion, Greengrass isn't overbearingly preachy in any sense. His focus is the drama and fully delivers on that."
"bobbysing","8","0","1","9 November 2013"," One of the most authentic & moving portrayals of a real life event on screen.
","Post a fascinating UNITED 93, based on the real life tragedy of 9/11, director Paul Greengrass returns to portray another horrifying event of the recent history when an American cargo ship was attacked by Somali pirates in 2009, taking the captain away as their only hostage. Luckily, Captain Phillips survived that tragedy with the timely efforts of the rescue team and he later wrote a book on the event too as the co-author titled ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"", on which the film is based upon.<br/><br/>CAPTAIN PHILLIPS superbly gives you a realistic account of the event and is definitely not an easy entertaining watch to say the truth. Its highly impressive recreation of the attack, at first excites you well and then even makes you sea sick and claustrophobic because of its constantly jerky, hand-held camera movements edited skilfully. There is a great amount of energy and excitement in its initial moments when the pirates are fast approaching towards the ship trying to get on it from any side. But once they successfully get over the deck, a disturbing tension is all over the progression till the end, which even becomes annoying to some extent as I felt.<br/><br/>Without going into a documentary mode, Paul thoughtfully shows the contrasting living conditions in Somalia before introducing the pirates as pure villains. And due to that one scene alone, the viewer is not able to hate the attackers completely even if they act as a clear life taking threat to the Captain and his crew. At times the film loses its connection with the viewers in its second hour. But an energetic, fast paced background score always brings them back into the proceedings and one repeatedly finds himself sitting at the edge of his seat, watching the screen attentively.<br/><br/>As a frightening surprise, it has a first timer Barkhad Abdi, exceptionally playing the skinny, lean and scary leader of the pirates, standing tall in front of the towering performance of the veteran Tom Hanks. But what Tom displays in the final 10 minutes of the film, enacting the post-trauma stress in his lost expressions, is nothing short of text book material and pure cinematic triumph achieved by the gifted actor once again. Playing it pretty calm and composed in the entire film, Tom delivers what he is known for in these final moments alone and one just keeps thinking about him in particular while walking out of the theater quite honestly.<br/><br/>Not an easy subject to shoot, admittedly the film might not be a visual treat for a major section of viewers looking for just thrilling entertainment in those two hours. But in case you love watching intense, focused and shattering depiction of such tragic life threatening events in films, then do not miss CAPTAIN PHILLIPS especially in the theaters, since it is indeed one of the most authentic & moving portrayals of a real life event on the screen without any doubt."
"cultfilmfan","9","0","1","9 November 2013"," Captain Phillips
","Captain Phillips, which is based on a true story and of the book by Richard Phillips and Stephan Talty, has been getting a little bit of backlash from the media, because some events in the movie weren't accurate, or were embellished for the film and weren't as close to the truth as some may have wanted. I guess this does not bother me personally because I for one do not remember specifically the exact details of this story when it happened in 2009, nor have I read the book which serves as a guide to the film. So for those who want perfect accuracy and were looking for an one hundred percent accurate film, I can not comment on that. Some of my more regular readers on this site may be a bit surprised that I went to see and review a film like Captain Phillips, because for the most part I do not either see, or review action films because I often find them boring an clichéd and full of long unnecessary effects and just things that to a lover of a good film script, or acting, more, or less leaves me dry. Captain Phillips, on the other hand is a horse of a different colour though. Yes, there is a lot of action in it and I guess it would technically be considered an action film, but this is what I would call an action film done right. The film captures your interest pretty much right from the beginning and at times it can be a very intense and harrowing film. The film even though it is a little over two hours, moves at a brisk pace and because of how involving the film is, we do not feel the running time and instead as a viewer we are so immersed into the events going on before our eyes that we really do not care how long the film is because we want to see what will happen to these characters and how everything will be sorted, or what the end consequences will be. The film is directed by Paul Greengrass, and to be honest, this is the first film I have seen by him as a director. I wanted to see United 93, when it came out, but unfortunately I have not seen it yet, but I do plan on it. I was very impressed with Mr. Greengrass's direction in the film and it really does add to the overall affect that it left me with. Other than Tom Hanks, who delivers a top notch excellent performance here, all the other actors were unknown to me and I don't believe I had ever seen any of them in anything else before, but I actually think that helped the film. By casting lesser known actors, or perhaps people who are acting for the first time, it gave the film a certain authentic quality to it and it felt more real and less like a Hollywood film. Speaking of a Hollywood film, even though this is a Hollywood production and is a wide release film, it didn't feel like a Hollywood film at all. I loved the choice of the unknown actors and also the fact that the film was shot in a cinema verite style making everything seem more gritty and enhancing the unpleasantness and the heat, fear and conditions the characters are in. The final shots of this film were so powerful and so unlike a mainstream Hollywood film that I could both really appreciate it and the final shots were haunting to me, but also powerful and something that will stay with me for quite awhile. The editing of this film is also top notch which includes jumping from scene to scene and event to event with skilled precise from the editors and I think it was also one of the film's strongest points. I also like how the pirates in this film were given personalities and were not just overly exaggerated cartoon like clichés of what a pirate, or evildoer must be. They interact with one another and we can somehow connect with them as much as we can even though we do not sympathize with them, but the film does humanize them in a sense and makes them seem like everyday people, just caught up in a terrible way of life and living. Again, I think the acting from everyone is really strong here. Tom Hanks' delivers one of his strongest performances in years as someone who is level headed under pressure and also at the same time brave, but also terrified and unsure all at the same time. The affect his performance and what this character goes through is all the more believable because of his strong performance. All the lesser known actors do a great job too and their performances seem real and are equally as powerful and affective. I like how these characters were able to interact and also that between the captain and the pirates, at times there almost seemed like they had a sense of honour and respect for one another. The way they communicated was one of the film's strong points as well. Captain Phillips is exhilarating and a powerful film to watch that because of how well done it is, it is bound to leave you feeling something after you leave and you will be totally immersed in the film as they do this. A first rate action film."

","I didn't really have much of any expectations for this. I never really looked forward to it, the only reason now being that it's going to be a huge Oscar contender. But you know what, this was really excellent. The editing and directing are totally in-tune to the kind of tone it wants the film to have. The technical aspects of it are not that original, we've seen this super-hyper style editing before, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work. The acting is really great, with Tom Hanks giving the best performance I've seen from him. I haven't seen his first Oscar win, but Forrest Gump I've always thought is really overrated. Overall, this is really powerful stuff."
"pc95","6","0","1","8 November 2013"," Decent Realism but Drags the 2nd Half
","One of the issues with ""Captain Phillips"" for myself as a viewer and probably a lot of folks is that you already know the outcome of the movie before watching, so coming in it's like watching a recorded game you already know the outcome to. Despite this, Director Paul Greengrass has worked with Tom Hanks,and a quartet of young green African-emigrated actors to goto great lengths in recreating authentic looking settings, dialog, and characters - and the movie is helped by this level of effort. To this end we have close ups and shots of Naval ships in what looks to be deployed operations as well as close-in tactics on display. Even with all this, the story lags and needs some getty-up about the last 45 min or so. The dialog and action becomes stagnant, and the movie bogs down. I grew tired of listening to the yelling and repeated dialog type between Hanks and the Captors. By the end I was ready for it to end. Fairly good, but perhaps could've had better pacing. 6/10"

","Captain Phillips is a brutally intense, edge of the seat thriller about the hijacking of an American cargo ship which took place in 2009 and ended with a stand-off between the US Navy & the Somali pirates' lifeboat from the cargo ship, where they held Captain Richard Phillips hostage. And without adding heroism or evilness to any of its characters, this film tries to capture the real event with as much authenticity as possible by keeping its potent drama at a human level while also making a statement against the myriad effects of globalization.<br/><br/>Viciously crafted, explosively executed, incredibly entertaining & highly satisfying, this film is tailor-made for Paul Greengrass' directional style and benefits greatly from its gripping screenplay, bleak yet arresting photography, tight editing, tense ambiance, energetic pace and very impressive & captivating performances from Tom Hanks & newcomer, Barkhad Abdi, as Captain Richard Phillips & Somali pirate leader, Muse, respectively.<br/><br/>Promising enough to make a prominent mark in the upcoming awards season, Captain Phillips is one of the most rewarding cinematic experiences of the year, so far and is escalated to thrilling heights by Paul Greengrass' kinetic direction & Tom Hanks' spectacular performance, who in the film's final moments, proves why he is hailed as one of the greatest actors of all time.

","Awesome! Fantastic! Nail biting tension! Heart pumping action. This movie really depicts the reality that is behind the current Somali pirate situation and is so realistically done- with every attention to the smallest detail- that you almost feel you are watching a doc. and are in the actual real situation- and this is awesome/fantastic.<br/><br/>Making for nail biting tension.<br/><br/>Loved the film- one of the best I have seen this year - and recommend it to everybody- because this is no fantasy or entertainer - it is highly realistic, true and real life. I learn't something. Awesome ! Just loved and enjoyed the film. Very good. A must see.<br/><br/>The only criticism I can think of- is that it could be criticized for possibly being racist in its story- pro US, pro Western big power, pro hi- tech, pro white, typically showing the US to be the big good guys, US dominating, anti black, anti third world , anti Somali- but unfortunately this is the reality. Those Somalis were pirates/the bad guys and had to be killed. This is the only criticism. But I enjoyed the film thoroughly and loved it esp. since it a true story. Very entertaining. Would like to see it again, and recommend/ask everybody to see it! Fantastic! Excellent film."
"motezart","9","0","1","7 November 2013"," Great film full of unpredictability
","The best thing about Paul Greengrass' new action thriller Captain Phillips is that it is actually about Captain Phillips. No, this is not a joke.<br/><br/>Phillips is an adept ship captain for the huge shipping conglomerate Maersk. He assumes his role aboard a freighter docked in Oman bound for Kenya, and this route is straight through the Gulf of Aden, past Somali, the most pirate infested piece of ocean in the world. I assume most viewers entering the theatre already know that this film is about pirates attacking a ship. The film does fulfill this expectation in the first act, but from there everything that happens is as unpredictable as is possible to be unpredictable.<br/><br/>First of all, kudos to the trailer's producers and marketers for selling this film as a conflict totally based upon on the hijacking of a ship. While this is the first major conflict of the film, it is not the only one. As the ship's hijacking unfolds, and errors occur, whole tangential series of events and complications are created. Greengrass takes these tangents to a place we never could have expected, and all of a sudden we have an unexpected thrilling crisis of a film.<br/><br/>Overall it's a simple story, but it's so creative in its originality and unfolding that I was on the edge of my seat the whole film. Since it's based on a true story I guess Greengrass shouldn't get all the credit. A lot of the credit must go to one the two scriptwriters, Richard Phillips. He adapted this script from the book that was based on true events.<br/><br/>Second of all, there is a storyline involving the Somali's and the world they come from. It was a great idea to include this. We are shown that Somali pirates are not just pure evil, but are in many ways forced into the acts of piracy they undertake. In a extremely revealing scene Phillips and Muse, the head pirate, reveal how higher levels of bureaucracy influences both their lives, they both have bosses they say.<br/><br/>In a moment of cinematic excellence, Greengrass actually makes the viewer feel sympathy for Muse despite the fact that he is a maniacal, automatic weapon toting killer who hijacks ships. Sir Greengrass, very well done.<br/><br/>There has been a concern over this film's release though, and this raises the question that all art needs to consider: do the events of the film/artwork that declare themselves as true have an obligations to actually be true? Or can anyone declare anything and make into a work in itself? This though comes from media attacks on the real Captain Phillips. According to The Guardian, apparently Captain Phillips himself was not the hero he is portrayed as in the film. He was a notoriously difficult captain to work for, and by sailing too close to Somalia some say he was the cause of the whole incident. Debate aside, very good film.<br/><br/>Get more reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com"

","Richard Phillips is the skipper of a container ship, en route from Oman to Kenya when it is attacked by Somalian pirates. What follows is Phillips' struggle to protect his crew, his ship and himself.<br/><br/>This is a true story, and is filmed by Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Identity) in verite mode. It is exciting and suspenseful, and blessed with several terrific performances. Barkhad Abdi as Muse, the pirate leader, is sympathetic and nuanced, far from stereotypical, and Faysal Ahmed as Najee is pleasingly and believably batsh!t crazy - stereotypical, but rightly so.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks (here playing Phillips) has founded a career on playing audience identification everymen, albeit he sometimes steps outsides his comfort zone. On one such occasion, Oscar came knocking. For me, Forrest Gump was a role of treacly obviousness, with one shining moment of heartbreaking reality when Forrest wonders if his son is likewise less than normal. Captain Phillips is an everyman but, towards the end, Hanks pulls something special out of the bag, and makes us remember why he has two Oscars.<br/><br/>This is a good movie - I enjoyed it, and I recommend it."

","I am a die-hard fan of Tom Hanks. So i was planning to watch this movie for last 2 weeks. I had to skip my office to watch this one and i was not disappointed.<br/><br/>It is always difficult to make a movie on true incidents because there is very less freedom a director can take. This one is no exception. But It was the Paul Greengrass's direction and Billy Ray's screenplay which makes it possible to convert it in an interesting movie.<br/><br/>It is a story of Captain Phillips, Captain of a cargo ship , navigating it through the horn of Africa. As a Captain he is well aware of the dangers of these waters. And he was not wrong.<br/><br/>This movie starts like a normal Hollywood movie. In starting it's a bit slow pacing. The Background sounds, camera angles, military operation scenes are very ordinary and we have seen them in many crisis movies. But the acting of Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi makes all the difference.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is, as always, extraordinary. His acting is so natural that we forgets Tom Hanks... and only remember the Captain throughout the movie. Last 20 minutes of the movie are awesome. We can feel the inner-self of the caption and that is certainly because of Tom Hanks. As a pirate's group leader Barkhad Abdi has done a great job.<br/><br/>In all other departments the movie is an ordinary Hollywood movie. But this movie is a must watch if you don't want to miss the best acting of Tom Hnaks after Castaway.<br/><br/>As a whole, i would like to give Captain Phillips 10/10 rating."
"guchrisc","Null","0","1","5 November 2013"," True story of a USA ship-Captain's encounter with pirates.
","Columbia Picture. Tom Hanks is the eponymous 'Captain Phillips' of this film. He is a merchant seaman and the Captain of a USA cargo-ship attacked by Somali pirates. This modern-day true story is the basis for this tense, character-driven, action-thriller.<br/><br/>Film opens with Captain Phillips preparing to leave home and go to work. Home scenes come across as mundane and realistic. However the journey to the airport jars with a conversation between husband and wife that seems unbelievable. Supposedly married for the best part of two decades, it seems as if they have never talked to each other before this day and have now woken up and discuss their family and the world in a very ponderous and wooden way. However as this is a true story we will just have to accept this bad and clunky scene. So do not be put off at this point as the film picks up after this scene.<br/><br/>Meanwhile we are also seeing scenes from halfway across the world. In Somalia to be precise. Although Somalia has failed to function as a properly governed nation-state for two decades. Somalia is in fact in a state of anarchy and is dominated and ruled by war-lords. We see enough to feel the atmosphere and culture in these brief glimpses. We see too the young Somali men who are the pirates. We can understand their mentality and situation, and compare and contrast it with that of Captain Phillips.<br/><br/>Supposedly Director Paul Greengrass asked Tom Hanks what he thought the film was about. TH said ""Pirates"", PG replied ""Globalization"" and asked TH again, who replied again ""Pirates"". This reviewer agrees totally with Mr Hanks.<br/><br/>In an interview Tom Hanks described how he and his crew did not meet the pirate crew before the pirates attempted to hijack the ship. Clearly the Director wanted this for the shock factor for the Hanks crew and to capture that in an authentic way. A good idea which clearly worked. Sadly however, because of the earlier Somali scenes, we viewers did not get quite the same shock-factor. To us the pirates were not quite that same unknown quantity.<br/><br/>The Director Paul Greengrass, who directed 'United 93' in 2006, seems to be trying to give the impression that he is looking at both sides in this film. However he is only pretending to be even-handed. A film entitled 'Captain Phillips' is not about the Somali pirates themselves but rather about Captain Phillips. The pirates are only important in so far as they impact on Captain Phillips. As such therefore it would have been much better if we, like the Captain and crew, did not see the pirates, until they had boarded the ship. However, having said that, a much more interesting film could have been made from the point of view of the pirates. In 'The Sopranos', David Chase was able to give us a Soprano POV, a pirate POV could have been similarly sublime.<br/><br/>'CP' is a film of two halves. The first half, you get what you expect, if you have seen the trailers. The second half is a little different. It is in fact a little slow in parts. However the tension does build. The problem is that this is really just a small little story. If a film is wanted with a modern-day Somali pirate story-line, then other true stories would be much more interesting. The reality is that this is just an interesting story, for historical reasons, for audiences in the USA, because it is unusual. While the film is shot from various perspectives, it is mainly shot from the perspective of Americans, particularly of course, Captain Phillips.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is Captain Phillips. His acting is tremendous throughout. Having said that however, all acting is superb. Both the crews, the ship's crew, and the pirate crew, give convincing performances. Rather than an action film, perhaps it is better to consider the film as a character study. We have the battle of wits between the two captains. We have also the interplay between the different members of the pirate crew. If ever a film demonstrated the need for constitutional government and a properly structured command-and-control system, then this is the film.<br/><br/>A major criticism of this film must be the camera work. Director Paul Greengrass, certainly in the early parts of the film, seems to want to give it a documentary feel. He does. Sadly however, much of this 'documentary-feel' is spoilt by cameras swinging violently, and sickeningly, quickly. In later parts we have incredibly close-up close-ups. Again, uncomfortably so. There are also hand-held cameras that veer about violently. A little, of some of this, may have been needed. Most was not. Except if the intention was to make the cinema audience feel slightly sea-sick. It certainly did not make viewing more enjoyable, but rather less so.<br/><br/>This is not a great film, but it is a good film, the subject matter makes it so. 'Captain Phillips' tells the story of what happened to a ship's Captain. It is a film, and story, that gets tenser, and tenser, as it goes on. When the film ended my cinema audience seemed to have been shocked into a stunned silence, although I felt ever so slightly underwhelmed. If you want to find out what happened to Captain Phillips, then this is the film for you. If you are wanting to find out a lot about Somalia and it's pirates, try reading up about them instead.<br/><br/>This modern-day pirate story, is a true story, and a good film. 8/10."

","If these are real pirates, they are very different from the ones depicted in other movies. They don't Urrr and have no idea where the treasure is. The captain tries to deal with them according to what he knows of pirates but it doesn't work and a tragic end becomes necessary of the situation. Still the journey is a thrilling one at sea with very scary Somali pirates but the differences between the pirates in this movie and the ones often depicted in older movies are noted. It is like the world has not dealt with pirates before and the situation gets out of hand. The pirates code does not exist in Captain Phillips. The navy seals turn out heroic."

"diac228","8","0","1","3 November 2013"," Intense biopic that will leave you paralyzed
","Gravity isn't the only heart-pounding drama concerning a very bad week in the workplace.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a spellbinding and intense drama that focuses on an everyday man having to use every last ounce of his wits to survive a dreary situation that was always one bad move away from death. Based on the unbelievable true story of the first modern-day seizure of an American ship, this film chronicles the events concerning the hijacking starting from the first attempted attack right down to the final moment of the conflict. It was heroism and the ""No Man Left Behind"" concept at its best, as many men and women were involved to try to arrive at a happy resolution to an ugly situation in foreign waters.<br/><br/>Combining the legendary acting of Tom Hanks, superb acting from rookie Barkhad Abdi, and excellent direction from the hand-held camera expert Paul Greengrass, even if you know the story the film will trigger the senses of tension, fear, doubt, and uncertainty throughout the 130 minutes. That being said, the less you know about the true story, the more you will sweat.<br/><br/>What the script adds however is a human element not seen in many military conflict-based films. You get a closer glimpse behind the thoughts and motivations of the pirates; they aren't just heartless monsters thirsty for blood. There are a few more layers behind their mannerisms and just why they are placing their entire lives on the line to commit a crime. Billy Ray does a great job giving personalities to characters that could have just as easily been caricatures.<br/><br/>Lastly, we have Paul Greengrass' directing skillset coming in full circle. Combining the emotional pull of his United 93 with the technical pizazz of his Bourne series work that puts the viewers front and center to the conflict at hand, Greengrass is at his best here as he mixes intense close-ups with tight shots that raise the tension bar to the maximum. Finally, there is a beautiful marriage of great directing and great acting as the conflict reaches its surprisingly rough climax and we see Tom Hanks prove why he is a multiple-Oscar winner and always seems to deliver in every movie he is in.<br/><br/>Although the movie does drag a bit in the second act and spends too much time building into the third (withholding some of the details could have elevated the unnerving mood even more), Captain Phillips is superb directing and acting mixed together to tell a wonderful story about overcoming dangerous odds when looking death right in the eyes.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't break any new ground; it's just a stand-up nitty gritty thriller that stands as one of the best films of the year."

What more could you want from a film.<br/><br/>Yes the film is fundamentally about the takeover, but if you look a little deeper, it's about capitalism, and segregation, and how different cultures live. When Phillips speaks to his wife about how he is worrying about the future of his children, due to impending globalisation, you can read between the lines.<br/><br/>Even though its pretty far into the movie when the pirates takeover, it's pretty tense stuff from the beginning. You know what will happen, but you still want the crew to get away, and for the pirates to forget about their quest, and just go and make an honest living.<br/><br/>But you know you cannot change a story by wishing it, but these sorts of movies make you feel his way. The second coming of the pirates is white knuckle to say the least, and that's how the film is until the end, white knuckle.<br/><br/>But those words do not give the films feeling justice, Greengrass uses his docu style feel to full effect here. It ruined Green Zone, but here it adds to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Much has been said about the final scene, and believe me, its the most riveting final scene I've seen in a while, and it had me in tears. If Hanks doesn't get nominated, I'll close my IMDb account.<br/><br/>But Abdi rivals Hanks on screen, and for a debut, it's the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>So all in all, its a tense movie, never releasing you from its tense grip for the duration.<br/><br/>Brilliant."

","From BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum), I had seen the trailer for this film a few times, and then I heard the fact based plot, and I was definitely going to see it when I saw critics give it the full five out of five stars. Based on a true story, the MV (merchant vessel) Maersk Alabama is sailing with its 17,000 metric tons of cargo from an Oman port through the Gulf of Aden to Mombasa, Kenya, and taking command of the container ship is Captain Richard Phillips (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Tom Hanks) who is ordering security precautions, being wary of pirating off the coast of Somalia. During the journey the crew carry out a necessary training exercise for potential pirate hijacking, but then this becomes a real threat when a suspicious craft is spotted on radar, it appears, after some speeding up and fooling the pirates on the radio, that the skiffs are outrun. However the next day four pirates in a faster skiff, led by Abduwali Muse (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Barkhad Abdi), return to board the ship, carrying a high ladder, and despite the efforts of the ship crew, using high pressure water hoses and rocket flares, the pirates succeed in boarding, carrying guns they manage to catch Phillips, while the most of the crew hide in the engine room. Muse, who is under orders himself, is planning to ransom the ship in order for the shipping company to make a high insurance money payment, he demands the captain to take them to the engine room, but the crew, who shut down the engine and emergency power, using broken glass and other small tricks manage to overthrow the pirate leader. They attempt to negotiate with the remaining pirates to take a lifeboat and get away with the $30,000 in the safe, but while inside it they launch it with Phillips inside with them, they are now planning a ransom with the ship's captain, the Maersk Alabama follow slowly and call the coastguard to help the situation. Inside the lifeboat tensions run between the pirates as they are running low on khat, lose contact with their mother ship, and the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Bainbridge is intercepting them, more Navy ships arrive, but Muse refuses to surrender having come as far they have, Bainbridge captain Frank Castellano (Yul Vazquez) is doing all to make sure they do not reach the mainland. In the night Phillips make an attempt to escape the boat and swim to the nearest ship, but they cannot take action without identifying him, he surrenders and is taken back by the pirates when shots are fired, and meanwhile a SEAL Team are going to try and take control of the situation, trying to target and shoot the pirates inside the lifeboat. The lifeboat is successfully attached with a towing rope, and Muse agrees to board the Bainbridge, assuming he can negotiate and make ransom demands, back inside the boat agitated pirate Najee (Faysal Ahmed) catches Phillips a goodbye message to his wife, trying to take it they fight, and the pirates plan to execute him, tying him up and blindfolding him. In the end the three SEAL marksman finally manage to target all three pirates inside the lifeboat and have clear shots, they simultaneously kill them, while Muse is in custody and arrested for his piracy crimes, Phillips is shock and cannot stop panicking, having been threatened and faced with death, but safe and sound he shakily thanks his rescuers for saving his life. Also starring Barkhad Abdirahman as Bilal, Mahat M. Ali as Elmi, Michael Chernus as Shane Murphy, Catherine Keener as Andrea Phillips, David Warshofsky as Mike Perry, Corey Johnson as Ken Quinn, Chris Mulkey as John Cronan and Max Martini as SEAL Commander. Hanks gives a fantastic performance as the real life captain put under pressure by threatening invaders, and Abdi who is just as much of a victim in a desperate situation, the growing tension and moments of violence make this powerfully thrilling, and it feels highly authentic, especially the emotional ending with the lead character, a must see drama based on a true story. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Henry Jackman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!"

","It is rare to find a film that manages to combine an intelligent script and treatment with a sustained sense of visceral excitement and tension, but ""Captain Phillips"" pulls it off in brilliant style in a manner not see since ""Zero Dark Thirty"". In both cases, the final resolution comes in a non-triumphalist operation by Navy SEALs, but here the mission is not to find and kill a known terrorist but to free a kidnapped ship's captain whose location is perfectly known and whose captors are the very antithesis of a man whose wealthy upbringing led him to a perverse global vision. This is a tale of two very different worlds: two captains, two ships, and local destitution pitted against global consumerism.<br/><br/>All the ingredients are there and mixed to consummate effect.<br/><br/>First, a compelling story: the true experiences of American captain Richard Phillips over a five day nightmare in April 2009 when his ship, the ""Maersk Alabama"", was boarded by four armed men off the coast of Somalia. Next, a sensitive treatment by scriptwriter Billy Ray (""State Of Play"") who does not demonise the Somalians but puts their desperate action in the context of the over-fished coastline, appalling poverty and brutal warlordism of their failed state. Then the director: the brilliant British Paul Greengrass who brings us the urgent camera-work and cutting that so characterised ""United 93"" and two of the Bourne movies. He is helped by the location shooting at sea and the loan of some heavy-duty US Navy shipping which all adds to the verisimilitude that grabs you by the throat from the very beginning and never lets you go. The score by Henry Jackman seems to match your heart beat as the action unfolds and the tension mounts.<br/><br/>And then there is the acting. Tom Hanks - the source of so many wonderful performances over three decades - is simply splendid as the eponymous sea captain (""Cap"" to his crew and ""Irish"" to his captors) and the final sequences especially are incredibly emotional. The revelation though is newcomer Barkhad Abdi - who was born in Somalia - as Muse, the leader of the khat-chewing pirates, the other captain, the man who dreams of being in America one day. The rest of the casting is spot on and, in the final scene, the US Navy medic is actually playing herself.<br/><br/>In short, ""Captain Phillips"" is film-making of the highest order and you should not miss it."
"ZChrisJ1995","8","0","3","27 October 2013"," Intense, well-acted thriller that packs a punch
","I was initially skeptical upon hearing that Tom Hanks was cast in a depiction of the Maersk Alabama hijacking, expecting that the result would be an overly sentimental, overly sensationalized presentation of the events that transpired. Nevertheless, I was happy to find that 'Captain Phillips' is a realistically acted and surprisingly intense film that sits along the likes of 'The Pianist' and '127 Hours' in the survival film sub-genre. <br/><br/>Hanks portrays the titular captain with ease and competence, convincingly giving the impression of a perfectly ordinary man placed in extraordinary circumstances. As the situation he is placed in becomes more and more desperate, Phillips in turn becomes more desperate, which is once again executed brilliantly by Hanks. Barkhad Abid, in his first role, is almost flawless in his portrayal of Muse, the pirate leader. He remains both sympathetic, as well as utterly terrifying, like a wild animal trapped in a corner. I consider it highly likely that both of these actors will receive Oscar nominations for their performances. <br/><br/>The film does quite a good job at presenting both sides of the story, ensuring that the pirates are not seen as purely evil. However, this could have been a bit more successful if more time was spent displaying the conditions in which the Somalians live, in order to achieve maximum sympathy. <br/><br/>Paul Greengrass, like his involvement in the Bourne films, directs the film in a grounded, realistic manner, with consistent use of hand-held cameras making the film feel like a documentary. The pacing likewise adds to this sense of realism. Roughly half of the film occurs on board a lifeboat in which Phillips has been taken hostage, yet the result is never boring, as the sheer intensity of the experience had me at the edge of my seat constantly. <br/><br/>'Captain Phillips' is an excellent film, both in regards to its acting and pacing. The end result is an intelligent, grounded and thoroughly exhilarating production that makes good use of the talent involved, both on screen and off.<br/><br/>Recommended viewing."

","Carving out a one-for-me (United 93, Bloody Sunday), one-for-them (Bourne Supremacy, Bourne Ultimatum) directing career over the last decade, Paul Greengrass has never failed to meet audience expectation, whether with his refreshingly inventive action fare or nail-biting dramatic pictures. Captain Phillips doesn't buck that trend. Narratively both compelling and nerve- racking, the (based on a true) story of what Richard Phillips went through when the freight ship he was captaining was boarded by Somali pirates is one you won't soon forget. Knowing the outcome prior to viewing won't affect the impact of Greengrass' movie; his heightened filming style, the unshakeable performances and the masterful score from Henry Jackman imbue Captain Phillips with edge-of-the-seat tension and emotional wallop. Tom Hanks delivers his best work since 2002's Road to Perdition - he's utterly gut-wrenching in the final scene - and he's given remarkable support by newcomer (and non-actor) Barkhad Abdi as the all-too-human leader of the pirates who, although committing despicable crimes, never turns into a monster. When Hanks and Abdi share the screen it's electric; the Hollywood heavyweight and a complete unknown craft out one of the year's most enthralling and combustible yin and yang relationships. Intense, commanding and affecting all at once... Greengrass is at it again."

","From Paul Greengrass, the director of the Jason Bourne films, comes the thrilling true story of one brave man. When a cargo ship in 2009 gets taken over by four Somali pirates, it is up to Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) to protect himself and his crew.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that Captain Phillips is a heart-pounding thrill ride that keeps you hooked from beginning to end. Despite it's 2 hour and 15 minute running time, the film is so fast-paced and never features one boring moment. We watch as Phillips does everything in his power to try keep himself and his crew alive by always trying to be one step ahead of our villains. But the thing about these villains, in more particular the leader, they aren't like your typical villains. They aren't stupid are easily duped. So when Phillips tries out his strategies we are hoping that he can quickly pull them out of the air. That is also one of the beauties of Paul Greengrass as a director, he really knows how to bring on the intensity in the right scenes. And he succeeds massively here. But also contributing to this is the amazing performance by Tom Hanks. Hanks provides so many different angles of Phillips and shows them with such ease you almost feel as if it's all real. We see Hanks play a calm and collected Phillips, to one who is trying STAY calm and use his cunning, to full on panic and a fight to survive, and the ultimate break down he has that really brings his performance full circle. Hanks' performance is by far the best male performance I've seen this year and very much Oscar worthy. Much like Gravity, Captain Phillips will leave you white-knuckled with your heart pounding until you can finally catch your breath.<br/><br/>This is easily one of my top films of the year and it is not one to be missed.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"
"Joe_Chadowski","7","0","3","24 October 2013"," A high quality biopic that lacks innovation
","Biopics are an interesting little sub-genre in filmmaking. The flow of real life events rarely, if ever, follows the typical story flow of rising action, climax then falling action. This puts the screen writer on a tight leash as they balance the scale of manipulating reality for the sake of cinema, while still remaining true to the source material. The line between immortality and failure is minute, here. Hit it right, and you have Social Network, get it wrong and you have Patch Adams. Where does Captain Phillips fall? Let's explore.<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a story most of us should recollect; in 2009, the MV Maersk Alabama was hijacked off the coast of Somali by pirates. Tom Hanks (with a excellent performance) stars as the titular captain of the ship who takes the reins of the situation, keeping the pirates at bay before being tricked into getting in the escape ship, bound for Somalia. The pirates' plan to use Captain Phillips as leverage for a $10 million ransom escalates almost immediately as America, well, gets all 'Merica on the situation.<br/><br/>Now then, Captain Phillips is a straightforward and characterful movie. It's also hugely suspenseful, but hardly groundbreaking. Paul Greengrass effectively delves into the story with a nail-biting sense of you-are- really-there intimacy. His dizzying directing is effective during the more tense scenes, but is distracting and disorienting for the remainder of the film. The screenplay is certainly ambitious in its attempt to show the story from multiple perspectives, but ultimately feels a little too diluted, and makes Captain Phillips a little overlong. I still do not understand Billy Ray's reasoning in showing the background of the pirates.<br/><br/>If Captain Phillips had spent a little more time under the microscope, it could have really been something. Captain Phillips is a perfectly potent, powerful and harrowing, but it's in the third act (once the Navy gets involved) where this film really comes into its own. It's here where I got a feel for what an amazing film this could have been, as the excellent acting, deft directing, snappy editing and banging score all rise in unison to a level a brilliance that you rarely see nowadays. <br/><br/>So Captain Phillips is a perfectly adequate biopic with as many flaws as qualities. If I'm honest I wasn't expecting it be so well put together, but the result is still merely the sum of its parts and doesn't offer anything of remembrance to the world of cinema. I don't recommend this movie unless you already wanted so see it. If that makes any sense."

","This is a brilliantly intense movie. A powerful picture. Even having lived through the time when this episode happened, and remembering some of what occurred, the suspense wasn't lessened one iota. Now if a film can be made under those circumstances, and be this gripping, that is an extremely well done movie. And this is beyond extremely well done! Tom Hanks, as Captain Richard Phillips, is riveting. The end of the movie, his emotions, brought me to tears. I can't admit to being a die-hard Tom Hanks fan, but his role in this picture is phenomenal. True, the Somali, Barkhad Abdi, as Muse the Pirate Captain, is fantastic. And considering he had no acting training and this was his only film, even more so. I'm thinking he should get a nod for Best Supporting Actor. But Tom Hanks simply shines like the star he is in this picture. The pride in the Navy personnel, and the Navy Seals, will really come to the fore in this film for most viewers. Like I said, this is a film so well put together, so well presented that I'm not surprised I haven't talked to anyone who left the theater after seeing this one without a feeling of awe.

"edroberts417","7","0","3","24 October 2013"," Captain Phillips
","Swashbuckling pirates, the kind with gold earrings, long hair and parrots, possessed of some of the greatest names in history—names like Blackbeard, Calico Jack, and Black Bart—are a staple of moviedom. Savage murderers and thieves though they were, what with cutting off people's parts and all, we love to watch them and like to think of them as living by some code of pirate honor. After all, it is the movies.<br/><br/>""Captain Phillips"" the story of a real life hijacking by Somali pirates, this time toting AK-47's rather than sabers and without the flashy nicknames, of a cargo ship plying the waters off East Africa. Captain Richard Phillips, (Tom Hanks) is a competent and conscientious captain who knows his ship well and runs it tight. Hanks is, as always, Hanks. He's just not a transformative actor. Competent and usually engaging, not hard to watch, but never impressive—more of a star than an actor. But here Hanks should be given some leeway—his character just isn't very interesting and some of the dialogue is notably awkward. (Scriptwriting credit goes to relative newcomer Billy Ray, whose only other credit is ""Hunger Games."" Draw from that what you will.) One of the more blatant instances of this comes in one of the establishing scenes, in which Phillips and his wife are driving to the airport, where he will board a plane to Oman to pick up his ship. It's a transparent effort to write that particular type of random, streaming, conversation between a husband and wife—and it doesn't work. That type of casual dialogue, the most common in real life and yet the hardest to write, almost never (outside the hands of Robert Altman) works—and Billy Ray ain't no Robert Altman. However, awkward as the dialogue is, we do get some sense of Captain Phillips. He's hard working, loves his wife, is concerned about his kids finding jobs after college And once the action starts it becomes apparent that he is a resilient and resourceful man, remaining resolute in the face of a very real threat. And that's about it. We never see anything of the interior of the man. What makes him who he is. What are his weaknesses? His foibles? What is his internal conflict? It's not there.<br/><br/>The real star of ""Captain Phillips"" is the camera of director Paul Greengrass. Best known for The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, this is just the type of production that Greengrass does best. Most of the action takes place in confined spaces with lots of steel ladders, stairwells and places to fall from—things that could give you anything from a nasty bump on the head to a broken femur. He teams up again with editor Christopher Rouse and, like the Bourne movies, the action is non-stop and the pacing is spot-on. The camera is frenetic and close, the editing is fast and sharp, and the tension never wanes. <br/><br/>The problem is that it's not much of a story, rather; it's a sequence of events. Expertly filmed and edited events, yes, but not much more than that. It is, essentially, a good guy/bad guy movie, with Phillips squaring off against the leader of the pirate band. Like all movies of the type, the two principles butt heads and match wits, first one on top and then the other, until one of them prevails. But, although the captain and the pirate leader are the primary characters, at least some of the supporting cast needs to be developed and brought to the forefront, for at least a moment or two, in order for any movie to work. ""Captain Phillips fails miserably in this department. Nary a one of the crew stands out from the rest. They all perform admirably. There are no backsliders or hysterical cowards. Nobody gets angry. There is no conflict about course of action. Nobody is even a diabetic whose insulin has been made unavailable, for crying out loud. They are absolutely interchangeable. Same goes for the Navy Seals, the other three pirates, the naval officers—not a single memorable character among them.<br/><br/>The standout here is Barkhad Abdi as the leader of the pirate gang, a sinister, erratic and sleep deprived Somali named Musé. He is, by far, the most interesting character in the film. Ordered to do what he does by the local warlord, Musé is not a pirate by choice. One of the best scenes in the film is a brief conversation between him and the Captain in which Musé spits out that if there were still fish in the ocean and Somalia was still what it was generations ago, he would be a fisherman in a fishing village, which his home used to be. Musé was not born a pirate.He was made into one, and he knows it and he laments it. Captain Phillips suggests at one point that Musé release him and take the thirty thousand dollars in cash that had been in the ship's safe. Musé replies that he has gone too far to turn back—an observation that could be applied to his home as well as himself. Has Somalia been broken too badly to be repaired, to ever return to what it once was? Suddenly, this chillingly dangerous man shifts from villain to victim. However, other than that subtle comment by Musé, the script sticks to the action, never waxing blatantly allegorical and, in this pivotal scene, Abdi plays Musé as a resigned and very young man faced with a life without prospect, deftly avoiding preachiness or martyrdom—a refreshing change from so much of what is out there. He is not a swashbuckling and proud pirate captain. He is a broken man with not so much as a parrot on his shoulder."
"OlieRendch","9","0","2","24 October 2013"," I think the tagline for this movie should definitely should have been CAPTAIN PHILLIPS: Everything going' be OK.
","So Captain Phillips is based of a true story of a man called Richard Phillips whose cargo ship he was on was boarded by Somali pirates and bad things happen. Now to start off with this film has an epic feel of realism too it; the shots and atmosphere of this film are just very real, it shows you engines of the giant ship humming which if you've been on a big ship you know you hear it or just the small rooms or the general feel of being out at sea. What I noticed as well, which I think added to the realism a lot was there wasn't much background music, at the beginning, and at the end and some other scenes it was just sound effects and dialogue which was really good. That just added to the amazing story this film documents of Captain Phillips and his run in with these four pirates - what I wasn't expecting is them to show a bit of back story to the pirates, it showed them right at the beginning in Africa and a glimpse of what their life is and what is generally what they do for work and why; not really in that kind of ""these are also good guys too"" way but it shows how everything happens. Now the whole film is 2 and a quarter hours so there are some slow bits in the middle but it still captivates you and the end of this film, wow, I heard it was one of Tom Hanks' best performances to date and I'd say so too. The final act of Captain Phillips is extremely intense and had my heart pumping for sure which rarely happens. So in the end this was a powerful film based on a true story and I give it the rating of 9/10."
"akash_sebastian","6","0","2","24 October 2013"," It's A Thrilling Tension-filled Film, But It's Haphazard Priorities Leaves The Audiences Clueless As To What To Feel.
","When a talented Director (Paul Greengrass) and a brilliant Actor (Tom Hanks) collaborate, you can't help yourself but be excited. Maybe I expected too much from the maker of 'The Bourne Ultimatum' because the overall effect 'Captain Phillips' had on me was good, but a little underwhelming. The movie is a thrilling Biodrama with appropriately-built tension and terrific acting, but the screenplay meanders a lot in a lackluster pace.<br/><br/>One of the two main protagonists, Captain Phillips (homonymous with the movie's title), is supposed to be the heroic lead of the film. Other than a few evading efforts against the pirate boat and a couple of astute tactics used to trick the on-board pirates, in the first half of the movie, he stoops into lame and unwise attempts of escaping when he's aware of the presence of already-at-work Navy seals. Moreover, his character was quite underdeveloped. Even the climax scene, where he cries out loudly after being rescued, had people reaching for their handkerchiefs, when it had the least bit impact on me; I failed to make any connection with him, or even feel sympathy for him. Though I have to say, Tom Hanks has done an impressive job, at least with whatever was given to him; his character's lack of impact can be blamed on the screenplay.<br/><br/>To me, it was the other lead protagonist, Muse, the leader of the Pirate group, who had more character and was more ""empathizable"". He was evidently switching between two emotions, one to follow orders and not go empty-handed to his elders, and the other to feel sympathy for his hostages. Barkhad Abdi's controlled and nuanced performance makes the character raw, fierce, emotionally-vulnerable and relateable. If it were upto me, I would have named the movie after him.<br/><br/>I certainly appreciate how the storywriter and director have portrayed the story in such an unbiased way; we get both sides' account. And the funny thing is, maybe the whole US rescue mission is supposed to be seen as a heroic deed, but to me, as the whole story turned out, the whole system (the cargo ship - navy seal team) seemed dumb. First of all, when such a big cargo is being transported through those dangerous waters, I don't understand the logic behind having no security. Then when a ship is in threat or hijacked, they spend so much by deploying the Navy seals and everything. To me, the way the four skinny Somalian pirates hijacked an entire cargo ship on their tiny boat seemed more admirable.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a thrilling tension-filled film, but it's haphazard priorities leaves the audiences clueless as to what to feel."
"MorgothsReach","8","0","4","23 October 2013"," Greengrass combines realism and thrills to create tense and riveting true-to-life drama
","At first glance there was nobody more apt to direct the story of an ordinary sea captain's struggle against armed Somali pirates than director, Paul Greengrass. From his two forays into the Bourne franchise – The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum – to his powerful and tragic United 93, he can always be relied on to find that perfect balance between realism and thrilling cinema. In Captain Phillips, the story of the eponymous captain's fight for survival against the aforementioned pirates, Greengrass once again delivers. There are no eye patches and swashbuckling in this true-to-life story; only the desperate resourcefulness of an average family man attempting to run down the clock until his rescuers arrive. The film opens with a quick but effective comparison between Phillips (Tom Hanks) and the leader of the pirates who will later board his ship, Muse (Barkhad Abdi): Phillips discusses his son's academic performance with his wife (Catherine Keener) while Muse is woken by rifle fire in his village before being ordered by his gun-toting bosses to get to work and make some money. The next time we meet him – after seeing Phillips assiduously going over safety protocols on his cargo ship in Oman – Muse is hand picking men for the mission which will ultimately pit him against Phillips in a battle of minds and wits. This brief but detailed opening perfectly captures the vastly different backgrounds but similar structures of these men's lives: both have to work for a living but it is ultimately the environment they come from which will determine the nature of this work. I will return to this portrayal of the two men a little later on. Phillips' initial misgivings about the cargo ship's route plan prove more than justified when, rounding the Horn of Africa, two unannounced ships are spotted on the ship's radar. As Muse and his men gradually close in on the Alabama while Phillips radios for emergency assistance and readies his crew, you get the feeling that the tension for the audience – never really on a par with the ship's crew – should be greater than it is. Perhaps understandably, the build up to the hijacking of the Alabama is not quite as tense or traumatic as Greengrass's re-enactment of Flight 93's hijacking. The events of 9/11 will forever remain fixed in people's memory, making the build up to that hijacking more difficult because of the audience's prior knowledge that no help was going to come for the victims. With Captain Phillips, on the other hand, the audience hasn't really got completely under the skin of the character by the time the pirates arrive, making it more difficult to empathise with his situation. However, like United 93, the film's tension is expertly maintained throughout the entire duration, continuing to bubble under the surface during brief interludes in the action. After successfully preventing hostile takeover on the first day, the pirates resume where they left off the next, changing their tactics while increasing their determination. Even in the exciting stand off between Phillips's crew and the pirates, as the latter attempt to attach their boarding ladder to the ship, Greengrass deserves credit for his portrayal of the Somalis. Even though these men are engaging in piracy and are overtly hostile to the ship's crew, the film nevertheless avoids the standard portrayal of clichéd villains, conveying the danger they put themselves under, and their determination, to carry out their mission. In spite of the ship's efforts to repel the threat the ladder is attached to the ship and then boarded by the pirates. What follows is an exciting and realistic depiction of an ordinary captain's efforts to protect both his own and his crew's lives. Phillips is simply the captain of a cargo ship not a war ship therefore his efforts are not put into judo-chopping the 'argh' out of the pirates but subtly deceiving them in order to save his crew from being taken hostage. This game of cat and mouse between Phillips and Muse provides some of the film's best moments as the captive captain attempts to stay one step ahead of the alert and suspicious pirate. Hanks is terrific as Phillips, giving his character an everyday heroism while never venturing into action hero territory. It is the character of Muse and the accompanying performance by Abdi however, which is the highlight of the film. Like United 93's hijackers, Greengrass humanises Muse but never to the extent of condoning his actions. As previously mentioned, like Phillips, Muse has bosses to answer to and must do what he can to appease them as well as make a living for himself. In a great scene, in response to Phillips's assertion that there is more to life than fishing and piracy, Muse matter-of-factly states, 'Maybe in America', again emphasising the uncomfortable truth that people resort to dreadful acts when their environment gives them no other alternative. Apart from an exhilaratingly-scored scene of Navy SEALS jumping from an aircraft, Greengrass expertly maintains this engaging realism for the film's duration as the growing hysteria and panic of both the pirates and Phillips culminates in a tensely riveting finale. Greengrass also deserves credit for not shying away from the aftermath of the hostage situation; instead focusing on it with sometimes uncomfortable and personal detail. Captain Phillips may not equal United 93 in terms of tension and power but it deserves full marks for its unflinching portrayal of sometimes uncomfortable world truths as well as for the terrific performances of Hanks and Abdi which anchor it. The end result is a film which, due once again to Greengrass, proves that exciting and riveting cinema is possible with everyday characters who are put in extremely dangerous but unfortunately real situations. <br/><br/>https://sites.google.com/site/drunkprojectionist/"

","Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum) knows how to build suspense. His latest action/adventure Captain Phillips, based on the true 2009 hijacking of an American cargo ship for ransom by four armed Somali pirates, is no exception. The movie creeps, crawls, rises and falls throughout its 2h15min running time. Tom Hanks delivers but the Somali pirates are the real stars of the film.<br/><br/>What I liked: Greengrass goes from 0-100 in a matter of seconds. The movie has a brief and awkward start but with one flicker on the radar and a hand-held camera we are engulfed in foreboding. The action gives the movie a frenetic pace but the performances win the day. Hanks is the everyman we can all relate to and be terrified for but it's the Somali pirates who offer us more than stock villains, even with stock dialogue. Newcomers Barkhad Abdi and Barkhad Abdirahman are smart, devious, famished, suffering and wilful. They tug at our heartstrings even as we root for them to fail. They are the driving force behind a film whose conclusion made headlines.<br/><br/>What I didn't like: Why did they cast the wonderful Catherine Keener if she was going to end up on the cutting room floor? This frustrated me to no end when the movie was over. I can also understand why the Navy hasn't exactly applauded the film because despite their oppressive presence they don't actually seem to do or accomplish anything. I understand the need to draw out action in order to build a climax but I couldn't help but wonder if some of the sequences were just add-in plot points to embellish the drama rather than actual events."

Drama that drives you to cry when a couple in love gets separated, to laugh at someone's idiotic misery, to amaze with the power of imagination, to get transported in to a world full of dreams or to be in situation that is just a recreation of a real life event but carries same share of intensity and anxiety characters might have experienced it in real.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS by notable filmmaker Paul Greengrass (the man behind 'Bourne' movies) throws you in a 'pressure cooker' situation where every passing minute escalates the tension in same manner the crew of American Cargo ship MV Maersk Alabama could feel, when Somali pirates invade to hijack.<br/><br/>With an implicit fear of the same, the cool-calm-composed but aging Captain Rich Phillips (played by the enormously gifted Tom Hanks) starts his sailing but soon in the middle of a mock-drill session, smells the alarming possibility of getting hijacked by pirates. Sadly, he fails to stop them from getting on board but never lets go the string of hope and courage for even an iota of a second, to come out of this misery of his lifetime.<br/><br/>10-12 minutes in the film and you know what is going to happen next but the way Greengrass unfolds the story with an intimidating sense of 'what is coming after' and the smartly edited inter-cuts between the ship and the pirate-group, you would always find yourself on edge of the seat with nails between your teeth. The camera-work effectively roams around for shaky close-up shots to give the narration an anxious-panicky-edgy feel and does a brilliant job while capturing the hijacking event. Though in the second part, film falls into being restricted & repetitive with the location of the story getting narrowed to one small life-boat, the anxiety-angst & intensity never go for the toss.<br/><br/>As other but very prominent strength of the film, the casting and the performances excite you the most. Barkhad Abdi as the gruesome-ghastly leader of the pirate-group plays mostly an underdog in the first part. With his regulated look, you actually never recall his first appearance in the film but later when he arises as the spearhead of the group, he shocks you with his performance. So does Mr. Tom Hanks, his calculated act as a captain determined to save and safe his crew is remarkable. Watch him in the last act where he is rescued by the armed forces and is now dealing with the trauma he's been in. A performance that deserves appreciation!<br/><br/>CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is easily the year's one of the best thrillers coming from Hollywood. It's a well-directed, intensely acted, smartly written inspiring tale of survival that keep you engaged and involved for the most part. A must-watch!"

","""You're not just a fisherman! You're not just a fisherman!""<br/><br/>Captain Phillips is a thriller that had me at the edge of my seat for most of the film. However, this isn't your usual hostage film as it follows a very different formula thanks to Paul Greengrass's multi-layered direction. I've spoken to different people about what they thought of the film and everyone seems to have a different interpretation or a different vision of the film. That is what a great film does: it speaks to us in different ways and somehow everyone takes something out of it. For example that line where Hanks's character confronts one of the pirates telling him he's not just a fisherman: for some what he was saying is that he can't just justify his actions and that he was just a purely evil man, but others (and I find myself on this side) tend to think that what he was really telling the pirate is that he has so much potential as a leader and he shouldn't just settle to following orders. He could be so much more than a fisherman or a pirate, and that he shouldn't let his surroundings influence him in such a negative way. After all, Greengrass is sending an underlying message about the effects of globalization. Captain Phillips strength lies in this struggle for control between Hanks and his captor, and the dynamics between these two is what makes the movie standout. Despite all this, the greatest moment for me were the final 15 minutes of the film where Greengrass lets Tom Hanks deliver one of his best performances in years. That last scene is what makes this film stand out and breaks the classic formula we've seen before in other hostage films. I don't want to give it away so I will just say that it was a very powerful and emotional moment and one that you never see in these hostage thrillers. My only complaint about this film, and the reason it won't get a full 5 stars from me, is that the first 10 minutes felt awkward and completely unnecessary with some poor dialogues, but from there on the film really picks up and had me completely engaged for the remainder of the movie despite a few minor pacing issues here or there. I had no issues with the shaky hand-held camera which Greengrass has used in all his films (The Bourne Ultimatum, United 93, and Green Zone), and I thought it actually contributed to the sense of claustrophobia during the lifeboat scenes. This is an intense and smart biopic about a recent event that many people were already familiar with, but once again Greengrass managed to deliver the suspense and tension throughout.<br/><br/>The screenplay was adapted by Billy Ray (Breach, State of Play, and The Hunger Games) from Ryan Phillips's autobiographical book about the events that took place in 2009 when his container ship was hijacked by some Somali pirates. Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) was on board the Maersk Alabama container ship along with his crew when all of a sudden a group of Somali pirates, led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi) take him hostage. Phillips buys enough time for his crew to hide in the Engine room while Muse and his three men: Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman), Najee (Faysal Ahmed), and Elmi (Mahat M. Ali) try to take control of the situation. Muse tells Phillips that from now on he is the captain of the ship and if they do what he says no one will get hurt. While the crew remains hidden some unexpected situations take place putting everyone's life in danger. Among the crew members in the Maersk Alabama are Shane (Michael Chernus), Mike (David Warshofsky), John (Chris Mulkey), and Ken (Corey Johnson) who try to keep everyone in safety by following protocol.<br/><br/>The Somali pirates were actually played by first time Somali actors who really did a great job, especially Barkhad Abdi who plays off of Tom Hanks really well. The struggle for power over the control of the vessel between these two men is one of the highlights of the film. I would go as far as to say that Abdi's performance was more impressive than Hanks's, but in the last 15 minutes Hanks proves why he is one of the best actors in the world with a remarkable performance. I think he was downplaying his dramatic role throughout the entire film so that when that moment came it would be even more powerful. I liked the way he was portrayed as an ordinary guy (and we really didn't need that opening scene to establish that because the way he related to his crew members was sufficient enough to see it) who tried to do his best to survive in such a dangerous situation and avoid putting the lives of his men at risk. He makes some mistakes like any other human might make in this situation and his life is ultimately dependent on others (in this case the Navy SEALS). Everything gets out of control and these men who struggled for power and control for so long end up depending on the actions of others. I also liked the way that Greengrass portrayed the pirates here not demonizing them, but not making them look like victims either. This is a real life story and pirate activity in Somalia exists because it is an apparently easy way of making money and in the opinions of a few the only way. You can enjoy this film as simply an entertaining and tense thriller or you can also try to read the different messages Greengrass is laying out there for the audience to interpret. For me it stands out basically because of Tom Hanks dramatic and perfect performance. His last scene is one of the best performances I've seen."

","This was just all in all, a great film. It kept you on the edge of your seat pretty much the whole way through. If I had to complain about it, it did start off a bit slow, and it got kind of boring at scenes. (It WAS a 2 and a half hour movie)but it was mostly really good. The acting was phenomenal, especially from Tom Hanks and it was just done really well, the way they filmed it and how it played out. It was exciting, thrilling and emotional. When I came out of the theater, I said to my friend ""It was so good that it was horrible!"" What I mean by that is, the ending was just so, well I can't really explain it without giving spoilers but because of this, it was GOOD. This is my first review and I right away knew that I wanted to do this one, (I just saw it last night). Anyways, I definitely recommend it and I originally gave it an 8 out of 10 but now that I'm thinking about it again, I give it a 9 out of 10. GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!"

","With 'Captain Phillips', Paul Greengrass does what he clearly does best, bringing to life the events surrounding the hijacking of the Mearsk Alabama in 2009. As with all true stories, the question often asked is how close to reality are the events on screen. When it comes to this film, in terms of specifics, this is going to be a hard question to answer; there is a law suit ongoing and there seem to be some questions surrounding the supposed heroism, or lack thereof, of certain people involved.<br/><br/>It is good, then, that Greengrass has not made a film that feels like it's going for the truth, but rather a balls-to-the-wall thriller which happens to be inspired by true events. Setting up from the outset with an approach that is immediately Greengrass, we see the titular Captian and the Somali pirates preparing for their respective jobs, and the word ""jobs"" is key here, on both sides. The approach begins a motif, which returns at various points through the following two hours, of a mirroring of circumstances; as the film moves on, we see more and more that both Captain Phillips and Muse, the pirate leader, are victims of a wider issue, neither man much in control of anything. Much has been made of this humanising of the ""bad guys"", and whilst it is true, it is also fair to say that Greengrass never pushes the point to the extent that we feel forced to sympathise specifically with them. Rather, and more importantly, we are encouraged to consider, along with Phillips, how and why these emaciated men are driven to commit such crime, and how such a sad state of affairs is allowed.<br/><br/>Perhaps it may have been beneficial for the film to have explored the globalisation issues a little more, and it features a soundtrack which, whilst effective, does come across, at times, like a lazy rip-off of Hans Zimmer. That said, if it wasn't for the trademark voice of a director with whom we are now quite familiar thanks to the 'Bourne' sequels, we could be easily forgiven for thinking this is Ron ""Apollo 13"" Howard at his absolute must-see best. The performances from the pirates (first time actors) seem unabashed by Hanks' presence, and in fact the reality that they never met before filming only creates a more palpable sense of fear and confusion. Indeed, Barkhad Abdi does not seem to be acting, it is more like he has just wandered into the film; he plays Phillips' equal and opposite with an apparently unshaken conviction. As for Tom Hanks? This is his most impressive performance since 'Road to Perdition', a film which itself let us see a side of Mr Hanks we hadn't seen before. From the moment he steps aboard the ship and begins running drills, we are sold; Hanks disappears and the stern Captain Phillips emerges. From here, the performance becomes increasingly compelling; this man can do so much with so little and it seems effortless, which so often results in us forgetting it is a performance. Here, the gradual breakdown of a proud and pragmatic man is perfectly pitched throughout, and the final scene sees the actor do something quite incredible, finding a gut-wrenching truth and hitting notes I don't think I've ever seen him hit so perfectly before. Yes, Hanks reminds us, at a time when perhaps we needed reminding, of why he is one of the greatest actors alive. Let's be honest, we do tend to forget.<br/><br/>Greengrass makes the wise choices to never get melodramatic and to never leave the action, which never really lets up; events just keep escalating. From an early scene of pirates boarding the vessel, to a final act that makes the last half hour of 'Zero Dark Thirty' look fairly amateur, you frequently remind yourself that this must have been a logistical nightmare to shoot; the fact it has come out looking so great and edited so well is testament to a very controlled film maker. On nearly every level, 'Captain Phillips' is most certainly one of the films of the year. It is shot with energy, it is perfectly paced,with a knuckle-chewing level of intensity which rarely wanes. It is hard to recall the last time I was this completely engaged and ""with a character""; I WAS that guy in the bathtub at the end of 'The Truman Show'! As well as the full throttle thrills, it offers a tragic human drama that leaves you some food for thought. <br/><br/>It may prove questionable as a documentary of fact, but as a thriller it is one of the best we will see for some time."

","The first hour was really exiting, great acting from both the leading roles and the smaller parts. A friend told me to go watch this movie and said that it was one of the best movies he had ever seen, so with that expectation I sat and thought that it really was that good. Until the super long hour in the lifeboat witch was according to me necessary but still made the film a bit to long and somewhat boring at just that part of the movie. But then when I had lost the hope and thought to myself that my friend obviously doesn't have any taste in movies an amazing ending showed and saved the whole movie. I have to say that if it wasn't the best movie I've seen the ending is at least one of them. Summery: First part: 9/10 Last part 7/10 Ending: 10/10"

","This movie had me on the edge of my seat for most of the film. The lack of a soundtrack was surprisingly great and made the movie feel more realistic. Also the usage of moving cameras which gave a great feeling like you were there.<br/><br/>It's a shame that after reading more about the movie it seems that most of the movie is fake - but that is to be expected in Hollywood I guess. They did a good job of making a gripping movie which felt realistic.<br/><br/>I have to say though that up until the hijacking, the acting felt a bit forced. Even Tom Hanks wasn't convincing - especially before they get on the boat. (Maybe this was partially clouded by my knowledge of Tom Hank's other movies.)<br/><br/>The parts with the US Navy thought are unbelievable. <br/><br/>Message of the movie: Don't mess with Uncle Sam.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this movie."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","3","13 October 2013"," A scary, real-world adventure that trumps anything you imagine about pirates.
","""Captain Phillips"" is a cold-water treatment for anyone who regards pirates solely based on what they see at the movies – or on the internet for that matter. If your mental imagery of high seas plunderers begins and ends with Jack Sparrow, then you're in for a shock when director Paul Greengrass puts his arm around your shoulder and shows you – in cold, spare detail – how it works in the real world.<br/><br/>The story of ""Captain Phillips"" is based on the 2009 attempted high jacking of the cargo ship MV Maerck Alabama, 200 miles off the coast of Somalia, and the subsequent kidnapping of merchant mariner Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks). Little time is wasted on getting things rolling. We are hardly 20 minutes into the film when the pirates, driving two skiff boats, begin closing in on the ship which they choose because it is the only ship in the region that isn't sailing close to another ship. Greengrass bypasses a lot of introductory scenes in an attempt to keep the story lean and spare. He establishes only that Phillips has a wife (Catherine Keener) and that the Somalis banded their pirate crew together early that morning on the beach, like workers looking for day laborers. After that the movie is full-steam ahead into a white-knuckle thriller that Greengrass is able to keep tense even when we know how it ends.<br/><br/>The scenes of the takeover are laid out with scary precision. The Alabama attempts to subvert the takeover by first outrunning and then out-maneuvering the skiff. The action is presented with such dramatic tension that we begin to think, for a moment, that the Alabama might be able to avoid the takeover. That, of course, is not the truth. The ship is boarded by four young Somali men who are skinny, frightened and waving machine guns.<br/><br/>We learn only what we need to know about the characters. Phillips is shown as a man of experience, who is able to improvise at crucial moments. Hanks downplays his performance by making it mostly reactionary. He doesn't pose for effect, but simply plays to the moment. He saves his one huge emotional moment for last. Hanks is an actor who is as familiar to us as a favorite cousin, and after 33 years of acting in professional films, we think that we might have seen everything that his acting arsenal might have to offer. He has a moment in this film of near-emotional meltdown that is startling. It is a moment that, up until now, this fine actor has never been able to display.<br/><br/>The pirates themselves redefine the words ""rag-tag."" There are only four men left when the hijack actually happens – several others abandoned the mission. At first they seem like movie types: There's a hard-eyed leader, a hot-head, a scared kid, and one guy who might be mistaken for having a soul. They have a goal in mind, but these are not professional criminals. They are scared, violent and hard-headed. Early and often, they make stupid mistakes because, determined as they are, they're not exactly brainiacs.<br/><br/>Most of their focus comes from the leader, Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Adbi) who earns no sympathy even when he tells Phillips his reasons for taking the ship - he, like, Phillips, has people to answer to. Adbi is an untrained actor making his film debut and is already earning buzz as a possible Oscar contender. It might be well earned. He doesn't play Muse as irrational. There's something in his eyes that tells us that he is determined to take this crisis to a tragic end. We actually begin to believe that in other circumstances, he could make an effective leader – or a fearsome warlord.<br/><br/>Greengrass keeps the film lean and sharp. He builds tension, not out of phony manipulation, but based on circumstance and fact. He's an old hat at this kind of thing. He previously directed ""Bloody Sunday"", about the 1972 Irish civil rights march and subsequent massacre by British troops. He also made the brilliant ""United 93"" about the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania on September 11th.<br/><br/>He's a craftsman who knows how to stage a real-life action scenes without pumping it full of phony drama. He sticks to the moment. ""Captain Phillips"" is a very well-made recreation. What it does it does very well. It doesn't have much meaning beyond itself, however. It is an incident that happened in real life, but there are not a lot of personal details. Once it's over you're only left with a great thriller. As with ""United 93,"" (which was my favorite film of 2006) Greengrass wants to stick to the facts, and not burden the film with side-stories. That's probably best because he's better at the documentary details than he is with characters and personal drama. Still, this is probably the most effective thriller you'll see all year."
"LoveForCinema1","9","0","5","12 October 2013"," it has tension, it has suspense, and it has Tom Hanks
","Captain Philips is one of those films where when the screen goes dark and credits start to roll, you just sit there with your heart still racing, saying wow.. wow. In the style of his other critically acclaimed films like United 93 and Bloody Sunday, Paul Greengrass has done it again, he has given us yet another thrilling, heart wrenching reenactment of a historical event. The camera work, the editing, the acting, everything was top notch. What I noticed from the beginning was how tight the camera work and editing was. The closeness of the camera created the feeling that you were right there with the characters and the editing deserves, at the least, an Oscar nomination.As far as the acting goes,I was beyond impressed. Tom Hanks, in probably one of his best roles to date, took my breath away again.He is the male version of Meryl Streep. He is an acting genius, someone who can take a role and make it human, make it so real and genuine. Throughout the movie, he doesn't have too much of an opportunity to be highly dramatic but still does an amazing job. It's the last 20 minutes or so that truly show his gift, the way he breaks down,the way he just lets out everything he kept in throughout the whole time, is so raw and emotional,I was crying. He has a way of capturing the essence of a normal, every day person, a way of getting in all the little quirks of real people.Barkhad Abdi was a perfect casting choice to play the pirates' leader. He gives a stellar performance,giving many of the scenes tension and an in your face feel, and almost matching up with the skill of Hanks. What also is an intelligent move on Greengrass's part, Just like in United 93, is the use of real people who actually worked those certain jobs (navy seals, medics, etc.) It adds a certain reality to the film and adds believability to the roles.Captain Phillips is tense. It is heart wrenching. It is raw and it is powerful. With it's well executed direction and stellar performances, Captain Phillips is a must see for anyone who appreciates quality cinema and great acting *cough cough*Tom Hanks."
"jdkraus","10","0","5","12 October 2013"," Excellent movie-making with great performances by Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi
","Hollywood loves to sensationalize true stories as major motion pictures. They have been doing so for decades and it sells tickets. Fiction over fact is much more enjoyable and dramatic than the often hard, dull truth. That does not necessarily mean all events depicted are false. In the case of Captain Phillips, we as audience members will never know the real experiences that man went through psychologically, emotionally, and to some extent physically. All we really know is that his cargo ship was 126 miles off the Somali coastline and it was boarded by Somali pirates. He was then taken hostage in a lifeboat where he remained captive for three days before the navy and the Navy SEALS (with their clever marksmanship) were able to save him. However, filmmakers can give us an assumed ""dramatized"" glimpse of the events by driving our emotions and putting us on the edge of our seats. The movie ""Captain Phillips"" does this with gusto and success for two core reasons.<br/><br/>The first is the talent. Tom Hanks, one of the best actors a director can ask for, plays the role as Captain Phillips. He depicts him as a mild-mannered, by-the-book captain who does anything and everything he can to not only survive, but help his crew make it out alive. He proves himself a very witty individual that cannot be helped admired. After all, the real Captain Phillips is a hero of sorts—not the kind who wears a cape, but a real-world brave person who is vulnerable and can be hurt. Tom Hanks plays this to the tee. For the two hours and fourteen minutes, Tom masterfully displays a wide variety of emotions—defiance, fear, bravery, shock, and sorrow. For the last twenty minutes alone, Tom Hanks truly gives a performance audience members will remember. <br/><br/>Newcomer Barkhad Abdi as the head of the pirate boarding-party turns in an equally brilliant performance. The writer was very smart in making his character not a one-dimensional villain. Instead, he is a man plagued by the ungodliness of the human condition—uncontrollable hate and violence yet full of boastful pride. The smug sneer on his face and his sarcastic, repeated phrase, ""Everything will be alright Irish"" (his nickname for Phillips) adds further to his character's sardonic personality. Bill Ray's solid writing highlights the depth of these characters; nonetheless, it is still the actors who bring his words to life. <br/><br/>The second reason for the movie's success is the technical works of the crew. Paul Greengrass is an auteur of the action/thriller genre and his visual style has been repeated over and over again in the mainstream action flicks—hand-held camera, natural lighting techniques, quick cuts between action, strong emphasis on field sound, etcetera. While this style has been seemingly overdone in many movies, it works well for this film. The type of camera angles put the audience right into the scene unflinchingly. Both the fast edits and the heart-pounding music heighten the tension. I sense Oscar nominations for cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, editor Chris Rouse, and composer Henry Jackman. <br/><br/>Even though we know what happens at the end of the movie, the people behind the camera are able to make the audience suspend their disbelief, and have them crave the suspense, thrills, and action that this ride has to offer. In a nutshell, ""Captain Phillips"" is a fun, intense film that excels in entertainment and characters. 10/10"

","From the beginning the movie kept my interest. You quickly determine Tom Hanks is a Merchant Marine Captain and his wife sadly drops him at the airport for yet another assignment in some far off land. They hug and kiss and perhaps a tear is shed. So far, a decent drama turn thriller unfolding. <br/><br/>Even if you don't know the true story, you sense their will be trouble, fueled by the subtle foreboding provided, starting when the Captain boards ship and notes several security concerns, which then is confirmed when you see the Somali pirates haggling to get the job of hunting down one if the many freighters in the nearby trade lanes. <br/><br/>From that point anticipation and dread set in keeping the viewer biting a nail or a slight squirm in the seat. The crew doesn't know yet but you know what's likely coming. When they finally realize they are being followed, the dread and tension increase until finally they realize these guys are in fact pirates and an orderly panic sets in. <br/><br/>There is great disappointment when it becomes apparent that not one single weapon is on board. A few rifles or hand guns would have made the difference in this case. This is not a movie fault if this follows the true story. Also not sure why they separated from the mainstream freighter traffic as pointed out, making for an ideal target. <br/><br/>So the anticipation and pace of the movie keeps the viewers heart rate elevated. The pursuit, capture and occupation keep the pace. The reticent reaction by the Maritime Traffic Monitoring upon the report is disturbing and you hope this is not a repeat of Benghazi. But, alas, the Navy does show up, eventually. Three or perhaps two and a half cheers here for timing. Loud applause for Naval professionalism! Some great scenes and action here. <br/><br/>Without giving away much more of the movie plot, the remaining action and resolution of the conflict is protracted to the point of a yawn or a few winks and a nod, despite the loud, riveting score. The final moment of resolution was exciting if brief in relation to this long extended sequence. Lose at least one star here, maybe two (total out if 10)<br/><br/>A quick point here. They should have had the wife on the phone with the Captain at least once to amplify the tension, dread and potential loss of loved one. She disappeared after the airport drop. A hint in an email but no real contact. Subtract a half star here. <br/><br/>And to sour things a bit at the end lets just say here that the Captain (Hanks) who had been steadfastly level headed, brave, even guardedly cool while naturally scared, goes through what I consider to be a melodramatic meltdown of character that I didn't find consistent, even given the situation. I felt it was gratuitous opportunity to demonstrate Mr. Hanks acting latitude, with all due respect for this great actor. My kids didn't agree here. They thought he was in character. You decide. I take another half star here. <br/><br/>Often Mr Hanks films have a political statement. If it were here it was subtle. He had some pity for the pirates lot and plight, in dialog with the young boy and within the ""captain to captain"" relationship with the better of the two lead bad guys. ""Isnt there something else you could be doing"" asks Hanks. ""Maybe for you, Maybe in America, but not here,"" the pirate laments. Hank's character does point out to his nemeses that they could have gotten away scott-free earlier with some modest booty, but Hanks and his antithesis agreed that we all have ""bosses"" with expectations and are not free to make the call. <br/><br/>Bottom line. Pretty good true dramatic thriller, devoid of gratuitous sex, violence, and computer animations (sorry Grand Theft Auto fans), with good pace and tension. Subtle political undertone but minimal. Lose a a few stars for protracted resolution, melodramatic meltdown and no family communication. 7 out of 10."

","WOW.<br/><br/>The only word we can think of to describe this film is gripping. To be honest, we didn't really remember how the situation with Captain Phillips and the Somalian pirates played out in real life. This was only a few short years ago, but how quickly we forget.<br/><br/>Regardless, we were on the edge of our seats watching this tense drama being played out on the big screen. Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips was marvelous, as always, but the true show-stealer was Barkhad Abdi, portraying the pirate Muse. You truly feel for his character throughout the film, who at one point proudly exclaims that he has hijacked expensive ships successfully in the past; it's obvious that he still lives in a rundown dirt-floored home in Somalia with no bed and no riches. This movie really makes viewers sympathize with not only the kidnapped Captain Phillips, but with the perpetrating pirates as well. We understand their role as villains and though we don't ever root for them, we know that they are also victims in some way.<br/><br/>It's actors like Tom Hanks that keep us interested and excited to watch movies each and every week. You really believe him as the characters he plays, and you feel like he has the best intentions at heart for every role. He is so, so good.

","I remembered this incident appearing in the news in 2009 but did not know the extent of the trauma involved in the ordeal of the Somali pirates taking over a huge American cargo ship. I wanted to know how truthful the film rendition was to the book A Captain's Duty written by Captain Phillips. There is a good online article available entitled, ""How accurate is Captain Phillips?"" by Forrest Wickman for Slate Magazine which provides more details on the accuracy.<br/><br/>According to Mr. Wickman's investigation, the film rendition is pretty accurate. I thought it was interesting that the person who played Muse, the captain for the Somali pirates, looks a lot like the real person who is currently serving 33 years in prison in Terre Haute, IN. The actor and the real person are pictured side by side in this online article.<br/><br/>I sure hope that Mr. Phillips was treated for Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome after the awful ordeal. To his credit, he did go back to work over a year later in 2010. The time on the Alabama lifeboat with the four Somali pirates was actually five days. One does not get the idea that it was that long in the film.<br/><br/>The best acting was at the end when Tom Hanks had to play someone who was in shock and traumatized. He did a great job and said according to this article that the scene was improvised. I found the doctor's or nurse's comments rather irritating at the beginning. Many people in the audience (including me) teared up at the end because finally it was over. It was pretty gripping for a long time. I was so proud of the Navy Seal Team 6 for their great work in solving the crisis. What would we do without them? <br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing. It holds one's attention easily. I would say that it's too intense for young adults (13-15 year olds). There is some violence as would be expected. It has a PG-13 rating."

","I must say that ""Captain Phillips"" is one film that's full of drama and tense moments it doesn't let down a viewer's pleasure as it tells the real life 2009 U.S. cargo hijacking in fine form. Though it's long and drawn out the film takes it's time and it's compelling showing the dark and different contrast between Somali pirates and U.S. cargo members. In 2009 a dark occurrence happened for the first time in 200 years a U.S. cargo ship was taken hostage and hijacked as the U.S. MV Maersk Alabama was taken over by deadly Somali pirates. And the ship's captain Richard Phillips(done by one of the best in the business Mr. Tom Hanks)endures the most horrible voyage a deadly cat and mouse game of pros and cons and yes and no's with the pirates. Head leader Muse(done so dead on and stone cold by Barkhad Abdi)is so ruthless it's scary. Anyway thru it all this film is a harrowing drama of tense moments with life saving decisions and choices as the waves and waters twist and turn at high sea! Overall well done tense drama nice to see a real life rescue mission go so well!"

","I saw ""Captain Phillips"", starring Tom Hanks-Cloud Atlas, Turner & Hooch; Barkhad Abdi-this is his first movie; Catherine Keener-Where the Wild Things Are, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Max Martini-Pacific Rim, The Unit-t.v.<br/><br/>This is based on the true story of the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in 200 years. It takes place in 2009, off the coast of Africa, with the hijackers being Somalian pirates. Tom is the American merchant captain of the ship that is targeted by Barkhad and his buddies. The ship does not carry any weapons, either personal or otherwise, so they are easy targets. Catherine has a small role as Tom's wife and Max is the leader of the SEAL team that is called in to handle the situation. Even though I knew the outcome of the tense drama-I remember the story in the news-it was still an edge-of-the-seat thriller. Both Tom and the newcomer Barkhad gave great performances and I can see Oscar nominations for the two of them. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and drug use and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes. I liked it enough that I would buy it on DVD."

","CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013) **** Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali, Michael Chernus, Catherine Keener, David Warshofsky, Corey Johnson, Chris Mulkey, Yul Vazquez, Max Martini. Absorbing and compelling true-life account of the 2009 Somali pirate hijacking of the American container ship Maersk Alabama with Hanks (in top Oscar worthy form) as the titular skipper, Rich Phillips, who uses his wits and stamina against all odds in a fight for survival at any costs. Directed with white-knuckle taut tension by veteran helmsman Paul Greengrass who knows how to balance the action and drama deftly with skill and élan. The keenly observant screenplay by Billy Ray (based on Phillips' book) keeps one riveted in spite of the outcome already known (not too shabby a trick to pull off). Novice actor Abdi (a Somalian cum American) as the head of the quartet of attackers is equally of note come awards season that has a verisimilitude not seen since Dr. Hang S. Ngor's Oscar-winning work in THE KILLING FIELDS. One of the year's best films."
