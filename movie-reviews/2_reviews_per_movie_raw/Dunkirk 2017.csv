"Aaron_Kyle","9","334","423","13 July 2019"," Nolan's latest masterpiece
","Dunkirk is one of the most visually stunning films of 2017 and one of the most realistic depictions of tragic events shown on cinema.<br/><br/>One would think that without any proper characterization or backstories of any of the characters Dunkirk would present itself as a dull excuse for endless action but it's the exact opposite. The characters are shown to us in a way in which we understand them and their purpose by only glancing at them which is one of the best aspects of Dunkirk. However, it is also one of the worst. The only minor issue with Dunkirk I have is that the actors aren't given much to do which the production quality easily outweighs. With a 104-minute runtime, Dunkirk perfectly balances two stories and lots of action and unlike films with twice the runtime, it doesn't drag for a second. Dunkirk is also one of the best sounding films in the last few years and rightfully so earned itself Oscars in both sound mixing and editing as well as film editing.<br/><br/>Dunkirk manages the be entertaining and emotional with little to no characterisation and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a compelling story or just some good action.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10"

","This film shows that Christopher Nolan does not only depend on crazy action or crazy plot twist. He shows 3 separate stories that come together and tells us a good story."
"nimdude","10","1172","1776","22 July 2017"," A short review with a longer explanation of why its OK that this movie didn't have any ""characters""
","Dunkirk is, in my opinion, yet another masterpiece from mastermind Christopher Nolan. Since everything that is brilliant about the film has already been said I will briefly write what I think of the film and also touch on a topic that some people are criticizing the movie for.<br/><br/>The fantastically directed film is told from 3 perspectives non chronologically. It superbly tackles the narrative and the non linear story doesn't at all pull you away from the intensity of the events happening on screen that don't stop from 00:00 to the last scene. Hans Zimmer most likely gives one of the most fitting scores for a war film ever. Sometimes there is only one note playing followed by heartbeat sounds and a ticking clock while other times a massive orchestra is interpreting what is going on on screen. The movie brilliantly projects the feeling of each and every soldier on the beach to the audience. Confusion, turmoil and fear. The cinematography was breathtaking and I felt anxious throughout most of the run time. There is no lead in this film and I can't really say anyone stuck out as giving a brilliant performance because it wasn't needed and I'll explain why.<br/><br/>The biggest criticisms of Dunkirk that I've heard of so far are that the characters are lacking in depth and that we aren't given anything to be invested in them. I feel like Nolan was trying (successfully) to make the audience care for each and every one of the men on the beach. He needed to have some form of ""main characters"" to be in the story so that we can see the events unfold from the direct perspective of all of the soldiers. Usually in war films (I'll use saving private Ryan as an example) the plot revolves around certain soldiers (like Cpt. Miller and Ryan) being in a war and doing things in the war but its still about THEM not THE WAR as much. In my opinion Dunkirk is a telling the STORY OF DUNKIRK. Not of Harry Style's character or Tom Hardy's character but of Dunkirk. What any of the ""main characters"" felt, every other soldier felt. Nolan resorted more to film-making techniques to tell the story rather than dialogue and that is why some people might have had a problem with the lack of character depth but realistically this type of terrible event wouldn't be a place for someone to ""develop"" as a character but rather a event where MEN WANTED ONLY SURVIVAL, and Nolan showed that perfectly. As for what the top review of Dunkirk on IMDb says about 'lack of emotion' in the film, I believe this to be a completely incorrect statement. Maybe he was referring to the lack of 'brotherhood amongst men' or the feeling of moral or something epic like that. Again the longing for the 'Saving Private Ryan' format of war films. What the reviewer fails to see is that realistically there was NO emotion on that beach besides fear and confusion. And I can safely say that Nolan and Zimmer and the DP all successfully gave us those feelings.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"criticadelcinema","7","1208","1888","19 July 2017"," A technical masterpiece that is nearly devoid of palpable emotion and compelling characters.
","Might as well get right to it, then. At the risk of sounding like a contrarian, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star masterpiece? Unfortunately, no. <br/><br/>The cinematography here at least, is masterful. Director Christopher Nolan has, without a doubt, reached the pinnacle of on-screen spectacle here. The feats of practical effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting of nearly 6,000 extras, authentic WWII vehicles, and shooting on location in Dunkirk, France contribute to a great sense of scale here. There is ongoing trend of action films in recent years of relying on CGI, and thankfully Nolan bucks that trend. <br/><br/>Similar to War for the Planet of the Apes, much of the film plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the score and sound design in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted, which, paired with Nolan's great work behind the camera, truly transports you to the Battle of Dunkirk. The wailing of planes passing above, the drone of gunfire, and the roar of explosions all contribute to the complete immersion into the world these characters are trapped in. This results in some of the most immersive wartime action scenes since Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>This film has and will continue to be compared to World War II classic Saving Private Ryan. Both films are beautifully filmed WWII period pieces with casts that deliver great performances. The similarities end there. Whereas Saving Private Ryan was engrossing as a narrative due to it's characters with depth and arcs, Dunkirk instead leans on it's subject matter and spectacle.<br/><br/>And while the subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating, as a film it lacks emotional firepower due to the absence of a strongly written protagonist. This is strangely uncharacteristic of a director of Nolan's caliber, especially when you recall the complex character work in his most acclaimed films: The Dark Knight, Memento, and The Prestige. Instead of focusing on a single character or single group of characters, the focus is spread across three protagonists in completely different situations. Showing the Dunkirk Evacuation through the three different perspectives of those on the beach, the sea, and the air is only an interesting proposition on paper. The narrative, due to this writing choice, is spread far too thin, with few characters getting enough screen time to develop even the mildest emotional connection.<br/><br/>While the characters in this film aren't written to even remotely be compelling, the great work from this cast is not to be overlooked. Harry Styles, known for being a member of English boy band One Direction, is surprisingly excellent here in his acting debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given. <br/><br/>I should love this film. Historical drama? WWII setting? My favorite director Christopher Nolan? Amazing cinematography? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection severely detracts from the awe-inspiring scope and technical prowess displayed. <br/><br/>If I reviewed based on visuals alone, this is a slam-dunk, walk-off home run of a 5-star film. While a focus on grandeur and situation over character depth and emotion may work for some (it obviously worked for 98% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes), it did not work for this critic.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt a cinematic achievement, but without an emotional core, it's impossible for this film not to feel cold and empty. Despite being a technical masterpiece, this is Christopher Nolan's most disappointing film yet."
"PanheadAndy","5","963","1519","26 July 2017"," Did I see a different movie than everyone else that has raved about how good it is?
","I was very disappointed with this movie. I have liked previous Nolan movies but this one left me feeling cheated that I had spent that much money to see it. It was boring and unrealistic.One scene had a ship getting hit with a bomb and immediately rolling on it's side then remaining afloat.At the end a plane runs out of fuel and seemingly defies the laws of physics by gliding forever and ever shooting down a plane before landing on the beach. They kept showing shots of the beach with lines of soldiers that nowhere approximated over 400,000 soldiers. Same with the amount of ships and boats and planes. The hype of this being one of the best war movies ever had me expecting something special. Instead it had me sitting there wondering when the fantastic movie was going to start. I waited in vain. Instead I left the show with a headache from the noise bombardment from the soundtrack.My biggest sense of wonder was that they had spent that much money making it. I wanted to like this movie but it never happened for me."
"Better_Sith_Than_Sorry","5","772","1290","21 July 2017"," Put Down the Kool-Aid
","Given the outright gushing of critics in praising this film, I was quite surprised to discover Dunkirk to be not only not deserving of such praise, but even worse, to be a cacophony of minimalist nonsense, topped off by one of the most ridiculous film climaxes in recent memory (more on that later). ""Possibly the best war film of all time?"" Not quite, I could name dozens better. In fact I struggle to think of many that are worse than this. My goodness, where to begin...<br/><br/>First I do not understand where the $150 million budget was spent. The actual story of the Dunkirk evacuation involved - literally - hundreds of thousands of men, and hundreds of boats and planes. In this film, we see....a few hundred men? 30 boats? Something like six planes? Where is the grand scale that a story like Dunkirk deserves, or really, demands? There was no grand scale. That is a heinous omission and oversight and ultimately fails to tell the story of Dunkirk as it should be told. And if you don't want to use CGI to achieve that scale, that's fine, but then either expand the real numbers of extras and props so it replicates what Dunkirk was actually like, or, don't do the film. A few soldiers standing around on the beach looks incredibly silly when the characters say on more than one occasion that there are over 300,000 men there. Where are they? We never saw them. Ludicrous.<br/><br/>Similarly, we see a few boats here and there, and a few planes. This does not come close to approximating the flotilla of ships, boats and other watercraft used - in reality over 800. It's hard to appreciate what a tremendous achievement the Dunkirk evacuation was - ultimately, the aim of this film I suspect - when we never actually see that achievement occur. We see a few boats and few planes. Literally a drop in the bucket of what Dunkirk was. Yet at the conclusion, as the men are disembarking, back safe in England, we are supposed to be swept up in a swelling feeling of appreciation for something that we never actually witness. Very bizarre.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, if you can call it that, was an escalating collection of random and intrusive blaring instruments that can be best described as 'noise.' I have no idea what the goal was there. Perhaps it was an attempt to convey what one might feel, the intense experience one might have, if he or she was in a war-time situation like this. Perhaps. A professional critic called it 'bombastic' and that's probably being generous. I am not lying when I tell you I had to take an Advil when I got back from the theater, thanks to the crazily escalating noise that overwhelms the latter part of the film. Yikes.<br/><br/>As for the climax, the scene of a Spitfire seemingly free of the laws of physics and gravity is bereft of all logic, and was such an eye-rolling piece of nonsense, no amount of criticism on my part can do it justice. Let's just say planes cannot keep flying indefinitely, much less maneuver and successfully engage other aircraft, when that plane has run out of fuel. The film deserves to be panned for this ridiculous scene alone.<br/><br/>This is not a great war film, it's not even a good war film. It is not typical or traditional story-telling, I will give it that. There are stretches of this film that lack dialogue and there is zero character development. While different, that's hardly unique (it's been done before). Perhaps some critics haven't understood that 'different' does not automatically translate to 'good' or 'great' - sometimes, it does not.<br/><br/>Put down the Kool-Aid. As my brother said to me when we walked out of the theater last night, ""Assuming I would like this, I thought I would go see this again over the weekend. Not only am I not doing that now, I won't even bother watching this once it's on cable or Netflix."" True that, bro. 5/10."
"hel-89571","3","521","863","15 August 2017"," A truly boring and tedious movie.
","As a regular movie goer I was naturally looking forward to seeing what all the hype was about in regards to ""Dunkirk"". Well I was sorely disappointed, and came away frustrated at what the director could have done with such a large budget, instead of the tedious film he gave us. <br/><br/>Within the first 10 minutes we find ourselves on the beach, together with lines and lines of soldiers facing the water, waiting for the boats to collect them. Never mind the fact, that the boats had not even left England yet! <br/><br/>Needless to say, the soldiers were completely unprotected in the open, and made for great target practice for the German planes above them. <br/><br/>I found the lack of character building to be an enormous let down. Whilst there were three mini plots, the soldiers being evacuated, the trio of Spitfires, and the one small boat with the man and his son, there was little or no interaction between the actors in these mini plots. <br/><br/>I call them actors as we were never able to get to know them by name as such, and hence there were no characters in this movie per se. Kenneth Branagh spent the entire moving walking up and down the wharf trying to get the soldiers into whatever boats appeared. <br/><br/>The supposed armada that was dispatched from the other side of the channel, never looked more than a bunch of mates out for an afternoon cruise.<br/><br/>There were many scenes with little or no dialogue, which depicted what it was really like for mainly those on the beach, or in an unused trawler a group of them came across. <br/><br/>Whilst these may have been realistic, we had no idea who the characters involved were, as we had no opportunity to engage with them throughout the film.<br/><br/>There were many times when we switched from a night time scene to daytime one, and then back to night time, when supposedly all the action was taking place at the the same time. <br/><br/>In my humble opinion, Dunkirk could have, and should have been an epic movie, but I'm afraid to say that I found it boring, tedious, and without character. <br/><br/>I am well aware that I am in the minority with this opinion, but it really could have been so much better.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Hans"
"snk2005","2","652","1087","15 August 2017"," Soul-less. Confused. Loud. Disappointing.
","Being an avid war film fan, I was beyond excited seeing the trailer for Dunkirk and couldn't wait until it hit theatres. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. By the end of the film, I was actually mad. <br/><br/>I have to agree with some of the reviewers here who've stated that many of these glowing reviews are paid for, because what they're describing isn't even the same film.<br/><br/>Before the artsy-fartsy daggers come out--no, I don't need tons of backstory to feel invested in the characters. It's war, it's brutal, and I can surmise what it must be like for these brave souls. But when I come out the film and can't remember a single character's name (or worse, even care about them), that's just crap storytelling. Art should inspire a connection. This left me devoid of anything to be honest.<br/><br/>Scale...I may as well have been watching a tiny pocket of some soldiers, fighting some war, taking place somewhere. Part of what's so astonishing and inspiring about Dunkirk was its sheer scale. This insipid attempt to condense it to bite-sized POVs is insulting. You would expect at the end when the character (I literally can't remember his name) began reading Churchill's announcement to be roused by emotion. But since the film didn't generate any, and the delivery was so bland, it didn't even click with me what he was reading until I heard, ""We shall fight on the beaches."" <br/><br/>Lastly, a film doesn't have to be linear so I don't mind differing time lines. This however, was like some art-house, ""look at how cool I play with time"" film school project. I'm sorry...GAWD I'm sorry... but this was bad. I think about 100+ reviews explained why it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Storytelling has been used by our species for centuries to share POVs, be morality tales, entertain screaming kids who won't sleep...you get the picture. NONE of that happens if your audience doesn't connect with the story. This was an experiment and indulgence. A $150M indulgence and waste of viewers' time and money. Shame on you."
"Martin010","4","703","1183","21 July 2017"," In 2017, over 330.000 film viewers were stuck in a cinema, surrounded by boredom, can they be rescued?
","It's hard to understand critic ratings of 10/10 while this movie undeniably lacks quality on some very important aspects. Let me start off with some positive notes:<br/><br/><ul><li>IMAX: The impact of the bullets and bombs felt as if you were really there. The entire movie is shot in a very realistic way. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Opening scene: The suspense, music and cinematography all came together very well in the opening scene, which really made me excited for the scenes to come.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Acting: Poor acting can easily distract the audience from their experience of being in a certain time/place. But there was not a single moment in which an actor did something out of character. All expressions were very believable. Great acting!</li></ul><br/><br/>But there were some major aspects I had issues with:<br/><br/><ul><li>Characters: The characters did not have any background story and there's hardly any dialogue to give some insight. The main characters are therefore replaceable for any other random soldier on that beach. I do not expect an elaborate introduction of every character, certainly not in a historical war movie, but the downside is that the audience cannot empathize with the main characters. I really didn't care for one of them to die. I've seen hundreds of soldiers die in earlier scenes of the movie, why would one or two more (just as hollow and unknown as any other soldier) bother me a bit? It's no must to focus on character development, as long as the other aspects of the movie make up for the lack of it. In Dunkirk that sadly was not the case.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Editing: Sometimes it was hard to follow which moment in time is shown, because the movie abruptly cuts between three perspectives, therefore even showing some events twice. I find this non-linear storytelling and continuity breaks unnecessary and poorly executed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Repetitive: Much scenes are identical or slightly different from another. Especially the flight scenes did not add much to the story. Instead I rather would've seen some scenes at the front-line with troops actually defending the beach instead of just a bunch of scared, helpless troops waiting for the next plane to fly over and bomb the shite out of them. Keeping out the Germans at the front-line is just as much a part of the story of Dunkirk and it would've given us a chance to actually see the enemy and get some awesome battle scenes. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Music: Usually I enjoy Zimmer's score. But in this movie there was no moment of silence, not a moment to break the suspense. Especially in IMAX, my ears were buzzing hours after I left the cinema. Was this intentional? Was it supposed to feel like one big action scene without any breaks, to get the same feeling of those soldiers, trapped between battles unable to take a break, constantly in stress of a nearing attack? Well, than Nolan did succeed. But I found it very annoying. </li></ul><br/><br/>Overall I believe this movie is highly overrated, due to many biased Nolan fans and critics blindly hopping on the hype-train. I found it a very boring movie. The lack of an interesting plot or any interesting characters sadly wasn't compensated enough by the impressive audiovisuals. Rescue yourself from boredom and don't watch this movie!"
"mraos","6","411","683","22 July 2017"," Hipsterish affectation of an ""artistic"" war movie.
","This movie is so paper thin I really can't write much about it. So many missed opportunities in a film about one of the most spectacular and complex battles of WWII. I can see what Nolan tried to do here, a kind of British ""Thin Red Line"" (there's even wind in the grass, lol, i kid you not), but he failed spectacularly. There are no memorable characters to be found here, and one wonders even if there are any actual characters at all. Not one, not one of them has any semblance of a character arc. Not one. Again, I see how Nolan tried to convey the impersonality of war and insignificance of the individual but he did it with such a heavy, clumsy hand, providing us with no counterpoint with which to drive the point home. It's basic screen writing stuff really. I'd expect such ineptitude from a first year film student but not from a supposed ""master of the craft"".<br/><br/>But anyways, this could have been forgivable if the film was more about the event itself, but it fails at that too. After watching the film, you'd be given to believe that the Battle of Dunkirk was fought by three Spitfires (100 were lost over the beeches alone), 1 German heinkel, a couple of stukas, 2 destroyers or a dozen or so boats... Oh yes and maybe a few hundred men standing quietly on a beach, doing nothing except desperately trying to look morose and dejected in a faintly passive-aggressive way. It's ridiculous. We are talking about total and absolute chaos happening there, hundreds of thousands of rifles alone discarded on the beach, not to mention guns, artillery, trucks... Burning and sinking ships of all sizes all across the horizon, parts of beaches inaccessible from rotting corpses washing up with tides. This was actually way bigger than D-Day landings in terms of men and equipment stuffed in a very small patch of land. Half a million desperate men stuffed in a small town, bombarded incessantly and under constant attack from bombers. Where did all those people defecate, what did they eat ffs? I wanted to know that, really. That at least would have given some much needed humanity to the so-called-characters Nolan keeps yanking around like so much puppets. So many missed opportunities there...<br/><br/>If Nolan wanted to do a tight little film about isolation and desperation of being on the loosing side of the war, he had plenty of other places and battles to choose from. Just ask around. Or if he simply had to insist on Dunkirk, then we should have seen this total chaos all around our protagonists, in the background at least - that would have served as a really powerful, so desperately needed counterpoint to the individual suffering and heroism.<br/><br/>And this brings me to the final point. The movie is one tone only. A monotone repetition of sights and emotions we've seen and experienced before. No one cracks a joke. No one really breaks down. No one has an embarrassing moment. There are no ups and downs, it's just some morose faceless robots performing obvious actions leading towards a bleedingly obvious goal. One single emotional and narrative tone from the beginning to the end. The entire emotional and narrative content of the movie would have fit snugly into a 20 minute short, and that is pretty much how long it takes before you start yawning. The best thing that can be said about the movie is that individual scenes are well directed and worth experiencing. But that is the real problem here - the film is constructed as a series of impressive ""experiences"" rather than cohesive piece of drama (And this particular historical event is almost uniquely stuffed with dramatic opportunities. It's almost as if golden-age Hollywood writers wrote the script for the actual event.) In other words, it's a Dunkirk theme park rather than a movie. You take rides. And that's it. And even those become repetitive after a while."
"ferped","6","461","769","20 July 2017"," A visual wonder that lacks depth
","Christopher Nolan is a visual genius: this film is just stunning to look at. From the bullets flying near soldier's head to gorgeous explosions, it transports you right into the war zone within the first 10 minutes of the screening. Furthermore, it is an accurate description of the ""Miracle of Dunkirk"". This is where the movie nails it. However, apart from that, I've had a couple of issues with it.<br/><br/>The film is told from three perspectives: Air, Mole and Sea. This is where the movie falls a bit short. The editing at some points feels lazy and not very consistent: it cuts from a dramatic scene or intense action scene very quickly. <br/><br/>The film is told in a non-linear way: this makes us watch certain scenes twice through different perspectives. Although this could've been done in a very interesting way, it's very difficult to keep track of whose perspective we're watching at times. Even when certain semi-important (I'll get back to this later) soldiers die, it took me a while to realise this happened.<br/><br/>This is where my third and final problem come into question: the characters lack depth. You don't care about the main character, nor any of the other soldiers that are dying. If I'm watching a film about war, I like to bond with the characters I'm seeing on screen. If none of them show any real emotion, the viewer won't as well.<br/><br/>All in all, Dunkirk could've been amazing. I personally don't understand why it has such a high rating besides being directed by a very well-known director / starring famous actors (including infamous Harry Styles) / being a war biography. Disappointing."
"will-reed","3","313","529","28 July 2017"," Devastatingly Disappointed
","-Contains Spoilers-<br/><br/>After reading such amazing universal critical praise, my less than stellar experience of watching Dunkirk obligated me to write my first ever review on IMDb. I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan, in many ways I think he has truly changed cinema and how we experience film. I would go as far as to call him a visionary artist. This is why Dunkirk truly baffled me.<br/><br/>Let's think about the technical facts of the Dunkirk evacuation, it is said over and over in the film that there are 300,000 men on the beach. We see maybe 1,000. A mass evacuation this scale took hundreds and hundreds of vessels. We see upwards of 30-40. And the Luftwaffe was definitely assailing the beach, yet in the film we see a paltry 8 planes. There is something missing here, it's called ""scale"". This film has a complete dearth of it. And that is a shame and blaspheme to the experience of the true Dunkirk evacuation. <br/><br/>Beyond the obvious factual incongruities, there are glaring narrative holes. We have no connection to these characters, they seem cold and distant from us. There is no character development whatsoever in the film. I understand that Nolan was trying to show the entire character of the Dunkirk evacuees, but again we only saw a minuscule few hundred of what was supposed to be 300,000 so this argument is moot to me. We don't even get to see one Nazis either, so the ""grand villain"" that was forcing the evacuation was never even on the screen!!!!<br/><br/>The score and the sound design have been mentioned by many reviewers, and again I was so underwhelmed. There have been so many better films for both scores and sound design, too many to list actually. Yes, there is some stellar cinematographer, but we expect that from Mr. Nolan.<br/><br/>Finally, I've heard and read ""One of the best war films ever"" so many times now. Give me a break. There are many many better war films- Ran, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, The Thin Red Line, and Saving Private Ryan to name just a few. I'd suggest you rent or buy one of these instead of watching Dunkirk. I wouldn't waste my time viewing this film again. I hope Nolan's next film is far better."
"Geff","1","519","899","28 July 2017"," One of the most dishonestly over-rated films of all time. 1 of 10.
","Yes, awful. How can anyone honestly give this film a positive recommendation? It is so amateurish. Whoever wrote the screenplay forgot the story. What story is it! It's not about Dunkirk, the famous WWII evacuation of British troops from France. What about the French troops? The British commander says to hell with them. Two cowards are the focus of the story. They will do anything to get out ahead of everyone else who are patiently waiting, keeping order, and waiting their turn. One other is picked up by a civilian boat on its way to rescue troops at Dunkirk, and he fights the crew to not go back. He kills one of them. Great story? I figure they used 5 planes to make the entire film: three RAF fighters, one German fighter, and one German bomber, all classic planes. Why I say this is b/c they only show three RAF fighters in one scene, and then it's always a one-on-one with all the other scenes. The special effects are from the 1950's. I think they did a better job in Wings, 1927. Also, it's hard to figure out what they are saying. I missed half the dialogue, but I didn't miss much b/c it's so worthless a film. It's aimless, boring, pathetic, and cheap. There is nothing epic about this film. It's a sad joke. What a waste of my money. It's one of the most over-rated films of all time."

I found the continuous droning noise whose pitch increased during the film to what I hoped would be a fantastic climax, but I the drone included what sounded like whale noises and more boring droning noises with occasional sounds of gun fire. I was bored after 15 minutes, the ridiculous story of the kid in the fishing boat, the original bit about the spitfire pilots and the nonsense of the soldiers taking cover in the boat.....absolute shallow lazy boring rubbish filming.

"Cinnyaste","1","481","841","21 July 2017"," A Masterpiece (of Emotionless Boredom And Nolan Trickery)
","Crow the critics are about Nolan's latest, ""Dunkirk."" A stunning masterpiece say many. Masterpiece my ass.<br/><br/>Snookered by the hype and war film fandom, ducats were placed on counter, a ticket for admission passed back. Lights dimmed, anticipation mounted, and... nothing. Nothing. Save lurching between disparate, battle set pieces featuring people for whom little or no empathy exists. Lacking investment in the characters, what remains are merely adequate, bloodless war scenes easily outgunned by the recent ""Fury"" and, farther back, ""Saving Private Ryan."" For example, a young boy is killed but we know nothing of him, nothing of his motivation for climbing aboard a civilian, Dunkirk-bound boat at the last minute. We feel nothing for him because he's simply a cardboard cutout.<br/><br/>As the actors barely register emotion, boredom set in and not to be shaken off. The characters move as wind-up toys. There are few actors who bare their soul like Cillian Murphy, here a shell-shocked survivor. As directed, he sleepwalks with the depth of an amateur in a high school production. He's not alone. All the actors turn in measured performances with identical blank looks and monotone deliveries. Particularly wasted is the actor's actor, Kenneth Branagh.<br/><br/>Certainly the bravery and sacrifice of civilian and military in the Dunkirk evacuation is celebrated in ""Dunkirk."" Thank you. However, this historical action occurred in 1940. Films echo the zeitgeist of the time in which they're produced. It's an odd choice to make a large (bad) film about an evacuation three-quarters of a century past. There's a stink of political agenda afoot in ""Dunkirk"" that's intolerable. The enemy, unseen in ""Dunkirk,"" lurks and kills from safety by air and ground. Surrounded with backs to the the Atlantic, the very survival of a way of life is in question, as portrayed in ""Dunkirk."" (Spoiler Alert: The Allies Won The War.) The enemy's attacks are isolated like terrorism. The result is ""Dunkirk"" weaves a cautionary allegory mirroring religious extremism bent on destroying all non-believers.<br/><br/>Subtle propaganda is dangerous. ""Dunkirk"" fits that bill. Either that or Nolan is a complete idiot who hasn't a whit of sense. It's a toss-up based on a filmography including the lackluster borefest ""Interstellar,"" and the beyond inane ""Inception."" <br/><br/>Nolan remains static in his career with ""Dunkirk."" His films are half-baked, underwritten, detached, and emotion-free. ""Dunkirk"" plays like a rough cut by a bad director who expects the viewer to emotionally fill-in-the-blanks. ""Dunkirk"" even lacks the courage of its convictions in being bloodless - there are no graphic deaths. At least Spielberg had the courage to rub the viewer's nose in the stench of death in ""Saving Private Ryan."" The first half hour of that film is unprecedented in the depiction of carnage (one can almost taste the grit of raining sand from nearby mortar strikes). Nolan sanitizes-for-your-own-protection. Yet he chose a violent topic and punked out; a war movie detached from death is not a film about war. By design, war cannot include gratuitous violence, just insanity - an element also lacking in ""Dunkirk.""<br/><br/>The wall-to-wall dramatic, but mixed low, score loses its effectiveness and becomes annoying. And, the constant, ham-handed crosscutting between stories further waters this already thin soup by stopping a scene's dramatic momentum.<br/><br/>A short scene in ""Mrs. Miniver"" (1942) featuring civilian Walter Pidgeon returning from Dunkirk in his shot up runabout says more in the visuals and a few lines of dialogue about the evacuation than the entirety of ""Dunkirk."" As Trump might Tweet, ""Sad!"""

","Been traveling and away but just managed to catch it on its last week here. I made it, so exited when me and my son sat down...... then. Major disappointment.<br/><br/>How is it possible that it has been graded so high? So many mistakes that even my 14 year old son could find, History and Pilot nonsense etc.<br/><br/>The good, in short. Actors did a good job, but that is about it. <br/><br/>Then. Dunkirk was a major milestone during the second world war. The scale of it could not be seen in the movie. The soundtrack destroyed much of the overall feel and was annoying after awhile. Allot of noise to summarize it. The plot and suspense when soldiers were trapped in the fishing boat was ridiculous. I mean the boat was too heavy and one guy need to leave to make it float free, all while the boat was filled with more than 2 tons of water, really? And water kept coming in through bullet holes close to the water line but still with pressure that you could believe it was a submarine 20 meters below the surface. Then soldiers still manage to drown in the fishing boat. Allot of nonsense trying to get some nerve into the movie. This do not even belong in a B-movie, period. Then you have a pilot that can fly forever without the engine, even engage in enemy dogfight that he wins. He then do a flyby over the rescue flotilla (that could pick him up after ditching) but he choose to land on the beach to be captured by the Germans, what?<br/><br/>The pilot stand next to his plane and Giant gantry cranes are visible in the background. No such cranes existed in the 40s. For a time i wonder if there were a twist there in the end, moving in time or so, but no, the cranes kept showing in the background and Germans show up. By then i was hoping to move in time, about two hours back or so. Why i kept asking me, make such a bad movie on such a piece of history?"

F*$*. we are approaching the 2020's dammit - use some bloody good CGI as you clearly can afford it. <br/><br/>The movie fails to portray even a 1/1000th of the actual evacuation - there were +- 330 000 troops leaving and over 60 000 killed ( thanks Wikipedia) yet ... Nolan fails to deliver any inkling of that sort of magnitude. The Brits left behind 63,879 vehicles including tanks and motorcycles + 2,472 field guns .... holy s*$(. but do we see a single tank or gun ... maybe 5 trucks and tug boat --- woo ooh ... <br/><br/>also the ending is Horses excrement, climaxing with some stupid spitfire pilot who is SO worried about fuel, yet manages to fly around and engage bombers for the WHOLE FILM right up to, and after its engine stops ... SURE ... then it unbelievably swoops around with no engine (they obviously just cut the sound to make it look like the engine had stopped) and then swoops past TWICE along the beach and it is assumed by the plot that it engages and SHOOTS DOWN an approaching Stukka dive bomber -NO!

","I do not understand why this movie gets such good reviews when it does not reflect how it really was. Where are the 400,000 people? Where are all the planes, the boats? The big ships that are hit by torpedoes or bombs roll over to the left side right away and sink, quite strange. Then you have a spitfire that runs out of fuel at a fairly low altitude, yet it's flying around forever and shooting other aircraft down before it lowers the undercarriage and lands well on the beach. They have also added a noisy background sound that becomes quite annoying in the long run. A disappointing movie that's not worth watching at the cinema."
"darkjedi-56080","3","276","481","27 July 2017"," Oh no :(
","Let me say I really wanted to like this film. I avoided seeing the previews or any reviews so I could go in unbiased which is how I like to see all of my movies. I don't like to rubbish the hard work that people put into their films because I enjoy really well made films. But in short I really wish someone told me to avoid this one. I'm not one to follow the flow and praise something that is clearly so very bad.<br/><br/>The bad: The music\noise\soundtrack...whatever you want to call it was terrible. Just random esculations of horned instruments that build up and up and up to nothing. It was way too distracting and completely failed to build the suspense. I found myself looking around the cinema at the speakers wondering when the projectionist was going to realise he had accidentally turned the sound up too loud for the movie.<br/><br/>There is zero character analysis. Everyone looks the same and you cant distinguish anyone from anyone else throughout the film. It doesn't matter anyway because you don't have any reason to care about anyone in particular because there is no back story of anyone. The plot is flat dry and boring. Don't get me wrong it was based on an important event in history but this film does this no justice at all.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe is the lack of dialogue throughout the film. Was Nolan trying something new here? Probably but please don't do it again. There are shots of what are meant to be hundreds of thousands of soldiers all standing in lines on the beach all deathly quiet staring out to the ocean in most scenes. Even the terribly injured lying on stretchers are mutes.<br/><br/>So many scenes don't add any value and don't make any sense. The stupidity of trying to force a single 60kg soldier off a sinking ship to reduce the overall weight of a boat stuck on the sand? I mean really...who writes this stuff. The boat is taking on hundreds of litres of water and you want us to believe that one person will magically raise the boat off the beach? It's a head shaking moment that just makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a b grade made for TV matinée crossed with the overly long 50 yard stares reminisce of a bad episode of the days our lives. The Dad in the boat couldn't care less that his son dies. He almost seems content. The plane scenes are slow and boring. They show little tactics and make us believe the entire German airforce was fought off by 3 spitfires. And don't get me started on the spitfire that somehow manages to linger in the air long after its engine has stopped for what seems like an eternity. Some say that Spitfire is still flying around without any fuel to this day. As my mate said, he didn't have to land on the beach, he could have flown all the way back to London.<br/><br/>I heard the budget was 150 million. That's got to be a joke. There is just no way. Either that or the majority of the scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. You certainly didn't have to pay your actors for speaking roles.<br/><br/>It's such a shame. This movie has so little going for it. Maybe the editor was coming down off a week long coke bender when he put this together because I have no doubt I could have done better with the raw footage and a PC version of Adode Premier.<br/><br/>Wait for DVD release and a night when you are not really into watching a movie to pop this one in. You wont miss the atmosphere of a cinema for this movie because there is none to talk of. I apologise for being so harsh but I would prefer an apology from the director for killing my expectations. 3/10 is very generous indeed."
"jaymcr","1","523","932","22 July 2017"," Its official. Movies are no longer about telling a story.
","I am sure that the critics that write the reviews are paid shills because anyone who considers that movie to be a masterpiece has either never seen a war movie or is just taking money to lie to the public.<br/><br/>Dunkirk was more spectacular than 7 or so boats, 3 planes and less than 300 men in a line on a beach. <br/><br/>And whose idea was it to pay Tom Hardy a ridiculous sum of the budget to once again hide his face and never actually do what he is paid to do which last I checked was acting? It's obvious he was used in this movie to give it some credibility just like they did with the Mad Max debacle where he spent 3 quarters of the movie with a face covering on preventing him from speaking. <br/><br/>The noise was awful and apparently some of that noise was considered to be music! Dull bass throbbing in every scene.<br/><br/>Story? Lets not even go there. I can sum up the Story in one paragraph although you cannot really consider it a spoiler because there's nothing in this to spoil. <br/><br/>""Trapped on a beach awaiting rescue but the ships keep getting destroyed by dive bombers with only 3 planes to protect those ships. Ends with Hardy finally revealing his face when he is captured after landing his plane which has run out of fuel.""<br/><br/>That's it. Everything else in between is just noise. <br/><br/>To the people who consider themselves to be critics I say this: If you want the movie industry to become like the gaming industry where the main goal is most profit in shortest time regardless of the content then keep spouting the BS otherwise you need to start telling the truth for once. <br/><br/>Two hours of noise and it cost them $100 million to make? It's obvious where that money went because these so called movie creators couldn't even be bothered to use CGI to expand the number of men, ships and planes to really set the scene. <br/><br/>There was nothing in this movie and Tom Hardy was thick or corrupt enough to be used as the marketing tool. <br/><br/>Don't waste your money."
"kassdo","4","231","400","23 July 2017"," Disappointing film on such a worthy story
","A very big letdown for such a moment in history. Recommend wait for HBO. Editing was terrible posting a foolish timeline that made no sense, midnight in France/daylight in England at the same time. Hundreds of small civilian boats assisted in the evacuation, not the dozens on the screen. Thousands of Brit Troops standing in lines exposed on the beach for evacuation with no ships in sight, waiting. Everything from an odd random torpedo scene to the rescued troops getting pulled into boats, soaking wet in oil/seawater then getting off in England wearing dry crisp uniforms.<br/><br/>The best dramatic gimmick? A valiant RAF pilot flies over the beachhead till he runs out of fuel, but he still has time gliding to shoot down one more Hun plane. That creates that final (5 minute) moment in the film where he quietly glides across the beach, providing that requisite film shot of all the British stars watching, biting their lips with respect.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I am wondering why he is landing towards the German held beach? Then with all the emergencies on the plane (off course, landing gear won't come down) he continues to wear his high altitude breathing/comms headset? The plane lands, the pilot jumps out and stands looking at the dunes and approaching Germans. Now being filmed with the golden sunset lighting hue technique, we finally see the glowing pilot's face (IMO Tom Hardy, the best British Actor today) defiantly surrendering. You think they would have used real human stories from the event to tell the story... instead we get scenes created specifically for select stars who dropped by the set to spend the day shooting their lines. A wasted opportunity to tell an amazing story of how the civilian armada saved the day."
"alangilbert-23096","1","227","394","2 September 2017"," What a disaster.. the movie that is...
","Ever since the end of the second world war, the phrase 'Dunkirk spirit' has been used in Britain to describe courage and solidarity in times of adversity. However, this film chooses to focus on a young soldier who tries every underhand trick he can think of to get on board the rescue vessels ahead of everyone else. Where's the bravery or self sacrifice in that? Instead of identifying with this ""hero"" I became increasingly angry with him and had nothing but contempt for his actions. Why not push in front of everyone else by pretending to be a medic? Why not pretend to be a survivor from a ship that's just been bombed and sunk? Not only do you get priority access to the next rescue boat but you get a hot drink, food and warmth before your comrades left behind on the beach. I was actually happy that every escape attempt failed for this character. <br/><br/>It wouldn't be so bad if there was some dialogue to help us identify with Tommy's fears or motivation but the first part of the film is played out in almost mute silence. A group of soldiers walk through Dunkirk without any conversation or discussion of their situation. Thousands of soldiers stand on the beach waiting for rescue with no-one apparently talking to each other. I'm sorry but this is just unrealistic. But then it's equally unrealistic for Tommy and his comrades to have walked through a clean and rather modern looking town of Dunkirk where there is no damage to any of the buildings, despite the fact that the enemy (don't mention the Germans) are attacking the place. Freshly swept roads, clean windows and picture perfect sandbags for the French army to hide behind surely the filmmakers could have built a decent set to depict a war damaged section of town?<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has said that he wanted to avoid CGI in this film and opt instead for a realistic approach. Okay, CGI has become all pervasive in modern films (and some of it is downright cheesy) but there's surely no reason why it couldn't have been used in this film to create the illusion of more soldiers on the beach or extra boats out at sea. Trying to depict such a large scale and epic event as Dunkirk in a realistic and authentic way is virtually impossible without using some CGI.<br/><br/>The cinematic device of three different story lines being told on three separate timescales just doesn't work in this movie. The constant jumping back and forth between the different threads leads to some jarring continuity effects. One minute the sky is overcast, the next it's clear and sunny. One moment it's nighttime, the next it's daytime. It's a shocking mess.<br/><br/>Halfway through the movie I found myself shifting around in my seat feeling increasingly irritated and it wasn't just the misadventures of our ""hero"". I realised it was the background music causing my discomfort; a relentless, monotonous assault on the ears. War might be hell but this soundtrack isn't far behind. When the small boats arrive at Dunkirk, a stirring rendition of 'Nimrod' from Elgar's 'Enigma' variations is played, albeit played at quarter speed. Is this really counted as being an original music score as stated in the credits? Sadly the answer appears to be yes because Elgar's music is no longer under copyright protection. The fact that somebody got credit for writing this particular section of ""original"" music is absolutely shameful.<br/><br/>The clichés: when Tom Hardy's pilot has a problem with his fuel gauge and has to start making manual calculations on what fuel he has left, what are the chances that he will actually run out of fuel before the film ends? Well knock me down with a feather! He's run out of fuel. Gosh, I never saw that plot twist coming <br/><br/>The young boy who jumps on the small boat at the last moment as it leaves England, not realising (in his naivety) that it could be a dangerous journey. What are the chances of him being badly injured or even dying? Oh look he's dead. Surprised? Well only by the manner of his death and the lack of concern from the skipper of the boat when told of what's happened. <br/><br/>What are the chances that our brave Spitfire pilot (who's just ditched in the sea) is going to be rescued from drowning at the very last second as the water laps over his head? What a cliffhanger! Our small boat gets there in the nick of time to save the day! On the edge of my seat and holding my breath with excitement? Er, no. <br/><br/>Then we have that ridiculous ending. After shooting down an enemy plane (don't mention the Germans) Tom Hardy runs out of fuel. In an outstanding display of flying skills, our pilot extraordinaire not only manages to glide his Spitfire up and down the beach a couple of times but shoots down a Stuka bomber in the process before making a picture perfect landing on the beach as the sun sets. Why bother landing on the beach? He could have flown back to England in time for tea and tiffin. As the sun goes down he destroys his aircraft so the enemy (please don't mention the Germans) can't get their hands on it. Quite frankly a crash landing would have been much more entertaining and an appropriate epitaph for this sorry farrago of a movie.<br/><br/>Verdict? This film is a turkey."
"somf","10","489","877","17 July 2017"," Micro as opposed to macro version of the battle
","Saw an early screening tonight in Denver.<br/><br/>I don't know where to begin. So I will start at the weakest link. The acting. Still great, but any passable actor could have been given any of the major roles and done a great job. I know almost no more about the battle of Dunkirk after seeing the film than I did before, and I am not exactly a WWII historian. Truth be told, I learned all I know about the battle of Dunkirk from the movie poster. Does that weaken the film? Hell no, this is a film about survival. The opening scene tells it all and sets the stage as we get our first glimpse into a young soldier's need to stay alive, and his creative attempts to do so. That actor may even be considered the main character of the film. More words have been written so far in this review than he speaks. And I have no clue who the actor in that role is. It is humorous that Tom Hardy looks like Bane through most the film in the role of a pilot wearing an oxygen mask throughout. Kenneth Branagh is the only officer with any lines in the film, so that should give you an idea of the POV that we experience. We are the enlisted man trying to find a way to stay alive in a chaotic and harrowing battle. Though I believe Dunkirk will win every single technical Oscar, I would be surprised if it has any acting nominations at all.<br/><br/>How does Nolan elevate this above other films of a similar nature? I think he says it best himself, when he describes Dunkirk as a thriller more than a war film. He pulls that off superbly.<br/><br/>When a ship starts to take in water as numerous bullets penetrate its hull, I wanted to jump out of my seat and cover up the holes myself.<br/><br/>The film has three separate stories that are titled Mole, Sea and Air. And we all know where Moles live. The way the narratives of the three stories unfold and how they are all tied together is what makes the film a masterpiece. Much has been said about Nolan using IMAX film cameras and how the film is enriched by this. I don't know. I doubt I saw actual film being projected at my screening. Every frame looked terrific though. <br/><br/>So what is the most superlative aspect of the film? Gotta be the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer will win the Oscar for this without a doubt. So , so brilliant. This is not a soundtrack that I would buy at the store and play on my stereo. This is a soundtrack that weaves throughout the three narratives seamlessly and creates this phenomenal sense of tension. There are times when a two or three minute tense orchestral passage plays continuously as the story shifts from the ground to the sea then to the air and the music draws the three stories together. Zimmer's soundtrack reminds me of the way that Bernard Hermann's work was so vitally important in building suspense in most Hitchcock films. Though that description almost sells Zimmer short. His soundtrack is that good.<br/><br/>I don't think this is a film that will retain even half of its strength in your home theater. No folks, this is a film that you cough up for an overpriced IMAX ticket and rationalize it by knowing that experiencing Dunkirk in any other fashion will just not cut it."

"BiiivAL","8","161","279","5 June 2018"," Wars do not win by evacuation, but in this very salvation there is a victory © Dunkirk
","A talented boy named Christopher was not indifferent to cinema since childhood. His first ""home-movie"" he tried to shoot, barely ten years old, armed with his father's 8-millimeter camera. The main roles in the first ""movies"" of a small fan of the ""Star Wars"" were played by the toy soldiers donated by the father (unfortunately, the permanent companion of Christopher's film career, Michael Kane, at that time was ""intercepted"" by Richard Attenborough for filming in another war movie). Almost 30 years of persistent directorial work. 9 full-length films, each of which is not familiar with the rental fiasco. Total fees of more than $ 4 billion for all work and a ""loud"" name. In the age of glory sin can not remember youth? And so, in the jubilee project, ""Dunkirk"" - Christopher Nolan returns to his first ""director's"" experience - military history. Only ""soldiers"" this time - not a toy.<br/><br/>Taking your favorite 70-millimeter film, a lot of natural scenery (minimum digital recording and green screens, gentlemen, only old school), loyal comrades (Zimmer, Van Hiteim, Crowley, Smith), and got several working ""Spitfires"" and ""Messerschmitt"", Christopher says: ""I want to shoot a visually beautiful movie."" And in Dunkirk he did it in his corporate style - with the inherent color effects a la ""The Dark Knight"", the epic scenes of air battles, the sinking of ships and the endless ""bombing"" that look no less qualitative than the fall of Cooper in Gargantua or a scene with a wave in Interstellar. But this was clearly not enough. And Christopher Nolan proclaimed: ""More realism!"". Operator Hoyte Van Hoytem should not be repeated twice. He unhooked a 100-kilogram IMAX 3D camera from a suspended tripod and, in an old-fashioned way, took off all the ""ground"" scenes from his shoulder. Voila, ""Dunkirk"" becomes the first film where IMAX shooting was done ""by hand"" - the work received a lot of realistic scenes from the face of desperate British troops, filled with panic, Nolan confirmed the title of ""experimental film-maker"", and Van Hoite moderately missed the gym . Ideally.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" is a screen reproduction of the famous in the history of Great Britain operation ""Dynamo"". In 1940, nearly 400,000 discouraged allies (mostly British) were pushed back by the German army to the small French port city of Dunkirk, on the English Channel. In conditions of total economy of military resources, involving civil courts, Great Britain begins the largest rescue operation. Christopher Nolan offers us his vision of these events and gives us a chance to look at them from three angles. Firstly, from the air - on behalf of the pilots of the Royal Air Force, at all times seeking through the strait to help their associates. Secondly, from the sea - on behalf of the crew of a small civilian ship, which is also sent to Dunkirk to assist in the evacuation of the British corps. And, thirdly, on behalf of desperate soldiers, who are eager to survive and get home, at any cost.
Christopher Nolan, in spite of his fears, was inspired not by the Spielberg story of the salvation of Private Ryan and not even by Stoun's ""Platoon"", but (!) ""Nonstop action"" - ""Speed"" and ""Unmanaged."" The genre of ""Dunkirk"" smoothly balances between the ""vigorous"" thriller and worthy ""war-movie"", and the suspense - just off scale. In addition, the director immerses us in a non-linear narrative, saturated with flashbacks and endless action in the spirit of the film ""Remember."" We can observe the picture of the bombing of the shore from the land, and in a few minutes - the same scene, but already from the fuselage of the Spitfire.<br/><br/>A few words about music. Oh, the seventh was scorching. Hans Zimmer, are you human? From the very first minutes, the soundtrack began, which did not end at all until the final credits, alternating only its tempo. Due to this, ""Dunkirk"" looks in one breath, in the truest sense of the word. I do not want to go into a detailed description of the impressions - I just wait for Zimmer's music to be called the classics of the 21st century.<br/><br/>But fans of the deep ""Nolan"" story are waiting for the sad news. In ""Dunkirk"" the director, not wishing to go beyond the historical framework, relied on reliability and coverage. There is a minimum of metaphoricality, a minimum of a unique fantasy, a minimum of understatement with respect to the plot and a maximum of understatement with respect to the characters. Calling the main character (Finn Whitehead) by the name ""Tommy"" (if we collectively called the Germans ""Fritzes"", the Germans generally called the British ""Tommies""), Nolan seems to seek to ""generalize"" and project on his fate and feelings the experiences of all who was in this situation - to create the effect of an impersonal mass. All this reminded me madly Remarque and his ""On the Western Front without Change"" - a real war, without ""superheroes"" (and was it not for this that the ""eminent"" cast was slightly overshadowed?), Impregnated with despair, a thirst for survival and whistling bullets from an invisible enemy.<br/><br/>Caesar could simultaneously read one text and dictate another. Walter White - at the same time teach chemistry and ""cook meth."" Well, and Christopher Nolan damn well knows how to combine the position of a talented screenwriter and an unrivaled director. And, perhaps, he once again proved it.
""Dunkirk"" is the tenth, anniversary work of Christopher Nolan. ""Powerful"" historical film with an invigorating suspense and dizzying visualization. A minimum of digital effects, a maximum of material props and ""cardboard"" decorations - a balm for the soul for all fans of the ""old school"" of cinema. Unfortunately (or not), the ""genius"" of the play played to the detriment of the ""uniqueness"" of the script - the fans of ""Beginning"", ""Prestige"" and ""Interstellar"" will definitely wait for some disappointment. In all other respects, the signature handwriting of the master of a large-scale movie is felt in every minute of the time-keeping.<br/><br/>You will like this movie, ladies and gentlemen, rest assured. Enjoy watching!"

","If you read through the swarm of negative reviews, you might notice a common theme: boring, dull, lack of characters. It's incredibly disappointing that they seemed the miss the entire point of the film.This is not a film about heroic soldiers triumphing against all odds while blowing up Nazis with transformer-esque explosions.<br/><br/>This is a movie about scenes, not characters. -and every scene is memorable, from the bombings to the torpedoes to the aerial dogfights. My co-worker, who is obsessed with WW2 planes, noted how incredibly perfect they got the British Supermarine Spitfire from the roar of the Rolls-Royce engine to the rattle of the components in the cabin. The accuracy and intensity of the dogfight was captured perfectly as well, mimicking the aerial maneuvers, firepower and damage in a realistic and dramatic fashion. The torpedoes noticed only moments before impact with it's slow monotonous movement sent chills of realization down my spine. Even in the beginning of the film, the way in which the Nazi leaflets were presented gave you some glimpse into the panic and anxiety felt by those soldiers.<br/><br/>I felt the ""lack of characters"" was realistic and served the film as well. War is not about larger-than-life personalities with specialized weapons being bad-asses. It's about nameless and faceless soldiers facing an existential crisis, the possibility of randomized death, and how they can either respond with despair or hope.<br/><br/>If you want characters you can root for and a happy ending where the bad guy in vanquished, then there are plenty of movies for you. But if you want a small glimpse into the despair, anxiety, hope, courage, and will of the British WW2 fighters then there is no better film ever made than this one."

","For the majority of his career Christopher Nolan has thrived in surrealism, whether it be focusing on caped crusaders or unchartered space missions. So it's intriguing to see him return to a narrative steeped in realism, and grounded by its commitment to real life occurrences. The results are staggeringly impressive too, while the talented filmmaker maintains his creative sensibilities, crafting a war movie that feels distinctively his.When thinking about war films, it's very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan.You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those.<br/><br/>Naturally I was excited for the movie and I think most people were because we knew that it is Nolan's movie. From the opening shot of dunkirk you are in it and You are experiencing everything like you are there , there's never a dull moment or scene where characters sit around a campfire and say who you got back home no background stories. You don't get those kind of things in Dunkirk what you are used to see in war films yeah this could be a problem because you don't feel connected to specific characters and you are not connected emotionally but this movie is not like others there are many war movies and we have seen many similar things but this movie is not about individual it's completely about the event. It's about the evacuation like being in the middle of this horrific situation. According to my opinion When you are in a situation like this you don't say ""hey my name is.....what's yours where are you from - oh I thought we could have a conversation between all the bombs and planes firing constantly"" No this movie is in the moment and how Nolan show us the event It's what movies were invented for. everything on the screen look completely authentic there's never a moment that feels wasted. When I heard that it's only 106 minutes long I thought it should be 3 hours long movie but when I saw that it starts in battle and ends in battle I think it's perfectly made in one and half hour. And if you're expecting big arcs then sorry because sometimes in war people die alone and no one's there to comfort them or tell them it's going to be OK that's what make this movie so terrifying.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" tells the story of a group of allied soldiers from Belgium, France, and the British Empire. When they find themselves surrounded by the Germany army on the beaches of Dunkirk, the film follows the story of the evacuation of 400,000 during the early stages of World War II.boasting an incredible cast, Christopher Nolan allows his players to internalize the fear and emotion, and allow them to express it in the most aromatic and penetrating demeanor's. As Tommy, Fionn Whitehead makes an astounding mark in his feature film debut. With no true lead in the movie, his point of view is often a crutch for the audience to rest upon, as his internalization of the character is one of the film's most pivotal high points.It is gripping from its very opening moments, in which we see soldiers getting picked off by invisible snipers in the middle of the titular town as propaganda flyers shower from overhead, announcing to the British, French, Canadian, Belgian and Dutch troops that they are hopelessly penned in by the Germans.We are in the early months of World War Two.Christopher Nolan makes the decision to avoid all of this explanation, and to give us a Dunkirk that focuses on the personal experiences of the war by land, sea and air <br/><br/>The sea battle is also done very well from a technical perspective. We get a sense of the claustrophobia of being aboard ship, the shell-shock and the terror of a watery death, especially when combined with lit gasoline. I thought the acting was by far the best in this segment. I very much liked Mark Rylance's quiet earnestness as a civilian sailor sailing to Dunkirk with his son - the quiet communication between the two of them with glances - the profound sympathy toward Cillian Murphy's traumatised rescued RAF pilot. And the scene of soldiers drowning under a fiery sea is one of the most memorable and rightly horrific in the film.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is edge of your seat filmmaking. Can honestly say I've never seen anything like it.A lot of people were wondering about Harry_styles & unknown cast. They're all great but Dunkirk is not about any one solider. Also 'Dunkirk' is another brilliant collaboration between Nolan & HansZimmer. The way he mixes in a ticking clock with score is nail biting.DUNKIRK relies on very little dialogue.We all know what happened on that beach, but Nolan's take is worth visiting. Yes, DUNKIRK relies heavily on sound of an increasingly fast ticking clock to build suspense.Drop everything and go watch Dunkirk. It is an experience. Not a mere film."

","where to start ... WW2 ended over 70 years ago, so I thought it was the time to tell true stories about what happened back then, but I guess I was wrong, and the allies still need some sort of ego- boosters, where the Germans are portrayed as dumb with fighters made of paper. The movie is very boring and slow to be categorized under war genre, and you can see that clearly even on the faces of the actors ... 400,000 soldiers trapped on a beach, should be a movie scene that everyone will remember for years, yet all we saw were few bored soldiers standing in lines as if they were waiting for bathroom... the lines of people at movie theaters who went to watch this movie looked more crowded and alive than the 400K !! And where are all those civilians boats which everyone was talking about? I thought it was gonna be a huge fleet, yet they were no more than a dozen of them !!!! I am not gonna mention the background music as this was a disaster which needs a separate review by itself... save your time and maybe spend your money on buying any WW2 game which will be 100 times more exciting than watching this"
"sunraider","5","147","261","8 August 2017"," Bland, Boring, Revisionist Take on Dunkirk
","As a WWII buff (listening to ""The Longest Day: Music From The Classic War Films"" as I type), I had expected to be first in line when this film came out but I hesitated after reading initial reviews. While extremely positive, many reviews commented on aspects of the film, from the non-linear narrative structure to the choice of characters focused on, that left me feeling that I would not enjoy the movie. I finally broke down and saw it because of its continued box office performance but found it as lackluster as I'd feared.<br/><br/>Present-day WWII movies just don't hold a candle to the classics (All Quiet on the Western Front, The Longest Day, Bridge on the River Kwai, Patton, and my all-time favorite film, The Great Escape), nor even big-budget mediocre fare from relatively recent times like A Bridge Too Far or The Battle of Britain. There's way too much pretentious nonsense in modern war movies. Every filmmaker these days has to make a ""statement"" about the horrors of war, as if intelligent viewers weren't already aware of that fact. Therefore, instead of a good story with appealing and memorable characters we get one that focuses on ""the coward,"" because in the modern-day mindset, anyone who acts in war with dignity and courage and self-sacrifice is seen as unrealistic and somehow a dupe of the evil powers that be. <br/><br/>None of those characters was remotely interesting or appealing and the time shifts were totally unnecessary. In addition, the omnipresent music was a total turn-off. There was never any chance to actually hear the real sounds of war, which includes silence and the banter of soldiers trying to make the best of a bad situation. All told, this is the most-overrated movie I've seen in years. Thank God I have the classics on VHS and DVD."

","The evacuation of Dunkirk was one of the most important moments in history, and a pivotal part of WWII. This movie had the opportunity to express the greatness and the gravity of this event, and it failed. <br/><br/>The flyover shots of a few dozen soldiers on the beaches, when there should be ten of thousands, failed to express the enormity of the situation. Similarly the dozen or so civilian boats, when there should have been thousands, underwhelmed their contributions. The attempt to humanize the story by showing a few individual vignettes, in one case a single incident shown from multiple perspectives, also failed. <br/><br/>No one character was engaging enough to impress the tension or magnitude of the situation. In essence this movie made a momentous and terrifying event a little boring. In doing so, it does a disservice to those that have experienced combat."

","I can't understand how it can get 8.4 rating. Technically great, I mean, high level images and direction. But: first of all, why would Nolan add the past and future in all of his movies? I didn't find any empathy, emotions, with respect to other war movies. The final reminds me of the usual war movies made in US. And two actors as Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy, almost not showing at all.

I fully disagree. First of all it is a boring movie. I had two or three times the wish of leaving the theater. As a matter of fact, some guys did so. Second, is a quite illogical movie, regarding space and time. They mixed together time shifted events, and I just realized that reading the critics. Third is a type of horror movie in which the intention is to scare you. Why the sound is so loud? I had the impression Count Dracula would show himself up to bite some soldiers' neck. After spending and loosing 5USD with the ticket and regretting not to leave the theater before movies end, I realized that was the worst movie on WWII ever shot. I dare to say that is the worst movie ever shot about any war, not just WWII."
"awaisee50","9","274","517","18 July 2017"," The event that shaped our world...
","Few directors have such a reputation that the release of their new film is an event and Christopher Nolan is one of those and Dunkirk is certainly an event. Based on what had the making of a military disaster the Allies are cornered on a beach in Dunkirk with the Germans drawing in and massive Allied casualties followed by the invasion of Britain almost inevitable.<br/><br/>Initially focusing on one soldier, Fionn Whitehead, who joins the thousands of British troops trapped on the beach waiting to be evacuated the film opens out into three distinct areas, The Mule, essentially a pier where the massed troops wait to board naval ships overseen by Kenneth Branagh's naval commander , The Sea, which focuses on a small leisure boat captained by Mark Rylance and his two sons who cross the channel in their bid to help with the evacuation and The Air where spitfire pilot Tom Hardy and two other pilots attempt to shoot down various German Luftwaffe planes intent on bombing the rescue ships at sea as well as the troops on the shore line. Each story ties in with the other and Nolan's script cleverly shows the same moment from the three view points usually with a dilemma within each.<br/><br/>It's a credit to the cast that despite the paucity of dialogue all are uniformly good. Fionn Whitehead is a unifying thread throughout the film as he lurches from one life threatening crisis to the next. Rylance & Brannagh are stoic & brave each aware of the desperate situation they are in and poor old Tom Hardy, much like Bane in 'The Dark Knight Returns', spends the film with his face covered by a pilots mask with only his eyes to convey the ever worsening situation he's facing. Even little pop moppet Harry Styles acquits himself well.<br/><br/>Nolan handles all this brilliantly but what really takes this into another league is Hans Zimmer's music. Relentless, it compliments the action ratcheting up the tension to a nerve shredding crescendo. This is so brilliantly done that certainly the film feels like one long frighteningly real action scene albeit a true one. Nolan, together with Zimmer and his Editor Lee Smith, have put together one of the best Summer blockbusters this year made all the more extraordinary by having almost no dialogue but letting the pictures paint the scene. Shot in Imax 70mm its certainly worth seeing it this way as its immersive nature takes you headlong into the action which will have your heart beating as loud as anything in the film with its all too real explosions and its terrifying fighter plane engines screaming as they hone in on the exposed troops. If there's any justice at next years Oscars then Nolan, Zimmer and Lee should, at the very least, be nominated.<br/><br/>This is an extraordinary film of a moment that was far from the military's finest hour and though the soldiers are the first to admit that, 'All we did was survive', it's a tremendously patriotic film about the courage, not just of the soldiers, but of the civilians who selflessly took their own boats across the channel to rescue thousands and thousands of troops. This is a testament to the courage of the few for the many and is sure to feature in many top ten end of year lists and rightly so."

You don't see any German troops fighting. Even when they are in the boat all you see is bullet holes appearing but you don't see the Germans.

","...that movie was better than this. <br/><br/>I've seen plenty of horror movies... but not one has terrified me more than seeing this prime example of what Hollywood has come to now. The two hours of this film were just a disgrace of what a rich studio can do for a quick paycheque. <br/><br/>If Christopher Nolan wanted the audience to feel as shell-shocked and horrified as the characters in his movie, then he truly succeeded. I have never wanted to escape the situation of being in that theatre more than his characters wanted to escape that beach. <br/><br/>First of all, this isn't your typical war movie. There was no bloodshed, no gore, not even any real violence, which some might find refreshing. However, there was also hardly any dialogue and zero character/plot development...you know, things you would expect in a basic movie. <br/><br/>I wanted to care for the characters so badly, or anything that went on in this movie. But the scenes were either too dragged out, or they would cut out at odd times, leaving you with a general disconnect from what was going on in any scene. The only explanation for what went on was just in the form of incomprehensible murmurs from the actors. This movie was based on a heroic and honourable rescue mission, and if the audience was made known of this simple fact, it would have set such a better tone. This movie had so much potential. If Nolan focused more on plot development rather than aesthetics, this movie might've actually been worthy of the multiple Oscar nominations it is going to get. <br/><br/>To sum it up, this movie is basically a beautiful war-themed music video on mute. If you can appreciate that as a movie, then maybe you will enjoy Dunkirk. As for me, I'd rather watch worms hatch eggs than come anywhere close to a movie like this ever again."

There seemed to be many scenes that would not be reasonable, starting with two soldiers encountering each other in an isolated location: they would not silently go about their business without confirming each other's identity. I thought I saw a spitfire that had run out of fuel first fly right-to-left, then left-to-right to land on a beach in front of the Germans, descending in daylight and landing in darkness. There was so much confusion as to what was being shown, and such loud ""music"" that it was difficult to follow the story. The critics seem to love this movie. I don't know why."

","For grey-haired Brexiteers like me, weaned upon a diet of 1950's British stiff-upper-lipped-ness (BSULN), a modern movie re-kindling that - now long lost - spirit was surely a must-see. I hadn't been to the cinema in donkeys' years; put off not so much by modern movies (which are bad enough) but by audiences of ignorant huge-headed bag-crackling crisp-crunching gas-bags who came to ruin the whole experience. And with a comfy chair, big HD telly and unlimited Stella, it would take something special to prise me off the cushions and fork out over £13(!). <br/><br/>Well, if any word might do it; ""Dunkirk"" might. If ever a word conjures up notions of legendary BSULN - Dunkirk is that conjurer's word. <br/><br/>I have a DVD of the much cherished 1950's version featuring those grandees of wartime spunk, John Mills and Dickie Attenborough, not to mention a reassuring dollop of Bernard Lee. It's an excellent work from start to finish. Every aspect of the great debacle and culminating ""miracle"" is included and carefully edited into a coherent story, from home-grown civilian cynicism about the ""phoney"" war, the collapsing French defence, discussions at High-Command, desperate British regrouping, French refugees, mountains of abandoned logistics, slaughter on the beaches and final deliverance. It ain't no masterpiece, but it's a very coherent, sterling work of typically understated performances, representing people with sufficient depth that you can care about them and their fate; all re-created by character actors who actually experienced both the war and the times.<br/><br/>Cut to yesterday. This modern take on the great event is shallow in the extreme. Oh-sure; the combat scenes are visceral enough with sound levels fit to cause tinnitus, but coherent story telling? believable characters? An overview of the great historical event? Forget it! Considering the makers of this movie had almost unlimited funds and CGI, this should've resembled a Cecil B Demille epic. There were supposed to be over 350,000 allied soldiers trapped in Dunkirk! I swear I've seen more people in Tesco's at Christmas than are depicted here. The beaches seem practically empty. And those people to whom we are introduced appear two-dimensional, like cardboard cut-outs.<br/><br/>The ""collapse"" is depicted by about half a dozen British Tommies walking negligently through suburbs, evidently unaware of the war, only to be mown down. One survives and encounters the French rear-guard. That's it. Time for a crap on the dunes. They're deserted, so what the hell? After that, there's a series of small set-piece conflicts drawn progressively together by the choppiest editing I've ever witnessed. All the characters are two-dimensional and unexplained. There's no back-fill story at all. A quite disproportionate amount of time is spent aloft with the RAF. Three whole Spitfires are presented almost reverentially, as if they alone turned the military tide. They skirmish with bombers and fighters, shooting down all they encounter with one quick burst of gunfire. The last one, running out of fuel, gracefully lands on the beaches of Dunkirk, in mellow westering sunlight, as the strains of Nimrod from Elgar's Enigma Variations grind away at half speed. It's frankly mythologising of the most juvenile kind. I almost laughed. (And incidentally; that Spitfire was travelling northeast along the Belgian coast, so the sun would have to be setting in the opposite direction!)<br/><br/>If you're a millennial - the sort who wanders vacantly about the streets gaping into the screen of a mobile phone; someone with no more depth of character than those depicted here; raised upon revisionary history and brain-washed into being a bien pensant of the glorious European Union, this movie will seem as authentic as your friends on Facebook. But if you're of an earlier generation; you might want to watch the 1950's version at home, on the big telly, with the unlimited Stella. It's better in every way."

","We saw Dunkirk on opening night, I was excited, I'm a huge WW2 buff. The incredible human drama at Dunkirk has mostly been overlooked by Hollywood. So July 20 has been on my calendar for a while. Boy did I fall for the hype!<br/><br/>I must say something positive first... great war footage! I loved the spitfires! Knowing that Nolan shot this move with only a few post effects is impressive. The scenes inside the ships were fantastic.<br/><br/>Now, onto the sad truth as I see it. I wish the producers would have spent some of the $150 million on a script. I didn't know you could shoot a historical period movie with a steep budget and not have one. It's as if this was just a big historical re-enactment of the Dunkirk rescue and the film crew said, hey, we should grab a couple of decent actors and throw some cheesy lines at them, we'll make a movie! There was an old-timer from the business that once told me, ""if you've got a great story you can shoot your movie thru banjo strings on black & white film"".<br/><br/>I got the impression that Nolan was hell-bent on shooting realistic war footage and he fell in love with those shots and scenes, forgetting that the audience would appreciate a plot. There are so many interesting plot twists from the actual event. We never really saw anything from London, France or Germany where most of the strategy was planned. Nolan focused on the beachhead and the channel. The realism was quite good, but too long and confusing.<br/><br/>The sound track had many problems too. The mix was hot, if you wanted to listen the sparse dialogue, good luck. For some reason the director chose to loop this maddening drone sequence throughout the movie. It was so obvious it had to be intentional. I was hoping the version we saw was just an advance copy with a rough mix, nope. One last thing, I'm not sure the average movie goer will appreciate the way Nolan repeated scenes. Apparently the footage was so good from 4 different angles we should show all of them, back to back. <br/><br/>I get it, great film makers take chances. There have been many examples, especially in the indie- film world of masterpieces that tried risky new techniques, sadly, Dunkirk isn't one of them.<br/><br/>To wrap this up... I'm glad I saw Dunkirk. I think most WW2 buffs will see it no matter what anybody says."
"liam_robertson","10","244","469","20 July 2017"," An absolutely outstanding depiction of a truly horrific event.
","I am always relatively confident that I'll enjoy the work of Christopher Nolan based off his pretty decent track record, however this gripping re-imagining of one of the darkest moments of World War II stands as not only some of Nolan's greatest work but one of the greatest war films I have ever experienced.<br/><br/>Dunkirk does not necessarily tell the story of any one particular character, but rather adopts the event itself as the films vehicle, resulting in an experience which uses its characters to portray the event rather than the event to portray its characters. This is presented through scenes taking place at different stages of the evacuation across the land, air and sea, creating a distinctive setting for each, but culminating in the same final conclusion. This being said despite Dunkirk's focus not necessarily being its characters, I did not find a single character performance in this film lacking or inconsistent with the tone or setting presented technically. In particular Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance and debut actor Fionn Whitehead gave especially memorable performances consistent with the striking spectacle Nolan presents. <br/><br/>As is expected with Christopher Nolan's films the visual presentation in Dunkirk has few rivals, the set pieces are outstanding with the use of breathtaking establishing shots to highlight the true historical scale of the real life evacuation. Action is presented in a smooth focused manner utilizing a few precise shots rather than an explosion of two second jump cuts we have come to expect in modern day action movies. There are multiple sequences which portray the pure fear, claustrophobia and disorder present in those final weeks of the evacuation and it is this ever present tension that will keep you engaged for the entirety of the run-time. <br/><br/>However it is the sound design which truly made this production a masterpiece for me, delivering one of the most realistic representations of the terrifying sounds of War. Gunfire had a distinctly different tone to other films, being delivered with sharp crack, explosions where accompanied by a deep base and the famous 'Jericho Trumpet' made by the Stuka's presence be constantly reminded and portrayed the sense of helplessness present at Dunkirk perfectly.<br/><br/>This is only enhanced by Hans Zimmer's excellent soundtrack embedded across the entirety of the film. Alongside Inception, Dunkirk showcases the exceptional talent Nolan & Zimmer have for combining meaningful score with striking imagery to create a distinctive emotional response from their audience. Through the skillful incorporation of an ever presenting droning base, screeching guitar strings and ticking timepiece the continual sense of urgency and dread felt by those both on land and sea is enforced across the entire film by this excellent soundscape. As a result I highly recommend that should you be given the chance you experience Dunkirk for the first time on the big screen, as the combination of a cinema screen and encapsulating surround sound will leave you with a truly memorable experience. <br/><br/>Even though this is a film a majority will go into undoubtedly knowing the final conclusion, Dunkirk is an experience I highly recommend everyone consider, presenting a defining moment of modern history in one of the most technically accomplished and memorably striking ways, Dunkirk will undoubtedly go down as a hallmark in film-making for many years to come."
"Brandon_Walker_Robinson","9","186","354","17 July 2017"," Nolan may have earned himself some high accolades come Oscar season
","No reviewer was lying when they said see this in 70mm IMAX (full disclosure, I saw this on a regular screen). In my opinion, it necessitates it. I can just ""tell"" from what I saw. The aerial shots alone would provide good reasoning for it, but the sound that those theaters provide with the big picture in front of you will captivate you exactly the right way.<br/><br/>This isn't a social kind of film, and it certainly isn't popcorn entertainment. Not a summer blockbuster at all. This film's scope feels very small, even though it carries epic tones within. Nolan really broke a lot of traditional film conventions with this, and I think that exact kind of ambition is what makes this movie work for a more general audience. I somewhat think audience members need to know what they're getting into beforehand to be accepting of that fact, but once they are I think they will be just fine.<br/><br/>On a technical level, I think this is Nolan's best yet. The Prestige still might get higher honors simply because of the more demanding writing that is involved, but given what Nolan intended to do, this nearly screams ""perfection."" Did he try and go for an R-rating? No. Did that matter? Not even close. Did he try and provide massive amounts of character development? No. Did that matter? Depends on who you talk to. I could honestly say that if there were two cuts of this film—an extended cut that develops the characters and this one—you could give us the option and we would find the one we enjoy more depending on what we're looking for. Did he look to vilify the Germans to the point of controversy? No. Did that matter? It didn't, but only one part does stick out for me (the ""one flaw"" that Nolan often has trouble with in his writing) and I'll get back to that in a moment.<br/><br/>""Harrowing"" is easily my favorite word to describe Dunkirk. This is a survival film, and that's all it is. He put us on the beach, on the sea, and in the air. He gave the characters a want and will to live with an impending threat for which we understand its consequence, without need of showing thousands of deaths or lots of blood. When one moment of attempted survival ends, another one begins without warning. That doesn't mean the film is relentless action, but it certainly is relentless tension, if for no other reason than Hans Zimmer's score. I'm telling you right now, his score is my favorite part of the film. It's actually mostly a quiet kind of score, but it is frightening and works with the film so very well.<br/><br/>Nolan has had a lot of trouble doing ""show, not tell"" in his past films. This time he has learned a lot, not letting the actors expose everything (acting was fine all around, by the way... not much to say about it honestly, as it's not the film's high point). I did not feel the presence of the surrounding enemies, though. If the film didn't tell us about it, I probably wouldn't have felt the pressure of getting off that beach sooner than later. Hearing the planes incoming was always scary of course, but as we only had the British perspective and a week-long time line at most, there simply wasn't a chance of feeling time cave in on them. This to me is this film's only real flaw.<br/><br/>That being said, the only real limitation that holds this film back is that it's based in reality, which means that we are already aware of the outcome. I think for this particular story it's fine, because it's not one specific moment that lets us breathe again... so letting it play out the way that it did is okay with me. I do not think this will go over with people who come in completely uneducated about Dunkirk. I made a mistake in stating that I wanted this film to educate me on the evacuation story. I think I'd rather have learned about it first and then seen the film, kind of like seeing United 93 after having lived 9/11 (not totally, but I was at least cognizant of all that transpired). That doesn't mean to research the film itself, but rather just the historical event.<br/><br/>I do hope that Nolan goes back to fictional work after this. Here was an awesome deviation from the norm that he chose to do, and he went out in grand style. I could have used a longer film with fleshed out character development, but this film also works as well especially in the month of July. I see this receiving many Oscar nominations such as score, editing, cinematography, visual effects, etc... I do not see any acting or writing awards... and yes, I see a director nomination as well. If the academy believes some of those earn him victories, then god damn it give him his Best Picture Oscar as well.<br/><br/>I can't really yet rank this film with his other films, because it's just so different. I don't see too many of the Inception parallels here. Every film of his outside of Insomnia either does nonlinear or intertwining storytelling, but this one is without the cleverness involved in the script. It's just playing things out as they do. Survive. So to revisit, I believe this may be his best work yet, even if I don't know if it's my favorite of his. I really just want to put this in another category from other films entirely, in which case it's my favorite of ""that kind of film.""<br/><br/>My heart is still pounding from this film. I simply cannot wait to see this in 70mm IMAX on Thursday."

","After enduring this film I was blown away to discover the critical acclaim for this movie! Not to mention the IMDb user reviews! This movie took me to a whole new level of bland. To take one of the most significant events of World War 2 and turn it into THE most dull and bland cinematic experience of my life. The film was woeful. I have never been so detached from the characters in a film ever. I'm thinking the entire script would be lucky to fill more than a page. Not to mention the action. We have around 400,000 men needing evacuation. But it looked like a couple of thousand. There was no scale. The action was damn stupid from start to finish. Did they hire an expert? Hell no. I'm an ex soldier and that is not how any of that action sounds. Not to mention the cruddy no stakes PG 13 action. Did a main character just die? No idea. The editing was so terrible. And who cares if a character dies. There's no character development. So there's nothing to invest in. What a mess."
"CalRhys","Null","235","454","21 July 2017"," Nolan's Perilous Masterpiece That Never Lets Up!
","Christopher Nolan. That name alone has the star-power of an acting giant. A name that once heard, turns the heads of an audience, whether it be a superhero movie, a science fiction epic... or a war drama, a typical moviegoer (even those less cinema-savvy or those who lack the traits of a ""cinephile"") will instantly be attracted to his movie at hand. We saw this with 'Inception', we saw this with 'Interstellar', and now we're seeing this with 'Dunkirk'. And my God, what a film it is. No film is truly flawless, but if a war film comes close to it, it's Nolan's new epic that does so.<br/><br/>We've seen the tale of Dunkirk undertaken several times on screen before, whether back in the 1950's or during that stunning and sweeping shot in 'Atonement', but none have come close to the realism, the grittiness and the intensity that 'Dunkirk' bestows upon the audience. The tale of a retreat that was seen as heroism, wait what? Yes, you read that right, the retreat at Dunkirk became one of World War II's greatest tales of heroism in the face of adversity. How Churchill had asked to ensure that at least 30,000 troops made it home... that number instead came in at a steady 300,000, and not just British soldiers. French, Belgians and some Dutch, it was a tale of spectacle that truly required an honest account from an auteur capable of bravura direction... well that auteur is Nolan.<br/><br/>We're all now used to Nolan's use of non-linear storytelling, and once again he utilises his famed formula to stunning effect, with three stories, each from the land, sea and air, all focusing on a different time frame, but effectively intersecting throughout. Our three heroes are newcomer Fionn Whitehead (land), Mark Rylance (sea) and Tom Hardy (air), each providing near-flawless performances. Lacking of actual dialogue, the sequences instead thrust the audience into a world of visual splendour and build the narrative through the use of sound and peril, the haunting and deafening sounds of diving Stukas, the ripping roar of the Spitfire's engine and the sudden silence, building to impending doom. The sound is this film's highlight, with Hans Zimmer returning once more to unleash yet another stunning score. Now, the cinematography, well what can I say? Hoyte Van Hoytema, take a bow, the imagery is both stark yet beautiful, its gritty yet serene, its claustrophobic yet sweeping... it's utterly encapsulating, from the opening shot, it draws you in, it takes you to that beach, it places you in the thick of it, and all the while avoiding the sight of the actual enemy in person, they're just lingering, unseen to the naked eye.<br/><br/>One side note that I'd love to delve into is Harry Styles, wow what a shocking achievement. Alike Heath Ledger as The Joker, Nolan has turned an unlikely cast member into someone of true talent.<br/><br/>In the 17 years of cinema-going during my life, I have seen some truly amazing movies, some that completely stunned me, many of which have been by the director at hand, including a fantastic IMAX experience of 'Interstellar', but never before have I left the cinema so awestruck, so silenced by the intensity of a movie. 'Dunkirk' isn't a typical movie, it isn't your typical war movie, this is more, much more. This is a film about the prevalence of heroism, the prevalence of Britishness, and how fear can strike drive and willpower into a human entity. This is a visual masterpiece, it is more than a movie, it's an experience, and one that should be witnessed by all!"

","After many great reviews I decided I would go and watch this on the big screen for the atmosphere and in that at lease I have to say it was great. But and it is a big but, for a story I left feeling let down. This is no saving private Ryan or stunning epic as the critics would suggest. <br/><br/>I am no history buff and I am from the other side of the world but even I know the story of Dunkirk and this just didn't live up the epic nature of the true story. <br/><br/>The characters don't do the story justice, the timelines are blurred and the epic nature is missing. There are some great visual scenes and a few uplifting moments but it just didn't feel tied together.<br/><br/>My rating is probably a bit harsh but I just don't rate this a one of the great efforts of story telling. If you didn't know anything of the actual events at Dunkirk this would leave you having missed the epic nature of what was achieved with 700 private boats over 8 days back in 1940."
"Humphreywashere","1","40","68","29 July 2017"," This movie is not about Dunkirk
","If you are interested in or have knowledge of World War II history, don't go to see this movie. If you have family in the armed forces, and/ or like 'saving private Ryan', similarly avoid this movie. It will annoy you, infuriate you, bore you. It does not inform or shape your understanding of what happened at Dunkirk. It is gratuitous labelling. The story is about something else, something I can't be bothered considering, something 'arty', something glorifying cowardice when there are soldiers of caliber all around. I went to see a movie about the astonishing evacuation at Dunkirk. I got something else that was cheap and nasty and insulting."

"zeki-4","7","178","342","19 July 2017"," Dunkirk: The Disney version.
","""The best world war 2 movie to date""? Really? As a guy who have been brought up on ww2 movies, I had to attend the first showing. Especially since there were so many ""best ever"" headlines. So there I went.<br/><br/>This movie is one long action sequence that stretches 106 minutes. But if you deduct the number of times that the exact same situation is shown, but from a different camera angle at another time in the movie, it barely passes the 60 minute mark. And after Hardy shoots down his fourth German plane, a stuka divebombs for the fifth time towards the beach, or Branagh looks up in the sky for the 7th time, it gets repetitive. <br/><br/>This actually felt like one long teaser prologue to 'Battle of Britain'. (If the rumors are true that Ridley Scott is doing his take on Battle of Britain, all I can say is: get busy!)<br/><br/>In 'Dunkirk' there's almost no dialogue, no conflict between any of the characters, no character development at all and the enemy is completely faceless. So this makes it a rather forgettable movie for me, unlike 'Hacksaw Ridge', 'Saving Private Ryan' and many of the other great world war 2 movies, that show war like it is: bloody. 'Dunkirk' is rated PG-13, which will sure please all the young Harry Styles fans. <br/><br/>In retrospective: The 5-minute Dunkirk segment (all shot in one take, an available on You Tube) from the movie 'Atonement' still makes a much larger impression to me, than I think Nolan's first (and hopefully not last) world war 2 movie forever will be doing.<br/><br/>But besides that - what Nolan (and collaborator Hans Zimmer) always do really well however is to create suspense, and there are some real nailbiting scenes in there, which make the ticket almost worth it.<br/><br/>I left the theater disappointed, though. Expected it to leave a larger impression. It didn't. <br/><br/>If you would have preferred 'Titanic' to be a movie that started right when the ship began sinking, 'Saving Private Ryan' to be all about the Omaha beach landing, and 'Braveheart' to be all about the battle of Sterling and Fallkirk, you don't mind cardboard characters, and you often find yourself muttering ""when do they get to the action-part?"", then 'Dunkirk' is definitely for you. For people who enjoy movies for emotional context, also: be advised that you won't find it here."
"Danielpotato","8","164","314","22 July 2017"," Christopher Nolan created an impressive blockbuster on World War 2, with the focus on survival.
","The most important lesson in the history of our humanity, surpassed in genre, religion among other moral aspects, is simply the survival of the species or a human being in question. Our most basic instinct is survival and when we unite, forgetting our differences (as a group of Individuals, not nations), for the sake of our survival and our well-being, the human race shines in the most intense sense possible. The cooperation between several elements, to come out alive from a complicated situation. <br/><br/>One scene, caught my attention when a group of Allied soldiers were surrounded in a ship and this same ship was being attacked on all sides by the German troops. One of the characters was being forced out of the ship to see if the tide sea was rising or not. Out of fear, this character did not want to leave the ship, it was when an English soldier replied: for the others to survive, one person has to die.<br/><br/>The theme of this film is survival, especially surviving in a difficult situation, is in itself a great victory<br/><br/>Nothing is better expressed in this film and executed in a way with as much talent as Nolan achieved in making with this film. Not only by itself, the message is passed to the audience in a clear and perfect way as is demonstrated in small scenes that help convey this message and build a fitting end to the film itself.<br/><br/>The film goes straight to the narrative and action of the movie without losing in passing with interesting monologues, unlike Inception, a film in which Nolan himself created a character with the sole purpose of explaining the rules of this universe for the audience, this is the apex of Nolan as a Film director and he performs his work in a simple and exemplary way. So Dunkirk is his smaller commercial movie, but with the bonus without unnecessary scenes that could crumble the experience of the film.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent and accompany the director's talents (the direction of the film itself) and the script in a cohesive, simple and direct way, highlighting Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance and of course the very competent Kenneth Branagh. These excellent actors help immerse the audience in the cinematographic aspect of the movie itself to make the experience as real and emotional as possible.<br/><br/>Again, congratulations to Nolan for choosing actors relatively unknown to the general public, but outstanding in their work of acting. Instead of trying to choose famous actors (whose private lives are always in the mouths of the people and the magazines), these people are celebrities and not actors. For this reason I never managed to pass the first act of Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg made a mistake filling his film with the most popular Hollywood All Star cast of famous actors at that time (their lives were so exposed that it was hard to see those people as soldiers or survivors of WWII). At this point, Nolan fared better than Spielberg.<br/><br/>By completing this great experience, special and sound effects are applied in an exemplary way and these same technologies make almost perfect use of the IMAX screen. The technical and aesthetic aspects are very good, as it comes this habit in this type of film with this type of budget (105 millions). The cinematography is very good (almost perfect, like in most of Nolan movies) and the camera movements are agile and very beautiful.<br/><br/>See the aerial combat of the characters of Tom Hardy (Farrier) and Jack Lowden (Collins) in aerial planes that looked with great and amazing beauty in fighting against the planes of the Germans. A technical amazing work of Nolan and his production team. Amazing, no doubt. Especially on the IMAX screen, where the film shows all its beauty, and if there is a movie that deserves to be seen in IMAX, it is one, this new work of Christopher Nolan, no doubt. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works. Making the storytelling move to viewers in three different locations (The Mole, The Sea and The Air). In a cohesive, precise and confusing way. This film shows a great talent of Nolan, and it reaches his talent to create sequences in parallel assembly the characters of the film in a brilliant way. The soundtrack composed by the veteran Hans Zimmer is amazing, Hans in turn creates a memorable theme for the theme of World War II. Fantastic and great.<br/><br/>The great and only problem I see that disturbs the experience of the film is limited by the PG-13 and thus limit the blood and violence, for God's sake, it is a film about a war blood and violence are common. At times it seemed like I was looking at some scenes and these same scenes seemed so artificial and displaced from the film itself, like the scene of the soldiers corpses coming to the beach, or the English troops being smashed by the sinking ship (two clear examples that PG-13 influenced negatively the movie).<br/><br/>One problem that some people go through seeing this movie is the lack of depth in some characters, however there are characters with depth, but not the kind of depth shown through dialogues or exposition. Nolan wanted to show something bigger. And I think Nolan did it. Nolan created in this movie to show the question of survival and its consequences in the lives of the people close to war and the soldiers who were fighting in that war. He wanted to show us how and survival define us, and I think he got the message very well across this movie. Even for this, he sacrificed some dramatic depth. Depth for certain characters, however Nolan passed a larger message, which surpasses any dramatically deep element. Nolan wanted to get something bigger. And in my opinion he did it."

"jchs","1","94","174","30 July 2017"," Some of the reviews on here are fake/paid for
","Average Movie. Nolan has made a bore with interstellar and now this one. There is no story what so ever. Just soldiers on an island and soldiers in a plane. No plot or anything. Just two hours of soldiers on a beach. Since this movie is based on true events, how did the movie not have a plot? Instead of wasting your money on this go to google images and type in soldiers on a beach or soldiers in a plane. There I saved you 15 bucks. Loud and annoying music that wasn't needed. Hans Zimmer will try to use his music to have you thinking this movie will get intense but it never does.<br/><br/>Another thing to note is most of the reviews on here for this movie are fake. I am constantly on this website and within the first 24 hours of the release of this movie there was already 100s of reviews posted. No other movie will have that many reviews that fast. Chistopher Nolan must of put some of the movie's budget into hiring people to write reviews. Planet of the apes came out a week before this and that only has 50,000 votes. This movie already has 115,000. Don't believe me? then check for yourself. Either half the audience had permission to watch the movie before anyone else or Nolan hired 100s of people for fake votes. Nolan is falling fast after his Batman Trilogy and he is an overrated director.<br/><br/>1/10."
"CBallmail","1","98","182","14 August 2017"," Ruined by its soundtrack.
","What a disappointment! <br/><br/>The worst part was the tooth rattling and incessant background bass beat that seemed only loosely related to the equally deafening and incessant score. More intrusive even then the ridiculous soundtrack in Gravity during the destruction of the space station in airless space, the beat and the score in Dunkirk drowned out what limited dialogue and atmosphere was present in every scene of the movie, even trespassing a bit on the hammy and over-extended scenes with Kenneth Branagh (no real loss there, I guess). When you can't hear the Merlin engine of a Spitfire from the cockpit, then you know there's a problem. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, what can you say about Spitfire whose fuel and ammunition lasted forever, and whose terminal glide seemed even longer than that, and yet somehow apparently ended in the timely destruction of a Stuka mid-dive bombing?<br/><br/>I cannot fathom the positive reviews this film received.<br/><br/>It wasn't even that impressive as a spectacle. Where were the masses of abandoned equipment and materiel? Some stacked crates right at the start, and a single anti-aircraft gun?

"jb07-660-944395","4","107","200","22 July 2017"," A Mess
","Once again the curse of Written and Directed by the same person strikes again!<br/><br/>From the very start, we watch well trained (from my own knowledge of history - this movie provides no background), British troops run down the middle of the road when fired on. Even untrained troops must have the instinct to seek the nearest cover of a door or alleyway?<br/><br/>The bland music is annoying, and was probably done to save time and money on background sound effects which would have added so much more to the drama.<br/><br/>After bombs are dropped onto the crowded beach, soldiers die, but you hear no wounded crying out for help.<br/><br/>The British Spitfires, while recreated extremely accurately, appear to have limitless ammunition.<br/><br/>The time shifting is totally confusing. One moment we are watching a scene in bright daylight, the next it is night, then back to day again.<br/><br/>What confused me most was when one pilot watched his wingman ditch, then he proceeded to shoot down a German bomber, after watching it in his rear view mirror for a while? Why would he do this? Why wouldn't he just turn and shoot it down?<br/><br/>A little later we go back in time to be with the pilot ditching. He then struggles to get out of his plane, but is eventually rescued. A little later, he watches his wingman shoot down the bomber! Are you kidding me? Unless his mate had been circling above, and given the time frame from the previous scene, the bomber should have been shot down whilst he was still trying to get out of his downed plane, and it would have happened miles away from where he was rescued.<br/><br/>Rather than provide a sense of the magnitude of Dunkirk, the film would have you believe, until one of the last scenes, that only a few large and small ships and boats took part. It doesn't show the lines of men in the water up to their shoulders waiting to be picked up. It doesn't even give you a sense of the time frame of several days.<br/><br/>Indeed, the ships shown look too modern to be early Second World War destroyers.<br/><br/>For those reviewers calling this the best war movie ever, I'm guessing this is the first you have watched.<br/><br/>Now go see Band of Brothers, to see how a real war movie/TV series is done.<br/><br/>Then see if you can find the original movie Dunkirk, starring John Mills, because although rather slow in places, this movie is still so much better than this new attempt."

","From a different viewpoint as this author walked down 101 floors of the South Tower on September 11. Worked for Aon and came away with not PTSD or dust-health problems (I was far uptown when the towers came down). So as I sat watching Dunkirk, the cummulative effect was to virtually relive aspects of THAT day for me. It's impossible to describe horror, fear and what it was like to BE there, or BE at Dunkirk. Many films and books (fondly MRS. MINIVER was the first). Or the heroic dogfights of BATTLE OF Britain. This one - far different. I came out of the theater feeling that I had just been through not only Dunkirk but 9-11 as well. It is THAT effective. The lack of dialogue for a good part of the film draws the viewer INTO the story as a real participant. YOU'RE THERE. Spielberg did it a few times such as the 20 minute Omaha Beach segment of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but even that film became just a more intense version of the standard war film.<br/><br/>Be prepared to have your life changed by this one.

"Imme-van-Gorp","7","31","52","12 May 2018"," Very interesting movie.
","Dunkirk is a war movie that shows three different storylines that sort of come together at the end. Every storyline follows a certain individual in a certain situation. This makes it so that you can really see what happens during an event like this for multiple different kinds of people. It brings you closer to what's happening instead of a main character or something.<br/><br/>The first storyline is on land and is mostly played by Fionn Whitehead, Harry Styles and Aneurin Barnard. It follows an inexperienced soldier (Whitehead) who is just trying to find a way out of Dunkirk, just like every other soldier at the beach. He then picks up two soldiers (Styles and Barnard) along the way who he stays with for the rest of the journey. I think the best thing about this storyline was the constant fear you felt for what could happen. Something I found really good was the chemistry between Whitehead and Styles, I think the best parts from this storyline were whenever Styles got on screen.<br/><br/>The second storyline is in the sky and is mostly played by Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden. It follows two pilots, who sort of witness all the horrible events from above, while trying to help as much as they can. I think I least enjoyed this storyline out of the three of them, because it felt very unpersonal and I wasn't really impressed by anything that happened during these parts. The best thing about this storyline must be Tom Hardy, since his acting was, as always, on par.<br/><br/>The third storyline is at sea and is mostly played by Mark Rylance, Barry Keoghan and Tom Glynn-Carney. It follows a man, a son and a young assistant going off to sea to try and save some of the men stuck at Dunkirk. I was very impressed with Glynn-Carney's acting during his parts and I very much enjoyed it. I think this has to be the most emotional storyline, because you get closest to these three characters out of the whole film, but one might argue that it is also the most boring storyline, because there isn't that much fear that anything will happen to them."
"medcolpa","4","134","257","20 July 2017"," A monotonic and essentially dull film
","I saw the film at the BAFTA screening in NYC on 18-July-2017. I went with some trepidation as my father was at Dunkirk (and my mother's first husband was a RAF pilot who was shot down during WW2). Much to my surprise I found the film rather boring. The vast majority of the action is extremely repetitive. The British soldiers trying to escape are continually thwarted in some way by water, holes in the hulls of the boats, followed by lots of swimming, standing/sleeping on the beach waiting for the next chance to do the same thing. This frustration is inter-cut with two other main story lines (not really stories, and that is the problem). RAF Spitfires coming over the Channel to help. Finally, the heroes of the rescue, the plucky small boats from the south coast, sensibly represented by one craft with three crew. The reality is this is film which we know what happens, as this is a historical truth - many soldiers are rescued by the small boats (I ticked spoiler in case you do not know this!). The inter-cutting of the latter two story lines with the soldiers is filmed is a poor way. First from a technical point of view - the no continuity of lighting. I know the weather is highly changeable in the Channel but the same scene is at once brightly sunlit, then cloudy, then grey, then sunlit within seconds. This happened so much that I wonder if they did it deliberately. Secondly, there is a slight historical non-linear telling of the three stories as they intersect. The idea is obvious to see the story from different points of view. But why? It is not as if the view points generate fundamentally different moral perspectives. However the core problem is there is no real narrative in the film. We do not get a chance to care in any way about the characters. This truth in stark contrast to much much better films about war. The simplest example to point to is ""Mrs. Miniver"", a truly great film about war and, as it happens, Dunkirk. There are many reviewers giving this new film 10 with 'greatest war I have ever seen'. With no narrative and scene scene showing the same thing, it cannot be. Other great war films: ""The Grand Illusion"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Full Metal Jacket""."

The civilian boat flotilla numbered a half dozen borrowed from the London Maritime Museum , CGI was needed badly...I cant believe I wrote that!<br/><br/>Also scenes kept repeating themselves,like the movie was stuck in a loop ( going cheap again using one day aerial footage) Two Spitfires against two Messerschmitt Bf 109's escorting a bomber trying to make a bomb run on a tugboat,trawler or small freighters must have been reused 3-4 times. A lone war museum Heinkel He 111 lining up like a pregnant fat duck seems rather suicidal even with Mr. Bean manning the ack- ack or is WW2 now in the mythology/fantasy realm & Nolan must not be critiqued while misusing the last flyable HE111...probably as not to tear off the wings doing fancy maneuvers & upping the price tag of this Turkey to $200 Million . <br/><br/>Plus that annoying music to camouflage the reuse of the footage was pure trickery & was getting blatant in the middle,even the lone CGI of the Stuka dive bombing the pier was reused many times with the music blasting in the foreground ...the same with the overturning Grey tugboat & swimming extras. <br/><br/>Nolan's soldiers seemed hauntingly bored & extremely selfish (Putting to much of today's persona in a movie is not a good thing) The somber cowardly Lion characterizations made the British retreating army an army of fools with the French soldiers looking on with grim contempt as the Brits throw them under the bus ( E.U blow-back propaganda even infects Dunkirk) The antiquated ""Hold the Line!"" isn't what one hears from today's metrosexual British males & it reflects badly in how one perceives history in today's age.The Brits at Dunkirk were climbing over each other backs to get out ...that is how I perceive Nolan's Crayola Kindergarten scribbles to be & not Churchill's heroic histrionics with his empire on the line.<br/><br/>Now since WW2 is now a distant memory with half of millennial iPhone humping narcissistic dolts rather clueless about anything concerning reality of historical placement, the story/movie did an awful job of explaining Dunkirk in the grand scheme of things . How many movie goers later Googled Wikipedia 'WW2' for an explanation of the Battle of France? ... not many if I know my fellow citizens. Nolan could have exchanged the Spitfires & Messerschmitts with the Millennial Falcon & X-Wing fighters I doubt any of today's citizens would have noticed nor cared.<br/><br/>The Germans (Nazis) were shadow figures & the explanation of why Hitler paused in pushing the Brits into the sea was brushed off like so much sand... Adolf was a cunning diplomatic in the first year of the war & Churchill didn't bite the Carrot while Adolf halted the tanks letting the Brits vacate without being massacred mercilessly while awaiting England come to terms(But that is politically incorrect to question motives or think outside what is acceptable .. now back to Star Wars sequel #9)<br/><br/>In conclusion the movie left me empty just like the sands of Dunkirk & any residue interest in 'WW2' was latter replaced by me digging through the closet looking for a dusty VHS copy of ""The Bridge to Far"" & reminiscing /realizing how far Hollywood has sunk & now sucks."

","I like war movies but I certainly didn't like this one. I feel the title is wrong because it's not so much about Dunkirk as its about some blokes who where there at the time.<br/><br/>Sometimes it was hard to follow which moment in time is shown, because the movie abruptly cuts between three perspectives, therefore even showing some events twice. I hate this - Repetitive: Much scenes are identical or slightly different from another. Flight scenes was like WHO cares. Keeping out the Germans at the front-line is just as much a part of the story of Dunkirk and it would've given us a chance to actually see the enemy and get some awesome battle scenes.<br/><br/>This movie is highly overrated, due to many biased Nolan fans and critics. I found it a very boring movie. The lack of an interesting plot or any interesting characters sadly wasn't compensated enough by the impressive audiovisuals. Rescue yourself from boredom and don't watch this movie!"
"elsephen","2","78","144","21 July 2017"," Save yourself the time: Just watch the trailer.
","*Please understand my rating is to compensate for the absurd amount of high ratings this film has gotten based on what I suppose is mere hype and anticipation. Because nothing in the film is more interesting than a silent WWII Documentary. <br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of Nolan's work. I was excited to see his latest in Dunkirk. It may be the worst film he's made. And I think- if you place any director with half the notoriety on the bill... this movie gets a 7.0 rating at best. But. With Nolan's name attached, people decide it's a masterpiece before viewing it- and they wouldn't change their opinion after.<br/><br/>There's no story. There's no character worth noting or caring about. There's no way to know what exactly is happening in many of the scenes due to the choppy editing... and every character seeming to be from the same clone-machine. (seriously- how many dark-haired guys with the same haircut can you squeeze into a single casting?)<br/><br/>It's monotone, it's repetitive, it's essentially the same scene for 2 hours... and that'd be fine if something notable happens- but it never does. There's never a moment where you care. Never a moment that hits you in the form of empathy, suspense, etc. It's essentially like Nolan wanted to play with a few boats, planes, and do it at the beach... and he filmed it. <br/><br/>It's been a long time since I've ever looked away from a screen and twiddled my thumbs wondering if something was going to happen or if it would just end if not... but I caught myself looking around the theater often. If I had a watch, I would have checked it. <br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>About the only notable moment that SHOULD draw some sort of reaction from audience members, is an extremely odd scuffle on board where a boy falls what looks to be 5ft to the floor below... and somehow loses his eyesight, somehow seems on his deathbed, and then dies... None of it makes sense, and the execution seems lazy and forced at the same time. The dad doesn't care. The guy responsible doesn't really care. The brother seems to care... for about 10 seconds. This part could have been cut from the film completely and wouldn't change anything. Much like a lot of the film. <br/><br/>The film is essentially the trailer... over... and over.... and over again. Even Hans Zimmer, who is usually brilliant, completely misses the mark on this one. He's trying to force suspenseful sounds and noise where the film simply doesn't match up with action. <br/><br/>How do you show the harshness of war while basically showing no one in pain? The closest thing we get to that is a few people drowning- but is flooding the real nightmare of war? You'd think so. It's truly the only fearful antagonist in this film. Water. And how many times can we watch soldiers stacked in bundles stare up at the sky, seemingly as bored as I was watching them, only to have a few water-balloon efficient bombs fall around them? <br/><br/>The editing was all over the place. Continuity issues everywhere. Daylight one second- dawn the next, back to daylight... the cuts would randomly shift to another area of soldiers that look exactly like the previous... sometimes in repeat scenes (which wasn't consistent enough to read), sometimes in time shifts... and none of it is really justified other than Nolan stroking himself to the millions he suckered everyone for here. <br/><br/>Possibly the most boring film I've seen in years. Incredibly disappointing effort by Nolan. <br/><br/>OH! Positive: It's pretty. For about 30 minutes. Then you're pretty tired of watching the monotone screensaver'esque takes that never seem to vary, with no contrast."
"dufourbenoit","3","129","247","17 August 2017"," No more than a good TV historical drama
","Is this a scam, or has the capacity to be critical been lost due to the very sensitive and emotional subject of the film. For me, it seems like a joke... How could this momentous and dramatic event in our recent history be presented with so little means and ambition ? From books and historical reports, the boarding was a mess, planes were all over the sky, there were myriads of boats and ships, the beach were left with tons of discarded equipment and weapons... We see none of that. How can you give an idea of what it must have been with only a few sparking clean vintage planes, one small war ship, 12 period fishing or leisure boats... How could so many shots taken on site incorporate 1960's, 70's or even 80's buildings, street furniture, modern container cranes... How can it be night for the scenes at sea, and day for what happens on the beach, in Dover, or in the air at the same time ? How long can a spitfire fly after it has run out of petrol, and still manage to fight... For those who like history, it is a waste of time. For those who like action and war scenes, it can be watched but will be a disappointment For those who seek emotions and a peek at humans behaviour during the event, there is reasonably good acting, in a good British drama tradition. I suggest to wait for one year and watch it on TV where this show belongs."

"Dunkirk1958","1","66","121","23 August 2017"," An Insult To Those That Served.
","Reviews claiming this movie ""greatest WW2 movie"" are an absolute nonsense. ""Dunkirk"" barely qualifies for the genre. <br/><br/>* There is zero land combat between Allied and German forces portrayed in the movie. There is no depiction of tanks, artillery or infantry engaged in hostilities on land. There is a dozen aircraft and ships from the era and what looks like a cast of a few hundred. The movie does not deserve its title. It is in fact an insult to the memory of ""Dunkirk"", the professional British Soldier, Seaman and Airman, the civilian and merchant crews of the rescuing flotilla, the population of Dunkirk - to all those souls from both sides of the conflict present at Dunkirk late May early June 1940. <br/><br/>* The 2 main characters are cowards. There is a repelling creepiness about their relationship. They don't look or act like professional British soldiers orderly holding on for evacuation rather they act like a pair of modern gender fluid sis males desperately trying to return to their safe space. This is the central story and it is about these 2 cowards deserting their post and using every trick they can think of to push in front of everyone else including the wounded to get aboard a ship home to safety. They even throw their rifles away not long into the movie the gutless scum. They deserved a court-martial sentence to be shot for the selfish, cowardly desertion of their comrades. <br/><br/>If the Allied soldiers had acted this disgracefully the defense and evacuation of Dunkirk could never have taken place and the war lost. <br/><br/>* A ""shell shocked"" soldier is rescued at sea by a civilian boat crewed by a middle aged gent and two teenage boys. This soldier flies into a rage demanding the boat steer immediately to England and not onto Dunkirk to rescue more men. In this rage he pushes one of the boys down a hatch to a lower deck where the boy strikes his head and dies thus committing murder. However, on return to England he is metaphorically slapped on the back and told ""not to worry old chap you are shell shocked so killing innocent people is totally expected of you. Don't you worry yourself we will lie to the authorities and the boys family so you never face justice. Now off you go and have some fun.""<br/><br/>* The disgraceful behavior of cowards and and the unlikely, unpleasant murder of a boy are deemed more worthy to depict than the inspiring stories of heroic courage and mateship displayed by the highly trained and experienced professional soldiers these men were. Brave men on the outer defenses and town fought desperately to ensure their comrades safe evacuation. These men knew they faced two possible outcomes - death or capture for the wars duration. The soldiers evacuated would have swapped places with their mates defending the beach without a thought. The movie should be about their valor not the shameful cowardice of deserters or the unlikely actions of a soldier claiming ""shell shock"".<br/><br/>This is perhaps the most over hyped disgrace of a movie I have seen. It is a shameful disservice to the men that fought at Dunkirk and the brave men in tiny boats that came to their rescue."
"vincent-malisse","4","70","129","23 July 2017"," I wish they evacuated me from the cinema
","With high expectations (it is a Christopher Nolan movie after all) we entered the cinema. With even higher disappointment, we left it. Dunkirk was two hours of the same over and over and over again building scene after scene with tense music only to leave the scene again without any climax. It was a confusing mix of scenes that failed to show the overall picture. If you like war movies, there are far better movies out there.<br/><br/>The movie started out right and you're thrown right in the middle of the action and sitting on the edge of your seat you expect the movie to dive right into a great story, but then it stops, the climax halted, the story does not really develop and you're left with a feeling of missing something. The entire size of the evacuation (which should have been enormous) is completely missing. The dread of leaving in time because the Germans are breathing down their necks is absent and the scenes often jump to different time frames of the evacuation process. In fact the only Germans you see in person in the entire movie appear in the very end.<br/><br/>The acting was OK and so were the different characters put in place: you have your heroes, each in their different way and you have your cowards, also each in their own different way. The cinematography was pretty well setup.<br/><br/>Despite a huge potential in possibilities, Dunkirk did not convince me and I feel left stranded on the very beach they tried to escape from."
"thomhoanghmt","1","96","182","24 July 2017"," A shallow, pathetic attempt to depict a war scene
","This movie is so bad that we had to leave the cinema before it finished. It is merely a shallow attempt to depict the ""moment"" and nothing else.<br/><br/>Content wise it offers no insight into the historic context, nothing. There's no dialogue, no story line whatsoever. If the intention of whoever made this movie is just to focus on the ""moment"", the state of being trapped of the soldiers then it also fails at that. For example, there were some efforts to portrait the mental state of the soldiers but dare I say it was an insult to those who fought in the war. What was being portrayed was mostly fear, the British soldiers depicted like a bunch of pathetic cowards, some was even tactically cheating to get on board, or accusing their fellow soldier of being a spy henceforth should get off the boat when it gets too heavy. Of course it's understandable to be desperate when you're in between life and death, but seriously what about other mentalities of the other hundred thousand soldiers? I cant help but thinking just play the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan on loop and you already have a much better result than this.<br/><br/>Lookwise, it is so off putting. They said there were 400,000 soldiers trapped in Dunkirk but throughout the movie, you only saw a few boats and planes. Fair enough if they don't want to use screen effects to keep the realness, but then why alternate the colour of the whole movie to that omnipresent teal and orange look? It is too overused that some scenes don't even look real. <br/><br/>The city in the opening scenes looks just fine and nowhere near like it's been at war, the high rank soldiers' uniform was flawless. The soldiers' faces look well fed and slept except some dirt on their face. <br/><br/>In many scenes the composition of the frame is repeated in the same way: the camera was positioned below skyline so the frame was dominated by the sky and the beach, in the middle were silhouette of the soldiers, running across or. If this is the only way to portray the state a of being trapped then it shows a very very poor imagination. <br/><br/>There's only so much left to criticize but I'll leave it here. For me this is the worst movie I've seen, also it's disrespectful to take such subject too lightly."
"John K.-2","1","40","70","19 August 2017"," Bleak and hopeless.
","If you enjoyed the last twenty minutes of Titanic, then this film is for you. If you liked the bleak vision of humanity that Christopher Nolan portrayed in The Dark Knight Rises, you might like the atmosphere of this film. If you want a generic war-is-hell and survival is matter of chance film, you may well appreciate this.<br/><br/>If you remember Dunkirk as a victory snatched from the jaws of defeat; as a near-miracle when for a full day a storm grounded the German air force in Flankers while the Channel was as calm as a millpond; as a day when sixty German planes attacked four hundred men on the beach and inflicted no casualties; as a time when men were buried hastily but with military honours rather than being allowed to lie dead on the beach; then this film does a huge disservice to the truth. <br/><br/>Finally a note on accuracy. The film may look right but it is missing almost any detail that might bring hope into the situation. The images may be accurate; the atmosphere is more appropriate for a film about a concentration camp."

","The first thing I heard about this film was some moronic SJW uproar about ""lack of diversity"" aka too many white people in the film and not enough women or people of color. The leftist lunacy never ends. This made me want to support the film even more, so I rushed out and watched it. Sadly, I found the film incredibly flat, devoid of much power amid all the amazing scenes, cinematography and effects. It seemed to lack...direction, or perhaps it was bad editing, but unlike other recent war flicks like Hacksaw Ridge (which was great save the meaningless love angle) Dunkirk was just not very compelling. It was like watching a series of scenes which looked great but had no cohesion as a complete film. Also, the soundtrack was freaking horrible. More annoying than suspense building, the repetition of the ""music"" did nothing but make those scenes less dramatic."

","2 hours of nothingness. No characters, no story line. Just some planes flying in the sky, a some ships, and boats with occasionally scattered dialogue and a few bombs here and there.

Terrible, terrible, terrible."
"uhsheen","10","108","208","17 July 2017"," This movie was so rich, so detailed and so profoundly moving that it's hard to put it into words. Christopher Nolan is back and he's here to show us what a master can create.
","This review will be mostly spoiler free but I don't want to be banned so I clicked it just to be safe..<br/><br/>The basic plot revolves around the 450,000 odd British soldiers trapped in Dunkirk, France as the German troops close in. They don't close in on foot though, instead opting to pick the trapped soldiers off from the air and sea.<br/><br/>This movie isn't a propaganda piece touting the glory of British resilience; most of the movie is just young men trying to survive, petrified for their own lives. The threat is ever present, there was a wonderful sense of tension throughout the entire movie. You really felt the cinema shake as the German planes closed in on the soldiers and let loose their bombs and you can feel the thick fog of fear.<br/><br/>The enemy in this movie is very interesting because you never actually see a German face. The enemy is just a looming threat and comes in the shape of torpedo attacks and bombs from planes. I read that Nolan spent a lot of time studying silent films and how they built tension which is pulled off masterfully in this movie. Like the movie Gravity once this movie begins there is no down time, they are constantly being attacked in one way or another.<br/><br/>The casting for this movie was absolutely superb. Our very own Barry Keoghan had a short role that I would liked to have seen fleshed out more but he pulled it off very well. Cillian Murphy was wonderful as always and played the role of a shell shocked soldier. Mark Rylance stole the show for me and put on a stellar performance as the father who is doing his duty to his country. His bravery never fades. Fionn Whitehead and Aneurin Barnard were excellent choices and I liked how Nolan chose largely unknown and inexperienced actors to mimic how young and inexperienced the soldiers really were during the war.<br/><br/>When I heard that Harry Styles was in this movie I figured that it was just a clever ploy to pull in more ticket sales but I absolutely stand corrected. He put on an authentic, honest performance that was very impressive. There's a great scene in a boat where you see how he is affected by desperation and sheer terror that really sold it for me, his performance was extremely consistent.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is a chameleon... Any role he plays he is completely dedicated and immersed and you can't peel your eyes away from him. He has some of the most nail biting scenes and his scenes toward the end of the movie were very emotional and moving.<br/><br/>Strangely enough some parts of the movie felt like watching old WW2 footage; it was grainy and real. This movie didn't rely on CGI, it was gritty and honest and beautifully shot.<br/><br/>You really can't talk about a Christopher Nolan without talking about Hans Zimmer and the soundtrack. There were some scenes that were reminiscent of the docking scene in Interstellar because the music flowed so well with each scene that it evoked a sense of urgency and intensity. This is a phenomenal soundtrack. The movie starts to a ticking clock and it's only a matter of time until time runs out.<br/><br/>There is very little dialogue in this movie but it isn't missed at all. This movie is an emotional power horse. I was genuinely moved a couple of times throughout it and it's one that will stay in my head for a long time.<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/><br/>Casting was perfect, the lesser known actors held their own weight against some of the veterans. The cinematography was fantastic, you really felt completely immersed in the movie. Hans Zimmer's score was Oscar-worthy. The movie will leave you on the edge of your seat throughout.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/>The story line is not always linear which was confusing. Dialogue was sometimes hard to hear (but not necessary)<br/><br/>_______<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a fantastic movie, it's as simple as that. This should be the standard of movie that other directors should attain to achieve and here Nolan proves that he is one of the greatest directors of all time. The acting is superb and the entire movie is a treat for the eyes and ears. Don't miss out on seeing this in a cinema."

","It's amazing how hype, a vastly overrated reputation, and a jackhammer sound score can mesmerize some naive souls into believing this wretched exercise is some kind of masterpiece of avant-garde filmmaking. If Saving Private Ryan rates A+, Dunkirk rates a D–.<br/><br/>The stage is set with a clumsy repetition of introductory titles (rather than briefly showing the lead-up to Dunkirk) before jumping into one of the main ""character's"" retreat to the beaches. I say ""character"" because, like the others, this guy is a cipher — there is ZERO characterization in this film. All are about wooden as the masts on the private yachts — might as well be animatron mannequins populating a haphazard stitching of action sequences devoid of any narrative structure (avant-garde or otherwise). Any halfwit with a budget and some CGI can stage engrossing battle scenes these days, but Nolan's random montage generates no real suspense — this is masked over with a relentless, buzzsaw sound score designed to get your blood up and compensate for the film's glaring faults — it doesn't, unless you're a Brave New World drone conditioned by the Feelies.<br/><br/>Implausible motivation: the shell-shocked soldier rescued by the private yacht revolts against going to Dunkirk, actually killing one of the young crewmembers and then we cut to yet another redundant Spitfire/Heinkel/Messerschmitt engagement. Back on the yacht, what has happened? Has the mutinous soldier commandered the yacht? Are the captain and his son outraged by the murder? NO! There's nothing here — no requisite emotion, no resolution to this ""drama,"" nothing but close-ups of deadpan faces, another problem with this turkey — like the old 70mm epics (How the West Was Won), IMAX is not the medium for close-ups, yet Nolan gives an over abundance of 100-meter ECUs! And what little dialogue exists in the film is lame, mumbled and almost unintelligible.<br/><br/>Perhaps worst of all is how he bungled the dramatic rescue by a flotilla of private boaters — the core of this story. We could have had Churchill's appeal, the humble yeomen assembling on the docks with a mixture of trepidation and courage — instead, the boats suddenly appear all at once, deus ex machina, at the beaches, with no depiction of the rescue at all.<br/><br/>I suffered through Dark Knight Rises and the 3-hour torture fest Interstellar (the most ""intelligent sci-fi film since 2001: Space Odyssey"" NOT!), and I will never endure another Nolan mish-mash again! They say he began making films at age 7 — he is still a callow, indulgent juvenile with a camera, big bucks and dismal mastery of cinematic art. I pity the poor souls who misconstrue his efforts as some kind daring Orson Wells/Maya Derren innovation, but there's no accounting for masochism."

People who are rating this movie with 10 stars, are either been dumbed down by studios in the last 20 yrs ... or the reviews have been bought by the studios for marketing reasons. <br/><br/>It seems to me like Nolan wants to be a 'serious' film director now, and wants to get noticed by the academy. The superficial heroism of military and war by all these movies are really annoying and stupid. Seemed like Nolan got inspired by Mel Gibson, here. <br/><br/>Good for Tom Hardy tough.

","The evacuation of Dunkirk was a miracle. I had wondered what this film would have to say about it that hasn't been shown before. The beach scenes are portrayed as lines of soldiers standing quietly. There are no non-coms screaming orders or keeping order. Everyone is acting like they are waiting for afternoon tea. Air battles: repetitive. The same yellow-nosed Bf-109 gets shot down several times. (Yawn!) And the timing of the air scenes is simply unbelievable. In an effort to create suspense a Heinkel 111 takes nearly five minutes to get close enough to be shot down by a Spit. This is despite closing speeds in excess of 500 mph. Just not believable. Other efforts to create suspense are simply contrivances. The crowning disappointment is the main kick: the miracle of Dunkirk was the response of hundreds upon hundreds of small boat owners, ship owners, ferry crews....ordinary Britons who risked their lives to get anything that floats across the channel to rescue the troops. This is given short shrift, not only in following only one boat, but in so few boats actually being in the film. I don't understand the hype this film has been given. Wait for it to come out on DVD, then don't bother to see it."

","Make no mistake, from a technical perspective Dunkirk is an absolute achievement in filmmaking. Shot in portion on IMAX and completely on film, it's a visually gorgeous movie with breathtaking cinematography of dogfights in the sky and battles at sea. The sound effects and mix are possibly the best I've ever heard in a film! The gunshots are and loud, frightening, and realistic and every scene with a plane closing in sounds as if it i flying right above the audience making for an all the more immersive experience. And as always, Hans Zimmer delivers another excellent and powerful score that is one of the best I've heard in a film in quite sometime.<br/><br/>Yet, Dunkirk makes the same mistake that many technical and visually impressive films do, it forgets to give us any reason to care about what's going on within it's craft. Nolan has made a film that is strictly about the event that took place and has chosen to tell it in an unconventional non-linear structure with three different areas of the event taking course over the span of a week, day, and hour. By within a few minutes dropping us into all the chaos unfolding and not stating the structure aside from brief ""One week...etc."" cards in the very start, it takes a little bit of time to fully grasp the way the story is being unfolded and difficult to get into during the first act with things moving at such a quick pace . The biggest issue with Dunkirk though is that there is nothing to get invested in. I'm debating whether to even say this movie has any characters because none of them have any depth, personality, or background. This is a film where we are suppose to be rooting for the survival of these people, yet aren't given any reason to care about them other than the fact they are soldiers fighting the enemy. As the film progressed, I found myself not wanting to see where the actual story would progress, but instead hoping that there would be something else I could appreciate visually or technically to keep me from losing complete interest.<br/><br/>Another big issue is that Nolan desperately wants this to be a grim and horrific portrayal of war. However, this is difficult to do when the film is restricted to the boundaries of a PG-13 rating. This is the perfect example of a film that needed an R rating to fully be effective in what it was trying to do. Take films such as Saving Private Ryan or the recent Hacksaw Ridge in which the battle scenes become borderline horror films due to not just their suspense, but brutality and graphicness. Not that Dunkirk needed to be a Gibson gorefest, but it's portrayal of war feels all too tame and can't deliver on the level of suspense that's built up in the scenes proceeding it.<br/><br/>That isn't to say the film isn't without tense scenes, one in particular where soldiers are hiding in a ship that is being shot at for target practicing is particularly nerve-wrecking as well as the climax and the ending are also very well done. As for the acting, there isn't a bad performance here, but with little dialogue or much to do other than look frightened the cast isn't given a lot to work with to show off much. Tom Hardy's role could have been played by any other actor and it wouldn't have changed a thing which can be said for most of the cast here.<br/><br/>For a film that has openly taken pride in how experimental, unique, and going against what is norm in Hollywood, Dunkirk ends up being exactly what Nolan has been criticizing. It's a complete exercise in spectacle that's trying to get a pass with it's unique style and filmmaking techniques to excuse it's lack of depth and emotional core. I can appreciate Nolan for taking a different approach to a war film and it certainly showcases his talent as a director, but just because it's different doesn't automatically make it good and without any real depth, characterization, or emotion only further provides evidence of his weakness as a writer. If the film had been trimmed down to 30-40 minutes and released as an IMAX feature it would have been much more impressive, but the film itself is an empty exercise in technical achievement that's in it's own way a new breed of cynical filmmaking."

","Gushing reviews and hype led me to believe this was going to be an amazing war film. So many people compared Dunkirk very, very favourably to 'saving private ryan'. Many rave reviews 10/10 'the best war film ever'& 'Nolan masterpiece' etc.<br/><br/>First things first, this film bears absolutely no comparison to 'saving private ryan'. Dunkirk is not fit to be mentioned in the same breath as Spielbergs masterpiece.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan is deservedly a classic war film that can be watched many times.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is (at best) mediocre. Watch once, unremarkable and quickly forgotten, vastly overrated and over-hyped. <br/><br/>We went expecting greatness, (which we were led to believe was this film) and left, as I heard a fellow member of the audience state on leaving, ""thats 2 hours I won't get back again"".<br/><br/>It's yet another of those Hollywood offerings, a clapped out ford escort disguised under a 'ferrari body kit'. From outside it looks good, but once you get in and drive, it's a clapped out ford escort.<br/><br/>Enough of my disappointment:- <br/><br/>The film shows the British/French military disaster of Dunkirk, where the British expeditionary force and thousands of French troops had retreated to Dunkirk, as conquering German armies swept across France using 'Blitzkreig' tactics.<br/><br/>The only hope for those at Dunkirk was evacuation by sea or face annihalation.<br/><br/>The film attempts to tell the story through the eyes of a Spitfire Pilot (Tom Hardy) <br/><br/>A group of British tommies attempting to escape from Dunkirk (including Harry Stiles who gave a creditable performance) <br/><br/>and civilian small boat skipper (Mark Rylance) who is sailing over as one of 'the little ships' to rescue the army.<br/><br/>The mistake is trying to cram to many viewpoints, with a slightly different time line, into too short a film (1hr 46mins) Also having characters you actually don't care much about. <br/><br/>The 1958 film Dunkirk did a much better job on both aspects and was over 30 minutes longer. <br/><br/>Visually it's good, (back to the Ferrari body shell) but you don't get any empathy for the characters, particularly the soldiers, who should be the key to the story (being about the evacuation from Dunkirk) <br/><br/>The film spends far too long with Tom Hardy, flying his remarkable spitfire, it flies on and on with limitless ammo. He shoots down several fighters, a bomber, and (amazingly) even a stuka whilst his plane is gliding (having run out of fuel) <br/><br/>The film title is 'Dunkirk' not 'Spitfire Battles' so detracts from the main story - which surely is about the evacuation of Dunkirk. <br/><br/>Mark Rylance is good as the boat skipper with his son plus a 17 year old boy as crewman.<br/><br/>However, its a bit Uuh? as he just sails off with his boat as the RN is trying to put naval crews on board, and remarkably knows exactly where he has to go and why. In reality the RN briefed the small boats and gave them routes to skirt minefields etc. <br/><br/>On route Rylance picks up Cillian Murphy sitting atop a mostly submerged ship hull. Murphy is a bit 'shell shocked'.<br/><br/>On realising he is being taken back to Dunkirk, in a scuffle with the skipper to turn around the boat, the 17 year old is accidentally fatally injured. <br/><br/>Pointless sub story compared to the main 'event' (Dunkirk evacuation) Another uuh! moment.<br/><br/>The film tries to be 'clever' (but doesn't pull it off) entwining all three story lines to meet at the same event. When Hardy attacks the bomber, attacking the minesweeper, that the soldiers are trying to swim to from their sinking fishing boat and Rylance rescues them. <br/><br/>The British soldiers, who the film follows, are remarkably cowardly. Bearing mind the Britsh Expeditionary Force, although small, was a professional army. Not conscripts.<br/><br/>I felt nothing for the soldier characters, other than a mild contempt for being so cowardly, no attempt to find their units, just run for the ships, by any means.<br/><br/>The film has several good actors, which seemed remarkably wasted, murphy as battle fatigued coward !<br/><br/>Brannagh as some senior naval officer on the pier - more of a cameo Hardy was convincing as a pilot but rather detracted from the evacuation story. <br/><br/>In many respects, this film is a glib, colour version of a disastrous part of our military history and a remarkable evacuation.<br/><br/>I did get a lump in the throat at the sight of the 'little ships' but only about 7 were shown, and it was almost a 'by the way' scene, as if not important.<br/><br/>In reality 800 or so, civilian small vessels, of all shapes and sizes, from paddle steamers to river launches, bravely sailed across to rescue the army. <br/><br/>However, you never get the scale of the event nor feel any empathy, let alone sympathy, for the characters. <br/><br/>This director is a poor scriptwriter for an historic event within living memory. He should stick to science fiction stories. <br/><br/>The sound was mostly loud dirge 'music' that did nothing for me.<br/><br/>Whats the difference between a bucket of faeces and the film Dunkirk 2017 ? The bucket!<br/><br/>4.5/10<br/><br/>p.s. I nearly laughed out loud at the end. On a surprisingly modern train in blighty, the soldiers wondered what people would think of them? Bearing in mind how they had jumped every queue and used every deception to save their skins. I think 'cowards' would be appropriate."
"ycho-29371","9","16","25","30 July 2017"," Very Powerful...
","Christopher Nolan's newest film Dunkirk is a psychologically harrowing war film about one of the terrifying events occurred in history. <br/><br/>While it may not be one of his best films, it still is a profound, powerful war film that truly honors the fact based story and event. Nolan crafts this film as if we, the audience is one of the frightened soldiers attended at the tragic yet distressing event that plays at the big screen extensively realistic. Dunkirk does the best job at satisfyingly delivering the frighteningly realistic portrayal of war and the evacuation in the outlook of the soldiers who were desperate at reaching home. What makes Dunkirk one of the best war films and eminently realistic are the production designs which has a usage of substantial boats, planes etc, the impressive performances and the top- notch sound design.<br/><br/>Most films especially superhero action flick consistently include large reliance on CGI. It has become the crucial trend in the film industry. Nevertheless, Dunkirk has none of that. It uses practical effects, real-life locations, and substantive components. As a result, when boats sink or planes blow-up, it makes these additionally terrifying and hand-gripping. Dunkirk has some of the best aerial dogfights ever put to screen. <br/><br/>Unlike the typical war films, Dunkirk isn't about sympathetic characters whom we know about their history or the amazing, drastic action sequences. This film mainly focuses on the evacuation and the survival throughout these drastically harsh conditions that are far from survival. It shows three directions which are the beach, standpoints at the boats, and the air. These three viewpoints intertwined concentratedly expressing the chances of survival of the 400,000 soldiers stuck at Dunkirk. The sound design was terrifyingly perfect embodying the gunshots, airplanes, and the crashes more resonant and an enhanced viewing experience that was memorable. <br/><br/>All of the actors are great. Nolan used plentiful of young actors as the frightened soldiers. The main standouts were Tom Hardy (Farrier), Kenneth Branagh (Commander Bolton) and Mark Rylance (Mr. Dawson). All of these characters appear as the central focuses at the beach, the air, and the boats as they balance these stories. Mr. Dawson appears as one of the civilian vessels marching to help the soldiers. Additionally, Harry Styles (Alex) had an impactful presence along with Fionn Whitehead (Tommy). <br/><br/>Overall, Dunkirk is an emotionally impactful and powerful war film about heroism, survival and a deep message that evacuation can be the victory along the supports of civilians. Nolan crafts this film thoroughly realistic, gritty and brutal for a PG-13 rated film. While the characters may not be the strongest, this is about war, the horror of the moment.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"varunpidugu-55807","3","65","122","23 July 2017"," The best thing about Dunkirk is that it ends.
","When I first read about the Dunkirk Evacuation, I was in awe- and the possibilities of exploiting and furthering this particular emotion were boundless in Nolan's 'Dunkirk'. Unfortunately, this movie falls embarrassingly short of its promise. Let's start with the positives.<br/><br/>-The acting: In my view, any great war film needs to not just have great characters, but also great ACTORS to portray those characters. In this aspect, Dunkirk shines. The acting is brilliant, as can be expected when your cast features the likes of Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Sir Mark Rylance and Harry Styles(?). There isn't a moment when any character exhibits an emotion out- of-the-ordinary, and there isn't a single actor in the film that falls short of acting talent or ability. <br/><br/>-The music: Contrary to a lot of other people, I actually quite enjoyed the background score- the theme of foreshadowing, which is at the center of the movie's premise, is brilliantly explored in the score. <br/><br/>Now, to the (rather long) list of negatives: <br/><br/>-Redundancy and repetitiveness: As you've probably heard already, Dunkirk's story is told through three perspectives/timelines: The mole (aka land), The sea, and The air. Unfortunately, while this idea holds enormous promise, it only results in redundancy and confusion. There are times in the movie when it is unclear through whose perspective the story is being told, and there are times when scenes become repetitive. This is particularly apparent in the scenes shot in the air. Maybe this was intentional, and if it was, Nolan succeeded here. To me, it just seemed like poor editing and confused direction. This results in the movie seeming exceedingly long for its 1 hour 45 minutes run-time. <br/><br/>-The inability to convey the scale of the evacuation: This, for me, was perhaps the most blatant flaw in this movie. You would think after a $150 million budget and the sheer scale of the actual evacuation itself that the movie would truly convey the likely thousands of ships/boats that were involved. This is just not the case. Throughout the film, we probably see maybe ~10 planes and about 20-30 boats/ships. This, in my view, does not do justice to the miracle of the evacuation, and greatly detracts from the promise this film initially had. <br/><br/>-The emotionless characters: This, in my view, is the biggest problem with Dunkirk. The thing is, there just isn't enough dialogue, there isn't any background on ANY of the soldiers that makes you empathize with them. The consequence of this is that when a semi-major or major character dies, you don't feel anything. Really, all you think is: Well, I've already seen 100s of random soldiers die anyways, why is this different? Again, maybe this was intentional, maybe the point was to trivialize the deaths of even major characters to the point that they are no different from any of the other deaths. I personally didn't enjoy it very much.<br/><br/>All in all, Dunkirk is a film with a lot of promise, and an incredible potential for awe-inspiring characters and story lines. However, its weak character development, and lack of ability to truly convey the enormity of the Dunkirk Evacuation ultimately lead to its downfall, and result in a film that inspires neither empathy nor awe. Very disappointing."
"nyorkergurl","5","63","118","21 July 2017"," Gonna take a shot at reviewing this (no pun intended)
","I'll start with the good. Nolan's refusal to use sets creates a wonderful atmosphere. I really felt like I was there on the beach with them, I felt the gloom and the cold and the mist and the enclosed spaces. The contrasting sunset on the sea with the catastrophe of war made me feel deeply for the humans who experienced this. I enjoyed the humanity in the beginning, the men searching for water and trying to poop anywhere possible. <br/><br/>However, my red flag went up at the informative slides at the beginning. In one swift move, any chance of mystery and allure was crushed. Obviously this is a historical event so major spoilers aren't really possible. But, this isn't a documentary. Let the stories unfold. Give us information in text if necessary, but omit the end outcome. ""The men waited for a miracle.""<br/><br/>Okay. So, we now know this movie is about them getting this miracle. Done. We already knew that. Don't tell us, show us. <br/><br/>I personally am not a fan of the way Christopher Nolan directs. In this movie as well as Batman, the audience is left visually lost. There are no point of references, no connected images that help us make heads or tails of exactly what's happening. This movie is unnecessarily convoluted. It took me awhile to understand that we are cutting between three different time lines. This is a fantastic tactic, if done with intention. In Dunkirk, it was all just... kind of happening. The film manipulates you by using incredibly loud sounds, which didn't bother me at first because I felt like I was really there with them, but when the film showed itself to be lacking in other ways, I felt fooled by the cheap trick. <br/><br/>I found a lot of the film to be simply inaudible. I dreaded the conversations between the commander and the colonel. For me it went ""blah blah blah, home"" ""blah blah blah, home"" ""blah blah blah, civilians"" At one point we even discovered that our stowaway friend was French. I thought it was more of an indiscernible English accent, but my French friend who I saw the movie with filled me in afterwards, and he only knew what happened because he speaks French. <br/><br/>Is that a huge negative? Not necessarily. But it felt like I was being left out. There's two types of movies. There's a movie that takes you into it, effortlessly. It isn't something you are watching but something you are apart of. The other type of movie is one that you actively need to watch. You could take it or leave it. It doesn't command your attention. <br/><br/>The main event of this movie was people getting off ships, people getting back on ships, people getting off ships, people getting back on ships. There was no through-line to look to for guidance. It didn't highlight the story of Dunkirk from any specific or interesting angle. Like I said before, it just kind of happened. The point of this movie is that it happened. Which, okay, that's fine. But, on top of that, key ingredients of the actual event were missing!<br/><br/>The real event included French and Candian and Belgian troops all evacuating over a weeks time, with the small boats. It wasn't suddenly one easy trip the way this movie presents it to be. And while this was happening, British and French men had to stay behind and fight in order to let the others escape. In addition to that, we didn't once see a man on the other side, narrowing and dehumanizing this story. <br/><br/>It's oddly convenient that everyone cheered with excitement when the small boats showed up, considering everyone who had gone out into the sea for the past week had been getting slaughtered. Seems less like real men experiencing this in real time, and more like a Hollywood director knowing the end of this story. This part, seemingly the main event of Dunkirk was completely glossed over. Seeing the civilians reach land, seeing the interactions between them and the soldiers, seeing the gratitude and stress and exhaustion is essential. And we got none of it. If your one goal in making a movie is to tell it how it is, at least tell it how it is."

","The Guardian summed it up like this: ""Bloodless, boring and empty: Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk left me cold."" This is the most stupid movie I have seen in decades. It starts with the main 'German' actor speaking German with a horrible accent. Non of these actors convinced me of being German, the main actor utters constantly clichés like 'just kill them all'. It follows the old Hollywood pattern of 'the good guys, against the bad guys, and of course in the end the good guys win. The enemy is just mowed down, everyone of them shot from the airplanes. I had to force myself to watch it to the end, and sat there in disbelief how such an unauthentic, stereotypical portrayal of an important part of WW II history can have accumulated so many positive reviews."

","Expected so much after all the hype but left feeling that I'd wasted valuable the time.<br/><br/>Glorified garbage which concentrates purely on the German aircraft strafing the beach and not what really happened and the mass slaughter that occurred on the edge of the same beach. <br/><br/>The movie spends the second half concentrating on one family who take part in the rescue, easily leaving the dock which is now in Naval hands and then a very boring trip to Dunkirk in which the father lost his son to a rescued soldier who was freaking out and yet no one blinked a eyelid. <br/><br/>Utter garbage, just another film Warner Bros has spent vast sums of money creating a story about nothing and marketed with a similar budget."
"Lalpera","1","53","98","8 August 2017"," Dullwork should be the ideal title for this one
","I am still trying to pick up the pieces of my brain after watching this so called 'epic movie ever' with so many dumb accolades! I am still at a loss to figure out what the heck Nolan was trying to tell us? Is it the 'heroic work' of allied troops; which actually to me, were lamely waiting for their death? Or was it about just one single heroic job of a RAF pilot or two? Or just about a story of some crap Nazi pilots, all of whom just got shot by one or two RAF planes who were running even without a drop of fuel? Some pilots can kill even when they are gliding so I guess miracles happen, doesn't it?? And the pain of racing your brain in between millions of scenes just nearly assassinate you! Why did Nolan think he was creating climax by swapping a soup of 3 main background scenes over and over, so quickly, till the end where that juggling-in-between scene job exhausts you to near death? It totally kills the smooth flow of any story telling if there was any! I don't have anything to comment about acting because there was no acting of any significance. All the actors were like monuments. And what was that guy Fionn was doing as Tommy, I don't have heck of an idea! There was nothing to comment about music either which I did fairly OK with my strong ear plugs. Editing was the mantra for Nolan it seems and probably is much better than the director's job I must say.<br/><br/>In short, just waste few dollars and hours and get a boring dull story with an endless cacophony!"
"sxh-87483","1","53","98","21 July 2017"," A failed experiment
","Dunkirk is drastically different from any WWII movie I've seen. It's Nolan's bold experiment in exploring novel ways to tell stories from WWII. While his attempt was admirable, I felt extremely disappointed after seeing the movie. Nolan spent no time on developing the characters or telling stories, but instead fabricated a complex movie structure. Some may say that Nolan is intentionally keeping the story simple so that the fear and anxiety on that day can be better conveyed to the audience. However, the intricate time line setting constantly distracts people from the scene and makes me wonder whether he is trying to tell a story or showing off his wild imagination.<br/><br/>If one just looks at the story line of the soldiers, he or she may think the movie is a documentary. The protagonist has almost no lines while constantly trying to escape from the beach of Dunkirk. We all understand the cruelty of war and don't need to spend nearly 2 hours in watching a coward running to learn that. Nolan's flat story telling style is a disaster and is the biggest barrier lying between the movie screen and the audiences. Just before I was almost convinced that this was a documentary, the romantic depiction of the fighter pilot pulled me back to thinking it was still a Hollywood movie. The fighter jets didn't miss a single enemy and safely touched down on the sea and beach. Wait Nolan, I thought you were going to tell us Dunkirk was a total disaster. Why suddenly you switched to this romantic depiction of war heros and hope?<br/><br/>When I saw the civilian boat leaving the harbor, I thought the main character would be the old gentlemen on the little sail boat. However, all he did was pulling a bunch of soldiers from the sea and navigate the boat through the war zone. The pivotal civilian fleets and common English men who changed the course of the WWII were not at all emphasized in the movie, given no more than 1/3 of the screen at maximum.<br/><br/>The purpose of a movie like this is either telling a story or expressing some kind of emotion or a combination of the two. Nolan hasn't done either as there are no developed plot or characterers. I guess he was betting his novel three-stranded story telling would compensate for the weakness. But I have to say it's a failed experiment and does not deserve any higher score than 5 on IMDb."
"jameskfaulkner","2","52","96","25 July 2017"," What an absolute Turkey !
","Normally I love this kind of wartime historic movie but it was absolutely terrible, just a total Turkey. Dunkirk is a infamous piece of British history, it was a disaster like the film !<br/><br/>The filming itself is reasonably good, but the biggest thing that lets it down is the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer should be fired ! It is constant relentless noisy drone through literally every single scene, that adds nothing and which totally ruins it. When it switches from one scene to another the same drone continues ! It is doesn't feel in any way 1940s, and neither does it feel British or French apart from the very last scene, but by then I was glad to get out. At the very least the entire soundtrack should be changed.<br/><br/>There is almost no speaking or chit chat at all by any of the characters so you know nothing about them not even their names. Again not natural. Even in the very first scene when he arrives on the beach and takes a drink from another soldier. They don't even speak which isn't natural and just not what British people do. Strange stuff also happens in that the young lad seems ill and then dies on the boat but there is no clue why ? Has he been shot ? <br/><br/>You don't see anyone German at all other than another bomber or another Stuka. The film could have been so good in that the scenes themselves look okay(ish) but it just doesn't work as a film. <br/><br/>When all the little ships arrive together this was quite nice, and one of the main legends of Dunkirk but they don't make enough of this. In conclusion save your money and watch it on TV instead but only if you are a real WW2 buff.<br/><br/>If you want to see a real genuine movie about how it was flying Spitfires etc then watch the Battle of Britain film, hint they don't fly until they run out of fuel, It is literally about 5 minutes for a Spitfire to fly back across the English channel to refuel."

"benj-20839","6","52","96","23 July 2017"," A Decent Sunday Afternoon Movie Best Watched At Home.
","Firstly, i want to say i enjoyed the film, nothing amazing like the critics and Christopher Nolan fans have made out but i think he achieved what he set out to do, with all the parameters he set himself regards to the differences with actual Dunkirk history and the filmmaking style he wanted to use.<br/><br/>It certainly isn't one of the greatest war films ever made, far from it but it is a decent experiment in filmmaking, if your into that kind of thing.<br/><br/>Me and my friend both thought it was like a good film you watch at home on a Sunday afternoon. And having watched it on the big screen i would say that thats the best way to fully enjoy it too, at home, which i would rather have seen it at. You'll understand when you see it, its just one of those films.<br/><br/>If you watch this in Imax like i did, make sure you take a tissue because the sound becomes unbearably loud after a little while and you may need to plug your ears up, especially when the aircraft segments start and with the bigger explosions abit later on. Even with tissues in ears its pretty loud too but its nicely bearable.<br/><br/>So if you do go and watch it at the cinema then i wholeheartedly recommend watching it in the standard 2D screens, mainly because of the unbearably loud volume and bassy sounds in Imax, mixed with the other film soundtrack noises makes everything sound muffled. And also because it isn't such the big visual spectacle as they've lead us to believe. Nolans previous films and those of say Ridley Scott or Peter Jackson have given more scope and reason to watch their films in an Imax screen.<br/><br/>Overall though, i found the film enjoyable, JUST above average. It plods along nicely for a 95 minute feature, with 10 minutes of end credits also. There isn't a dull moment in this from my perspective. Nolan does make you feel sorry for the characters he wants you to feel sorry for, but for a war film it isn't a greatly emotional one. I don't understand why its been given such high ratings as the visuals, sound, story, character development and overall feel don't warrant such grand praise. I can understand why half the audience have really disliked it for the above reasons also, as there was no storyline and there's barely a character for the audience to attach themselves to. Plus there's a lot of difference in regards to the sheer numbers of aircraft's, boats and people not present here. I did feel the grandness of the peril these boys were actually in really missing because of this scaling down from Nolan, which was his conscious choice to leave out. I have to admit that adding CGI here and there really would have given this moment of history a more realistic vision of it's devastating scale.<br/><br/>I expected to see really amazing choreographed air combat sequences too but they were just OK, they did the job but nothing spectacular or exciting. There have been way better and breathtaking aircraft combat scenes from most other films, war or sci-fi!<br/><br/>If you didn't know Christopher Nolan's intentions in his film as i've briefly alluded to above and are expecting to see an epic masterpiece of a war movie in the vein of films by directors like Stanley Kubrick, Michael Cimino, Brian De Palma, Oliver Stone, Ridley Scott, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg or Mel Gibson, where the visuals mesh breathtakingly with story, characters and emotions then you may be disappointed with Dunkirk. Dunkirk feels more like a brief and confined moment of an evacuation, with small scale pockets of peril at its heart, and knowing that will help you appreciate this better, hopefully, but by how much i don't know, for me its a 6/10, just above average.<br/><br/>It's definitely not on the scale the critics and fanboys have sold it on, for a general audience! Even though i enjoyed it i still don't see how such high ratings are being thrown at this. And its a shame the film doesn't convey the epic grand scale feeling of terror that history has told us."

","I really liked Inception. I think that Christopher Nolan is a genius. But his latest film, Dunkirk, is a turkey. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm not just saying that because I sat there and nit-picked the military hardware and special effects and found them lacking. I'm saying it because the movie was just plain bad.<br/><br/>I will point out that I'm glad that some of my favorite actors got some work and were paid ""big picture"" money to work on this. It's nice to see some really fine actors get paid. That's the only good thing I can think of to say. So let's get started on the bad stuff.<br/><br/>Historical accuracy? Yeah, I'm a war nerd (tm) and I study war. I did notice a few ""errors"" here and there but WHO CARES? The errors in historical baloney such as ships or planes or whatever just fade into nothingness compared to colossal error of making a movie about Dunkirk in which the blitzkrieg is missing. Blitzkrieg may have been real, or may have been some kind of historical fallacy, but it's a thing. It has to be in a movie about flippin' Dunkirk or nobody knows what's going on.<br/><br/>This movie desperately needed a tiny touch of something to explain how all those soldiers ended up on the beach. A hint. Something. You just don't show ""lots of guys on the beach"" and not expect somebody to ask ""what's this?""<br/><br/>The blitzkrieg was missing. So were the Germans. No Germans. Just ""the enemy"" said in such a ""suitable for television"" manner as to cause anyone's ears to prick up. ""What did they not say? They censored the word 'Germans?' What??""<br/><br/>Yes. Dunkirk is a movie that fails to identify ""the enemy"" as The Third Reich. I'm calling bullshit on that. This is just embarrassing. No mention of Germans or Huns or Jerries or Heinies or Boche. No nothing.<br/><br/>The word is ""stupid.""<br/><br/>It gets worse.<br/><br/>The film opens with a stunning display of poor soldiering by a British Tommy. He comes under fire so he stands up in a hot environment and then, failing to get rightfully shot, he throws down his rifle and runs for the rear. I wanted to shoot him myself but the realities of modern cinema make shooting characters on the screen pointless.<br/><br/>We are then treated to some of the worst aerial footage in memory. Spitfires and Messerschmitts shoot each other. There is a discussion about saving ships and planes for The Battle of Britain. It's a short discussion. There is another short discussion about The Battle of France. Nobody cares, especially the people on screen. It's all very abstract, cold and meaningless.<br/><br/>But never fear, we're treated to the inevitable result of shooting and bombing and killing. A man is rescued from a sunken ship, then, in a fit of dementia, he kills a teenage boy. Obviously that's what happens in war. Men go mad and kill boys.<br/><br/>Well, if you want to believe that--go ahead. Just don't expect me to join you. I'm sure that a few British soldiers behaved badly during the Dunkirk battle. But that's not the story here. The fact that the vast majority of them did not behave badly is the story. Get it straight.<br/><br/>They made a good movie about Dunkirk. It was called Mrs. Miniver. Watch that instead. Maybe the British back then were just too stiff and proper to be believable to us now. But that's not something that was wrong with them then, it's a symptom of what's wrong with us now.<br/><br/>Addendum: It took me a couple of days to find the movie that sounds like this one. Yes, I hated the score by Hans Zimmer almost as much as the movie itself, because it was so distracting to try to remember ""where have I heard this before?"" Well, I heard the music in the 1984 film ""The Bounty"" by Vangelis. THAT music sounds so much like the music in this film that if I were Vangelis, I'd lawyer up.<br/><br/>So yes, even the music sucked (I can hardly believe it). Hans Zimmer let me down."

What a waste of Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and James D'Arcy to say nothing of Tom Hardy.<br/><br/>There is zero character development, resulting in zero emotion and zero identification with the plight of the characters.<br/><br/>OK Spoilers! What was the point of the kid on the boat falling down and dying? Since when do Spitfires have limitless ammunition? ( in reality they had 15 to 20 seconds of ammo ) How can a Spitfire with a dead engine shoot down a bomber? Why did Tom Hardy land his Spitfire towards the Germans and get captured? Why did the soldiers hide in a boat that was outside their perimeter? <br/><br/>I could go on but what's the point.<br/><br/>Finally, I laughed out loud when Branagh, standing on the mole said 340,000 had been saved, How the hell would he know that?

Two major reasons why: <br/><br/>(1) For the important roles of British soldiers, men who in reality fought their way out of France, sacrificing many in combat and enduring tremendous privation, injury, terror, and hardship, the director chose to focus on soldiers who think only of their own survival--certainly there were some men like that in WWII, but it is simply a waste of wonderful and compelling raw material to produce this movie out of all the possible scenarios the director could have chosen.<br/><br/>(2) This movie skimped terribly on sets. It was embarrassing to watch a few hundred men on the beach, one or two Royal Navy ships in the water, two British planes in the air, and a handful of civilian boats.

","It was difficult to give this film such a high rating but it did have certain good qualities. The acting was good and the uniforms looked real. having said these good things, let me get to the list of bad:<br/><br/>DO NOT see this movie if you are a fan of history. The historical inaccuracies will drive you insane. Dunkirk was one of the turning points of the war. It was because the Brits were able to save their army that Germany did not invade. Germany instead decided to turn on Russia and this eventually led to their demise. This great WWII battle was completely underrepresented in this film. There were less than ten total planes in the movie, 20 or less ships, and MAYBE 500 actors. This was not enough. I went in expecting the same level of action as the movie Pearl Harbor, but what i saw was... something less. <br/><br/>DO NOT see this movie if you like a story line or plot. There was no plot to this movie at all, and the events in the movie are not even represented in a linear time line. <br/><br/>DO NOT see this movie if you like to identify with characters. You will not care much about the characters because there is very little dialogue and no way for you to learn about them. <br/><br/>DO NOT see this movie if you are expecting action. There were only a couple ""dog fights"" which consisted of one plane flying behind another with zero intensity.<br/><br/>DO NOT see this movie if you have been in the military. Obviously Nolan had nobody on set that knew anything about the military because from the opening sequence there were problems. For example, the movie opens with a few Brits lollygagging in an area with Germans close enough to shoot at them. It is here we see that apparently none of the Brits had their weapons loaded. Also it should be noted that at no point is there any fighting of any kind in the city of Dunkirk. They never show the men holding the line for this evacuation. There were no German artillery barrages. Also it needs to be said, planes would not have dropped bombs on men in the sand when there were ships and docks right there. They would have strafed them in the sand. <br/><br/>Overall i cannot say how completely disappointed i was with this film. I do not think i will ever see another war film from Nolan."

Caracthers are undeveloped, for example Tom Hardy speaks maybe 10 lines and he is wearing mask all the time. Harry Styles is actually good.

I also had a problem with the dialogue. The lines between the characters were very rigid and did not move the plot along.

","The words ""Christopher Nolan"" and ""disappointment"" are not words I would naturally associate but for me, they apply where ""Dunkirk"" is concerned. <br/><br/>It promised so much from the trailer: a historical event of epic proportions; Kenneth Branagh; Tom Hardy; Mark Rylance; Hans Zimmer on the keys; the director of such classics as ""The Dark Knight""; ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" : what could go wrong? <br/><br/>But it just doesn't work and I've spent the last 24 hours trying to unpick why.<br/><br/>A key problem for me was the depiction of the beach itself. The film eschews CGI effects (which I would normally commend) in favour of the use of ""practical effects"" and the involvement of ""thousands of extras"" (as the rather glutinously positive Wiki entry declares). Unfortunately for the movie, there were some 400,000 troops marooned in this last patch of civilisation ahead of the Nazi hoard, and all of the shots refuse to acknowledge this scale of potential human tragedy. Yes, there are individual scenes of horror, such as the soldier walking into the sea against the impassive stares of the young heroes. But nothing of scale. At times I thought I'd seen more people on the beach on a winter's day in Bournemouth.<br/><br/>My disquiet at this deepened when we got to the sharp end of the rescue by the ""small boats"". In my mind (and I'm NOT quite old enough to remember this!) I imagine a sea full of them. A sight to truly merit Branagh's awed gaze. But no. They might have been ""original"" vessels. but there was only about half a dozen of them. A mental vision dashed. <br/><br/>The film attempts to tell the story from three perspectives: from the land; from the sea and from the air. The sea though gets the lion's share of the film, and there is much drowning that occurs that (I am aware) was distressing for some in the audience. <br/><br/>Nolan also pushes his quirky ""timeline"" manipulation too far for an audience that largely expects a linear telling of a classic tale. It's day; it's night; the minesweeper's sailing; then sunk; then sailing again; a Spitfire crashes, then crashes again from a different perspective. I know many in the audience just didn't 'get' that: leaving them presumably very confused! <br/><br/>That being said, the film is not a write off, and has its moments of brilliance. Kenneth Branagh (""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"", ""Valkyrie""), although having a range of Nolan's cheesy lines to say, is impressive as the commanding officer. Mark Rylance (""Bridge of Spies"", ""The BFG"") also shines as the captain of the ""Moonstone"": one of the small boats out of Weymouth. And Tom Hardy (""The Revenant"", ""Legend""), although having limited opportunity to act with anything other than his eyes, is impressive as RAF pilot Farrier. His final scene of stoic heroism is memorable. <br/><br/>Fionn Whitehead is also impressive in his movie debut, and even Harry Styles (""This is Us"") equips himself well. <br/><br/>The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema (""Interstellar"") is stunning with some memorable shots: a burning plane on a beach being a high spot for me.<br/><br/>And Hans Zimmer's score is Oscar-worthy, generating enormous tension with a reverberating score, albeit sometimes let down by unsuitable cutaways (for example, to scenes of boat loading). Elsewhere in the sound department though I had major issues, with a decent percentage of the dialogue being completely inaudible in the sound mix.<br/><br/>I really wanted this to be a ""Battle of Britain"". Or a ""Bridge Too Far"". Or even a ""Saving Private Ryan"". Unfortunately, for me it was none of these, and this goes down as one of my movie disappointments of the year so far.<br/><br/>(For the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com.

Sadly for us it was a disappointment and left us wondering exactly why the film is called ""Dunkirk"".<br/><br/>There are good performances and some emotional scenes, particularly at the beginning of the film. But the time line was so confusing and the beach was so empty considering that there were well over 300,000 men awaiting evacuation. And where were the 800+ small boats which sailed back and forward over a period of 8 days and, together with the larger British destroyers and merchant ships, saved almost 340,000 soldiers. We saw endless air battles which were beautifully filmed but weren't exciting or effective.<br/><br/>Finally the music - Hans Zimmer is a wonderful composer of film music and his creation for this film was effective. But why so loud and so much? It was almost impossible to hear some of the text and I'm astonished that a director of the caliber of Nolan thought that this would add to the tension. Sometimes silence says far more than the constant background of very loud music.<br/><br/>I presume that many of these things won't bother a younger audience but I believe that the story of Dunkirk deserved to be more accurate.

"claudio_carvalho","3","42","78","7 December 2017"," Forgettable, Dull and Absolutely Overrated
","""Dunkirk"" is a forgettable and dull war film absolutely overrated in IMDb. There is no character development and the viewer does not care for anybody who lives or dies. The shallow screenplay is awful and the Batle of Dunkirk is limited to the evacuation of the Allied soldiers, most of them British, that stay in lines on the beach or on a dock attacked and slaughtered by the German airplanes. The plot focuses basically in three simultaneous storylines: the first based on an old man with two teenagers in a boat trying to rescue soldiers; the second on a Spitfire pilot that crashes his airplane on the water and is rescued by the old man; and the third on a Navy Commander in charge of the attempt of evacuating the soldiers. Better of watching again a classic war movie than spending 1h 46 min watching his terrible film by the usually overrated Christopher Nolan. My vote is three.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Dunkirk"""
"burlesonjesse5","5","41","76","23 July 2017"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Dunkirk
","Christopher Nolan, a period piece, and a warfare movie. It's an interesting amalgamation. What did I think? Eh, meager disappointment at best. My latest review is Nolan's 2017 release, Dunkirk. <br/><br/>The story of Dunkirk is a true one. It's not handled faithfully and it has big Chris achingly trying to reinvent the combat wheel, Nolan style! It's about a rather large evacuation in World War II. Allied soldiers were taken from the beaches and harbor of Dunkirk via the summer of 1940. And in case you are wondering, Dunkirk is a medium-sized commune in northern France. <br/><br/>Frustrating, overly thought-provoking, icy and at times clunky, Nolan's film is told through the eyes of three different groups of WWII servicemen. Yeah its running time is 106 minutes but Dunkirk feels like it's two and a half hours long. Heck, about an hour in, I was almost ""done"" with Dunkirk. Natch.<br/><br/>Anyway, Christopher Nolan as a director, gives Dunkirk a sterile look, a large canvas, a few nimble wide shots, and a numbing sense of being. These are the traits I like about him. However, when Christopher's style fails to correlate with the proper subject matter (forgone battle in the trenches), it almost appears like amateur hour on screen. Nolan mind you, has never been a supreme storyteller, a user-friendly filmmaker, or an expert at staging action. This is where his Dunkirk ultimately fails. <br/><br/>For a movie under two hours, Dunkirk feels slight of hand at being a silent film. It still has a ton of scenes that don't find a rhythm and can't sustain any kind of payoff. Battle sequences involving planes, boats, and land infantry are quick, lack minimal gore (that explains the PG-13 rating), and are virtually non-coherent. Also, the actors mumble their lines and Nolan's favorite troupers from his other flicks (Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy), feel underused while not having a lot of script material to bounce off of. <br/><br/>All in all, my biggest fault with Dunkirk has to be the editing by Australian Lee Smith. He shapes a vehicle that substitutes wartime ADHD and spoon-fed art for tone and entertainment value. Nothing in frame is truly held long enough for the viewer to process. Basically it's the movie equivalent of someone constantly changing channels with their state-of-the-art remote. So yeah, Dunkirk has a couple of meaningful moments with a provided musical score that's equal parts stirring, absorbingly loud, and annoying. Still, Smith's edits are very choppy and very fleet. They zap Dunkirk of having any lengthy intrigue or sense of epic tranquility. Bottom line: War pics shouldn't make you miffed at trying to fit all the events together as the closing credits come up. That only works with stuff like The Thin Red Line. My rating: 2 stars."
"chflouris","3","38","70","4 December 2017"," A lot of marketing, great Box Office revenue, but a massive turn off.
","There has been a massive hype for this movie on the radio and specifically BBC R2 where, Chris Evans was praising how good this movie was.<br/><br/>The movie in my eyes has no real substance. It switches between 3 scenes, It has average to bad music, it doesn't provide any historical background, it has no dialogues, just a few lines and the constant annoying sound at the background is there to supposedly cause suspense, but in contrast it creates anxiety and is uncomfortable to watch or listen to. Last but not least, the film doesn't manage to show the scale of the Dunkirk evacuation. This is my opinion.<br/><br/>I am sorry to say that I really struggle to find anything positive about the movie. If they gave a refund at the cinema i would have gone to ask for one. Apparently, paying a lot for advertising nowadays makes a movie a 9/10.. This is frankly sad, but I am glad other people can see the same side of the coin as myself. <br/><br/>People that say this movie is a masterpiece, and they give a 10 star rating are deceiving other potential viewers. <br/><br/>I give 3 stars because i want to be objective and say that on the graphic side of things there were good graphics."

","As a fan of Nolan's works, I have to say that this one was a disappointment. I wasn't going to write a review either, seeing how many have been written already, but I feel like I should. Okay, so here's the deal, for what I gathered, you'll either hate it or love it. Unfortunately, I'm one of those who hated it. Okay, hate is a strong word, so let's say that I was bored by it. The first half hour you just wait to see what will happen and for the story to kick in. But, after forty minutes in, you finally realise that the story is there, you just didn't see it. I have to read some reviews to finally get a grasp of what was happening, as the description doesn't really prepare you. After that, it's just a boring movie about ships getting sank and no dialogues. No dialogues would have mean a gold mine of rich emotional performances, but not in this case. The performances were blunt and the emotions just no where to be seen. So, what's left is a disappointing ending and the credits. Overall, I give this one a 2 because the story may have been there, but it wasn't presented nicely enough for me to see it. Plus, there was no thrill in it to keep me interest nor emotion."

"siivooja4","2","36","66","4 August 2017"," Uh - this was a sad creation. I want my money back
","Where to start tearing this catastrophic movie apart? <br/><br/>Many viewers will probably like the storytelling showing the same event from different angles and personal stories. This idea is copied from Kieslowski's Trois Couleurs-trilogy. There is an obvious search for fear of death by drowning or sinking with a ship in a closed locked space, but it just doesn't work. Other movies like Das Boot is a masterpiece of this, but Dunkirk isn't able to copy the feeling at all. <br/><br/>Other points: 1. Why film a beach side street in a small French town, but do not even bother to edit out the modern buildings? <br/><br/>2. Show a bunch of private yachts in a harbour. Many of the boats are from the wrong era. <br/><br/>3. Almost 100 000 soldiers died in Dunkirk. This is not depicted in any way. It is an important part of the real story. <br/><br/>4. Wikipedia: ""The loss of materiel on the beaches was huge. The British Army left enough equipment behind to equip about eight to ten divisions. Discarded in France were, among huge supplies of ammunition, 880 field guns, 310 guns of large caliber, some 500 anti- aircraft guns, about 850 anti-tank guns, 11,000 machine guns, nearly 700 tanks, 20,000 motorcycles, and 45,000 motor cars and lorries. "" However in the movie we see a few rows of boxes on an otherwise clean beach.<br/><br/>5. Both sides lost over a hundred aircraft in Dunkirk. A loss of over a hundred planes means thousands of missions were flown during those days. Yet we see 5-6 in the movie and at most 3 in the sky at a given time. <br/><br/>6. Men hide in a fishing boat and wait for the tide to return and float the boat again. Germans are ""target practicing"" at the boat. Water comes in through a few rifle caliber holes. Yet more holes appear under the existing ones. So the Germans are target practicing and shooting way under the waterline of the boat? What rifle shoots a hole in a metal bulkhead through one meter depth? Then the men are able to plug the holes with anything else than their fingers? While textile or almost any material could be used to plug them and avoid sinking. Plot or real stupidity? <br/><br/>7. The sounds were surprisingly low quality. Rifle shots do not sound like real rifle shots. The Rolls Royce on the Spitfire is off too. Hearing it live is a majestic experience, but in the movie it's not even close. Honestly I'm not sure if the cinema had their sound system tuned wrong or if it was the movie, but although I'm not much into music it bothered me throughout the movie. <br/><br/>War is hell. This movie is like a slow funeral."

"SimonB27","2","34","62","15 August 2017"," Dull, uninvolving and nonsensical in spite of one or two moments
","There are no spoilers in this review. We know how the whole thing ends or, if you don't, stop reading and get a history book. This film is not the way to learn anyway.<br/><br/>I had high hopes of Dunkirk. People were saying it is a great film. I remain baffled as to why. I did not quite want to walk out of Dunkirk, but I was bored and I can't say I enjoyed it. It has too many fundamental failings. Here's why.<br/><br/>Firstly (let's start with something positive), the good points.<br/><br/>There is a bit of spectacular photography. Some of the shots of ships are well done.<br/><br/>The acting - Having said that there's not a lot of ""acting"" at all. Come to think of it there should be a lot more ""acting"". The characters should be more terrified, angry, resilient, defiant, chipper etc. None of this comes across but I think that's the director's fault, not the actors'.<br/><br/>There are some interesting vignettes. They stand alone as well-executed scenes but, as I'll discuss later, they don't add up to much.<br/><br/>Er, that's about it.<br/><br/>Now, the things that just added up to make the film annoying, dull and uninvolving.<br/><br/>Characterisation - I just wasn't invested in any of the characters. The ""lead"" in the form of the soldier that we follow through the trials and tribulations of the evacuation is just not a sympathetic character. He is a chancer trying to get ahead of the queue. Quite apart from the fact that he's certainly not representative of the troops at Dunkirk, it's unnecessary; he's a weasely little character when there's a much bigger story going on. The rest of the characters are largely two-dimensional. The sub-plot on the boat, brings in another unsympathetic character, is difficult to believe in, is a distraction and has nothing to do with the evacuation. If we needed character sub-plots, we'd have been much better off looking at the people back home in England, their fears, motivations etc. and we'd understand the story of Dunkirk better.<br/><br/>There is also no sense of the real fear, desperation, defiance etc that must have been foremost in the minds of the men on the beach. In fact there is very little emotion in the film at all. We follow a couple of soldiers about for a bit but we get no sense that men are awaiting the lottery of the next Luftwaffe bombing raid, losing their comrades or wondering if they will get home to their wives or whether a Panzer division is about to come over the horizon.<br/><br/>Scale - there is absolutely NO sense of the scale of the evacuation. The actual evacuation involved some 400,000 men. We see very few... really, very few. We hear a man on a stretcher takes the space of seven standing men but the ships leaving the harbour are clearly not full; there are just a few guys standing by the railings. At Dunkirk, men were so crammed onto ships they had to leave their backpacks behind. Surely the budget could have run to a few more extras or a bit of CGI. We see three British aeroplanes and a couple of German ones! <br/><br/>Story - there is no real story to invest in. Quite apart from the intensely annoying non-linear narrative, there is no sense of what actually happened at Dunkirk. We never get to understand why it happened, why the commanders did what they did or what choices they had, the RAF's role, the French army's role, how the fleet of little ships came about, why Hitler didn't attack by land or anything really.<br/><br/>Non-linear narrative - oh my goodness me! Why? Don't get me wrong I enjoy a well-constructed non-linear narrative, but this isn't it. The story jumps around for no readily apparent reason. We see things twice but then there are two planes at one point so we're not quite sure if it's the first plane or the second one. It's a mess. Again, some interesting little vignettes but not adding up to any coherent story we can invest in.<br/><br/>And then there are all the other little nit-picking bits that made the film annoying and distracting. A soldier salutes a very senior colonel without his hat on (not done!) and then casually imparts a load of information without once saying ""Sir"". Would a senior naval officer in 1940 really say ""we're stuffed""? Spitfires could fire their guns for a total of about 17 seconds and did not have apparently unlimited ammunition, nor could they keep flying with no engine. If a plane passes you at altitude (at what? 120-150mph?) and then ditches, it will not be 100 yards or so from your boat, it'll be well over a mile away. How is the boat captain an expert in German aerial tactics; his explanation makes no sense. When you're not invested in a film, you notice these things.<br/><br/>Oh yes and other people have commented on the score. What score? It's just noise except for the final section is it supposed to be rousing or patriotic? It's just Elgar's Nimrod played at about 1/4 speed. Score by Hans Zimmer?.. not really.<br/><br/>So all in all while this film does have one or two moments. It adds up to considerably less than the sum of its parts. I had started giving this three stars but the more I think about it, I don't think it's worth even that. Not only could it have been so much more, it's actually quite a badly made film. Why on earth are people giving it high ratings?"

","What a disappointment! I went to the theatre with an expectation of seeing a spectacle in the class of Saving Private Ryan (SPR), but boy, was I in for a rude awakening! So, what is Dunkirk (2017)? It's a movie similar to SPR, but rid of ANY story and ANY character development. It's like a war documentary, but without any narration. We see the soldiers, the airplanes, torpedoes, ships, but there's no story that connects them and pulls you in. When I saw SPR, I was engrossed in the story immediately. Here, I walked out after about 30 min because the movie failed to engage me in any way.<br/><br/>No matter what genre I watch, I am ticked off by unrealistic scenes (given the premise, of course. It is not unbelievable to watch Spiderman walk on the ceiling because you accept that the movie works on the premise that Peter Parker got bit by a radioactive spider and thus developed some spider-like abilities. However, it would tick me off if Spiderman's hand turned into a rocket launcher or a plasma weapon - that's the premise for Terminator movies, not for Spiderman.) But I digress. So, the main character sees another soldier on the beach. He approaches him and says nothing. O-Kay.... He keeps looking at him, and the other soldier, also without saying anything, gives him water. The main character drinks, returns the bottle and leaves without a word. Ummm... A ""Thank you, man"" would be in order. You would think they have some telepathic abilities and are able to communicate with thoughts. But OK - I am thinking everybody's super stressed, so I let it go. But the next scene is what really kills me - enemy planes bomb the beach full of soldiers. After the planes flew away, the surviving soldiers get up from the ground. Some remain on the ground, presumably dead or wounded. Nobody approaches the soldiers on the ground to check if they're wounded, if somebody is still alive and needs help! Absolutely unrealistic! They looked like robots, not soldiers who cared about their fellow brothers in arms.<br/><br/>The movie goes on skipping from story to story, all of them being boring and not connected to one other. No dialog, no character development, no story! Silent movies provide more dialog than this! Just when I thought our main character was mute and deaf, he finally opened his mouth some 25 min into the movie. At the moment when a torpedo hit the ship, I didn't see the soldiers who I connected with, struggling to survive - I saw actors dressed in uniforms shooting a movie. That's the moment when I got up and left -- while the actors were still acting they were under water hit by a torpedo..."

","This was a good try to be sure, but in truth I felt underwhelmed when I left the studio. The film is technically near perfect but it fails to show the true scale of the evacuation or the civilian and military fleet that pulled it off. Also it totally failed to show the heroic defense by the French who held the Germans back for those vital few days and allowed the British to escape.<br/><br/>Early on Kenneth Branagh's character states that there are over 400.000 men on this beach yet we fail to see any more than 200 or so in any shot, the rest of the time the beach feels near deserted. Now I understand that hiring 400.000 extras for a film would be financially and logistically impossible yet without this kind of scale or even some clever CGI work this film feels like a few dozen guys running about on a beach being rescued by a handful of boats. Anyway, it was still a good try and the aerial dogfights with the Spitfires was magical, that alone made it almost worth watching, almost."

","Hard to understand the hype attached to this movie. As usual Director Christopher Nolan's penchant for the non-linear method of direction makes the usual shambles of the story line. Given the promotion for this movie I expected more and waited, unrewarded unfortunately, for the seminal moment that would lift the movie above the average to the epic magnitude of the actual event. The movie lacked .... scale. For example the RAF lost well over 100 aircraft during the evacuation but Nolon would have you believe only 3 RAF aircraft showed up. The Germans also lost well over 100 aircraft, some say closer to 200+. Same with the loss of equipment. Left on the beach at Dunkirk were enough weapons and equipment to equip 8-10 Divisions, and included 800+ field guns, 500 anti-aircraft guns, tanks, trucks etc etc None of that scale was represented. In fact the long lines of troops waiting on the beach in the opening scenes soon disappeared and the beaches were left empty in many scenes long before the movie reached its peak. The Seminal Moment in the actual event was that some 700+ small boats left England to help rescue the stranded troops. Nolan managed a ""fleet"" of about 10 or 12. Again, no sense of scale. Many are claiming this is one of the best war films ever. I don't think so. I felt short changed to be honest because it lacked the scale of, for argument sake, the opening scenes from Saving Private Ryan."

","SPOILER ALERT: The Germans won this bit of WWII.<br/><br/>Tawdry rubbish. Summed up by the modern train carriages the 'soldiers' board at the end.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan's famous opening scene had you flinching and wincing at the succession of gory death scenes without letup; you never had time to worry about WHO was getting butchered. In order to stretch exactly that sort of thing writ large with ships and planes to an hour-and-a-half, Christopher Nolan has had to allow some kind of characterization to happen. The suspense occurs in that you never know whether the character you're looking at (I'm sick of Steadicam btw) is going to last another few minutes or not. This movie is for the generation that has grown up with live, amateur disaster footage.<br/><br/>This is a terrible way to inspire any kind of identification with the characters; everyone is expendable, and none of them are drawn in any depth whatsoever. A little vulnerability here, a little courage there, but after half an hour of this all that's left is the spectacle of violent, horrible death. And Kenneth 'No-Lips' Branagh practicing for when he inevitably does Churchill. (The English politician, not the car insurance bulldog. I won't be advance booking).<br/><br/>This is why 'Dunkirk' resembles a series of computer game action scenes cut together. You're just waiting for the next one to find out if anything happens. And the music, sorry, the synthetic drone that goes on throughout (what happened to war movie themes?) adds to that sensation. No development, no change in mood - apart from stealing 'Nimrod' from Elgar (a cliché, by the way) - and in the end, no surprises apart from unexpected death. The whole movie feels synthetic, ie artificial, instead of engaging your deeper emotions.<br/><br/>It's technically interesting - I wouldn't say 'impressive' - and may look authentic compared to 'traditional' war films, but it's actually just as false, and has less emotional involvement."

Historically, Dunkirk was a logistic miracle, in which a disorganized flotilla of amateur yachtsman managed to spirit off 300,000 plus British soldiers, trapped by Nazi forces.<br/><br/>Now, if you want to do a micro story, fine. But you do have to put in scale. Instead, we have these meandering lines of soldiers on the beach, fewer numbers than in some cineplexes. We see nothing of the flotilla until 90% of the movie is gone, and even then it's a throwaway.<br/><br/>The bulk of the movie is spent on a single ship, a single Spitfire, and a couple of rather unlikable soldiers looking for a way home. It took me quite a while to realize that the stories were not in sync, that I was looking at several different time frames. How clever! What totally unnecessary complexity!<br/><br/>This might STILL have worked,except that Nolan does not bother with any more than the barest exposition of the characters. So instead of seeing the Grand Evacuation, we see the struggles of several ciphers, completely out of context.<br/><br/>Add to that an ear-splitting, incomprehensible score, and you have - not a disaster movie - but a disaster."
"Lejink","5","30","54","22 July 2017"," On the beach
","In which Christopher Nolan attempts to do a Spielberg in widening his palette to take in a major war-themed movie a la ""Schindler"". Does he succeed, well, I don't think so. Nolan has spoken about the unusual construction of his film, taking three stories on the day, one being two young soldiers' desperate attempt to escape the carnage on the beach over the course of a week, the RAF pilots attempting to protect the air-space over the Channel within one hour and the crew of a small private boat in one day making their own way to try to help relieve the situation and then sort of sort of slow / fast forwards them all on from there, cutting from one to the next in triangular order, from start to finish. These switches, I have to say, I grew almost irritated at by the end, to the point of anticipating them even at key dramatic points in the story.<br/><br/>I guess his big idea was that rather than attempt a massive-scale over-arching narrative of the events at Dunkirk, he attempts to tell the tale with just these three microcosms and infuse them with the different human traits at play in such a desperate situation. Thus we see the young soldiers on the run from the start displaying fear, selfishness, ingenuity but yes, even cowardice as they try anything to get aboard a leaving ship, only to end up threatened with drowning in an abandoned boat they'd hoped to commandeer and use to get to safety. With the pilots, we witness calmness, bravery, loyalty, flying skills and ultimately self-sacrifice as they fight overwhelming odds in the air while in the rescuing private boat, again we see endeavour, courage and compassion as the crew of one middle aged man and two young boys attempts to make a difference by saving as many as they can.<br/><br/>Was this approach the best way to convey the big picture here...I'm not convinced it was. Some of the incidents seemed contrived and at odds with the realism sought for elsewhere, especially the incidents of the young cabin boy on the small cruiser and the French soldier who ends up with a bunch of hardly heroic British soldiers under deck, trying to escape drowning.<br/><br/>Sure, the depiction of the terrible ordeals they each went through is realistically portrayed, on water, land and sea, but ultimately it lacks the realism of say ""Saving Private Ryan"", (sacrificed obviously for the 12a classification to no doubt ensure younger viewers could get to see it), so there's no blood or bits of bodies as you would otherwise expect. I'm not sure I saw even one German in the whole movie. <br/><br/>There's very little dialogue either so there wasn't much room for acting skills to shine other than by reacting mostly with British pluck to events, which actors like Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance can do all day while Tom Hardy is confined almost exclusively to the cockpit of his Spitfire. The best I can say about pop star Harry Styles' acting debut was that I didn't even notice him until my wife pointed him out to me in a scene right at the end.<br/><br/>Commendably, Nolan keeps his film to a 105 minute duration when it would have been easy to bloat it to double that length, but in the end, I didn't feel at any stage that I was actually witnessing real events, always that I was watching a movie, which for me, as I say, makes it ultimately a failure. The miracle of Dunkirk was that 300000 got home safely under insuperable odds, whereas here it seemed as if barely 300 made it. Mr Nolan should turn his telescope around."

","I only write a review when a movie is being badly over hyped. Very, very few people alive can actually remember Dunkirk. It is a certainty that those who have written the glowing reviews are neither historians nor veterans, and have no concept of the reality of this World War 2 chapter. This film in no way reveals the true scale or horror of the evacuation of the British Army from France. <br/><br/>Perhaps all these generous 9 and 10 star reviewers feel that Christopher Nolan gave them a first hand education and true taste of war. He did not. The film is grossly inaccurate n both the detail and the representation. <br/><br/>I won't repeat all that other critical reviewers have written - please read some to get a balanced view. However there were some 350,000 troops and some 800 boats. Not the small numbers depicted here. Similarly, it was not fought by 5 German planes and 3 British Spitfires.<br/><br/>This was pure Hollywood indulgence for Nolan. Spitfires that glide without fuel forever. No blood. No groans. No cold. No shivering - not even in a cold, waterlogged uniform. Poor continuity. A debatable soundtrack. A woefully poor use of acting talent and lack of meaningful script. <br/><br/>A film does not always have to be truthful or realistic to be a good film. This film might have provided entertainment for some, but for those who suffered and died in Dunkirk or those who wanted to see the truth, this film is a true let down.<br/><br/>There were also a lot of cheap short cuts used in making this film but, if a film about Ryan Gosling dancing and playing the piano can steal Oscars, this certainly will.<br/><br/>I gave it 1 star to help bring down the average but would otherwise have given it 5."

So many stories of real heroes and heroics to choose from, this Hollywood trash is inaccurate and depressing, focusing mainly on rotten events, and seeming, at least to me, to skimp on matters like extras and facts (photos from the time show warships with crowded decks not just enough to man the sides, ships did not anchor for loading due to the air threat, discipline remained excellent to the very end, even the Spitfires gyroscopic sight in the pretty good flying simulations was wrong for the time). <br/><br/>Apart from Kenneth Branagh's role (and I suspect he might perhaps be embarrassed to be associated with the end version as his role stood apart as fittingly uplifting), this movie is insulting to the greatest generation and the French have a right to be upset too. No doubt many, particularly self-styled intellectuals, will disagree with me, and that's okay, but as one who grew up hearing stories from those who were there at Dunkirk and who has read a great deal about it, I think this travesty of a great story is Hollywood junk(unlike Saving Private Ryan which is excellent)!"

"SaranshTMF","6","19","32","23 July 2017"," Average at best. Over-hyped unnecessarily.
","The film is about an unacknowledged story of WW2 where 400000 men, on a beach, were struggling to survive. Movie shows that despite large in number but still helpless to fight, 300000 soldiers were rescued off the beach by civilians. And instead of getting booed for their cowardliness, they were respectfully welcomed in their homeland. Basically showing a fresh perspective on war that sometimes survival is also a victory. <br/><br/>The moment you walk out of theater, you will forget the film. No strong characters, unnecessary time line shifts to show a straightforward story made me loose interest in the film. IT IS JUST AN ORDINARY FILM. <br/><br/>What could've made it interesting? A focus on how the French sacrificed a lot as an allied force knowing that only 30,000 can survive and British were the first preference. A focus on why only 30,000 soldiers could be saved. This is an interesting one. The water at the beach was very shallow and only one ship could sail ashore at a time during high tide (every six hours or so). A proper background of the events that led to 4000000 soldiers stranded on the beach. It was one of the most clever plan by Germans to make them helpless. Leaflets were thrown (start of the film) asking the french to look at the map. They are surrounded by German army on the front and ocean on the back. There is no way but surrender. However the french saw the shallow ocean as an opportunity to escape ad survive. All these details are missing."

","In 13 years of membership at IMDb.com, I have yet to write a review of a film, but this is the one that has compelled me to do it. (A sentiment I've seen more than once in other reviews of this film on this site.) Nothing happens in this movie. Nothing takes place. No events transpire. There is a paucity of things that unfold. The only way I could write a review of this movie would be to use every synonym that exists for ""nothing"" and ""happens."" The movie is 106 minutes long, and Nothing. Happens.<br/><br/>The glowing professional reviews of this film are pure rubbish. Nobody wants to confront the reality that acclaimed director Christopher Nolan has created one of the single most worthless movies of all time, so instead they praise his colossal failure of a movie by calling it ""unconventional, ""minimalist, ""immersive,"" and any other number of adjectives from the self-congratulatory esoteric lexicon of the self-styled ""cinephile.""<br/><br/>All that being said, I would actually go ahead and recommend you watch this movie once.

","Just saw this yesterday and I really wanted to like it, being an amateur historian in general and big fan of military movies/books in particular (i'm an old navy sailor). Aah where to begin, I guess with the non-chronological, non-linear format; bad idea for this movie. I'm a fan of it in other genres, but it doesn't allow you to engage or get invested in the event being depicted, much less any of the people. It jerks you back and forth from ""week"" to ""day"" to ""hour."" It feels like it's out of sync throughout the whole times being depicted. I loved the Dark Knight and believe it is the greatest superhero movie ever made, plus a genuinely magnificent movie in general; up there with Ben-Hur, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Good The Bad & The Ugly, the Godfather, even Once Upon a Time In American (another out of sequence movie), and so forth. I know it sort of raps up with all three frames, but you even get to see repetitive scenes (albeit from different viewpoints) again and again. The score wasn't anything spectacular, just a little bit overdone, and sometimes even overtook what was going on screen, bad idea. As another reviewer noted, the historical event was a big deal, this movie was supposed to ""film"" it, but you only see 7-8 boats on screen, not the hundreds that were actually used; same goes for the extras; I felt this was a great opportunity for CGI boats, planes, and people; I'm not against it for conveying ""reality"" on screen, especially on a Nolan film, the CGI would have been top-class and wouldn't have been cheesy. Also, the lack of dialogue made it more like a long documentary about the logistics of the event, even though you don't see the grand scale (with a couple of hundred extras, 7-8 boats, and 3-4 planes). I feel bad for not liking this movie more because I'm really appreciative of what the British did at Dunkirk to ""fall-back"" and live to fight another day and eventually defeat Germany in WWII. The ""Greatest Generation"" described in Tom Brokaw's book, which I read, was even greater in the United Kingdom, due to their sacrifices and shared sufferings (bombing of London and other UK cities). This movie deserved to be given one or two people to hang on to and grieve with and cheer for and be afraid with and persevere and survive with. Even though the end ends like that, it was sort of anti-climatic. This was my opinion, one man, not representative of anyone else's view point, of which we all know there are/will be many."

Everyone in it was two-dimensional, and it was impossible to feel a connection with any character, not even the one played by the ordinarily brilliant Thespian Kenneth Branagh. It was like the entire cast, including Branagh, were an assembly of extras. There was precious little dialog, and this movie was an utter stink bomb. This could have been a brilliant movie.

"luqmanfatahillah","3","25","44","28 July 2017"," Void, uninteresting, and cold technical vista from Christopher Nolan
","Nolan has been a storyteller that build his movie on plot rather than character, as the latter were usually just there to move the story along instead of someone to root for. He tried to build fleshed out character in Interstellar and failed to fully portray a human emotion that ultimately renders them unable to be cared about, although he spent the majority of the film trying to get us to care about the characters. In this movie (Dunkirk) he goes back to his usual 'blank-characters and work on plots more' routine and judging by his track record and the lack of clear star actor in the exception of Tom Hardy (who is underutilized and even he didn't bring anything special) anyone coming in the movie expecting a story with no discernible characters are correct. But, what is very confusing is why did he even bother to set up conflicts for these characters (i.e one of the characters from the arc is dead from falling down a stairs (truly) after a certain Cillian Murphy uncharacteristically goes into rampage while he never hinted that the character have violent tendencies due to his shell shock) that requires us to CARE about them in the first place. Okay the 'french- suddenly-thought-to-be-German-Spies- somehow' opened the door that could save some people including the one who were there in the first frame of the film (AKA the young soldier), and that gives us a reason to care when they tried to get him out of the boat while one of the characters tried to stop him and the other are forcing him on gunpoint? If anything, the only tension and dread moment are generated by the score and camera movement and visual. The dialogue itself are..bad. it's on the nose level of exposition, it's uninteresting, and it's just overall unmemorable. Hans Zimmer is a very good composer. How Nolan approach him to do the scores for Interstellar results in a very beautiful score. But his work on Dunkirk is, to say the least, mismatched. To realize that a man like Nolan who insist on shooting his movie on film roll and practical effect would conceive a mismatched, orchestral score that didn't sound grounded and even has techno beat in it that really did not fit the pictures shown. The score is not even memorable, since there's no recognizable theme that would be associated with the movie immediately (such as 'No Time for Caution' in Interstellar or 'Dream is Collapsing' in Inception) and it seems they approach the scoring beat-by-beat rather than working on a certain mood that wants to be conveyed. The visuals are, granted, is beautiful, while there is some poorly lit shot that clearly wasn't meant to be THAT dark. But, it gets tiring after a while due to Nolan's tendencies to reuse the same shot but just from different angle and different object to focus on (like seriously why do we keep seeing the right side of the cockpit on Tom Hardy's plane, is the left gone or something?). On the plus note, the production design and sound editing are of the highest quality. Wouldn't be surprised if it will receive an award or two in that department. The movie takes the theme of survival as an event rather than a state of emotion. It renders the movie to be stone-cold in it's tense moment and dull in it's calm moment (which there is little of), and become something you'd just behold and hear and hopefully immerse yourself in it. But due to his forced effort to make us care about this nameless character, and other reason that is stated above, this could be the least interesting of Nolan's film. I don't see anyone will analyze it's story or direction or even it's color scheme which is downright limited in the coming time. I don't see it as a classic in Nolan's filmography. I see a list of things Nolan should address and wonder where to improve his next project."
"ParkingtonLane","4","25","44","23 July 2017"," Lacked a true villain and gives little reason to support protagonists
","With great expectations for Dunkirk as Nolan has an incredible resume, I was extremely disappointed with Dunkirk. He does a time shift for the three POV's which gives an interesting layering of storytelling; however, what was the benefits to telling to story in this way? In Memento, there is a clear purpose to how Nolan uses time, but in Dunkirk it just seems trivial. <br/><br/>Furthermore, there is no villain, Nolan just relies on ""The Germans"" as an excuse for us to undoubtedly support the British soldiers without ever showing an evil thing that the Germans do besides bomb the soldiers, which is what the British were presumably doing to the Germans. That being said, I had no real reason to support the protagonists. Moreover, Nolan appears to rely on the audiences knowledge of Dunkirk from school and such, but as an American I had no emotional connection to the battle as I had never heard of Dunkirk before. <br/><br/>The Soundtrack seems to be just a lot of noise and doesn't build to anything, especially with the three POV's clashing at points. Also, the British accent can be hard to understand at points as an American.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I feel Nolan did little to establish an emotional connection between the audience and the characters. There was no battle scene, which was disappointing. I left the theater feeling disappointed and unimpressed."
"banknik","7","25","44","21 July 2017"," A good film - but a few scenes missing for a classic
","What Nolan has done with Dunkirk is create an outstanding piece of cinematography, with an interesting concept that works well (the three balanced time-lines taking place at a different pace, a week, a day and an hour). However, there are just a few things missing that prevent this from being a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The first is a simple graphical introduction with maps. I know the assumption is that most people know about Dunkirk (and being a British history teacher, obviously I know the story too), however for global audiences, there simply isn't the knowledge there to understand what is going on. For example, what year is this? What has happened in the war already (the invasion of Poland)? Why is the situation so desperate (because Germany has surrounded the allied forces and overrun the French defenses by going through the Ardennes forest in Belgium)? The USA has not yet entered the war (for American audiences), and nether have the Soviets. The French are about to surrender to Germany, leaving Britian alone to face the Germans. Dunkirks location in relation to England. All of this could have been explained with a short graphical introduction (like in enemy at the gates) of less than 2 minutes long. It wasn't, and therefore it simply looks like the British are running away without any explanation.<br/><br/>The second thing that is missing is the desperation of Dunkirk. By all accounts, the evacuation was generally pretty orderly. However, after the initial introductory scene, there is none of this on the beach in the second half of the film. When things should be getting more desperate (and there were many thousands of British soldiers who got left behind) during the second half, it seems like the Germans stop attacking the beach (except for one lone aircraft that gets shot down by Tom Hardy). This isn't true, and in the end Hitler does order his troops to move in when the air-force fails. Not to mention, the fact that many of the small boats get sunk too - it was an evacuation under fire, this is missing from the end of the movie when the boats turn up. It gives the impression that the evacuation was somehow fine once the boats turned up and does a disservice to the heroes on those boats and the whole first half of the movie (set on the mole - ignoring the parts at sea). This could have all been improved with a bit more artillery and plane attacks at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The final scene which could have been included was Murphey's story - just a few scenes of his own evacuation from the beach - during the second third of the movie (increasing the fact that the mole was a week - whereas at the moment it seems it is two days, not a week), and then how he ended up being the sole survivor on his ship to be rescued - explaining why he is suffering PTSD would justify his earlier attack on the young boy. This would increase the length of the movie to about 2 hours and a bit - which is how long this movie should be. At the moment it is simply too short, and that prevents it being a masterpiece. Shame, because apart from that Nolan did a great job."
"HenryBaker","2","20","34","25 July 2017"," Mind-numbing, repetitive and pointless
","My wife and I left about 80 minutes into the movie. The first 10 minutes shows a pair of soldiers trying to get off the beach on to a boat to England by any way possible, fair or foul. It shows planes flying in formation, breaking off formation, a pilot's eye view of a hard turn, a close up of the pilot, and some gunfire from a plane. It shows the goings-on aboard a small civilian boat heading to Dunkirk to rescue trapped soldiers. It shows a military boat sinking from a bomb or a torpedo, men jumping overboard, and others struggling not to drown. The next ten minutes shows the same thing, as does the next ten minutes, the ten minutes after that, and ... you get the idea. After about our fourth round of ""we've seen this already, and this is going nowhere"", we left. The ""trapped underwater"" scenes are very disturbing even if deaths are avoided or not shown.<br/><br/>The beach, sea and aerial scenes are on different timelines that I assume converge at the end, but it can be very disorienting to jump from day to night and back again between scenes not knowing where the three timelines are relative to one another. There were a few instances of coming into a scene knowing exactly what was about to happen because you had already seen it on another timeline.<br/><br/>I've seen 60-second commercials with more dialog and character development than this movie had 80 minutes in. What a waste of time and money."

I guess they tried to go down to a up close view to intensify but it just falls short. It's too slow to captivate, there's too few things happening considered the grand scale of the Dunkirk operations. It feels like a few hundred men were trapped on a beach and a dozen boats that came to rescue them.

"gwat-91721","2","24","42","30 July 2017"," wonderfully produced nonsense
","My informal summary was: ""a load of crap"".<br/><br/>I could appreciate the wonderfully filmed set pieces, but the overall work was a mess.<br/><br/>First off the tripartite switching between Air:1 hour, Sea:1 day, Land:1 week, just didn't work. All 3 sections lost any sense of continuity, and you were left with a jumble of brief scenarios. For me this was particularly the case with the ""Air"" segments which just became boring interludes.<br/><br/>The other really bad decision, for me, was the choice of the incidents shown. They were just populist trivia that didn't give any sense of the actual battle. For instance, the ""small ship"" is obviously based on a well known case. But the circumstances were completely changed and sensationalised do it gave no insight into the actual events - and where did the manslaughter of the young kid come from??? This segment is actually an insult to the RN who organised and in most cases manned this aspect of the evacuation.<br/><br/>In contrast to the Air section, which was drawn out, the Land section was just a kaleidoscope of jumbled incidents that gave no sense of the passing of time (the evacuation took a week). There was supposed to be a minimal story line, but even so the uniform switching French guy and the prolonged hiding in an abandoned ship were pretty dumb, and where did the idea of ""3 hour tides"" come from. It was all pretty ridiculous, and furthermore the series of silly events, meant that there was no serious attempt to tie the ""immersive effects"" to any basis in the reality of Dunkirk itself."

"lerxstwannabe","3","21","36","24 July 2017"," A Spielberg, Kubrick or Stone, Nolan is not.
","The last truly bad WWII film I ever saw was The Thin Red Line. Dunkirk seems to want to compete for that spot, but still comes in slightly ahead.<br/><br/>I like Nolan, I really do. Interstellar was one of my favorite movies, Inception was great and I loved his recreation of Batman. I also love WWII movies, Band of Brothers being one of the best stories ever to grace the screen, in my opinion. The entire time watching this movie, though, there was one nagging question I had: What if Spielberg directed this?<br/><br/>Chris Nolan really isn't suited to take on a film like this. Dunkirk is a historical drama, about one of the greatest feats in WWII. This has two strikes against Nolan; one is that it's a historical drama, unlike the rest of his portfolio. The second is that WWII is, by its very nature an ""R"" rated period (so to speak) and Nolan seems to thrive in semi-tame PG-13 violence.<br/><br/>""War is Hell""... yet nowhere in this movie do we ever sense that. There's a huge difference between gratuitous violence and realism, mind you and I am not promoting the former. Steven Spielberg is the master of understanding this. Some of his movies are rather violent, yet they use that to drive home the plot and atmosphere of the film. Chris Nolan really, really, desperately needs to take some notes from Spielberg in this area if he wants to be a true master of his art. The desire to stick to this catch-all, watered down PG-13 cash- cow rating, almost seems forced, considering the time period and the topic covered.<br/><br/>Realistic ""R"" rating aside, the tedium of the movie sets in rather quickly. Had I not paid money to see it, and waited for its TV release, I would have changed the channel about 15 minutes in.<br/><br/>This story sets itself up for about half of the film. It takes that long just to understand the characters, their motivations, their situations even their names. Once that's done, the movie starts to show us some promise and hopes to drops us into action, but ends up easing us down gently. Critics may commend Nolan for keeping an even momentum, not letting one part overpower the next - unfortunately it carries the momentum of a brick wall.<br/><br/>The history of Dunkirk is a fine example of human will and strength, it just doesn't make for a gripping story. The events that this movie cover, can be summed up in about 2 pages of a text book, not an entire novel nevermind a 2 hour movie!<br/><br/>A book editor once told me that you should always focus on telling the most interesting moment of a character's life. While the evacuation is interesting, in this movie, it seems the most interesting moments took place just before the events it covers. How did 400,000 soldiers end up getting pushed back to the sea? What battles were fought that drove them so far? What tactics failed so catastrophically?<br/><br/>Dunkirk tells half a story, with the more interesting half taking place before the movie starts. The two hours of this movie could have easily been compressed into 1 hour, with another 2 hours telling the larger story of how the events transpired that led to this point.<br/><br/>Acting wise it's hard to tell. Mark Rylance almost revisits his role as the Russian spy, Rudolf Able in (a much better film) Bridge of Spies. It works. His calm demeanor, yet screen presence is felt and you do make some connection with his character. Of course, that may also be because his character has one of the larger speaking roles throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors are wasted, especially Kenneth Branagh, who has proved himself, time and time again, to be an ""actor's actor"", but has been almost sidelined for the duration of this movie.<br/><br/>I would recommend waiting for this film to reach a cable channel before you fork out the $12+ for a ticket if I would recommend this movie at all. As it stands, do yourself a favor and binge watch Band of Brothers in order to get a much more rewarding WWII experience."

To cover up the boredom of the movie they have hired the master composer Hans Zimmer. The problem is that that Hans has accidentally composed the ""thrilling"" soundtrack for a completely wrong movie. The music mainly consists of ""thrilling"" buzzing noise made with synthesizer and also of tick-tock sound of a stopwatch which stops few times during the movie just for the reason that it can start again in a minute. The soundtrack just doesn't fit for this movie at all.

"Beakyboy","2","22","38","10 August 2017"," A wasted opportunity
","We had been waiting with anticipation to see this film. It had received mixed reviews but we kept open minds. I'm afraid the bad reviews are correct, the film is wasted opportunities. There is a far better Dunkirk made in 1958 starring John Mills and Richard Attenborough which stands head and shoulders above this latest attempt. Or the BBC 2004 TV film starring Timothy Dalton and Benjamin Cumberbatch which explains how the rescue was planned and implemented. Both had more realism and drama and made you understand the incredible feat that Dunkirk was.<br/><br/>The Dunkirk story is as much about the little ships but little was made of these, they just started across the channel with much of the film taken up by one of them. There should have been nearly 2000 vessels of all sizes involved in the rescue but all we saw were a handful at best. Similarly the RAF flew nearly 5000 missions over Dunkirk, not the three or four planes shown. The weather in 1940 was also inclement over France for nearly a week which prevented the Luftwaffe from taking off. The film shows a beautiful blue sky.<br/><br/>On the French beaches, there wasn't enough actors or CGI to make it look like hundreds of thousands of men waiting for rescue, more like a couple of hundred at best. The French soldiers were indicated by half a dozen actors and there was no Indian or other Colonial troops represented, just queues of caucasians. Meanwhile Branagh stands woodenly, gurning at something for most of the film. Rylance might as well have been the BFG as there was no difference in his acting.<br/><br/>The worst part was Tom Hardy as a Spitfire pilot (probably more accurate to have given him a Hurricane which out numbered Spitfires and were tasked with attacking bombers). The end of his role was just unbelievably silly. As was scenes of downed aircraft floating as if they were made of wood and polystyrene.<br/><br/>I would like to see a Peter Jackson version of Dunkirk. Nolan's 2017 attempt is a weak script and weak directing, both of which are his responsibility."

I should have asked for a refund. I can only say that the film lacks at so many levels that one simply can not connect with it unless there is a pre-existing bias of some sort. Then again, I did not watch the end, but even if it is spectacular, which I seriously doubt, I sincerely wish that I would have done something more productive with my time and money."

","Worst war film in a long time. What this movie had to do with Dunkirk is a mystery to me. It was basically a series of battles ranging from air battles to sea battles to shore battles. It could have been titled anything for all it had to do with Dunkirk. Dunkirk was just a convenient background for your typical war movie. Also, how come it was nighttime in Dunkirk when it was daytime in the channel? And how was the dead stick spitfire able to fly for what seemed like an hour before landing? The dialog was almost incoherent o many occasions. Don't waste your money on this dud."
"kaptenvideo-89875","8","10","15","1 August 2017"," Dunkirk"" is the Nolan movie that has touched me the most
","Ahh... Nolan. Who doesn't love Christopher Nolan, eh? One of the most acclaimed directors working today, a cinematic genius behind modern classics such as ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""The Prestige"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar""... Well, I hate to be a party pooper (as always), but I have never shared the mad love every other movie fan I know has to share for him. I mean, his works are a'ight, but I never found them to be as great as everybody else seemed to think. I guess I liked early Nolan the best – ""Memento"" and especially ""Insomnia"" –, when he was more interested in characters and building suspense than just creating the biggest baddest epics available. Of course, Nolan is good at creating suspense and orchestrating action setpieces, but even his best works ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" have suffered from being overlong and pompous. Not to mention his third and last Batman which felt like a big pompous piece of crap. Having written all that, I liked ""Dunkirk"" a lot. It's not only one of the finest movies of 2017 (so far), one of the most thoughtful war dramas I've seen, and also Nolan's best yet. Although if you go to cinema expecting his usual, you may well leave disappointed, because this epic World War II tale is quite unlike anything we have come to associate him with. After all these years, it must be supremely difficult to create a war drama with something fresh to show or say. But Nolan is not afraid of challenges, and he has managed to pull off a movie which is both epic and intimate, artsy and mainstream- friendly, adrenaline-filled and deep at the same time. It's what the movie lovers always wait for but rarely get: a thinking man's blockbuster. ""Dunkirk"" shows the experience of war from the another angle rarely seen or thought of, at least in movies. It's about human frailty, loneliness, isolation and enduring the limbo between chaos and salvation that war is made of. Of course, there's also enough explosions and eye-candy, but the whole thing is rather artsy in a good way. Not much dialogue or clearly defined events too, just people waiting (because there's nothing else left for them to do) and trying to survive. There is not even a single clearly-defined central character, although there are several main story lines to follow, sometimes not in chronological form. The story is about thousands of Allied troops surrounded by enemy forces, trapped on the beach and waiting for rescuing. We have some well-known actors here, such as Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy, but it's not really an actor's movie (ie, meant to let somebody shine) but fitting everything into a carefully crafted cinematic mosaic. Speaking about war part, I especially loved the flight and air battle scenes. The immediacy, the sound effects. Also the fact that they were often made from pilot's viewpoints, so it feels more realistic. The pilot shoots and we see target plane catching fire only after a while, for example. All in all, Dunkirk"" is the Nolan movie that has touched me the most. It's about real things, emotions and experiences, and the action is thrillng. Another beautiful achievement for one of the most liked and successful auteurs working in mainstream cinema today. Watched it in IMAX which probably add something to the experience, at least from technical standpoint. But it's surely a good looking and sounding movie on any screen or setup, methinks."
"Anillusion","7","10","15","23 July 2017"," I wanted more in a Nolan film
","I saw Dunkirk at the Dolby Cinema in Eindhoven (NL) last Friday with a friend and in the end we both didn't really know what to think of it. It's by no means a bad movie, I mean visually...man...Hoytema has done terrific cinematic work. Hans Zimmers score was again a stunning combination of sound design and music. But for a Christopher Nolan film the movie left something to be desired. In the past, every film he did, it kept you thinking about it. The implications, the deeper meanings of what Nolan is trying to say to us as a story teller. This one doesn't do that. It's an unfolding of events, and although spectacular, it keeps the audience at a distance. To me the movie screamed 'look at me, look at me' but when you look at it, it doesn't communicate its message. Does it even have a message? Apart from Mr. Dawson I did not connect with any of the characters. When his son dies, I feel for him. I don't feel for any other person who dies. I would compare this with Schindler's List, which has lots of (unnamed) characters, the girl with the glasses, the little boy who tries to hide, the girl with the red jacket, to name the obvious ones. Maybe they have names, but my point is they aren't main characters and their names aren't important. But you experience some of the story by following their events. Dunkirk is a movie that's contrived only of those kind of characters and it constantly jumps between them. Even between time frames, which disoriented me.<br/><br/>And there's nothing wrong doing this in a movie, but in my opinion you have to compensate this with context. A reason or connection of why you do this. Why are you telling it this way? Also when a movie starts or ends with titles, and those titles are so crucial to your story that if left out, you can't explain (part of) the movie, for me that's a tell that in the cutting room they discovered the movie or a part of it didn't work on its own. The jumping between time lines could have been fixed by connecting those time lines at some point halfway through the movie or maybe another clever trick. He's Christopher Nolan after all, or are we discovering that it was actually Jonathan who was the clever mind behind Chistophers movies? We don't need opening titles that tell us about hacking minds to gain access to peoples dreams. Inception tells us this as the movie unfolds, although the exposition scene with Ellen Page was a bit too much. The introduction of the Joker in the Dark Knight or Bane in the Dark Knight Rises. We don't need to know who these characters are for the audience to become intrigued by them. I for one did not know the Bane character before seeing the Dark Knight Rises. But the introduction alone, just hearing his name makes you fear him. Memento takes us on a journey discovering what's happening and what has happened. Interstellar, how it connects time and events. Cause and effect are connected. Each movie brilliant on their own. But for me, Dunkirk doesn't fit in this list of movies.<br/><br/>Again, I'm not saying Dunkirk was a bad movie. It just isn't, and I still gave it a 7. If it were any other director, I wouldn't be writing this. But for me it wasn't enough of a movie to feel whole. For a Christopher Nolan film, I wanted more, I wanted to be inspired, I wanted to be thinking about the deeper meaning of the movie, I wanted to feel the need to re-watch this over and over and I didn't get that. I just got a movie."

Based on true story, yet fictional. Dunkirk happened, yet not like in this movie. It was a lot more messier and bloodier. In the end this seemed like big budget fan film for one WW2 battle). Tom Hardy's performance was very Bane-ish (after watching the movie you'll know what I mean), so if he wasn't pushed on by studio, just because movie needed big name to be in this big budget movie, then Nolan made mistake by casting him. Would be better with someone with no name (at least no name at the moment). Must admit that even I didn't like movie story wise, I admired cinematography. All shots and effects were outstanding, I wish there would be more movies like this every year. It was so nice to enjoy those practical effects.

The cinematography was awesome, watching the dogfights from boat level. Mark Rylance (Bridge of Spies) & son's journey was inspiring. As was dog-fighting on fumes by Hardy's character. I went to the show for the story and because Cillian Murphy & Tom Hardy were in it. I was disappointed that there was no backstory. This would have been a better movie at 2 1/2 hrs. Had expected Churchill & war room discussion/argument with the Naval Command. Very little in WW11 happened without the Commonwealth and as I understand it British India Forces were at Dunkirk and white outed out of the story. As was Cmr. Cloustons' massive contribution to the evacuation. I was disappointed that the movie was too short and didn't have the politics in it and the Commonwealth wasn't represented at all. I'll read books on Dunkirk but I wouldn't see the movie again."
"andrew-riddell-1","4","12","19","8 August 2017"," Lost Opportunity
","I totally love WW2 movies, so when the trailers for Dunkirk came out it was a definite one to see. Dunkirk was a true testament to the British people who sailed out in small boats to bring home the BEF. This was a true story of heroic private citizens saving the day, so did the movie show the true scale of this remarkable feat. In my opinion it did not, you never felt the monumental scale of the evacuation or the danger that the BEF were subjected to on the beach. Instead the focus was on a few characters and what they went through, now this may have worked better if it wasn't for the fact that their stories and how the all interact doesn't happen at the same time. One minute you are at night with one character and then during the day with another, why the story wasn't filmed as each character went through their own individual stories is a missed opportunity. Dunkirk is at best a good movie but no classic war movie, so it will not end up there with the greats."

","I have been a fan of Christopher Nolan since I saw ""Memento"", and Cillian Murphy is good in everything he does, so I was really looking forward to this film. What an enormous disappointment.<br/><br/>I have to wonder why film critics are doing an ecstatic dance over it; being Christopher Nolan does not give you an automatic pass to having your film considered great. This is the worst movie I've seen in quite a while, regardless of director.<br/><br/>What the film presents is about a half dozen sub stories but with no simultaneous time frame; it hops from one scene to the next with no continuity. Nowhere are we able to make an emotional connection with the characters, which is really the key to a fine film. It was simply a collage of well acted scenes about war thrown together into one huge mess. <br/><br/>Maybe Nolan felt he was unable to due justice to those who so courageously stood at Dunkirk without bringing in sub stories. He should have found a better film editor to attempt to tie it all together."
"ericbouron","5","12","19","28 July 2017"," The importance of sound.
","I won't judge the film based on the cinematography nor the editing nor the scenario. I actually learned a lot with this movie about the importance of sound. <br/><br/>In cinema, and for those who know know how the production of movies works out there, we know that the sound department is a class apart. The first ready to shoot, the least important department during the shooting because anyways, in post-production it will be resolved, right?<br/><br/>This is where Nolan missed it badly and sunk the movie like one of the ships. I sincerely have no idea how the producers let Cristopher Nolan get away with this. Usually the Nolan's movies are so weird in a way that catches people''s attention that they don't pay attention to the plot holes because the atmosphere that are created are so immersive that we don't care. <br/><br/>Dunkirk is not one of his usual movies where the story itself is an unknown with surprises that keeps you on the edge of the seat. Dunkirk is more of a trying to be contemplative like Malick's war movie, and stressful like a Spielberg's war movie. He tried to stay in between the two keeping his overwhelming sound that literally turns off the immersion. He tries so hard to create an atmosphere, that you begin to wonder if he even trust the images he is filming.<br/><br/>The amount of sound in every moment of the film tries so hard to keep you there, that you ask yourself if why not a simple moment of silence could not do the job.<br/><br/>Nolan's team of sound design and mix failed to create an immersive experience (I saw it on IMAX) that made me always stay away of the movie and made me realize the lack of depth in the movie. It's not a ""war movie"", it's a ""survival movie"" and the bad sound editing and mixing makes it none of both. <br/><br/>There are some many specific moments that we could discuss (the soldiers in the boat for example) but the main idea is this: I will listen to all movie that are nominated to the Oscars in best sound editing and sound mixing. Nolan and his team failed so bad that we should take a moment to appreciate how hard is the job of the sound department and how precious is a moment of silence."
"spasek","6","12","19","25 July 2017"," Underwhelming and Uninspiring Attempt
","The best war films have one major thing in common: they focus on the people rather than the events. If you shuttle us from one event to another without focusing on the people, then the attempt is hollow and shallow. Unfortunately, this is the type of film that Nolan gives us. He moves us from one area with hardly any characterization at all. So why should we be emotionally vested? <br/><br/>I had my doubts as well when this movie was given a PG-13 rating. The best war films of the past forty years or so have all be R-rated films. Storytellers and filmmakers know not to hold back on the horrors of war. Veterans of Dunkirk speak of how it was like being in hell. We don't feel that nearly poignantly enough. <br/><br/>Dunkirk was an event that saw over 800 ships involved in the rescue as well as several hundred British aircraft (not the lone three that we see in the film), of which approximately 177 were lost. Furthermore, the combined efforts of the British/French troops holding off the Germans in the various towns isn't even addressed except for a couple of minutes during the opening scenes. Dunkirk should have been a 3-hour film, encompassing the entire theater that was Dunkirk, with focus on characters in various places to give us the sense of the desperation of what the Battle of Dunkirk was all about. Instead, Nolan chooses to only focus on small aspects of the battle without giving us much substance at all.<br/><br/>The pulsing music ultimately fails as well, utilizing a similar style as the one used to introduce the Joker in Dark Knight. Except, instead of using it for ten minutes to increase the intensity, it's used throughout the entire film! Ultimately, because of its overuse, the music loses its power and effectiveness and ends up becoming just annoying. <br/><br/>Despite its glaring flaws, the cinematography is very well done. The air combat scenes were impressive, as three planes do their best to protect the boats and ships attempting the rescue. Historically, 243 ships were sunk. A prime opportunity should have been utilized to really get a feel for these civilians trying desperately to cross the channel. Instead, we get a wasted effort.<br/><br/>I could easily list over twenty war films that are far superior to Dunkirk. And given that it was one of the pivotal events of World War II, it should have been given the respect that its veterans deserve. The movie lacks cohesiveness as well as emotion. Nolan should refrain from doing another war film. Not only did he fail to utilize characters as the focal points, he failed historically as well, which is nearly a crime in and of itself."
"JackCerf","6","12","19","24 July 2017"," A Technically Interesting Failure
","Saw it this weekend and thought it clever and well done but ultimately uninvolving despite the high level of tension it keeps up. I think it was overpraised by critics who admire Nolan as a technician, and I'd give it no more than a 6/10. It was interesting to see how Nolan converged the three time lines on a single point, but the dynamic in each timeline was very different. <br/><br/>The one hour RAF timeline with Tom Hardy was pure action. Hardy's character makes two moral decisions, one quite unexpected, but you have to pay close attention to see them. Since I get chills whenever I see footage of a Spitfire, which Mark Rylance's character rightly calls the most beautiful airplane ever built, I was fully involved, but this action sequence didn't have the weight to carry one third of the movie. See Messerschmitt, dodge Messerschmitt, shoot Messerschmitt, da capo al fine.<br/><br/>The most conventional segment, with the most character realization, was the one day timeline with Mark Rylance as a civilian pleasure boat owner displaying middle class stiff upper lip. His reasons aren't fully disclosed until the end, and there's a coda that, in the light of hindsight, gives you the difference between what happened and how it was reported and passed into memory. More I can't disclose without a spoiler.<br/><br/>The one week timeline involving the troops on the beach is a failure. There simply wasn't enough social interaction among the men for the audience to relate to them as individuals or to their experience. Inarticulate fear will only take you so far, and that's all Nolan had to offer with the squaddies. It would have been more effective if ""Tommy,"" whose name we never hear, were part of a small unit instead of a lone straggler-fugitive trying to attach himself to others. Then there might have been some grumbling, some mordant humor, some defeatism, or some other character developing conversation among people who already knew and trusted one another. Not here. Kenneth Branagh's character was a very heavy-handed Basil Exposition and nothing more. Nolan uses him to give a data dump and then ignores him till the next data dump is needed to orient the audience.<br/><br/>Apparently Nolan finds the prospect of drowning while trapped under water to be particularly horrifying. He returns to that situation several times, in different settings and from different viewpoints. This contrasts with the complete absence of realistic wounds from the bombing; in that respect, the picture is as sanitized as a 1950s war movie. <br/><br/>There are a few good throwaway lines. One that sticks in the mind is that as Tommy makes his way through a French barricade towards the beach, one of the French soldiers mordantly wishes him bon voyage."

It apparently attempted to isolate on a couple individual story lines, but the characters are for the most part very poorly developed. <br/><br/>Mark Rylance/Mr. Dawson/Father/Boat Captain was pretty much the only character that was developed enough to hold any interest. Tip for Producers/Directors: If you get Kenneth Branagh for your movie, use him one hell of a lot more and better than they did in ""Dunkirk."" <br/><br/>No one else was developed enough to be of any real interest. <br/><br/>Furthermore, I didn't think the movie did a very good job of showing either how desperate the situation was for the soldiers stranded there or the magnitude and difficulty of the evacuation. Near the end, it is like a ""oh yeah, here comes the Cavalry"" with some rote shots of some smaller vessels coming to evacuate. <br/><br/>Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was distinctly dissatisfied with this movie. Not a horrible movie, but definitely one I found disappointing."

I did not feel the fear or suspense of the retreating soldiers like some of the positive reviews have said. I understand that not every war movie needs to be gratuitously violent and rather tell a story, but the characters really had nothing that can excite or interest a viewer. Most of the characters are extremely boring and show little to no emotion. The one shell-shocked soldier portrayed seems almost forced. I never really cared about anyone because they were all severely undeveloped characters. I don't even know any of their names because they were so forgettable. Lacks in action and story.

The chopping and changing of scenes that overlap the timeline make the movie so damn confusing. Half the movie you're watching a plane drop out of the sky and you start to feel it's an Inception scene and you're screaming ""would the van just hit the water already!!!""
Whatever made them think this would work is beyond me.
Not to mention the lame perspective they showed of an armada of civilian ships coming to the rescue. In reality the rescue operation was large and the fleet was massive. In the movie they show one fishing boat and a ferry. Whoop whoop! We're all saved!! Please....
Oh, and its bloody loud! And I dont mean enjoyably loud, I mean ""grab your ear buds matey, or you'll be deaf by the credits!"" No joke, good lucky watching this at home. Keep the remote close by to balance the sound for the entire movie.
I was really looking forward to this, but found myself drowned in confusion. By all means watch it, simply so you can say ""oh yeah, that guy had a point..."""

","I'll be honest. I watched less than an hour of this before bailing out. Whatever good may have happened after I turned off the TV, it could not possibly outweigh the absolute crap I'd seen up until that point. It's an insult to the men who risked and lost their lives to misrepresent such a pivotal event in the 20th century. Really, all the dramatic freight you need for a fantastic movie is there in Dunkirk. All you have to do is tell the story and you'd have a great film. Instead, there is this mish-mash of whatever random blah blah yuk stupidity. Yes, that is exactly as much sense as it makes, any of it. I was not just disappointed, I was insulted. A generation of young people will grow up with a very badly mistaken impression about Dunkirk, and that is the worst possible outcome of a bad movie about a historical event. Shame on all the people responsible for this completely crap movie."

","I'm not going to belabor this because there seem to be many reviewers here that have already done my work for me.<br/><br/>All I saw and heard in this film was an overly loud disjointed mess. I know of the non-linear story structure and have no problem with that in other films, but this film gave me nothing to actually hook onto to keep my interest. The beach, the planes, the sea. Lather, rinse, repeat. By the one hour mark, I stopped caring and came here to see what others thought and if maybe it was just me. Apparently, no. VERY disappointing film from Nolan. Watch it if you must, maybe you'll see something I couldn't."

","This movie is just not that good.<br/><br/>It starts out very promising, the first 15min of the movie make you excited for what is about to come next. But as the movies goes on, you realize that the dialogue (the little that was in this movies) is not good. The plot is scattered all around the place. The characters have no story, some of them don't even have names. The timeline trick was really not that clever. And the emotional connection was non existent due to all of the aforementioned reasons.<br/><br/>Never once did i feel, while watching this movie, the epic magnitude of the situation. When Branagh's character stated how many soldiers where saved i almost choked on my popcorn, because the beach looked like it had max. a few hundred men waiting in line. Nolan should have used cgi, at least on the beach scenes.<br/><br/>There were few things that were silly and felt rushed. A young boy accidentally suffers a fatal wound, and the old man responsible for him doesn't even bat an eye. The boy ends up being dead, and the old man still couldn't care less. Tom hardy's character flies on an aircraft out of gas for what seems to be an eternity. Then lands the plane nice and neat on the enemy shore, when he could have landed it anywhere safe. <br/><br/>Nolan should get help when writing scripts. Action alone do not make a movie."

All actors played well, especially Mark Rylance (he was also great in Bridge of Spies). However when the film ended, i was feeling bored. I could wait for a few months to rent this movie on some video-on-demand service. If you expect an epic film, think twice. I totally disagree with the 8.4 rating. It should be around 6.5."

","I'm generally hooked on historic movies, usually fascinated by the aspect alone that the events displayed really happened.<br/><br/>Sadly however that is about the only grace the movie can offer. Absolutely bland & one-dimensional characters, the antagonist SS- Officer was a complete joke - especially if you're capable of the German language. (grammatically this didn't even resemble German at times + there wasn't a single authentic line in the entire movie.) <br/><br/>In its entirety Dunkirk has nothing to offer, but a few 'heroics'. - Not once have I been sucked into this story. Not once have I felt an inkling of the immediate threat of the situation.<br/><br/>All that aside, perhaps the worst thing about this movie are the overwhelmingly positive reviews of critics. I know war hero stories from WW2 are a sanctity few would mess with - but this movie stands as a shameful testament towards that bias. <br/><br/>I was expecting more from Nolan, hopefully he will get back to his old self."
"paolomarchiodi","1","21","37","16 September 2017"," When ""computer generated imagery"" can teach you a lesson in history
","For sure, many and many viewers went to the cinema with great expectations for the movie Dunkirk. Most of them thinking it would be like the ""New Saving Private Ryan"". Unfortunately it is not so, and not in the sense that it is not an action packed block-buster. First of all, Dunkirk is not a bad movie, but it is not the movie it was expected to be and was so anticipated. The decision taken by the film director Christopher Nolan, not to use computer graphic, or to use it as less as possible, was in this case, in my opinion, the wrong choice. I speak as a history buff, so obviously, I had great expectation in seeing huge scenes and pictures, that only movies can give from past events, like bringing a history book or memories of veterans alive. Dunkirk isn't that, and that is, in my opinion its greatest flaw. It is important, for such a movie, to let you learn something, to get an impression, to perceive a past event, something maybe you have read about, but you never could really imagine. This is were Saving Private Ryan, speaking about WW2, (pardon me this comparison, it is the first that comes to mind, I could cite countless others Stalingrad, U-96 or for example Platoon for Vietnam War), really shines and where Dunkirk completely fails. Transmitting you an impression, a feeling for such true immense and tragic events. In Dunkirk, you have to imagine what is happening around the focus of the camera, you have to know the context, you don't get it served, transmitted. Before you go for this movie, to really appreciate it, you have to document yourself, or most of what Dunkirk was, a true gigantic episode in history, will simply don't emerge or even reach you. In my opinion a war movie, or maybe a movie with a historical background has to literally take you to its time, transport you in its century and let you leave the movie hall with a feeling of astonishment, curiosity and desire to learn more about what you just saw, maybe even kindle a passion in in the specific subject. With Dunkirk this is not the case, it is a good drama, but for sure it is not a history lesson and even less a historical movie. At the most, it will leave you some impressions, that you get from the different points of view from the protagonists, but all them without a real and remaining contextualization. Nothing that will make you think about it on your way back home, nothing that will stick in our memories and maybe would have helped to fill a gap in the common knowledge, of so many of us."

","I love Christopher Nolan's films. So unusual and most have great depth. He is terrific at using a creative imagination. I feel he should not have come within coo-ee of a true War story. It is not his genre. I am stunned - although I guess I should not be - at the high ratings from so-called experts. Were they facing the screen when this was on. <br/><br/>Why do Americans have to spell everything out for us? A plane makes a massive thud into the ocean as it is shot down and one of the men says ""It's down"". Thanks for letting us know. Then you see 30 men swimming towards a boat and I think the same guy says ""There are man in the water"". Really? I thought they were dolphins. Do we really need Cellos and Horns to try and build tension. I do understand the war was tense. We don't need bloody Cellos to inform us. I missed most of the dialogue. I felt sorry for the Cello players. They are probably in hospital right now with some repetitive injury.<br/><br/>The actors looked so disengaged. The older dude in the small boat got emotional once and it looked weird. Kenneth Brannagh looked like he was on Prozac. He probably teared up towards the end because it was possibly the worst movie ever made. Tom Hardy wore a mask through the whole movie until the last minute. One of the finest British actors and you cannot see his expression nor hear him over stupid Cellos. <br/><br/>There was flitting between time lines without explanation. Cillian Murphy suddenly appears on a boat refusing to let some men on. Like huh? A boy gets killed for no reason and nobody really cares. The son of the captain starts to care and then he suddenly stops caring for some reason. There is mention of 300,000 men on the beach. Were they in crab-holes? <br/><br/>Lastly with all the budget on this movie why do war scenes in other movies make these look dull?"

","I am sorry to say I was disappointed in this movie. After all the hype and trailers for this movie I found it boring. I was expecting a war epic with much more action and more of a story line concerning the rescue of the all the men trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk. The attempt of the producers to have the audience bond with the characters, I feel failed. The only persons that I did felt connected to were the captain of the small pleasure craft and his son. These two coming from England to the beach of Dunkirk I enjoyed. There should have been more emphasis on the real story here, that being the hundreds of ships, small and large, that were the real heroes of this historic event."
"Pete_merritt","1","13","21","10 September 2017"," Very Very Disappointed
","I was so spectacularly disappointed with this film and found so many areas of its story just so badly executed. Its so sad to see how films like this create an almost placebo like effect with movie goers falling over themselves to describe them as being the most breathtaking cinematic events they have ever seen when in reality they are just simply passable. Why am I saying this? I feel that Christopher Nolan failed in an almost epic scale to show the true scale of men, machines and vessels that were on those beaches during the evacuation. At no time did It feel that there were anymore than 500 men on the beaches and this itself was so poor and ineptly executed. If this film had been made 30 years ago by a seasoned director then there would have literally been 4000 extras used to create the atmosphere and cinematography required, and yet this film just relied on some CGI of a few hundred?<br/><br/>There were several scenes that seriously made absolutely no sense for example hundreds of men all lined up on the jetty in possession of their rifles ( 303 Lee Enfields ) and when the inevitable German Stuka bomber made its way towards them on a bombing run all of them (apart from one bloke) instead of aiming their hundreds of rifles towards the air and at least giving something back to the enemy before their fates were sealed, they all just decided to duck and hold their tin hats? It was just stupid and not a human response in conflict. There were no rudimentary light machine gun positions with Bren guns to provide any form of token anti-aircraft screen and it was just really really poor. Im not looking for the film to be some gung ho war film but it deserved to be realistic and it wasn't.<br/><br/>Kenneth Brannaghs role in the film felt was under whelming and just didn't work. I found his acting his usual one dimensional self when playing an historical British figure although the one he played in this was just a fictional character. Again Nolan invented parts of the story as at no point did any Sea Lord or Admiral set foot on the beaches to either orchestrate or pass on instructions or messages, this again showed just how weak the story-telling was.<br/><br/>I found the idea that there were only three Spitfires available on that given day just stupid and again resembled nothing like what actually happened.<br/><br/>The way the story jumped around and Cillian Murphys slight back story ( one scene from when he was picked up ) was again poorly handled and just didn't work.<br/><br/>Again the director spectacularly failed to impress upon us the true scale of what it was like to be there and also at the end the actual number of small crafts that were involved. The scene where Mark Rylance looks across the horizon at a gaggle of no more than 30 boats was just totally underwhelming.<br/><br/>The scenes where the soldiers go onto the beached trawler was quite frankly non-sensical, were the British soldiers practicing their marksmanship and if so why??? Bearing in mind the last thing any troops who had just been in combat for the past few weeks would be needing to do whilst sat on a beach waiting for rescue was to worry about re-zeroing their weapons?? Or was it the advancing Germans? Again why would German troops be looking at practicing their marksmanship skills when they were already in contact and about to re-engage with the enemy? The whole trawler thing was just so inept especially when the troops only decided to get out of it when it was literally submerged?<br/><br/>For anyone who even in passing studied the Dunkirk evacuation this film was an utter mess but even worse it really failed to honour the story and the lives of those involved.<br/><br/>There is a terrible lack of talent in film making these days, people don't dare question such films and like sheep just follow the hype...."

","Nolan is one of my favorite directors and I was waiting for this movie to come out and finally it did. For the first time in my life I had to literally escape the theater because the volume was unbelievably high. There were so many high frequency sounds that I couldn't stand listening to the soundtrack. I play in a rock band and I am used to loud sounds and yet I had to exit the cinema. It took me nearly 2 hours to fully recover. Some of the people had their hands covering the hears for most of the scenes. The movie is amazing but I think it's totally useless if you can't enjoy it. Would you still like a beautiful sunset next to a worker operating a huge drill? I will wait for the DVD to be able to lower the volume and watch the ending.

A film with no meaningful story-line or content but plenty of bombast. And noise. Oh, the noise, the noise! It was loud, excruciatingly loud, unnaturally and unnecessarily so, far beyond the pain barrier for my ears. Which I had to cover for much of it as I found it so physically painful. Why so loud? I came out of it reeling and shell-shocked. And as for the 70mm IMAX giant screen experience, what nonsense. I get sharper and better quality pictures on my home TV. It was just very much bigger. The actors wee Mark Rylance and wee Kenneth Branagh were cruising, not having to act at all, just look heroic, misty-eyed and lantern-jawed from time to time, and think of the money. And given given the budget it was disappointing to keep seeing the same three Spitfires, one German Me109 and a single Heinkel He111 in the same shots over and over again. And as for that near-end shot of a burning Spitfire on Dunkirk beach set to Elgar's jingoistic music, that said it all."

Which of the planes we see knocked down is one we saw at another point - or shall see at another point from a different perspective? We don't care); the indifferent film score - nothing too grand, no real crescendo, nothing that could be described as patriotic; long long stretches in which nothing happens; the deliberate undercutting of the idea of the people as having an idealism great than self-interest - and many of the principal characters deliberately sabotaging the overall effort - or deceiving others - or acting in a xenophobic way - or committing suicide out of fear ... anything to undermine a ""spirit of Dunkirk"" emotional feeling; All this is quite deliberate by the director - and to have just spent $50 ($23.50 for the IMAX seat, another $27 for a hot dog, soda and popcorn) - simply makes one far more reluctant to attend a movie - no matter the many (wrong-headed) plaudits."

"Ravenloftrealm","1","13","21","3 August 2017"," One of the most over-rated films of all time
","I hated this film. Why? Don't get me started. But then again, let me get started. The whole tone of this film is all wrong. There is something 'flat' about the whole thing. First of all, there is no battle here. What we have is a series of isolated skirmishes usually involving a few planes here and a few planes there. In fact, this film has so little 'scope' in terms of battle intensity that if I didn't know better I'd say it was shot on a low budget. <br/><br/>The film has no star power. It's filled with a bunch of actors I never heard of. Tom Hardy is in it, but you'd never know it since he's wearing gear in his Spitfire.<br/><br/>The film is told exclusively from the British side and there are no German characters in it. Since the film is so dry and dull being so British, one can only speculate on whether it would have been of help to get the German perspective as the battle unfolds. <br/><br/>Aside from one scene with street fighting, there is no action involving tanks or infantry. All the airplane and ship stuff just get monotonous. <br/><br/>The film cross cuts tediously to a small boat in which an older man and two young guys are heading to Dunkirk with a sailor they picked up at sea and two young soldiers, one British and one French, who are using their wits to just get off the beach and into a boat or ship. In fact two thirds of the movie involve this small boat and these two soldiers trying to catch a ride home.<br/><br/>As a point of comparison, 'Fury' absolutely crushes this film and if you want to see a good world war II movie I recommend that one. ""Enemy At The Gate' also had some really powerful battle scenes. I just think they could have done this much differently and much better."

","The movie started like a good movie could've started. Very slow paced and didn't really give much. I really like beginnings like that though as it adds tension and mystique. But throughout the second half of the movie I thought I was seriously being pranked. I could only come to the conclusion that the cinema, the director or God (I'm an atheist) was pointing a camera at me and filming my facial reactions as the movie progressed to later laugh at it.<br/><br/>When you watch a movie made from Christopher Nolan, that has a stellar reputation of directing top 250 IMDb movies, you expect nothing less from Dunkirk. Instead Nolan took a 180 turn from what he has previously done, what he in my opinion is best at, and made this emotionless, insanely expensive and straight out lame movie, that I just was begging to end.<br/><br/>But the real and only reason I am writing this (went on to recover my password to write my first and only review) is because of all you guys calling this a ""masterpiece"". I just can't understand how this is happening again. First it was Gravity, and now Dunkirk. <br/><br/>It's like you fail to grasp the concept of a movie which, yes, is a great plus if made realistic, but it must contain some kind of PLOT. This movie had nothing remotely close to a plot, much less a twist, which naturally makes the movie dull, empty and simply not a movie but a documentary at best.<br/><br/>I'm guessing the next over-hyped movie will be filming a guy for a week doing absolutely nothing special, that barely talks and then let's also pointlessly mix up the time-line to make it extra confusing so you call it a masterpiece because it represents reality? <br/><br/>It's tiring guys. Firstly because you made me waste money, and also because you simply cannot move your a**es to look out the window if you now crave reality in it's purest form so much.<br/><br/>1/10 because of the hype <br/><br/>4/10 movie (for the effort and time it must have taken and because Nolan somehow managed to get this out into the public)<br/><br/>Jeez."

","I was waiting for this film with great anticipation since it was announced many months ago.<br/><br/>WWII films are one of my favorites genres, and with that, I am talking about classics like The Guns Of Navarone, The Eagle Has Landed, Saving Private Ryan, etc.<br/><br/>Keeping that in mind, I must say that I left the theatre utterly disappointed, not only with the shallow narrative of a major WWII event but, with the way Chris Nolan decided to tell his story.<br/><br/>** SPOILERS AHEAD **<br/><br/>The three point of view storytelling is somewhat confusing, first because it is not so obvious what Nolan is trying to do, it takes a while to notice the dynamics, and, the always present continuity errors (gross sometimes) do not help either. I am not attached to traditional storytelling, and most of the films I like had some kind of alternate scripts, but for my liking, it went a bit too far with Dunkirk.<br/><br/>Another major flaw is the shallowness of the story, all the characters are almost like supporting characters, with no lead or at least one or two characters you feel empathy for. Maybe Noland made the ""lead character"" the event itself, but it is not depicted with depth or detail (I will not mention historical accuracy) it deserves either.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake was, in both positive and negative senses (caveat: I am an aviation enthusiast and work as an airline pilot), the air combat scenes. Impressive work and kudos for Nolan for not using only CGI, always a pleasure to see, and hear, some Spitfire/RR Merlin in action. The air combat sequences were, indeed, the highlight for me.<br/><br/>But also a major disappointment, as ** MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD ** the final sequences practically disregarded all the laws of aerodynamics and energy management known to men (back then and today). Planes can not fly forever, do air combat maneuvering and then fly sustained and prolonged level flight without an engine running. Period.<br/><br/>4/10"
"shivendrasharma","6","13","21","22 July 2017"," Could have been better
","As other reviews here describe in great depth, Nolan has successfully implemented the best of visuals and sound effects. However, the hype created by trailers falls pretty short of describing a genuinely intense and desperate evacuation that took place during the whole battle.<br/><br/>At first, the trailers looked as if the Commonwealth Army fought a desperate retreat to 'home'; however, what we see are repetitive scenes that of a handful of Stuka divers getting destroyed by a group of just three RAF fighters, only one of which keeps on the skies while the other two survive on the same escape boat.<br/><br/>Its not the setting or the diversion of the director's traditional way of telling one of history's most important events as an all out war (like what one could remember from The Enemy at the Gates or Saving Private Ryan), but the lack of depth in showing the true nature of that hasty evacuation that took place when news had spread that German forces from all sides would be surrounding the allied landing within hours. What we see instead is anonymous soldiers simply changing boats from ships and vice versa, and finally reach 'home sweet home' without really showing much of the real blood that was spilled in order to protect those who were to be evacuated. So, although the movie launches off nicely, it goes monotone within 45 minutes.<br/><br/>I wish Nolan had shown the French lines that there were holding their ground from the Germans and relate all that with the evacuation that was taking place. Its just too plain."

","I cant conclude that this was a masterpiece or an epic - it most certainly wasn't - There are a few reviews on here that match my sentiment - the editing was poor several stories come together but are done almost ad hoc with a scene being almost a flashback to a previous scene where a plane that was shot down is then shot down again as part of a different story within the same story (if that makes sense). I watched the 1958 version of Dunkirk and it had more intensity than this the fear of the daily bombing and fear of drowning, fear of not getting off the beach alive - well that intensity was lacking in this there appeared to be a few hundred men on a beach who were occasionally attacked by 3 stucka dive bombers there were moments when you wanted something to happen and when it did you wondered what the hell it was about as there would be no dialogue. I felt like screaming what did you spend £150 millions on. It could have been so much more, special effects could have had thousands on a beach not a random selection of soldiers here and there there could have been more little boats coming towards Dunkirk. However, some things were done well the ship saving men and then only to be sunk again. Showing the desperation to survive and the cost of that survival. The spitfire scenes where we learnt something of what the RAF learnt in aerial combat that prepared them for the battle to come and the crew of the little boat and how they epitomised the spirit of Dunkirk - that was done exceptionally well but I was very disappointed about the rest and don't expect to see Oscars where there was little dialogue to deserve such."

After seeing classics such as Saving Private Ryan, the Pianist, Enemy at the Gates, etc. Dunkirk pales in comparison. Dunkirk reminds me a bit of the Blair Witch Project which was a new approach at the horror genre which was a total failure. At least the cinematography was good."

"mjude-32153","4","19","33","23 July 2017"," Plot spoiler alert if there had been a plot. I don't understand the praise?
","I am a bit of a WWII buff so knew the story of Dunkirk going in. I can only imagine how lost a person not familiar with this chapter from history would be while watching this movie. Outside of a few lines of text at the beginning that provide an extremely brief bit of background info, there is zero explanation of what is happening so don't expect any sort of history lesson. It's kind of like a documentary that used all of its budget to create excellent reenactment footage but ignored the narration. <br/><br/>Instead of a voice like David McCullough or Morgan Freeman to tell the tale, there is an annoying, overly loud, virtually continuous music score that instructs the viewer how to feel every single second. For a few scenes the director must have decided that loud manipulative music wasn't quite enough and elected to use dead silence instead. Frankly, my ears were so relieved during these precious quiet moments that any scene at all, another pan of the sky, another upturned face, a boot in seafoam would have triggered a tremendous emotional response.<br/><br/>And yes, scenes are repeated. Remember when you first saw the trailer? When the cold, grey, ominous sky; cold, grey, ominous beach, and c.g.o. water made you feel almost as if something ominous was going to happen? Well, if you appreciated all of that great dreary English Channel atmosphere in the trailer you are in luck because the one thing Dunkirk succeeds in is establishing an ominous, dreary atmosphere. It's kind of a miracle how minutes and minutes of panning clouds, water, and beach don't begin to get old until about 45 minutes in. That's about the point when you sneak a look at your watch and realize that nothing more is going to happen. <br/><br/>At my first watch look I was still hopeful and subtracted 35 minutes for previews which still gave the movie time to, you know, start moving. By my third time check I found myself wishing that I had paid A LOT more attention to one of the young dark headed guy's garbled words during the first ten minutes because I was starting to worry that I had missed something drastically important to the plot. But it turned out I hadn't missed anything more important than determining what was going on in any of the three, non-linear, confusing story arcs. <br/><br/>Dunkirk follows the separate stories of a soldier, a sailor, and a pilot who are just trying to get home during war. Except for the pilot, who glides his plane down on the wrong shore. And except for the sailor who takes his children into known danger because he already lost one son to the war and loses another son on the journey but doesn't seem to mind. But these lads might not even be his children. I either forgot or it somehow slipped by me in the 50 or so spoken words that I actually understood. Regardless, I liked the sailor character the best by far, if only for the fact that he had the lead speaking role.<br/><br/>At the end, the director predictably juxtaposes the bleakness of the beach at Dunkirk to the colorful landscape of the English countryside to suggest that the war is behind the dark headed soldier guys. And as one of them reads aloud from a newspaper about how silly their mission was, their countrymen somehow know that the newspaper is wrong and welcome them home with drink. Oh, he also reads part of Churchill's famous, ""We will beat them on the beach,"" speech in what might be the most awkward style ever recorded. I assume this was done to hammer home the fact that young men who go to fight in our wars are just simple, uneducated fellows. But really, I have no idea. This movie might be deceitfully deep or just a collection of nicely filmed war images. <br/><br/>I left the theater not knowing a single character's name, not caring the slightest about any of the characters, and not able to even coherently describe what happened. It was like retelling a fading dream that seemed to have narrative and importance but only images and atmosphere remain.<br/><br/>What is even more astounding, but to my great relief, I couldn't even remember enough of the nonstop, blaring score to hum a single bar. <br/><br/>SUMMARY: If you've never seen a war movie you might be very impressed by Dunkirk's power. Or, judging from the positive critical reviews, you might have seen all of the major war movies and still be impressed. I honestly have no idea. POSITIVES: *Great attention to atmosphere and mood *Great cinematography *Probably will get people interested in learning about Dunkirk and WWII *Reaffirms that war is bad *Does not rely on gratuitous violence *Might be the only realistic war movie of the past 30 years that could be appropriate for kids *Story is told from a creative, non- traditional p.o.v. NEGATIVES: *Boring *Repetitive *Is basically a silent movie outside of the ear shattering score and sound effects *Incomprehensible narrative *Zero character development *Zero historical context *The score ODD INCLUSION: *I get that the director wanted to show that war is hard on the regular people who are involved. And I get that fear is hard on the bowels. But TWO pooping scenes/references within the first five minutes?? COMPARISONS: *The movie ""Carol"" which was long on atmosphere and got critical acclaim but was a lazy snooze-fest"

The film simply shows thousands of soldiers and sailors, standing on a beach or dock ,waiting to be bombed or shot at by German Aircraft. Several people in the theater got up and walked out.

","It's hard to imagine where the $100million budgeted for this film was actually spent. Perhaps on the stellar cast, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy to name a few. All superb actors but in this, are completely muted and devoid of impact. I couldn't tell one floppy haired actor from another. To be fair, it wasn't their fault as the script was basically a lazy copy and paste from everything that has come before, just that it was the abridged version. Whilst the scenes aboard ships were tightly packed with personnel, when the camera panned , the beaches were clear from horizon to horizon, interspersed with some burning oil drums to give the timid illusion of a war zone rather than Margate in November. Though some subscribe to the idea that less is more, in this instance, less is less. Compared to the BBC's 2004 three part series Dunkirk, this fails in every quarter. Like wine, sometimes it's crap even if you paid £80 for the bottle, despite how much you want it to be good."
"hgreisman","2","14","23","26 August 2017"," Brexit
","Ever since its release, Dunkirk has garnered more than the usual share of column inches granted a movie in the UK press. I can only assume that it has a special resonance for the English audience. Maybe it's all tied into Brexit, and other things that many Americans don't understand.<br/><br/>I for one don't understand how British GIs, who'd been serially defeated by their adversaries, and had been on the run for over a month, could maintain their schoolboy haircuts and find time to shave every day. The English equivalent of Hollywood's Central Casting must have been pressed into service: The BEF appears to have been an army of heartthrobs, so much so that halfway through I figured the movie was produced with a gay audience in mind.<br/><br/>The retreating Brits must have had an extraordinary quartermaster, because the Tommies sport uniforms with nary a tear or a smudge. Although I can't claim any combat experience, my overall impression is that people bleed when they're shot, and that battlefields resemble smelly junkyards littered with body parts. In Christopher Nolan's vision of war, even the dead are well-groomed. One might think that following media coverage of terrorist attacks, audiences would be bemused at the sight of cadavers that looked like the undertakers had just finished getting them ready for the viewing. That PG-13 rating must require an awful lot of sanitizing.<br/><br/>And who, may I ask, kept the Germans at bay so the BEF could evacuate? You'd never guess it from the movie. It was the much-maligned French army; maybe even worse led than that of their ally's. Casualties were heavy among those left behind. After a particularly brutal march to Trier, Germany, survivors spent the next five years as POWs or forced laborers.<br/><br/>The genuine heroism of the little guys who piloted their boats across the channel is sadly rendered mawkish by wooden performances and painful clichés. And the CGI that several reviewers rave about looked to me like cartoons; in fact, the whole feature has an animated feel. Toward the end of the movie, my mind wandered, and a rogue thought conjured up memories of Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap, in particular the bit where narrator ""Marty DiBergi"" describes the faux heavy metal group as one of England's loudest bands. If there's an Oscar for decibels, then Dunkirk is a shoo-in."

Dunkirk did not provide context to the battle as it unfolded even confusing what little story there was with oddball editing, e.g., day and night times bounced around.<br/><br/>Dunkirk had a chance to explore why the Germans did not attack to fully destroy/capture the allied troops which by all accounts they could have fairly easily done. There was one reference in the movie when it was mentioned almost in passing that the the German tanks simply stopped their forward motion but nothing was said about why or even wonder why. I have read of possible reasons concerning Hitler's order not to destroy the expeditionary forces but now with the perspective of over 70 years this should have been included as the key missing piece of this story.<br/><br/>I gave Dunkirk a rating of 4 instead of 1 because of its visual production value but I am being generous."
"andalus-91860","3","14","23","27 July 2017"," Beautiful cinematography but still left me cold..
","As expected of a Christopher Nolan movie, Dunkirk has beautiful cinematography. I enjoyed the sometimes dizzying shots of the airplanes and the ocean but it made me appreciate the range of filming. However the movie itself was devoid of a plot. I understand Nolan was aiming for a movie geared towards survival of the soldiers, but I was not particularly moved by their struggles. The plot was too scattered for me. For instance, I was under the impression that the movie started out with ""the mole"", which was later referenced to, but never followed up on, which confused me very much as to what they were aiming for in terms of the story line. The fighting scenes were drawn out WAY too much and could have easily been cut down by 30 minutes so that I didn't have to watch 2 hours of essentially nothing. Also, the pounding music was suspenseful in the beginning but eventually began to hurt my ears.<br/><br/>Also, as a side note,I later read on the actual events on Dunkirk and learned that Indian soldiers had a significant contribution in the events at Dunkirk, as they were a colony under the British Raj at that time. Nolan claimed that he didn't want to politicize the movie, but I don't understand how not including Indian soldiers would have politicized the movie. Thus it gave me the impression that in spite of beautiful graphics, I was yet again watching another stereotypical movie with white people saving the day during a war at the core of the movie, while pushing aside the contributions of other people. It might not matter to a lot of people but I would have personally liked to see SOME historical accuracy, along with a better stitched plot to keep me more engaged *yawn*"

A half hour to forty five minutes in I felt myself wanting it to be over and fast.

","I've now spoken with 4 other people who saw this movie and all of them felt the same way. I know how much of a darling Christopher Nolan is to the film critics. That said, without going into a long detailed account of this movie I'll just say this.<br/><br/>This is a movie that could have been a great movie but wasn't. At the end of this movie you will not remember one character's name. (It's hard to remember what you never knew to begin with.) You will not know how many civilian boats came to the rescue of the trapped soldiers. You will not know how many civilians lost their lives trying to save the soldiers. You will not really know why or how the trapped soldiers ended up on the beach to begin with. You basically will have seen a few action scenes that take place on or near the beach at Dunkirk. That's it. REALLY! No story was told. No emotions get stirred or are touched.<br/><br/>It would have been better if they had included information prior to the end credits. It would have helped if they had shown actual photos or video from the actual rescue, maybe include real survivors ... and on and on.<br/><br/>Another frustration was the difficulty understanding the limited amount of dialogue, due to the never ending loud music. At the beginning I was wishing for subtitles. Then I realized that whatever they were saying was inconsequential. If this movie had been silent, I'd have left feeling the same way.<br/><br/>This is a shallow, visually entertaining snippet of what could have been a good movie. Whereas with Quenton Tarantino, you wish his films were edited to remove an hour from them, with this movie it's just the opposite. You wish the director had told the story of Dunkirk rather than show a few action scenes of what it might have been like to have been there."

But, when you put them all together you still had only a series of great looking clips, not an engaging movie. The lead characters were virtually indistinguishable from the other 400,000 soldiers. You never got to know them as individuals, so it had no impact when something happened to them. Nothing was ever explained, so if you don't know the historical context you still won't know the significance of the event, or even what really happened after you see this movie.<br/><br/>I've seen much more interesting and clear documentaries on TV.

","When a movie is based on actual historical content, it's hard not to go into it without having certain expectations. From what I knew on the battle of Dunkirk, I was expecting a gripping story on the heroic effort and sacrifices made by the French Army on the defensive line to keep the Germans at bay long enough for hundreds of thousands of British and Allied troops to escape; to live to fight another day and win the war. I was expecting to be awed by a true appreciation for the grand scale of evacuating hundreds of thousands of soldiers under enormous pressure. And while I understand going into a movie with high expectations isn't always a good idea, it's hard not to expect anything less than an impressive story, particularly when you know that story is true.<br/><br/>Although the movie had initially appeared to be ready to deliver on these expectations, it didn't take me very long at all to realize that, sadly, Dunkirk would ultimately fail to deliver on any of it.<br/><br/>There were no battles on the defensive line and air battles were portrayed in this film in a way that made German pilots seem like unworthy adversaries; easier to shoot down than ducks in an Atari video game. The film also fell disappointingly short on portraying the true scope of the operation. I've seen longer lines of people waiting to buy the new iPhone than the lines of soldiers portrayed on the beaches awaiting evacuation.<br/><br/>I had found it disappointing that 20 minutes into the film I was still wondering what the plot was on a story I was already familiar with. The lack of dialog was also so obvious and overdone that I had started to grow annoyed by it.<br/><br/>In the end, I was left wondering why this movie received so much hype and such high ratings. The only possible explanation I could provide is that there must be an awful lot of people out there who like to analyze movies scene by scene, in a DIY director's cut fashion, so that they can offer an interpretation on what they think the director is trying to portray though his artistic creativity, because these high ratings seem to have absolutely nothing to do with this actually being an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Director Christopher Nolan seemed too lazy and bothered to even halfheartedly attempt to deliver on anything that made the battle of Dunkirk so historically significant, choosing instead to focus far too much on creating some new kind of Tarantino/Pulp Fiction-esque piece of story telling that Hollywood elites and snobby critics can adore him for."

","I was confused wheather I went to a nightclub or the movies, because the annoying music sounded from the very beginning right until the end, nonstop, it was criminal. This musical resource is getting ridiculous in general, but especially for a war film, as it takes all the realism away from combat scenes, there is no music in war, why would a director would chose to avoid a single moment of silence is beyond me. The movie barely had a script and very confusing timelines, it was difficult to understand what had already happened and to match it with other scenes about the same events. There was very little dialogue and the characters were very shalow, watching them getting killed did not make the slightest difference as it was not emotional connection to them. All scenes were constantly drowned in loud, annoying, dramatic music trying to somehow convey the desperation those soldiers must have felt, but overusing that resource ruined the movie for me, I left with a headache. Some truly unrealistic scenes also, especially close to the end, where that Spitfire runs out of fuel and still manages to shoot down a German Stuka. Terrible movie, the critics must have been bought, there is something off about that 8.5 score, dozens of people agree with was a 1 star film. Weird."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","18","31","3 August 2017"," Disappointing, perhaps Nolan's weakest (subjectively)
","""Dunkirk"" is a fairly new 105-minute release (2017) and the most recent work by Oscar-nominated writer and (not Oscar-nominated) director Christopher Nolan. It is actually pretty short for a film by him. And the history/war genre is also pretty new for him. Maybe that's the reason why this project did not really work out too well. But first things first. The best thing about the film is the technical side. No doubt the film will score a few Oscar nominations there, for its sound probably, perhaps for visual effects, editing or cinematography as well. But that is really almost the only positive thing I can say here. It also shows that story is way more important than all these previously mentioned factors and this is where the film disappoints the most. The problem is not even that Nolan included so many unknown actors. I guess this was even somewhat smart because the soldiers should be a great mass of people like you and me. But Tom Hardy was really completely wasted, what a joke how they used him. His character added nothing and still they thought we would care for his fate at the very end. Oh yeah he wears a gas mask again like in his role as a Batman antagonist. Branagh, another Oscar nominee, was also very much wasted, even if not as much as Hardy. Recent Oscar winner Rylance had the best material (together with Murphy) from the known cast members and he was also the MVP I guess. Or lets better say the least forgettable.<br/><br/>Story-wise, the ending was decent, a scene here and there too (like what happens after they find the Dutchman, that's also one of several moments when we realize drowning was a really present danger and potential cause of death back then in these military fights) and the early scenes on Rylance's character's boat were okay too before they do stupid stuff like have an untrained guy shoot down a German plane out of nowhere. I thought the general idea of having Rylance represent marine / water, Hardy represent air (force) and Branagh represent ground / foot soldiers was a nice one, but what they eventually made of this premise was really disappointing I would say. Also the Dunkirk situation is a promising one for a movie, but this is hopefully not all they can make of the subject. Even the British recent movie ""Their Finest"" that has some Dunkirk references in it was considerably superior. Also this is another Nolan movie that will certainly not get much (if any at all) awards attention for the actors. Only Ledger managed to break the cycle, even if Bale, Hathaway, Cotillard, Caine and some others too gave decent performances at times. Anyway, back to this one here. I cannot say I was well entertained watching it and that's why I give it a thumbs-down. Then again, while I love history, war films have never been great for me, so maybe if you enjoyed the likes of ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""Band of Brothers"", then you will enjoy this one more than I did and can check it out. But if you didn't, then it is best to skip it because I as a Nolan fan (like some of his works, even loved others) never managed to warm up to the material. Maybe the helping hand of his brother as a screen writer could have helped. The actual outcome is perhaps the biggest disappointment of 2017 movie-wise."
"qormi","4","18","31","28 July 2017"," What's all the fuss? Not so good.
","For one thing, it was scaled back too much. In reality, Dunkirk was a huge battle involving the evacuation of around 400 thousand men. Hundreds of planes and ships were lost. Thousands of men died. The movie failed to convey the magnitude at all. We see a few planes dog fighting instead of hundreds. We see a few ships and boats sunk instead of hundreds. We follow one character around throughout the movie and it was boring. I really can't say I liked this movie. Great sound effects though."
"meyuk","2","18","31","27 July 2017"," Emporers new clothes
","Saw this at an imax cinema. Boy did the imax 'sound' ruin the talking. The dreary background noises generally drummed out the voices, even when there was no other action going on. There should also have been some quiet passages depicting just the sound of the waves as the soldiers took stock of their terrible plight. The film itself is a jumble of truncated scenes, sometimes repeated, that are not filmed very well. One scene ranged from day on the English side to night in France, then, for a minute, we had a storm only to never see it again. The characters are ridiculous and the lack of factual events is disappointing. This film would have us believe that 300,000 soldiers were evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk by a single visit from a number of small fishing boats. Also, that 3 spitfires were enough to provide all the air cover that the soldiers needed. This film is so bad that people must be commenting on it based on their knowledge of the makers and actors involved, rather than what they saw and heard."

"sinancemtemiz","4","18","31","22 July 2017"," It has been a very big disappointment and I think it could be the worst Nolan movie ...
","The shortcomings of the script and the story are:<br/><br/>The scenario used in the film has a lot of gaps and is full of bullshit ...<br/><br/>The film has a split screenplay but nobody tells you the name in the film and you do not understand who you are like in the form of actors and all the complexity ... There is no proper dialogue ...<br/><br/>There's a lot of time shifts in the film ... The film goes in 3 days ...<br/><br/>On the first day, we come from the street and try to board the ship as a fugitive. The next day the ships departed and evacuated. Arrival by train on the third and last day.<br/><br/>They find Cillian Murphy, who sits on a sinking destroyer, by chance, who is killing someone on the boat, no one says to the man ""What are you doing?"" (I do not understand how it happened ... the child pushed down 3 steps and died.)<br/><br/>However, the incident is so complicated and incoherent that I could not make any sense that these 3 days would always show the scene of the landing of the helicopter in each other ...<br/><br/>There are 450 thousand soldiers waiting on the beach. Why are you confusing this story ... Are 450 thousand people waiting behind the beach for the enemy? It is not ridiculous!<br/><br/>There was no resistance in the place where we were talking about the last sandy hill, and the Germans did not even bother to attack it, just bombarded it with a bunch of tank firepower and so on. (Because the German army has waited for 48 hours in reality but nobody tells it in the film, you are watching like an idiot.) ... But the German troops are firing occasionally ... According to your head, I can not decide what to do. This film, in the meantime they shoot firing in their heads ... because in that last scene they hold their dry cargo ship to the fire, or in the first scene ...<br/><br/>He stayed in the air for almost 5-6 hours with the plane running out of fuel ... In the place where he could turn the plane like a friend and bring it down to the sea (next to the evacuation ships), the plane is lowering it in the enemy positions ... Shortly after the plane comes down two enemy soldiers come and arrest this man No opposing fire is opened when we go down to enemy positions ...<br/><br/>There is this unfinished American masturbation event ... The British and the French have escaped but they have come to say that we have come to destroy them ...<br/><br/>A very simple result was the end of the movie with the linking part, 30 boats arrived and dozens of soldiers took out the soldiers they could not get out and went ... 330 thousand people, 30 boats and they went and they did not tell anyone that the air crafts of the German aircraft do not ... The submarines were pert and there was no plane left ... Even if the submarine floated to the water surface and hit the boats, even killing 100 thousand people ... The child seemed to be tricked ... Okay, here we are, we are gone,<br/><br/>If you are shooting a war movie like I said, you can not tell this story according to your head on the same front line because it is contrary to the topic you are talking about, because it is against the war because everyone is doing the same job ... There is no such thing as an enemy anymore. The film was ruined ... This story could be explained much better ... In other words, the story of a manga soldier could be more clearly understood and more beautiful than a story of a manga soldier. Divide it with lines ...<br/><br/>Come on to shooting problems:<br/><br/>I do not know if 2d den can be caused but it seems to me that the images are terrible ... The whole world does not have to watch this film in imax, but this technology exists in very few places ... 2d scenes are sometimes clear, sometimes fuzzy, sometimes (primary person ) ... There was a lot of incomprehensibility in there, and there was always a continuous event that jumped up there, so there was no clear event, and the continuous events are intermingling ...<br/><br/>Nolan's ambiguity continued here as well. He did not always use the same method of shooting. For example, while looking at a person's eyes, the camera is constantly trembling, shaking according to the man ... For example, when the torpedo is in the camera the camera of the stimulant is not shaken, The same problems exist in many scenes in the cinema or in the divine view ... Especially in the jet scenes, while the camera is swaying with the vibration of someone's plane, there is no such problem on the other ...<br/><br/>The biggest minus in terms of cinema is that the film starts with a narration and ends in the face of a flat-faced man who has to explain what it is at the end that this unacceptable is a mistake that these mistakes ruins the film ... How do you not tell them what happened or how many died or how many destroyers sink ... Scandal a mistake ..."

This film did a terrible job in its plot delivery. There was no character development at all. Nolan tried desperately and gambled in taking an eclectic approach to a war movie which ends up leaving the audience in a state of mass confusion. I hated it. I couldn't wait until the credits rolled so I could officially depart from the dumpster fire that this movie was. If you are expecting your typical heroes and villains war movie with cool battles and testosterone laden machismo, this is far from it. Dunkirk is a 2 hour expose of the mundane depressive state of war as if you were in it. Few action scenes. Little dialogue. Scattered confusing plot. Not sure how Nolan pitched the idea of having a de facto silent film World War II movie with no action or emotionally driven sub plot. You will be very sorry you went to see this.

This is in fact the problem with this aesthetically perfect movie. We do not feel for the soldiers at any point of time. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is overused to such an extent that the focus goes to the music score instead of the visuals. Dunkirk could have done so any things right just by having a higher run-time. In 100 odd minutes, the movie just, don't move us. It had all the perfect components for a movie that would remain in our hearts for times to come, but getting out of the cinema hall, only the burger I had in between remained with me.

"jam-iii-1","2","15","25","24 July 2017"," A Spectacle in Search of a Story
","The most remarkable about Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is that he entirely missed the whole story of Dunkirk which was about these tiny private boats, thousands of them, piloted by citizen-sailors rescuing hundreds of thousands of cornered British troops. This became a huge rallying point for the Brits before the Blitz when ordinary Britons actually saved 270,000 men. For most of Nolan's Dunkirk he focuses on Mark Rylance who appears to be out in the middle of the English Channel all by himself. In reality, the private fleet was a massive flotilla. If you live on the west coast of the US, imagine every private boat in LA Harbor, Long Beach and Newport emptied into the Catalina Channel. That's what Dunkirk was like. Where are all those CG effects when you really need them? Instead, Nolan seems more interested in effects that show troop transport ships being torpedoed and breached which is NOT the real story of Dunkirk. And that's not saying anything about Cillan Murphy's pointless flashbacks or Tom Hardy's silly Hollywood RAF pilot who shoots down German fighters without fuel or an engine. If you judge a film by the actual events that inspired it this is not inspired work - just another bloated CG spectacle with an over-mixed soundtrack, a much advertised 70mm picture, and in selected theaters, vibrating seats. Seriously. In that sense, Dunkirk is not a bad IMAX film - if only it were an hour shorter. If you want to see a good Dunkirk film, dig up the Dunkirk from 1958 with John Mills. A far superior piece of cinema."
"noelbillington","4","15","25","23 July 2017"," Over-bored
","Over-hyped and over-budgeted this emperor's new clothes of a film is expensively but far from seamlessly stitched together. No character development or back story whatsoever so impossible to care about any of the protagonists, no cinematic grandeur and literally not a German to be seen ( probably a clever metaphor which like many of the bombs and bullets in the film went over my head ). Perhaps suffering from it's 12A rating the beach massacre was far too clinical and lacking in realism, explosion after explosion followed by soldiers simply getting up and immediately standing back in the ' sea' queue or playing dead, no one injured, screaming, bloodied or even limping slightly or sucking on a sore finger. The toe-curling shoe-horned incident of the Enid Bilghton caricatured thick kid fatally falling down two steps of a boat ( curiously the one place there was an actual suggestion of blood, but not much ) seems like a clumsy afterthought. At least we can depend on Tom Hardy to single handily knock those Gerry bombers and fighters for six, even with not a drop of fuel in his kite then, land beautifully on the German held beach and, avoiding their towels, get out, blow up his plane and standing rather dangerously close for my liking( of course he is very brave must have known it was safely out of ammo by now ) watch it burn whilst waiting stoically to be taken prisoner, no doubt to fight another day."

"shvmsharma","6","17","29","24 July 2017"," Dunkirk will age really badly.
","Dunkirk is Christopher Nolan out of depth and in uncharted waters. It's a movie that wants very hard to be great. Where characters talk in monosyllables and look meaningfully at each other or in the distance expecting the viewer to be with them in their moment. Going by the majority of the reviews, this British war survival story has been bought by a lot. I was sitting in the theater waiting for that moment of redemption in the movie that never really came. Critics, it seems have seen the movie and adapted their tastes to like it and find deeper meaning (as critics often do) in perhaps the most straightforward story line made interesting only because of the non-linear editing tropes which Nolan otherwise uses well in his other movies to some purpose. Here it becomes too much of a gimmick and some extremely non moving and non interesting events are made to seem more than what they are. What remains of Dunkirk is an aural and visual spectacle that falls squarely flat by the time the last of the British is rescued. The movie has multiple endings and at such a short run time, the ending can't come fast enough. Nolan has admittedly taken off from multiple movies before he made Dunkirk and his effort is different in the way it has such less impact even after bombarding the viewer with bullets, bombs and an overpowering Hans Zimmer soundtrack.<br/><br/>Hoyte Van Hoytema is a brilliant cinematographer. The Spitfire is a brilliant machine (as mentioned by Nolan in many interviews and expressed by one of the characters in the movie.) The aerial photography is like no other you may have seen. But all of this amounts to nothing. The spitfire maybe a brilliant machine and Hoytema may have taken brilliant shots but the story line flounders away in the air somewhere. Tom Hardy can't see the plane clearly and after the 10th shot of the same plane meandering here and there you realize the war can be really tedious and boring without that pounding Hans Zimmer soundtrack at the background. Thanks Christopher Nolan for putting me right in the middle of the war with such lovely heart pounding score, because frankly the screenplay isn't your best bet here and you know it.<br/><br/>I'll go on here and speculate now because I'm a fan of the man and want to. The man who doesn't seem to falter even when he makes a movie like The Dark Knight Rises as he infuses a lot of commentary and brilliance in the weakest of plots. Christopher Nolan has a very visible Stanley Kubrick hangover. He has a picture of Kubrick's chair in his office, he swears by Kubrick's brilliance and if you try and see there are quite a few similarities in the filmography of the British compatriots (Dunkirk being his Paths of Glory). Wanting to be the greatest and most complete filmmaker is the noblest of ambitions but wanting to be like someone else may not be. Before Dunkirk, he was a man who would blow your minds off with a plot twister like Memento or The Prestige, a mind bender like Inception or Following or his villains would have the most memorable roles like The Joker. Dunkirk is Nolan's 'war movie'. Every great director generally ends up making one and wants to make the greatest one. (No one comes close to the Thin Red Line and Apocalypse Now yet, IMO) Dunkirk makes me believe in Christopher Nolan the human director. This guy wanted to make his war movie and when I see it, this was a movie the world would be better off without. In these times of war and international strife, the movie shows you some of the horrors of the war while squarely glamorizing many aspects of it (""The Spitfire with the Rolls Royce engine is the greatest machine ever built."" Says the old guy to his Son in the movie.) I have read many Nolan interviews to find out what this important artist who wields great artistic influence the World over, thinks about what's happening in the World. His world views are unfortunately not much available in the interviews and going by Dunkirk, a patriotism filled British epic lauded by all the British and the colonial powers the world over, it's quite unfortunate that this is the movie we have to live with as the Best reviewed movie of the year. One watch is enough to tell you the movie is average at best and I can't make myself believe it's greater than it really is when it's squarely a technical achievement.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan is at the zenith right now as Dunkirk becomes his best reviewed film and may of course get an Oscar or two thanks to the technical brilliance. It remains his most manipulative and weakest story. A very flimsy plot made watchable thanks to the score and the camera.<br/><br/>Dunkirk would age really badly and few years from now, may not even be considered in his best movies."

The continuous sawing against cello and violin strings were meant to increase the drama of the plot. But, it was repetitive and mindless and detracted from an otherwise great movie (it would have garnered at least a nine rating without the score). Hopefully, they can re-score the film someday.

"medicricci","4","16","27","21 July 2017"," Not about Dunkirk and certainly not an epic movie.
","Possible spoiler for content: I went to see the movie full of hope it might be another epic movie living up to its title ala ""Bridge Too Far"" or ""The Longest Day,"" but this movie was not about the evacuation of Dunkirk. It wasn't even a war movie, and anyone watching it would not know anything useful about the actual battle (that wasn't even an actual battle). First, the good: The graphics were well done, exceptional in fact. The pilot's eye view and shooting engagements were very good. The naval scenes when ships were hit, including interior scenes, were pretty well done as well. The larger vistas of the beaches were pretty good and copied from readily available historical footage. The movie's converging story lines of the three soldiers was well done, with the eavesdropping part giving a good entry for the general situation (aimed at audience members who don't know anything about the relevant history). A Ju-87 dive bombing attack at the beginning was pretty cool in giving audience members a chance to hear the notorious Stuka's siren.<br/><br/>The bad: There was no real ""air to air"" per se--the German ME109s just flew in a nearly straight line acting like training drones for the British fighter pilots to shoot down. Inexplicably, instead of flying like fighters, i.e. at higher altitudes to maintain situational awareness and tactical superiority, everyone flew at sea level. German fighter bombers simply droned alone with escorts that apparently did nothing but get shot down for a chance to show the very good perspective shots. The occasional attacks on the beach were more for a look at an attacking plane, but really nothing else. The damage and effects of damage on people were superficial and not even close to reality, and there was no impression of the tremendous amount of equipment held by the British. Troops stood by the water in company sized lines waiting for ships that were not even visible, and no attempt was made to prepare for anti-aircraft response with rifles or shore batteries. Several scenes of the evacuation showed (or you heard) the impact of incoming artillery fire, but not one ship fired counter battery fire. The actors were all very pretty boy-models, except in one pretty lame subplot where the ""bad guy"" Brit had a slightly meaner set of eyebrows. In this scene, a squad of soldiers abandoned their unit and hid in a beached boat without the slightest sense of tactical or situational awareness, and hid. While hiding in the hull of the boat and awaiting the tide, during which time no one set up a guard or made any preparations to use the craft, some rifle/machine gun fire began hitting the boat's hull, creating holes that began allowing water to leak into the boat. Somehow, despite hitting the metal hull of the boat and not exiting, none of these rounds ricocheted or hurt anyone. The undisciplined group panics and begins to wonder how to lighten the boat so it won't sink. During this part, the ""ugly"" guy threatens to off a disguised French soldier so that his riddance would make the boat somehow more sea worthy.<br/><br/>In short, this was not a movie about Dunkirk, but a drama centered about a few soldiers, a couple of pilots--all of runway good looks, and a civilian boat owner with a veneer of early WWII and a backdrop of Dunkirk that would only fool or engage someone knowing little to nothing about the actual history of crisis. It certainly wasn't a thriller or realistic, and it was nowhere near ""epic."" But the excellent CGI, coupled with a real story ala ""Bridge Too Far"" construct, could have contributed to an outstanding movie."

He made Europe remember WWII all over again and he educated the young and helped (?) elderly to closure. Spielberg is a movie maker who knows very well his genres and how to not mess with them. <br/><br/>Enter Chris Nolan. A movie maker famous and known for science fiction and fantasy. With Dunkirk he shows at least me that he is as predictable as a dull Adam Sandler. <br/><br/>My biggest concern when I sat down to watch Dunkirk was weather Nolan would stay true to the genre or if he would put his sci-fi magic into it. After ten minutes I realised I was watching Interstellar again and I had to fight the urge to actually leave the theatre. What annoyed me the most was the sci-fi sound effects, scifi music score and the shallowness of the historical event. <br/><br/>Is the movie good? Well, Nolan's fans will probably like it, Generation Y will like it but people who, like me, had a life changing experience with Saving Private Ryan, won't be as thrilled or impressed. Imagine Schindler's List in the hands of Christopher Nolan. Darn right, thanks but no thanks. <br/><br/>I didn't like it at all."

","I'm getting sick of these paid reviews. I feel too defeated to even write this review. What a waste of Â£17. This is right up there as one of the worst war films I've ever seen. You know it's bad when multiple people in the audience shout out ""That was s**t"" at the end.<br/><br/>There just isn't a story line, a beginning, middle or end. There's no point to it. It had so much potential as the picture and cinematography are so realistic. That's pretty much all it has going for it. Not to mention that Tom Hardy is in about 5 scenes and says all of about 5 words. Massive disappointment."
"DWilson100","5","36","69","20 July 2017"," Red Badge of Dunkirk?
","Where to begin... The ""soldier lost in the complexity of war"" has been done before, and I had high hopes for the film, but I was just disappointed. First, this movie is grim. Not grotesque, just depressing and grim, so prepare yourself. After reflecting on it a while, I think the movie just felt too thin. Thin on scale, thin on character development, thin on dialogue. For a movie called ""Dunkirk"", if you don't know anything about the battle going in, don't expect much coming out. It's really 3 interwoven vignettes about personal experiences during the battle, mainly 1 group fighting (air), 1 group running away (land), and 1 group trying to get into battle (sea). But for a massive operation with hundreds of planes and ships and hundreds of thousands of men, it just felt puny. Imagine a movie about D-Day where the invasion force is 3 allies against 3 Germans on the beach, with a couple of planes and a ship tossed in for drama. That's the feel. Movies like this can work if they have the feel of man as a small cog in massive machinery, but this just missed the mark for me. And the music was grating. Several times it overtook the screen action in a glaring, bad way. Just not a very good film. Not a total clunker, but not great by ANY means."

Large groups of people that would be talking (or yelling) and doing stuff in reality are somehow often silent and immobile. A lot of the communication is calm tones even though it's a war - urgent, hugely scary, life-threatening.<br/><br/>There isn't much story - although I'm not sure if that was the intent. Instead it just jumps between a handful of totally separate characters pretty much randomly, and it jumps way too frequently for any sense of continuity.<br/><br/>And then there's quite a few inconsistencies. Can't list here without declaring this a spoiler, though.<br/><br/>The aesthetics / atmosphere does seem suitable for what's going on, though.<br/><br/>Unless you're into weirdly produced arty movies that are all atmosphere, this shouldn't really appeal."
"stevenfreekin","6","25","46","25 July 2017"," Good Film but Disappointing at the same time in many ways
","Just watched the movie on 70mm film and the image quality was exceptional. For the most part it was an enjoyable and entertaining history film about survival during war. It had some great suspense and thriller elements to it. In fact some of the sequences were very Hitchcockian in nature that they reminded me of Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent. If i had to categorize this movie i would say it's an Action-Thriller that takes place during war.<br/><br/>My first problem was the Sound & Music. Both were too loud, annoying, distracting, and monotonous that several people got up and left. I almost did. It's the same problem that the dark knight rises suffered from. They mixed the sound so high to make the action and explosions appear grand but it fails since the visuals don't work. There's only one director who can direct great action and explosions and make it look grand and epic that i almost believe its a work of art, which in a way it is. That director is none other than Michael ""Bad Boys"" Bay.<br/><br/>Second problem i had with the movie was too many cuts to secondary characters that i didn't care about. Not to mention i barely cared about any of them since I never got to know them. They should have stuck with just three stories: the pilot, the father and son, and the two soldiers trying to survive. Period. I don't care about the generals, random soldiers, or Cillian Murphy's character either.<br/><br/>Third problem i had with the movie was it didn't have a grand scale or scope the way it was advertised. The film tries hard to want to be epic but fails. On the posters it states that over 400,000 men were trapped but in the movie i didn't see that at all. Honestly, it was more like 2,000, then there was like two planes in the sky and a half a dozen boats. Really? That's what you called grand? If you enjoy a historical Action-Thriller that's full of suspense then definitely check it out. Bring some ear plugs if you can."

","Walked out of the movie after watching it for an hour. The actors do not talk very much in the movie but it seems to have music playing in the background quit a bit. The movie went from one scene to the next to the next to the next, it kept jumping around so you never really get into liking one character or the other. It was a very slow movie and the War scenes were less graphic than what you see on regular T.V. I would rate this movie below a 1 if I could. Definitely the worst war movie I have ever seen.

From there the entire run time is spent in jarring fashion that's meant to simulate being in an actual battle or being attacked. What it fails to do is be an actual film or tell any kind of tale. It's a two hour long dragout scene and not an actual movie.

","Okay so I just returned home after watching Dunkirk and I have I was so wrong,Hahn Don't know how to say this but billions of blue blistering barnacles what the F@@K did I just saw. This is not a Christopher Nolan movie it had nothing of him in this movie in fact I am not even sure if it was a movie at best it's a WW2 situation shown on a high budget History channel world war episode. I am not swayed by anyone's review so I am going to give my Unbiased Spoiler free review of DUNKIRK.<br/><br/>Okay the opening scene is awesome and it gets you the background score is getting chilling and you are now in Christopher Nolan Zone and then 15 minutes goes by and music is still building on and before it reaches the climax there is suddenly change of scene!! Why?? And the same things go on in a loop throughout the movie. Its just starts to get frustrating. Just for everyone benefits Dunkirk is bit like Memento which tells the same episode through different character eyes in a Time lapse/ Wrap mode and this time it is not executive well.<br/><br/>You have to pay attention to starting 10 minutes to get what's going to happen the incidents will be shown through 3 different angels – Soldiers on land, pilots in the sky and sailors on the boat and by far the best shots are from the sky and no one gives damn about soldiers and of course since it's a sea movie you have lots of ships and one very irritating rescue boat. Now here is the most confusing part of this movie, you see many big ships sinking yet you start to realize no damn it, it's the same ship sinking over and over again!! I mean the same episode is being shown by three different group of people.<br/><br/>in Dunkirk defense it has some truly state of the Art Dog fight scene in the sky and they are shot Gorgeously well and its the only saving grace of the movie and yet in the end of the movie that moments are also taken away from you.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is not a movie it's a episode at best there are no characters and the best one never shows his face and I have no idea if Christopher Nolan does not like Tom Hardy Face but he refuse to give him face time on on the screen, he is always in some kind of mask. I Think even if every Englishman write brave reviews about Dunkirk it will still not save this huge high budget ship from sinking , it has Titanic written all over it. I am not sure if CN directed this movie or some one from his assistant team did it. The film has some very serious editing issues and narration is all over the place. The Music has same tone in every seen and hence we will never have ""No time to Caution"" moment in this movie.<br/><br/>For me this movie has failed in all levels, even Hacksaw ridge is far better war movie than this one but the problem is Hacksaw understand it is a movie Dunkirk is confused and I am sure it is NOT."

Plot is superb, Hans zimmer music delivers the tension, cinematography is very good and art direction is brilliant. Now coming to negatives. There is no script at all. No character development. When the film ends you won't remember a single character except tom hardy that's just because he's the only familiar face. Despite having an intriguing plot you won't feel any thrill. Nor you feel emotional in any scene. And the worse part is it does not have violence and bloodshed. A war film without violence or bloodshed is like a food without salt. On the whole, Dunkirk had a very great idea but Nolan failed in execution. Even Michael bay could have made it thrilling."

"doorsscorpywag","1","7","10","5 December 2017"," Absolute Bottom Gravy
","The 1958 film with John Mills and company told the story of Dunkirk in a masterly manner showing the horror and the struggle to survive. The 2004 BBC Drama/Documentary showed some of the neglected aspects in those who manned the line to allow survivors to escape the carnage.<br/><br/>In both there were some excellent acting performances from the likes of Richard Attenborough, Bernard Lee and Benedict Cumberbatch. Both told a wonderfully uplifting story of heroism and sacrifice to allow Britain to withdraw its army across the channel and continue the struggle. Neither shied away from the reality that was Dunkirk showing the audience the terror of attack from the air and the murder of civilians by the Luftwaffe and soldiers by the SS. The 1958 ensemble cast and the BBC documentary cast told the story from different perspectives in a way that made you feel part of what was going on.<br/><br/>This pile of over rated toilet slop showed that film makers today have not the first clue how to tell a Historical story. Jumping back and forward telling the story from the air, the sea and the land and achieving nothing more than confusing the audience as Tom Hardy endlessly attacked the same plane for an hour and a half before running out of fuel and landing faultlessly on the beach and into a nest of Germans.<br/><br/>The beaches were sparsely occupied by a few short lines of soldiers and there was no sense of peril as the Third Reich bore down on them. The odd air attack allowed Kenneth Branagh a chance to look dramatic and stern and some bloke from the army was there because there would have been some bloke from the army there in 1940.<br/><br/>The dunes behind the beach were empty and nobody seemed that much in a hurry to leave. It must have been Hell for our brave lads in 1940 but it was a Hell for the 2017 audience as this incredible story was reduced to a few blokes here and there doing stuff in a really boring manner whilst being shot at once in a while from invisible Germans.<br/><br/>The utterly stupid scene that opened this dross shows the Nazis a few hundred yards from the beach which is guarded by our brave French allies but nothing about the British who were holding the perimeter to allow the Army to retreat to Dunkirk. Their bravery is not even hinted at as they sacrificed their lives to allow others to get away.<br/><br/>The French are treated with disdain as if their courage amounted to very little as a Frenchman sneers at a 'brave' Brit who has thrown his rifle away and ran through their lines. Being told to 'p#ss off' by a British officer when they dare to join the rather small line of Brits waiting for rescue. <br/><br/>Even the terror of a torpedo attack looked rather dull and nothing Nolan did had an authentic look about it. The soldiers on the mole did not look as if they had spent weeks fighting their way out of Belgium against a Nazi horde and looked rather dapper as they strolled along the pier.<br/><br/>When they got to the other side they arrived in the 80s and got on trains that were a bit too modern for that period as seen by the upholstery. Nothing about this film caught the imagination. Only the Mark Rylance Mr Dawson character and his crew looked as if they were actually interested. This was the only decent bit of the film.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy flying around bored me silly and I was rooting for the ME109 at one stage. The worst were the land characters Kenny just one of a bad bunch. At least he was able to emote as Jerry bombed the handful of extras portraying hundreds of thousands of frightened, exhausted, hungry, thirsty and defeated soldiers trying to stay alive among the dunes. This nonsense does not even try to reflect the courage and steadfastness of our soldiers instead focusing on two cowardly types who weasel their way to the front carrying a stretcher.<br/><br/>How the media was able to tell the arriving soldiers that 300,000 had been saved bemused me but was just another piece of terrible storytelling.<br/><br/>I had looked forward to this but it was dreadful. Want to watch the real story go to 1958 and 2004. This turkey is not worth your time."

"mfredenburg","5","7","10","7 August 2017"," Dunkirk Underwhelms
","Just saw Dunkirk. I am going to go against the flow and say I found it to be mediocre. Did not like many of the directing choices Nolan made. Many of his choices felt contrived and made it hard for me to maintain my willing suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh was in the film, but was heavily underutilized. We never got a feeling for the miracle that was Dunkirk. And we ended up with a surprisingly small film for such a big event. One example: over 800 small boats enabled over 300,000 British soldiers escape, yet we never ever saw that. Consequently, the film completely failed to capture the scale of this event.<br/><br/>I suppose Nolan was trying to give a view of Dunkirk from the perspective of a few hapless British soldiers who had a very small / micro view of the war. This particular group, unlike the vast majority of British troops, appeared willing to do anything to get back across the channel with little regard for their fellow soldiers. Ultimately, I just did not find them very believable and I really did not care about them. <br/><br/>Likewise, the French's only role was to try to get on the ships. One of main unsympathetic characters was a French soldier who stripped a dead British soldier to so he could pretend to be British in hope of getting across the Channel. The fact that is was the French that fought a fierce rearguard action that gave the British time to effect the rescue was ignored.<br/><br/>Scenes that could have been powerful - weren't - because the proper foundation to make them powerful was never laid.<br/><br/>In not using CGI to give the viewer the true scope of Dunkirk (using real boats, people, planes and ship would have been cost prohibitive), over 850 ships and over 400,000 troops, was not shown. One would have never guessed the RAF fought hard and deployed hundreds of fighters to combat the bombs raining down on the men waiting on the beaches, flying a total of 3,500 sorties and losing 145 aircraft while the Luftwaffe lost 156. <br/><br/>In the movie ships rolled over after getting hit by single bomb and the fact that Naval ships can actually fight back was ignored. In fact an armed civilian ship, a paddle wheeler, actually shot down 3 German airplanes en route to successfully ferrying 7000 soldiers back to England in seven round trips. So in the real Dunkirk larger ships survived multiple attacks from German aircraft and actually shot them down. We get none of that from Nolan. Consequently, he created a distorted and inaccurate view of Dunkirk. <br/><br/>I can appreciate artistic license, but Nolan went too far in creating his sparse and tiny Dunkirk.<br/><br/>So while I generally like war films, this one underwhelmed me. It was not a bad film, but it was inaccurate and there are many far better war films.<br/><br/>On the positive side I did see it in IMAX and some of the scenes were spectacular. The soundtrack was also powerful. If you want to see this film, see it in the theater and see it in IMAX. I do not think it is worth watching on the small screen.<br/><br/>We deserve a real film about Dunkirk."
"Darksidecrew","Null","7","10","30 July 2017"," Dunkirk (2017, Chris Nolan)
","I got to see this film in the IMAX theatre which is really by far the best way as unlike most other films that use IMAX cameras to heighten portions of the presentation, this one is almost all in the larger IMAX format with only a few dialogue scenes reverting back to the more traditional widescreen format. This is the story of allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France who are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.<br/><br/>The story is told from several points of view and it chops rapidly between them at a break-neck speed. I think Chris Nolan has taken on board some of the criticisms of past films for over waffling and un- needed length as this one is edited tight as a drum. Some may say there are not enough character moments but I feel there were enough to tell the story effectively. <br/><br/>My grandfather was captured in this region during this time and was a prisoner of war for the remainder of the campaign. It is not lost on me what kind of hell these men went through and this film delivers that feeling. The score is amazing as was the sound design and I will be expecting Oscar nominations for both. I will reserve judgement till i see how it fairs on the home format without the IMAX treatment on whether it is Nolan's best film to date but it might bloody well be. 8/10"
"texshelters","6","7","10","23 July 2017"," What could have been one of the best war films in history is mired in a hash of plots and subplots with little to root for.
","Dunkirk-A Review.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is wonderful to look at, however, it is at once too much and too little. There are too many cuts and too many subplots that it is easy to lose interest in what is happening. The cuts come quickly, which works with the air and action scenes, but holding longer on some shots would have allowed us to more deeply feel the gravity of the events. <br/><br/>Inevitably, I found myself comparing Dunkirk to other WWII films. It holds up well, with two notable exceptions. First, the intensity and close contact action is not as impactful as the opening to ""Saving Private Ryan."" However, the tension throughout the entirety of ""Dunkirk"" surpasses ""Ryan,"" which moves aimlessly at times. I also think of the remarkable ""Das Boot"", a film that made many sympathize, me included, with Nazis in a submarine. The tension in that German classic is at a level that ""Dunkirk"" doesn't match, and ""Das Boot"" never relents until the ending. <br/><br/>Moreover, in ""Das Boot"", we get to know the captain well, how he cares about each man in his command and we see his fear. That makes the film more interesting for us. There is one setting in Das Boot, a submarine, and that's all. The film's limited scope increases the tension and our attachment to each character.<br/><br/>What was also lacking in the film was a sense of the war in general. Das Boot was able to show us the futility of war and how the leaders in Germany made huge strategic mistakes. Little of that comes across in Dunkirk. <br/><br/>Dunkirk shows a great rescue but ignores the fact that this operation was only required because the Allies underestimated Germany's forces and were outflanked by the Nazi advance when the Allies failed to anticipate a German Blitz through the Ardennes. The military strategists were so inept that the whole British army almost went balls up during the retreat. <br/><br/>Not all the subplots in Dunkirk work well. A subplot involving a volunteer civilian ship-mate, George, is awkward and unnecessary. Certainly, Nolan wants us to empathize with all the British citizens who aided in the rescue. He also wants us to understand the ""shell shock"" (PTSD) that the soldiers went through. Both the bravery of the volunteers and suffering of the soldiers was clear throughout the film and a tacked on, haphazard conflict on a civilian boat was not well thought out. The scene is an insipid distraction from the core of the film. However, the depictions of shell shock in general were realistic and impactful.<br/><br/>There was also a scene featuring a beached vessel that added nothing to the story but another subplot to distract us from more interesting characters and plot lines. In this way, the film is reminiscent of disaster films from the 70s where each character faces life and death challenges and we briefly see what happens to each one of them. But we don't need to see what happens to every character and every way the soldiers were stranded. All the plots and actions leave us too scattered to deeply care about any of them. <br/><br/>The acting was surprisingly flat with two exceptions: Mark Rylance as a private ship captain Mr. Dawson and Tom Glynn-Carney who plays his son Peter. More about their story and bravery and less about the tacked on George would have improved this film. <br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton is a waste of talent here. His dialogue is a clumsy attempt to explain the gravity of the situation, but it added little that the battle footage didn't already show us. Moreover, Branagh's stares into space did nothing for the film. But he does look good in that uniform. <br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is overwrought and melodramatic, much like John Williams score for Schindler's list, Zimmer wants to make sure we FEEL things. More subtlety would have served this film well. And the unnecessary discordant drones and grinding sounds added to some of the battle scenes were annoying and distracting. The sounds of war: the machines, the engines, the bombs, the bullets, are compelling enough. There was no need to embellish them. I would suggest that Mr. Zimmer stick to standard action films like ""Inception"" as I have suggested that Williams stick to films like ""Jaws"" and ""Star Wars."" Serious dramas demand less bravado and more nuance. <br/><br/>Though the story is bloated with characters and subplots, there were some great directorial choices in ""Dunkirk."" First, the lack of machoism is refreshing. While there is a lot of posturing and anger in the film, what clearly comes across is that many of the soldiers were rightfully scared and enduring as best they could. There were no John Wayne characters on the beaches, or in this case Benjamin Cumberbatch, proclaiming that the British were going to punch the Nazi's in the nose. <br/><br/>Another good directorial choice is not stereotyping the Germans as 'evil.' Certainly, the Nazi leadership was a humanity hating force of slaughter, but the film focused of the heroic British, French and other allies. <br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent and the cameras were masterfully placed in the film. An award for cinematography could be granted Hoyte Van Hoytema for degree of difficulty alone. <br/><br/>Rating: Matinée. What could have been one of the best war films in history is mired in a hash of plots and subplots with little to root for. Still, seeing it in 70 mm is a treat worth the viewing. <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"

","From the start there is a lack of dialogue, you are thrown into action though which draws you in, however this soon fades and the action slows down and you are left wondering when the story itself is actually going to begin. Some say it's a beautiful film visually however as someone who knows a lot about WW2 and the scale of evacuation of Dunkirk it doesn't do it justice. Over 900 boats were used and both sides lost around 150 planes which is not portrayed well enough with a handful of ships and only 3 German and 3 English planes. I understand the director wanted to not use Cgi however without this I feel that the script, plot and character depth needs to be more engaging to keep the viewer interested. The subject matter of the film was the evacuation of Dunkirk, I would actually struggle to explain the plot/ storyline to somebody because it doesn't really have one.<br/><br/>Overall I can see the director has tried to make a war film different from the rest, however for me this didn't work at all. Without an interesting plot, character depth or dialogue all you are left with are nice images which does not do enough for the viewer to really get a sense of emotion, and feel what the soldiers felt at the time."

Despite all that is perfect with the film, it does suffer from some glaring storytelling issues that, while many may enjoy, I found to be unnecessarily tedious.<br/><br/>While many of you will probably hate on me for saying this, I simply have to say it: Christopher Nolan is overrated. There is no other way about it. The man has given us classics but flawed classics, at best. However, Dunkirk is a perfect response to my feelings towards Nolan. The film is extremely fast paced which is something that plagued Nolan since Batman Begins. Here, he is restrained and it pays off quite beautifully especially when you factor in the brilliance that is Hoyte Van Hoytema's outstanding cinematography. The film is big and Hoytema's determination is shown through every frame. He is dedicated to capturing beauty and here is no different. Hoytema serves as a very suitable replacement for Wally Pfister.<br/><br/>The film, while being 106 minutes long and probably Nolan's most accessible feature to date, also is very scarce when it comes to dialog and general character development. There are very few characters here that will have you standing and cheering for. I mean, you're going to cheer at moments in the film. It is geared to do just that. But it won't have you gravitating towards Styles, Rylance, Hardy or Murphy. Quite frankly, they all have (with the exception of Styles) minimal screen time. Those looking for a Tom Hardy war movie better think again. This isn't about one soldier, it is about all of the soldiers. No one is more important than the other. <br/><br/>Overall, Dunkirk is an exceptional addition to Nolan's impressive filmography. Crafting a unique war film that doesn't rely on overtly patriotic moments to move it forward is hard yet Nolan makes it seem effortless. The film relies on the courage and sheer will power of the human soul and that is something only the rarest of war films can do. Despite some wonky story telling, Dunkirk is nonetheless exhilarating and should absolutely be seen on the big screen."

","could not see the point of this film, as usual all the critics applaud a very flawed, unemotional and very banal film i was looking for the experience, the spectacle but there was nothing. the cutting between the timelines was utterly pointless and distracting, in fact everything in the film makes sure you do not get involved, you do not care for anyone or what is going on. Again Nolan puts in really bad unbelievable things, would a pretty heavy spitfire be able to glide and manouvre for some considerable time and then do a perfect landing. once again he bombardes you with an ear splitting soundtrack, zimmers pounding racket, bombs, bullets and other sound effect have the effect of distancing you from everything. in the entire film i don't think one boat or ship was seen moving even when they were supposed to. there were over 900 boats of various sizes, he shows about ten, in the air the luftwaffe were creating havoc, we see three spitfires and about six to ten German planes. all in all an insult to the men being rescued and the people who came for them."

","THIS REVIEW DOES NOT REALLY CONTAINS SPOILERS. I ADDED THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO CLUE HOW MUCH OF PLOT ELEMENTS YOU CAN SHARE FOR IT TO BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER. <br/><br/>From beginning to the end, Dunkirk is gorgeous. The scenes look real and lifelike and that can have a strong impression. It's photography is so stunning (I assume shot in location), and the scenes so well composed that you really have the impression you are in the middle of a war zone. That was the only thing I liked about this movie. I mean, don't get me wrong, most people will likely find this movie amazing. I believe I have a perhaps more strict requirements from movies than most, to name a few that weren't met (maybe some people will feel like this is a spoiler, because it will make them enjoy less the movie, since well, it's crap, but the haven't realized yet): <br/><br/><ul><li>there is no story. Nothing happens. I like movies where things happen. This movie is funny that way, nothing really goes on. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>it's some propaganda BS. like really: the time when some rich aristocrat came to rescue soldiers with his yacht. it almost makes me laugh. I keep thinking about the uselessness of yachts and how much it costs to keep one, about an aristocratic Englishman voting laws to keep immigrants away and going around in his yacht, maybe feeling bad about starving kids in Africa and how he just voted a law that makes sure none of those will never enter English soil, and maybe he feels a little bit bad about his yacht and how much diesel it uses. Maybe he thinks about climate change or how he spent in one hour 120 pounds in diesel alone on making his way to Belgium, and how much he would spend in total, not that he cares that much about money as he has plenty. He cares about the public opinion, he himself knows a yacht IS an useful thing, a necessity, if you will. And also he didn't even buy this yacht, he inherited it, so was it really his fault? But now, after Dunkirk, he is relieved. He will be seen sailing as the hero he believes he is. Rescuing people, letting strangers into his boat and taking them to safety. Not that he would let anyone into his boat and help them to England - Hell no! If the were English soldiers, in distress, in time of war, then yes, but other cases, of course not. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>do I really need to bash it more? Okay, so the characters are not developed. There is no depth to them. I cannot even tell if the actors did a good or a bad job, because we learn nothing about no one. Maybe that's the genius (GENIUS BEGINS), keeping the mystery. OR it is lazy writing and poor storytelling. WHO knows? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>One sided AF. We see no German soldiers - maybe that's the genius (THE DARK GENIUS) - or maybe it is a one sided propaganda crap, as the victor tells the story kinda thing. I mean, have you seen a story book saying that the rapist, thieving bigoted man that destroyed the land and were insane and horrible actually won something? </li></ul><br/><br/>In short, the whole thing was mind numbing. I was expecting some sort of introspective drama, maybe even some new insight into war or something deeper, OMG, an 8.4 on IMDb, right. But I think this score is fabricated, this movie is mediocre at best - although beautiful. Huge disappointment, don't spend your money, wait for it to come in Netflix and then, I will congratulate you if you watch it until the end. 2 hours of my life I will never see again and money they took from me to watch a freaking English yacht aristocrat save the day by going into war when he wasn't even drafted. Like really, it pisses me off so much thinking about it I would like to challenge the director to a fist fight. And have him give me my cinema money back."
"classicsoncall","6","8","12","26 August 2017"," ""We shall never surrender.""
","I'm not going to go into a long winded review of why I didn't care for this movie because a lot of others have said it a lot better than I can. I will however, mention the comment of another patron of the theater I was at while walking out after the end of the film. When I asked him if he followed what was going on in the story, he stated that it was ""not what I expected"". A very diplomatic way of putting it. Because he was with his wife, and the couple was elderly, is probably the reason why he didn't say it sucked.<br/><br/>What I got out of the picture was this - it was about soldiers drowning, near drowning, about to be drowned or already drowned. What I had anticipated going in, much as the aforementioned fellow movie goer probably did, was something that presented the sheer immensity of the evacuation effort that was the real Dunkirk. There's nothing in the film that approaches that size or scope, leaving one to wonder what made the events of Dunkirk so memorable.<br/><br/>The topper for all of this for me was a newspaper headline near the end of the picture that declared the character George (Barry Keoghan) a 'hero of Dunkirk'. His claim to heroism - the teenager was killed by a soldier who declared his cowardice and didn't want to go back to the front lines. I don't mean to disparage the kid, he was just doing his job the best way he knew how.<br/><br/>Regarding that scene which took place on a private boat in a rescue effort of evacuating soldiers, George's father came to that shell shocked soldier's defense before the event that resulted in George's death, stating to his other son that ""He may never be himself again"". Unfortunately, that's the way I felt leaving the theater."
"Skaigear","5","8","12","18 August 2017"," Technical excellence, but uninteresting and monotonous
","Dunkirk is a historical war action drama, written and directed by Christopher Nolan. I have always been a big Nolan fan so naturally I was hyped for this movie. Nolan has knack of taking a genre he has never done before and somehow make it appealing to the masses and intelligent at the same time. A superhero trilogy? Check. A dream heist film? Check. A space travel sci-fi? Check. Admittedly, I am not a big fan of the war genre, but I was still very curious to see how Nolan would tackle it.<br/><br/>The film is unquestionably extremely well-made, and I could see why people would love it and claim it as one of the best movies of the year, but to me it was just far too dull. While the interweaving of three perspectives is interesting, I did not feel any tension during the lackluster action scenes because I did not care about any of the characters since their development was non-existent. A lot of the times, unless it was Cillian Murphy or Tom Hardy, I could not even tell which character was who, complicating things to an already unexciting movie. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was also a miss, which is shocking because I loved all his previous Nolan efforts. Also for a war movie, it really could have benefited from an R-rating, as the bloodless PG-13 makes things even duller than it already is.<br/><br/>There are a few things I really liked though, namely the sound design when the spitfire jets were descending down the beach, wailing terrifyingly like monstrous banshees. The acting was also mostly well performed throughout by everybody especially Mark Rylance as a civilian going into Dunkirk to save the men. The film's technical excellence cannot be denied, but with uninteresting action and monotonous characters, Dunkirk was just a disappointment. You can say I do not understand the film, but I believe I understood it just fine; I was just not as enthralled as should be to Nolan standards."

","What a weird movie. The script should be able to fit on a single page and there are very few dialogues (and certainly none that you would remember).

"susand1108","2","8","12","6 August 2017"," Use just one of those millions and hire a script writer
","The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 is the cinematography. Make no mistake: this was a horrible movie -- not just boring but horrible. The characters, if you can call them that, were undeveloped and unlikable. How can you care about a character if they haven't even got a name? Nothing but a hodge podge of ""intense"" scenes, one after the other, and yet they all look alike after a few minutes.<br/><br/>There was no attempt to tell the inspiring story of Dunkirk. If you didn't happen to know it (and certainly if you came in one minute late, after the silly title card intro), you'd be completely lost. But then why would you think this was about Dunkirk anyway? How could you mistake the couple of hundred soldiers on a beach, three pilots, two ships, and one fishing boat for a story about the Dunkirk rescue? (My mistake, by the end there were maybe a dozen boats.) <br/><br/>Where did the money go? Certainly not to CGI where they could have beefed up the numbers accurately. Certainly not to an actual screen- writer who might have given us a narrative. It must have gone towards having all those glorious BS rave reviews written. <br/><br/>And don't get me started on the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer should be ashamed of himself. 7000 measures of the same loud droning strings!"

"puckamo","2","8","12","4 August 2017"," Almost a total disappointment
","The story of the ""little ships"" and their rescue of the British army at Dunkirk deserves a great movie, and this is not it. Or even close. The first scenes are compelling, and the vision of the troops standing in line on the beach, queuing up patiently for the transport that might never come, is striking. Mark Rylance is superb as always, and Kenneth Branagh shows up, though he doesn't have much to do. I've heard from friends that they found the Spitfire dogfights boring, but I didn't- they are often confusing, and the shots from the pov of the Spitfire pilots are too short, but the scenes stay in your mind. But after about fifteen minutes the relentless, incessant, ever-present ""music"" of Hans Zimmer begins to wear on any sensible viewer, especially once you realize that there's another hour and a half to go. This ""music"" never stops, and once that becomes apparent, and the time jumping starts in earnest, the movie really starts to grind, with only momentary flashes to show what it could have been. Christopher Nolan should stick to the franchise movies and let someone with some sensibility handle the real-life epics."

"PaddySlattery","3","8","12","29 July 2017"," A wasted opportunity. Style over substance.
","Note: This is my first ever IMDb contribution.<br/><br/>Lets put a few things aside first, like the fact that Christopher Nolan wrote/directed while Hans Zimmer composed the score; Hoyte van Hoytema helming cinematography with an incredible cast of familiar faces mixed with fresh new faces in a film based on a story inspired by a landmark moment in history where countless men and women senselessly lost their lives at war......Yep, leaving all those factors aside, lets judge this film on its own merits.<br/><br/>I should also mention that I haven't heard or read one single review of this film yet so I'm not swayed or influence by anyone. I'm looking forward to hearing other peoples views tho, because I've a feeling this film may divide opinion; maybe not immediately with the hype machine in full flow but later down the line when the dust settles.<br/><br/>Anywho.... where to begin!? The positives - The film looks incredible (cinematography, production design and costume) and you know its not a good sign when you have to start off with how good it looks....but it does. It looks great. Oscar worthy greatness. It's the one note that was perfectly hit in this film, in my honest opinion. Speaking of hitting notes... Hans Zimmer's score was, eh, great, too....but.... eh.... let me see..... how do I.....? OK, let's tackle the negatives - Well, you see, Hans' great score was hindered by an extremely disjointed script. Yes, there I said it. This script was an absolute mess and don't give me that BS about ""Oh Chris was going for a chaotic mess of a script in order to truly reflect the physical chaos of the"" ...no. Just no. You can portray a chaotic mess and still beautifully craft a coherent story with proper character development. (See Saving Private Ryan). Poor old Han's score, which showed great promise at times, was ripped apart during a long succession of badly crafted sequences and non-linear time-lines. What made this 2 hours (felt like 3) even more excruciating was the desperate measure Nolan employed with the sound design in order to hold audiences attention to a story that failed gloriously to do so. At the end of the film, when he turned off the ""tension builder"" sound effect, I was left there feeling.... WOW. Was that it? Really? <br/><br/>I've seen many great war movies in my life ie. Paths of Glory, Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, The Longest Day, Black Hawk Down, The Deer Hunter, The Pianist, Ivan's Childhood, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Empire of the Sun, The Bridge on the River Kwai etc. etc. etc. and what each and every one of these films had in common was humanity. A story that speaks to the heart of their heroes AND villains. Even through a variety of brilliantly chosen lenses, Dunkirk failed to let us in. It just gave us a sequence of events wrapped up in one big event, garnished with great action and visuals and said ""go make sense of it yourself"". Don't get me wrong, that's not always a bad thing. I love to work as an audience member, but mining for a soul in this film would have felt like mining for gold on the bog of Allen. And such a great selection of character actors, too, including our own (Irish) Cillian Murphy and Barry Keoghan, with so much to offer, but if its not on the page, the actors can only give you so much.<br/><br/>I know.... harsh right? Who the fudge do I think I am, wha? Don't worry, the film will make it's millions back and all will be well but I still fell this was a huge wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>I watched this film with 6 other people last night and I even spoke with a few others in the cinema after the film. Everyone I spoke to felt let down by the story and how it was told. Everyone also thought it looked great, so I guess there is that.<br/><br/>Will Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk stand the test of time and join the extraordinary league of epic war movies? Only time will tell. Personally, I don't think it comes close.<br/><br/>Out of ten, I'd give this film a sturdy 5.5. It looks great with great performances and its relentlessly honest in its portrayal, aside from a couple of forced sentimental moments at the end. As for the story itself....Well, it felt sterile and cold. Of course, that was Nolan's intention,I'm sure."

","After seeing previews showing authentic WWII aircraft, I thought ""Wow,"" and couldn't wait to see this in our IMAX. While the visuals were indeed superb, I found the ""Batman"" like dramatic soundtrack intended to ramp up the viewers anxiety levels during intense battle scenes overwhelming. This effect was used throughout the movie and in my opinion was completely unnecessary and became progressively annoying as the movie played on. Frankly, I think the action sequences were sufficiently thrilling alone, where including an instrumental soundtrack only served to distract the viewer from any sense of the realism portrayed on screen. It's unfortunate that Christopher Nolan choose to portray this event in a ""Batman"" like dramatic setting.<br/><br/>I did feel the movie was entertaining, but not nearly the caliber of a ""Saving Private Ryan"" quality as I was hoping for. There are several stories playing out, leaving insufficient time for character development to the extent needed to make you really care about anyone in particular. There were also a couple of action sequences that strained credibility if you are a WWII realist, but fortunately not so many that it came off as a ""Rambo"" type film.<br/><br/>I think most will enjoy it as an above average WWII offering with great visuals. With a few tweaks, it could have been much better though."

","I don't remember watching a movie this bad in a long time. And that comes from a Nolan fan *and* a ww2 fanatic. I have no idea why this movie is hyped as it is, but there was very little that attracted me to the movie.<br/><br/>1) Throughout the movie a total absence of scale is prevalent. You never have the feeling that Dunkirk was about 400,000 men crammed in a relatively small section of coastline. Empty, if anything, is the only word that describes most of the movie.<br/><br/>2) An unhealthy amount of recycling of the same locations makes the movie feel cheap. Most shots are framed in such a way that you never really get to see much beyond the absolutely necessary. The inside of a boat, a little cross section of a cruiser, a very close-up zoomed image of a pilot in a cockpit that doesn't even shake or show any signs of noise or discomfort. The same little stretch of beach with the exact same docking cranes features in various scenes - always the same angle, the same distance.<br/><br/>3) The dialogue is weak. Unnatural, sometimes almost as if part of more takes of dialogue that were removed later on. Short, abrupt, without conviction. Never feeling the tension as a reason to not talk. Or excessive boredom. Or sleep. No, it just feels like the characters didn't really have a soul.<br/><br/>4) The actors were generic and poorly chosen. They didn't feel like they were really unified with their character. Many of them looked alike and that's about as deep as we go.<br/><br/>5) There is a lot of ""time stretching"" going on in this movie. Things that would last 30 seconds or a few minutes in real life last an hour and a half in the movie. There is so little information to tell, so few scenes, boats, airplanes and so little story telling going on that they made every tiny accomplishment or happening last almost throughout half the movie, bit by bit, ""interwoven"" (and that is a word that makes it sound better than it is) with each other. But boring in the end.<br/><br/>6) The total lack of historical accuracy bothers me. It's not that Nolan has so much wrong in broad lines. No, it's quite accurate (also because he doesn't have much to tell, it seems). But the horrible depiction of for example the stranded fishing boat scene. After the first set of holes shoot up the hull, the soldiers are fighting among themselves ""who needs to leave the boat to make it lighter"". WHILE STANDING CHEST-DEEP IN WATER. Really, 70 kilos will make a difference when standing in 5-6 tons of floodwater?<br/><br/>Or the spitfire. Which flies at around 100 meters altitude, loses it's engine power but glides for seemingly forever.And forever. And forever. And then some. Just the actual seconds of flight time and the portrayed speed means it would have basically flown a dozen kilometers. But ...of course, it still ended up at the same tiny stretch of beach, same cranes in the background. Jesus.<br/><br/>7) CHEAP. I just can't put my finger on it, but the entire movie just feels ""lower budget"" than what I expected or would deem a minimum. The way the movie is edited doesn't help, a lot of the footage lacks cinematic grandeur, the music is predictable and somewhat repetitive. This movie can't even polish the shoes of intense, gripping productions like Band of Brothers. Literally the most boring scenes of that miniseries are still more interesting than the most interesting scenes of Dunkirk. And that's a sad conclusion to sum this all up with.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm wasting my time even writing this - the movie is just not worth really thinking about. I'm going to watch a few documentaries about Dunkirk to get the bad aftertaste of Nolan's failed recount out of my mouth."

"wigglytoes","4","9","14","28 September 2017"," An assault on my ears
","I went to see Dunkirk at the very end of it's movie theater run. Therefore I've heard how great it is, and was expecting to be impressed. Maybe I was expecting too much but I was underwhelmed. <br/><br/>Now a day later I have found out that 'the Mole' is a dock for loading ships. Where the screen showed 'The mole, one week', 'The Sea, one Day', and 'The air, One Hour' it meant that there was going to be three different story lines occurring over one week, one day, and one hour, simultaneously. I didn't realize, while watching the film, that that was how the film was setup. (I was trying to figure out what a Mole was. It would have really helped if they said ""The Dock - during one week"", etc. Plus the movie continuously cuts back and forth between these story lines. So you move forward in time, then back, then forward. Throw that all together and you can see why the movie is very confusing to some.<br/><br/>I'm very familiar with the story of Dunkirk so the jumping around from time line to time line didn't throw me off that much. Except for when it was obviously night time in one story, and daytime in another. If I only had known that there were three movies going on at once. It would have made a lot more sense.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie was the sound track. Perhaps this only occurred in my theater (I doubt that), but it was oppressively loud. Not just the bang bang of guns firing, that's expected in movies these days, but here there is constant background droning. Not airplane noise - just really loud single note background noise. I took a tissue and stuffed it into my ears within 10 minutes of the start of the film, and I never felt that I could take the plugs out.<br/><br/>The next biggest problem is the lack of a coherent story. I went with a friend who didn't know the Dunkirk story, and she had no idea what was going on. Over 300,000 soldiers were evacuated! You never would have known that through this movie. A third of the soldiers evacuated were French! You will have the opposite idea after the movie. Hundreds of small boats helped in the evacuation! The film shows about 12. The real WWII soldiers were well disciplined, and while there is always chaos in war, there was a chain of command in control! In this film there seems to be 3 people of high rank and everyone else is a private and on their own.<br/><br/>There are some good points to the movie. Not enough to justify the current price of admission, but it wasn't a total waste."
"lovesandwich","6","9","14","14 September 2017"," It looks beautiful and at times immerses you in the action, but that's about it
","Personally, I was disappointed by it. And I actually like Inception and Interstellar.<br/><br/>It looks very good, and the scenes where stuff was happening did immerse you in the experience. I admire the lack of dialogue and the use of actors who looked authentic, warts and all.<br/><br/>But the characters were almost like cardboard cutouts and I did not feel any sort of attachment to any of them nor did I reach any deeper understanding of them. There was not nearly enough historical context provided.<br/><br/>I hated the soundtrack. I found it was grating and at times the movie was just too loud. Some will say it was supposed to be grating, but I still found it pretentious. It's like the usual ""bwaaaaaas"" we hear for dramatic effect in all the blockbuster films and their previews. It worked for me at the beginning of Inception, but they didn't cram that kind of thing into every scene like they do here, and there was an actual soundtrack that wasn't just bombastic noise IMO. A guy can't even take a dump without the soundtrack trying to make it seem epic.<br/><br/>I also felt that many parts just dragged on, and that there were things that didn't quite make sense to me, such as:<br/><br/>I didn't understand why all the soldiers stood on the pier like sitting ducks. In WWI, people figured out that you shouldn't build trenches in a straight line because a plane can just swoop down and machine gun everyone in it. Yet here are the soldiers standing exactly in that formation. I was surprised that the planes continued dropping bombs rather than just gunning everyone down. The soldiers also just kept cowering instead of firing at the planes. Enough people firing a volley seems like it wouldn't be in vain.<br/><br/>The scene in the boat with the bullet holes appearing and everyone arguing about how someone should leave, even though the weight of the water coming in was several times that of a single man, and then them trying to plug the holes with their hands when I could've sworn I saw things lying around in there that they could have used. Even if they did manage to plug the holes with their hands, they couldn't possibly keep them plugged the whole way, and people will still have to go up to sail the boat. Let alone the fact that it made no sense for Germans, or whoever else, to waste time distracting themselves with target practice on a vessel and giving away their position when in a real combat situation.<br/><br/>I found the flight scenes to be redundant and boring. There were times when it did feel realistic and was kind of cool, but then they would just show what almost felt like the same scenes repeatedly. Some say they actually reused footage.<br/><br/>When that pilot goes down and can't get out of the cockpit, I felt it was such a drawn out cliché. And I didn't understand why the other pilot stays behind and lands further east on the beach instead of landing and evacuating with the others. I thought maybe it was so that he could be there in case there were other planes to shoot down, but then he would have stayed in the area, not left it.<br/><br/>The scenes on the civilian yacht felt unnecessary and unengaging. The flashback to Cillian Murphy's past didn't add anything to the story and wasn't clearly transitioned into, making it confusing. And I didn't understand why all of these people came on the boats when each of them is taking the space of a soldier who could be evacuated.<br/><br/>Similarly confusing and pretentious was how there were supposedly three parts to this with an amount of time accompanying each, which I didn't understand, e.g. ""the mole (one week)"" and ""air (one hour)."" I hate when this is done unnecessarily. Tarantino loves overusing that.<br/><br/>All the British pride schlock was cringe-worthy, from the kid who is a ""hero"" because he hit his head and died, taking up the space of multiple soldiers as he was lying down, to many of Kenneth Branagh's one-dimensional scenes, to the writing at the end just before the credits.<br/><br/>To me, it felt more like a pet project that Nolan enjoyed geeking out over while making, but that isn't as pleasant for the actual viewers, except Nolan fanboys who will eat up anything he does and call it a masterpiece, hence the artificially high rating on IMDb and the glowing reviews everywhere.<br/><br/>There are also doubts as to its historical accuracy, though I personally am not knowledgeable in the topic.<br/><br/>An article in Slate titled ""What's Fact and What's Fiction in Dunkirk"" claims that it is largely accurate.<br/><br/>But then I've heard others say it isn't historically accurate, e.g. claiming that:<br/><br/>-The number of soldiers and boats shown was nowhere near the true scale of what happened<br/><br/>-There were anti-aircraft guns present<br/><br/>-There were more than three spitfires available that day<br/><br/>-There was no high-ranking officer such as Branagh's character on the ground<br/><br/>-The beach looked too clean, when in reality there were debris everywhere<br/><br/>-The buildings in the background are all undamaged when in reality they had taken heavy damage<br/><br/>-It contains many anachronisms: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/goofs"

"shauni15","6","9","14","22 August 2017"," one of the most perplexing films I've ever seen
","Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk was heralded everywhere as his greatest achievement yet, so you can imagine as a big fan of his i was excited to see it.<br/><br/>Well, that excitement turned to disappointment very fast<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes are very impressive, the camera-work, the direction, the pacing are fantastic, the film has the best ship sinking scene filmed since titanic, the air battles are also exceptionally well filmed, and are way more subtle and realistic than most films.<br/><br/>The problems however stem from two different, but very important things.<br/><br/>first of all, the film has no characters, none of them are developed at all, we don't have a protagonist to root for really, all the actors are just used as props for the big battle scenes without any personality or investment.<br/><br/>i feel like Nolan was so happy with how well he story-boarded his big scenes that he only realized he forgot to write actual characters in the movie when the cameras were already rolling, which is really confusing to me, because Nolan used to be one of those directors who prioritized characters over the plot in most of his movies, sometimes even to their detriment (like the dark knight rises).<br/><br/>but this was just a big spectacle with zero personal investment, granted the sequences themselves were exceptionally well executed and filmed so kudos to Nolan for that, he really took it to the next level, but if we're not invested then no matter how well it's done we wont care, so the movie unfortunately became boring very quickly, which wasn't helped by the other big problem.<br/><br/>The movie becomes very repetitive. We see an amazing ship sinking sequence, with mouths wide open, but then the next big sequence is another ship sinking, and then another, and then another, the same with the plane fight sequences, they just did the same thing over and over, and since we weren't invested to begin with, it became even more boring.<br/><br/>So the movie was ultimately an exercise in futility, Christopher Nolan wasted one of his best directorial achievements on a movie with his worst writing one. Resulting in an impersonal, albeit impressive film, that lacks heart and character."

","While the true story and heroic efforts of the Dunkirk Evacuation deserve a 10, this movie does not. The worst of it was the droning, somber monotony of the musical soundtrack, particularly in the first portion of the movie, which has to be the most tediously overwrought score in history; followed by another heavy handed long section of a repetitively monotonous 4 or 5 note ascending minor scale, all of which was a serious and unfortunate detraction from the action on screen. <br/><br/>One of the historically unique facts of this evacuation was the civilian fleet of nearly 400 small craft (Wikipedia) which heroically volunteered for this amazing feat, which I think was under-depicted. <br/><br/>By the movie's end, it confirmed the senseless stupidity of geo-political wars and conflicts caused by governmental leaders, and the resulting senseless personal loss at the battle front. But faced with this senselessness, it also celebrated individual acts of bravery and sacrifice.<br/><br/>Conspicuously and sadly absent was a written narrative at the end which summarized and brought into focus the huge scope of this historic evacuation, along with actual photographs."
"mttuk","5","9","14","10 August 2017"," Fails to deliver overall
","I have been so looking forward to this movie. Having studied the evacuation of Dunkirk, many years ago and also having been to visit the beaches and also the wartime tunnels at Dover where much of the planning was conceived, my expectations was that this would be a movie to rival all WW2 movies before it.<br/><br/>However, all the way through the movies I felt like it was skimming the surface of what happened and never really got going at any point. I left deeply disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie itself is telling the story of the evacuation from several different viewpoints which are timed in with each other. This I felt was a really good concept, to get the views of civilians trying to help, soldiers, fliers and officers alike. Where it falls down in my opinion is that the film is almost totally devoid of script. The characters involved only have a few lines throughout the entire movie. It is hard to find any type of connection to them as there is no story about them.<br/><br/>But perhaps the biggest let down of them all is that there is literally zero mention of the epic planning, call to arms and execution of the Dunkirk evacuation. There is hardly any mention of Bertram Ramsey, the man responsible for the entire evacuation. This was the largest evacuation of troops in British military history. There were hundreds of private trawlers used, hundreds of aircraft, dozens of royal navy ships. This film failed to capture any of this and instead focused on a few individuals, but failed to give them a script.<br/><br/>Honestly I feel that if you didn't know the story of Dunkirk, before you went and saw this, you would leave still not really knowing, and this for me is the greatest let down by Nolan. This movie FAILS to actually tell the story of Dunkirk.<br/><br/>The music score by Hans Zimmer is excellent, the effects in the movie are excellent. It fails in almost every other department."
"jbuchana-21199","5","9","14","10 August 2017"," ""Some ships rescue a bunch of soldiers"" By Christopher Nolan
","This was one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. I LOVE historical and war movies, but this is not the case, Though it wasn't awful, i'd probably never watch it again. Pros: great story. Good acting. No cheese scenes. Period. Cons: Edition is terrible, very difficult to get along with (my sister got completely lostwith the non lineal timing). Characters are really underdeveloped. I didn't cared at all if they lived or not, because there was no plausible difference with non- main character soldiers. Music is quite annoying (sorry Hans) Staging SUCKS. There were 400.000 souls and 1000 civil boats in Dunkirk. But Nolan decided that 2000 soldiers and 20 boats were enough. WHERE THE HECK ARE THE OTHER 398000 SOLDIERS AND 980 BOATS MY DEAR CHRISTOPHER?!??!?!? A HUGE BUDGET JUST TO PAY FACELESS TOM HARDY? WELCOME TO CGI ERA!!!! YOU JUST HAVE TO DO COPY PASTE A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH YOUR ARMY! MY DEAR GOD IT REALLY GRINDS MY GEARS. Pause Breathe Happy place Where were we? Yes! Conclusions. The movie is just... good. Maybe the problem is that I was expecting a movie way more overwhelming. The movie is, all in all, inconsistent. Characters are shallow and you never get to understand the real dimension of the events. You just now how many people they saved because the paper says so. But if it was for Nolan's point of view, it's just a bunch of boats that saved a couple hundred soldiers. Really difficut to understand if you never read about Dunkirk before. As I have already said, the most disappointing movie I've ever seen."

","What can I say about this film that doesn't slate it too much, everything. What a load of boring drivel, all the adverts saying it's a masterpiece, best acting ever, pffft. We are basically shown in this film that our ships were made of paper, one torpedo and they were sunk in 2 minutes, the fighter pilot has no aim whatsoever, he rarely speaks and then instead of landing his plane on a safe part of the beach or in the sea he decides to land miles away from anywhere but right in front of the Germans, which by the way is pretty much the only time you see one. In another part some soldiers are trying desperately to sail a boat full of bullet holes by sticking their fingers in them, like that's going to help. Now don't get me wrong, I totally understand how awful it must have been for the soldiers standing their waiting and the pain and suffering they had to endure, but this film did not really portray that at all, what a shame that all the radio and TVs hype yet another movie just to make money, there were so many other random scenes in this film almost as if someone picked up lots of bits from the cutting room and stuck them all together. Sorry but this film is a no no."

"sq8188-162-458059","3","9","14","6 August 2017"," The story is the story ?
","Would have been good if there were any real story except maybe one about the RAF pilot what little there was. Director Nolan is trying to tell a story through a soldier's eyes. He tracks one young private with no name and gave him almost no dialog throughout the retreat. The soldier with no name wore the same shell-shock expression in the entire movie. Nothing he did was significant - so why are we following him? The pilot whom i was told was a great actor in UK but he had on a pilot's face mask the entire time, only at the end when he fueled out and stepped off his plane did he show his face. The pilot showed great skill in aerial combat. When his 2 other fly mates were shot down, he seemed to have stemmed the entire Nazi air force all by himself. At the end, the story suggests he chose to stay in the fight using up all his fuel than leaving the British ships undefended. Amazingling the ships nearly did nothing to defend themselves! I don't see any AA action. Nolan must be a one-sided believer in air power. I had to stretch my imagination to see what the pilot was up to. The beach at times look deserted. There were supposed to be 400,000 men stranded there. At least they could have CGI some of them in. Weird! The screen writer seems to want to say it's every man for himself out there. There were no order to it. Ken Branaugh was paid to look regal and just say his lines but seems detached to the men or even the war. After an hour of running around, occasional strafing from a couple of Luftwaffe planes and boats sinking it gets monotonous. Without any story building, at least the screen writer could have throw in some perspective from the German side. The only ""german"" seen were shadows of Nazi helmets descended on the pilot after he bailed out and torched his plane. About the boat sinking, director Nolan chose to show 4 maybe 5 boats sinking if you count the hospital ship in the beginning. The entire British destroyer loss in the operation was six. Nolan was obliged to show almost all of them sinking ?<br/><br/>I thought the 1958 version of Dunkirk was boring, but this one bores just same, except some spectacular air crashes. Not enough to save anything. Not even close to ""Private Ryan""."
"Uberiffic","Null","9","14","4 August 2017"," emotionless, dull, tedious and frankly poor on every level
","Not being a Christopher Nolan slappie, I was able to judge this effort all on its own merit. Watching what hits the screen plays out like a tedious and poorly constructed cable documentary. Honestly, there is literally not one ounce of character development or establishment at all. It's just a dry depiction of three round robin events that cascades from one harrowing circumstance to the next. one revolving around a fighter pilot, another around a foot soldier and his French imposter hanger-on trying to survive and the other about an elder statesmen boat owner and his efforts to aid the cause. The only one that is even remotely interesting involves the boat owner, his son and poor lil' George. In fact, the only character name given as to remember it was poor sad lil' George. I didn't make it to the final credits but I wonder if the rest of the cast of characters was simply titled ""nameless soldier""? Having no depth means limited emotional impact and that does a disservice to the real life heroes this movie tries to honor. What alleviates the shear dullness of what is depicted often comes in the form of a racing soundtrack. It's as if the frantic music is your cue on how to react because it's hard to tell by just watching the visuals. The movie itself is all one grim repetitive note. After a while, the grinding soundtrack does start to annoy and pushes towards headache inducing territory. Is that some kind of sloppy film making trick? Trick the audience in to feeling uneasy using other senses rather than simply writing an impactful story? It IS dull and it can hardly be called an actual movie given how it's structured but it's not offensively bad and does its job showing the grim events of Dunkirk."
"nicolaselsen","Null","9","14","2 August 2017"," Why the hype?
","I am sorry, but I did not like this film.<br/><br/>Went to see it with 2 friends, and during the opening 15min both one friend and I both looked at each other, and thought that the location scouts had done a terrible job. From what we could assess, none of the 40's Dunkirk streets had been rebuilt, you see buildings that look strikingly like they were from the 80's or 70's from the last century. For this type of budget? Furthermore, we all know the story, so where were the boats jammed with solders? During several scenes, we see soldiers almost scattered around on a ship. The same with soldiers on the beach. Did they have trouble hiring extras? Was there some resistance to CGI scenery's/soldiers in? If yes, then I am sorry, but it did part of making this film a failure in my eyes. The music and the ticking clock, that you almost hear constantly in this film had it's own little role in annoying me (just annoying, not adding suspense or any form of dimension. We do know that time was a factor in Dunkirk, there's no need to give you 2h of ticking clock for that).<br/><br/>Thumbs up for the air scenes and a good job from Tom Hardy. OK for drama, decent job from the young actors. A film transporting the right level of patriotism for this monumental achievement by the British/French people, not forgetting about the individual tragedies and lives torn apart.<br/><br/>But, I am sorry, I think this was a terrible job for creating the canvas of the movie, the set & atmosphere.<br/><br/>I don't like to trash films, but in this case, the people who were there deserve better."
"dave-goodman-130-352295","2","9","14","2 August 2017"," Woefully disappointing
","Looking at most of the other reviews I must have watched a different movie. I expected a lot from this movie from the build up and hype, especially given the story line. If you are expecting something along the lines of SPR then forget it. For a start this movie should have been a U certificate as there is absolutely nothing in it that would justify a 12a or even a 12 certificate. All that would constitute a rating above a U (Graphic scenes of violence, Gore element, Nudity and profane language) there was none. The whole film was empty of any feeling of fear or danger of what it was like being involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk. At no point do you get even a bit emotional during the movie and at the end you are left thinking Oh Well.. shall we go and get a pizza. I sat alongside a couple of people in their 80's who's only tears were the price of the tickets. They simply said 'It was nothing like that...much worse). This really was a movie about one man and his boat setting out in his frightfully perfect suit and tie in an effort to rescue the whole of 300,000 stranded servicemen. One dogfight involving 6 planes shown from different perspectives (which was not only boring but confusing) throughout the movie, two ships sinking..again shown multiple times from different perspectives and a few queues of soldiers in perfectly clean uniforms (bearing in mind they are escaping after months of combat) as if they were waiting for the canteen to open. When a 'straffe' occurred they all ducked as if ducking from the rain. The worse thing was you were left with the impression that only half a dozen local fishing boats went over because thats all you see arriving at the beach. Tom Hardy in the roll of a spitfire pilot was a total waste of an A list actor and as for the acting debut of Harry Stiles...well give me a break, stick to singing I would say. Mark Rylance is superb as ever and Kenneth Brannagh..well you know Kenneth.. Rah Rah Yah Yah and all that, a proper gentleman he was organizing the hospital ship. Strangely no German soldiers...in a WWII war film, give me a break please. The biggest laugh, all said and done and the half a dozen boats had rescued all 300,000 (which you didn't see) they were welcomed home by the dutiful English lady with a Cup of Tea more less saying 'There There Boys better luck next time. This movie given Nolan's previous work had so much potential and totally missed the opportunity. I give it 2 for the sound effects, which were also awful but better than the movie."
"mitchell5954","6","9","14","25 July 2017"," Dunkirk is Okay but Underwhelming
","Dunkirk is the latest film by Christopher Nolan. As usual people are praising his film as a masterpiece. I'm a fan of Nolan so I wanted to love this film like everyone else. However, I have to be honest; this is one of his weaker films, in my opinion. I'm not the biggest fan of war movies, so that doesn't help either. I would put this over The Prestige and The Dark Knight Rises, but every other film he's made I think is better. I would even put Interstellar over this. I'm not the biggest fan of war films, so that doesn't help either. Though, this is certainly not the best war movie I've seen either. The film isn't bad, but it's painfully average.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple. The Germans have pushed the British and the French back to the beaches of Dunkirk. Military vessels and plains are in short supply so civilian boats are mobilized to rescue the stranded troops on the beach. The rest of the film is the soldiers surviving on the beach as the civilian vessels make their way there.<br/><br/>The film does some things well. From a technical aspect Dunkirk is amazing. The film looks great, and the effects are amazing, as one would expect from a Nolan film. It has the typical gray, bleak look to it, like in most Nolan movies, but it fit the tone of the film and gave it a good atmosphere. The music also fit very well.<br/><br/>The action scenes are alright for what they are. This is not action-heavy war movie, but a survival war picture. Do not expect wall-to-wall action in that sense. I also like how the Germans are never seen throughout the flick, but there presence is still heavily felt. The few fight scenes we do get are okay at best. Some of the action gets confusion, and becomes difficult to tell who is fighting who.<br/><br/>The issue with this movie is that it gets dull. This is one of Nolan's shorter films, at two hours, yet you can still feel the length at times. Some scenes feel unnecessary or are dragged out for too long.<br/><br/>The characters are also dull. That's the film's main problem is that all of the characters are boring. The acting is fine, but the characters they are not that interesting; none of them. Cillian Murphy, a great actor, is wasted in this role. It's not that I hated any of the characters, but I wasn't invested in any of them either.<br/><br/>That's a problem, because characters are essential getting invested in a story. If you have good characters the viewers are on that journey with them and feel what they feel. Since I wasn't invested in the characters the film did not hit nearly as hard with me as it should have. The message of Dunkirk is the same as any war film. It wants to convey to the audience how terrible war is. However, there are so many war movies that do this better because they have a better cast that resonates with you.<br/><br/>Overall, Dunkirk is a mixed bag. It's an okay movie that's worth one watch. However, there are better war films, and certainly better Christopher Nolan movies, out there."
"bobbobwhite","5","9","14","23 July 2017"," More like a documentary than a dramatic film
","Not too much I liked about this film. Emotionless story for the most part, with mostly repetitive bombing and killing and a soundtrack that was deafening and unrelenting. The film's color was also washed out which bled any potential emotion from it. Character development was non-existent. Mostly scenes of scared to death young men trying to survive.<br/><br/>Didn't like at all the 3 stories in one gimmicky approach to this important historical event. Scenes constantly jumped from one of the 3 stories to the another with no relationship to the last scene shown, only to the last scene of the same story shown earlier. Also, too much repetition and different angles of air attacks, with soldiers constantly in the water from bombings and too little of anything else that made Dunkirk the historical war icon that it is known to be. For example, in one scene it was disheartening and historically inaccurate to show one destroyer that didn't even fire a shot at a bomber that sunk it even as the plane was clearly visible from miles off. And, the many plane dog fights were too repetitive and did not look realistic for the most part. There were also too many scenes that looked ""off"" in historical accuracy to me, one example being the one of soldiers in an abandoned boat on the beach, being shot at by an unseen shooter, but none of the soldiers were killed or even hit by the many bullets that pierced the boat's sides. Not one.<br/><br/>The entire story and editing of the film annoyed me to the point that I ended up not caring much what happened at the end. That is never a good thing in a war movie. The different time lines of the 3 stories were more than disorienting at times as the film cut from story to story and back again, with all time in each......suspended. <br/><br/>If this famous filmmaker wanted to make a documentary, he should have made one. What was missing was a dramatic movie. To me, bad form to mix the two but keep an emotion-starved, washed-out color, documentary style story throughout. This story could have been told and shown a lot better."

Even great names like Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, or Ridley Scott were unable to break this unwritten rule. <br/><br/>However, war films are different. Steven Spielberg's two Best Director awards are accomplished through movies both set in World War II. The Vietnam War Trilogy of Oliver Stone twice win him the Oscar.

Everyone who has seen Dunkirk pictures and movies from around that time period knows what i mean. let me give you few examples, - the only Germans you vaguely see are at the end - the view from the sea to the city and in the opening shows an intact undamaged city, while in 1940 the city was destroyed, it looks more like a holiday resort. - the beached were filled with cars, equipment and most of all soldiers of all nationalities, English, french belgiums and yes also dutch. - you only see few small ships, while there were more than 30 dutch fishing ships for example than the shot at the end with the spit, not to forget the skies at that time in 1940 were filled with German planes and not the few you see in the movie the effect is soo poorly done that its just disappointing. but most of all were were the German soldiers? <br/><br/>So i left with a feeling like is this what everyone is to enthusiast about ? the more think about it the more i see that it was a waist of money and the beach view really did it for me, it spoiled everything.

How can you have 400,000 soldiers on the beach, and not have them do nothing but dodge incoming bombs, and then just stand there and do nothing while staring up in the sky for the next bomb to drop, plus the film had no film shots of the enemy ""Germany"" but of a couple of scenes of the enemy air planes being shot down, also in the film were a submarine ""U-70"" from the enemy torpedoing rescue ship escaping Dunkirk, the submarine was never seen in the in the film but you do see a silhouetting torpedo under water from an aerial view heading towards England naval rescue ships. too many mistakes were made by the director and production here . No war scenes really? 400,000 troops on the beach and no action and where were the french army? 2 stars at best"

","I have no idea why critics seem to enjoy this movie and I have no clue how this has an 8.5/10 (at the time of writing) on IMDb. I hope this is eventually corrected upon DVD release. This movie did have fantastic visuals and amazing sound, but I don't go to movies just for that. I need some sort of character development, which this movie offered none. The characters also looked very similar, so you tend to get confused at times. They try to get you to care if someone dies, but you just aren't attached to them so you won't care if they do die. They also talk about grand scale, but there is no grand scale here. Now, I know very little about Dunkirk, but I'm pretty sure there were hundreds of thousands of people. This film seems so small compared to that number.<br/><br/>I get that the film maker wanted to put you at the center of the action to appreciate the grand scale, but it doesn't seem to work here. You may as well play a WWII video game instead of watching this movie. Honestly, this would've been better if it were a History Documentary instead. At least in that case, you would've learned a lot more with awesome visuals. <br/><br/>Joking aside, I've actually never been so close to walking out halfway through a movie before. You will leave underwhelmed, or in my case, I was angry that I got duped by the critics."

","My wife and I both came away from this film very disappointed. The great critical acclaim did indeed elevate our expectations but the movie just had no depth to it. There were no plot twists, no character development, and there was an incessant dramatic music score throughout the entire movie. It's like hearing the Jaws music for two hours. It simply lost all effect.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh is the postcard for the overacting, pompous British thespian and he stands on a dock for the entirety of the movie in a Captain Crunch uniform filling the role to a ""T"". A good amount of other cheese was layered throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The movie was bereft of heroism save for Tom Hardy's character and a few other spots. <br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, but it's certainly not a great movie.

","I think that all the ""micro vs macro"" envision of the battle and other explanations on good reviews are bullshit. This is a bad movie full of trickery. The beautiful scenery, music, slow action that pretends to be deep and intimate (sometimes I remember the way better 'Thin Red Line', Terrence Malick, 1998) may fool a lot of viewers. But the reality is this: 1. No story at all. Simply some unlikable characters (except the old civilian captain) wandering around.<br/><br/>2. Very bad setting. Modern buildings around the beach, a modern factory on the background and modern ships equipped with recent technology that they tried to disguise, failing miserably, do not help to get into the movie. 3. No epics. 4. No respect for the facts. A few soldiers making a line, a bunch of small boats and three planes gave a very poor envision of the dimensions of the real Dunkirk battle, in which hundreds of thousands of soldiers and thousands of pieces of equipment (trucks, guns, tanks...) packed out the beaches and the city, in which 40000 french soldiers died or were captured backing up the evacuation of the army fighting a real enemy, not an invisible menace that shot out a few bullets and a few bombs with one or two planes from time to time. 5. The French should be offended. 120000 French soldiers were evacuated also. In this movie, French are treated like garbage. 6. Risible air raids and combats, ended with a plane that violates the law of physics. This movie is not a tribute to the Dunkirk soldiers. It is offensive to the memory of that momentous event in the History."

","Ever since I was a child, I always felt attracted to history and specially to World War II, which is why I was on he first line to see this movie once it opened on my local cinema. <br/><br/>After seen the movie, I have to tell that somehow Dunkirk felt different from all the other movies I have seen related to WWII. It might be the non linear narrative, or the fact that the movie depicts the struggle of more than 300k young soldiers trying to save their lives and by doing so becoming seating ducks to the German army. <br/><br/>Even if this event can not be consider a battle victory, because they were fleeing away from he front. It is one of the most inspiring moments of WWII for the English people, were they realized that the impossible can be done and from that moment on, things started to change at least on the psyche of the common people and specially the soldiers. <br/><br/>War movies based on real events, are always brutal and they usually leave you with harsh feelings and empathy thoughts about how it really was to be in the character shoes. A must see movie, Mr. Nolan did it again."
"atoothbrush","5","10","16","29 July 2017"," Less than the sum of its parts.
","If you have seen many Nolan films I feel you already expect a certain style of product walking into this film. I think it fulfills expectations there.<br/><br/>Great production values. Great actors making the most of what they have to play with. Great visuals and cgi. Tense atmospheric score and sound effects.<br/><br/>Sadly it doesn't really come together as a whole package. My opinion is there has been a steady downward trend in Nolan films since Inception (with the exception of The Dark Knight which was only elevated by Heath Ledger's epic performance). This film fits right in that trend.<br/><br/>IMO, many directors given the elements here would be able to craft a better film. Can't give it more than half marks."
"amandazz100","6","10","16","26 July 2017"," Gripping or silly !! I can't decide
","I cannot make up my mind on this one. I loved the complexity of the three time strands. I liked the pacing and the use of music to create the threatening atmosphere. <br/><br/>In principle the idea is neat - there are so many men on the beach that giving a few of them a starring role and back story serves to understate the sheer mass of human suffering and terror being experienced during Dunkirk by everyone there, so the ensemble cast idea is a good one. <br/><br/>In reality though everyone has a back story and the film tradition of picking one or two of those out and providing more rounded characters works well in those circumstances because the audience can empathise, as it is, here we have an ensemble caste with a couple of not very well picked out individual characters that is hard to care too much about. <br/><br/>The film is a kind of half way house - a bit of a war movie, with a few superheros. You can tell it is made by someone more used to the fantasy figure genre. The characters that have been picked out behaving like comic book heroes in terms of the scrapes they get into and how they get out of them, with true Hollywood cliff hanging moments.<br/><br/>The movie is also curiously ""unviolent"" as it made for audience under 12. the beach scenes severely understate the brutality of the situation and the horror of war. The explosions were rather anodyne - Bodies being blown up on beaches but no discernible injuries afterwards.<br/><br/>I also thought the scenes on the beach looked rather sparse - for what was supposed to be 300,000 men. <br/><br/>Showing this from the perspective of the men on the beach without actually seeing the enemy works well but the actual terror of being on the beach does not come across that well especially when the beaches are both so empty and so orderly. <br/><br/>The ending is weak and very ""Hollywood "" unrealistic and happens abruptly - almost as if the money ran out <br/><br/>There are a few "" laugh out loud "" moments from a British sceptic - where someone gets saved at the final moment - true typical Hollywood super hero stuff - not really fitting for a war movie - where such moments probably didn't happen- people just died. <br/><br/>The story ark in the boat probably works best, but that is because it reverts to the tradition of finding characters one can empathise with, though even here rather too comic book for my tastes.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the movie and I found it absorbing, but I don't think its a war masterpiece."

There was so much hype in this movie that i had a pretty high expectation (also just because of his name), I regret to say I didn't enjoy the movie as much as his previous movies. I actually can't feel much emotion in this movie like I did in his other work (I was teary in both inception and interstellar) Maybe because I'm not too familiar with the story (but I did research the whole Dunkirk evacuation before I went to see the movie)I can only say i'm very disappointed and first time in any of his movie i kept wondering when it would finish.

It doesn't make you feel anything in fact it was really hard to concentrate, after every 10 minutes I was literally waiting for something wow to come up which obviously didn't happened. It nowhere shows a genius escape or struggles of a war, just some men swaying from one place to another.The actors lacked intensity, no characters were established it seemed like the writer didn't have any focus or vision for the film.

The disjointed time frames are not clever but annoying. It's so cheap too hardly any boats, five planes and crappy explosions, beautiful blue sky and a lack of effects.

"sorello","1","11","18","31 October 2017"," Worst film reviewed by awful critics
","Having watched most of this historic film, I have come to the conclusion that not only was it a disastrous attempt by an incompetent director, but that Hollywood and the mainstream media critics, are equally inept at their job.<br/><br/>It's a shame IMDb has fallen into this category, as I have used the website as a useful guide to which films I should watch or avoid.<br/><br/>Several strange behavioural anomalies occurred inside the first 10 minutes, which gave a clue to the complete amateurish script and direction by Anthony Nolan, related to the Nolan sisters perhaps.<br/><br/>1. The nasty, evil, German interrogator SNIFFS the cocktail of drugs on the syringe he is about to inject into the hapless captive. 2. When punched repeatedly in the face, the captive does not move his hands in front of his face defensively as one should, even though he is not tied up. 3. Everyone talks one at a time, like a badly written script by Mr.Nolan. 4. When they find the French female spy, they debate whether to hand her over the the Nazis, because the evil, smirking, sadistic, method-actor German officer offered them passage if they handed her over. Both British and Germans were fully armed. They debate one at a time as per Nolan's pathetic style of writing. 5. When the Nazi soldiers open fire on the building, they are standing in a line in the open, shooting planks. No troops would have lasted very long standing in the open firing at other armed soldiers who were under cover, like a badly-made western.<br/><br/>Everyone in the film behaves unnaturally, to when the British officer rebukes a soldier, to the soldier stupid reaction to stand to attention without being told.<br/><br/>I was so much hoping for a good rendition of such an important chapter in the second World War, being British myself, and because 90% of the critics say so, it will go down as such, but the same ""analysts"" loved La, La Land, a place they strictly belong.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a turkey of the worst with dozens of badly written scenes too many to mention, the only surprise is the almost universal acclaim it received from people paid to review movies.<br/><br/>It shows what a terrible state the film industry is in, and Hollywood's deference to shoddy workmanship on a grand scale!"

"garrvanorden-378-358098","2","11","18","3 August 2017"," Dunkirk, more like Dung-Crap!
","Dunkirk, more like Dung-Crap! I have no idea why this movie received good reviews. Let me start with the good. This movie looked and sounded great in I-Max, and I saw this movie on $5 Tuesday. That's the end of the good. Now to the bad. This movie had no characters. I felt zero emotional connection to anyone in this movie. I didn't care if anyone lived or died or anything. Mark Rylance's (the BFG) character was the only one who was halfway interesting. He was the only character who had a decent amount of dialogue in the film, who had a clear goal, and who made decisions. The other character that had more than 5 lines in the picture was Kenneth Branagh's. He seemed utterly pointless. It seemed like he was watching the movie, and his purpose was just to say a cheesy lines about ""Home"" every once in a while. Tom Hardy's character was boring and repetitive, only to predictably save the day in the end. Because this movie is so messed up, it is really hard to decide who the main character is, but if I had to decide, it'd be the guy we see 1st. He is very forgettable. He looks and acts almost identical to his friend and almost everyone in the whole movie. He meets his friend while he is taking a dump. This is not a joke. So the main character doesn't poop. He stops and helps his new friend bury a body. And the guy doesn't poop the whole movie. And him and his new friend just try to escape the whole movie. That leads me to my second point: there is no plot. It's just a bunch of explosions. There's more plot in a Transformers movie. 'Poop guy' and 'bury dead body guy' just go from ship to ship trying to live. By the way, the movie is almost over before 'bury dead body guy' says anything. So these guys try to live, Kenneth Branagh stands on a dock and says things that don't matter, Mark Rylance picks up survivors in his boat, and Tom Hardy shoots other planes, while in his plane, over and over and over again, while not being seen or heard. And that's your movie. I kept waiting for the opening action sequence to be over. I kept waiting for it to slow down a little and have some exposition, but it never did. It was like I missed the beginning and just tuned into the climax of a long, humorless, silent picture. That's not to say that a movie can't be action packed and be great. U-571 is an example of a nearly non- stop, action packed, WWII movie, thrill ride. U-571 managed to have memorable and distinct characters with different purposes. U-571 had a plot with a clear goal and twists and turns. If Dunkirk could've just cut out some of the unnecessary bits, like Kenneth Branagh, and had the 1st half hour be set up and character development, then it could've been really good. But as it was, I didn't care about any of it. I kept watching English soldiers die and thinking, ""I don't care. This movie didn't make me care."" As simple as the plot for Dunkirk was, the movie was really confusing. You'd think if you're going for an exciting, action thriller, that a simple linear plot would suffice. This movie jumps all over the time-line without giving any hint that it just made a jump in time. Christopher Nolan does a great job of jumping all over the time-line in his movie Memento. In Memento, he manages to keep things coherent and engaging. Not so here. This is just disappointing. The time jumping is completely unnecessary here. What little dialogue there is in this film is really hard to hear because of thick accents, loud explosions, masks over faces, and the music being really loud in the mix. With a really simple plot that is really hard to follow and characters with zero development or even distinguishing traits, I found myself in a really big struggle to care about what I was watching, even with incredible imagery and sound design. Yet, the whole time, the movie was telling me what I was watching was really exciting with it's music score. And that leads me to my last point: I hated the music. It pains me to say that because I usually love Hans Zimmer, especially under the direction of Christopher Nolan. There is virtually no melody in this score. It's relentless and annoying. I guess I can't blame Zimmer, considering he was just scoring to picture. Imagine watching The Dark Knight, but during the entire movie all you heard was The Joker's theme, non-stop. That's what it's like. The whole soundtrack may as well just be an air raid siren. And it's not just the music. The sound effects, as incredible as they were, were also loud, annoying, and relentless. At times, I found myself covering my ears. I thought, ""Why am I paying money to cover my ears? What I'm covering my ears to is what I paid for."" You know what movie is better than this: all the movies I have seen this year. Valerian and The Mummy were even better. They were at least fun. The best movie I've seen this Summer is War for the Planet of the Apes, but you really need to see all the Apes pictures to get the full enjoyment out of that one. The next best is Spider-Man: Homecoming, but maybe you're not up to date with the Marvel movies. In that case, see Wonder Woman. You don't need to see the other DC movies to enjoy that one. But what ever you do, don't see Dunkirk. I beg of you not to give that garbage your support."

It started with a group of British soldiers walking through a town. You never find out what they are doing there. Nothing at all is told of why there are only French and British troops in Dunkirk. <br/><br/>The troops are constantly strafed by the Germans, but only by 1 or 2 fighters at a time. I'm guessing that's all the movie budget could afford. During the real battle, the Germans stopped all attack of the troops. There is no mention of why that happened, nor is it presented adequately in the movie. The movie should have explained why the British were fighting the Germans at that time. Why Hitler let the forces be rescued. Why the Germans stopped the strafing, which by the way was a bit more than one or two Messerschmitt's at a time. There was absolutely no personal connection to any of the characters. The plot was lacking in every possibly way. When such a movie is released, those at the top usually say something like the movie was never meant to be a documentary.

","It's a visual spectacle, of that there is no doubt.<br/><br/>However. I was left feeling empty and disappointed for these reasons:<br/><br/>1 - The lack of all CGI ruined the film for me from the get-go. During the first beach scene's, it strikes you how 70's/80's the beach front buildings and windows are. That's because it is. It looks way more recent than wartime. It's wrong and it looks wrong. <br/><br/>2 - I had no sense of scale. The beaches seemed as empty as the dialogue. There were supposed to be 400,000 soldiers awaiting evacuation and many hundreds, of not several thousands of civilian boats coming across to rescue them. Watching the film felt like there were a few thousand soldiers and maybe 50-100 boats involved.<br/><br/>3 - The whole film is devoid of much dialogue. It meant that you really didn't connect at all with any of the characters - particularly the Hardy character who did little more than look menacing with his eyes in most shots. <br/><br/>4 - I really didn't like the way that the story-telling dotted about, seemingly randomly at times, to tell a short and limited story from differing perspectives, in a totally non-sequential way. It made a mess of the story-telling for me. <br/><br/>5 - Did the Hardy character really do what he does in the film? I think not. <br/><br/>A missed opportunity to have used this visual spectacular really hit home on what really happened, and what it was really like back in 1940 on Dunkirk beach, in the same way that the opening beach-landing scenes of Saving Private Ryan are indelibly etched into my mind as really giving a sense of visual perspective of how epicly awful it was to land on Omaha beach under enemy fire. <br/><br/>The visuals are great. The story-telling is poor. Overall, it's not a film I'll be rushing to see again."

","Dunkirk is a visual treat for art-buffs and students of cinematic discipline. But for everyone else, especially those who love history, the movie is a massive failure due to it's sheer incompetence in capturing the scale and import of the biggest military evacuation in modern history- 3,38,000 allied soldiers saved by over 1000 boats and ships in just a week. <br/><br/>Dunkirk was not just any other battle incident in WWII. It's the story of how a large number of civilian vessels and navy ships safely transport around an enormous number of soldiers back to home. Its about achieving impossibility, doing a miracle, defying all odds only because so huge number of people were to be saved by so many untrained rescuers. Dunkirk is all and only about scale. Take this scale out and it becomes meaningless. Ask yourself - would anyone had given entire incident a second glance if there were 1000 soldiers to be saved and 20 odd boats came from Britain to do the job? No one, including Christopher Nolan himself. <br/><br/>Yet he takes this subject and almost in a blasphemous treatment of its importance, does away with the very scale that made Dunkirk 'Dunkirk'. What you see is an empty beach, a handful of soldier, a few odd boats in water, and two spitfires in sky, trying to play out a theatrical enactment of entire event. And that's what this movie is- just theatrics and technicalities- creating temporal disturbances in story lines to impress the gullible, patching oddball narratives to cover- up for plot weakness, raining down musical scores to hide its lack of substance. <br/><br/>I hope Mr Nolan never makes a movie on memory of Hiroshima attack - because then instead of a giant mushroom cloud that killed over 40,000 souls and decimated a city we will see a mild explosion and a couple of smoked huts."

I agree it is a fine piece of work with some good performances sprinkled throughout but was somehow lacking even there. It was even hard to accept given the visuals that there were enough boats to extract 10000 instead of the actual 300000 that were alluded to.

"nicknutmeg","1","17","31","24 July 2017"," This film is grossly overrated and boring, hence my one star review
","I would typically rate a film like this 4 stars, which is what it deserves, given that it lacks a plot, any sense of coherency and development, while also failing to get beyond the most superficial and basic summary of the story of Dunkrik. I am giving it one star because I am shocked at the high rating it currently enjoys, given its completely lazy script and disjointed direction. I am disappointed by C. Nolan, and I think he should stick to directing and stop writing scripts because they are awful. There is literally no meaningful dialogue in this film. If you like a contentless, dialogue-light, incredibly unintelligent film that has some nice shots of a dive bomber chasing and being chased on the beach in France, then this is for you. The film has such a severe shortage of dramatic content that it shows the same scene three times from different perspectives (the final scenes of the dive bomber chase) without really adding anything to the plot. Knowing a bit about the history of Dunkirk, after watching this film, it is safe to say that it tells the audience one thing about Dunkirk: there were 400,000+ soldiers trapped there by the Germans, and the British Navy rescued them with the help or requisitioned civilian vessels. I have watched an array of WWII films, from Saving Private Ryan, Letters From Iwo Jima, The Thin Red Line, Das Boot, Enemy At the Gates, and countless others. I have never felt the need to write a review for any of these films because I felt that their ratings were accurate reflections of their worth as films. I am writing this review, which is the first I have ever written on IMDb, because I am so outraged at the hype about this film, given that it was utterly vacuous and boring. As even the most generous reviewers have conceded, the film lacks characters, and thus lacks any real plot. Literally nothing seems to happen the entire film except for a few sailors and pilots being rescued--and one really long chase in the sky. There is absolutely no context given of why they were in Dunkrirk and how they were trapped. The entire drama surrounding Dunkirk, not to mention the massive military blunder made by Hitler at this front, was not only absent, but apparently actively ignored in this film. The film made a point of constantly switching from one scene to another and then back to the first (at certain points switching back and forth between four or five scenes that were only loosely connected to one another). Either people are getting more passive and sheep-like, simply following the lead of the critics who are undoubtedly invested in this film's success for reasons other than a genuine love of film, or they are becoming less intelligent, since this film is the definition of trash. I cannot believe that I read someone saying that this was the best film they saw in a decade. However, when the competition is the 6th installment of Spider-man, an overrated and overblown third installment of Planet of the Apes and other like-minded, mind-numbing agit-prop and trash. This entire review does not even get into the issue in the film surrounding its glorification of war, aesthetically, for the most part, but also dramatically (albeit at a very diminished level, given the lack of drama and character or plot development and depth in this film). The very origins of WWI and WWII lie in the callous and blind aestheticization of war, as in the proto-fascist futurist movement which produced poems glorifying war and modern machines of death. The scenes and feel of war are not adequately depicted in this film. It is far too much of a feel good flick to be realistic or even approach the boundary of realism. The entire film lacked the quality of feeling real, despite the director's desperate attempts to make it feel that way. Saving Private Ryan, despite some of its flaws, was far more gory and realistic than this film (I do not think you can make a realistic war film with battle scenes, especially of WWII without the level of violence that would warrant an R rating). In the end of the film, the soldiers go on a train the England and the train's interior looks like it is from the early 2000's or late 1990's at the earliest. It does not look like 1940's England. The film does not capture the audience through ideas or dialogue or history, but rather uses beautiful camera shots and crowd psychology to please and entertain. It lacks any critical attitude toward itself or the idea of representing war and destruction, and moreover, toward that of representing history in general. This film tells you just about what a knowledgeable four year old could say about Dunkirk: allies trapped by Nazis in Dunrkirk, and British RAF and Navy come to the rescue with the help of a few civilians. Really not compelling. How about showing the audience why Dunkirk even was part of the war? Or showing the local French population, or the Nazis who were invading? Or simply explaining the context in more than three lines at the beginning of the film. This script was lazy and amateur."

"Opinion-r-ated","1","4","5","22 November 2019"," This 'film' of the action at Dunkirk did teach me ONE good lesson .
","I purchased this film in Blu-ray for my collection.
Unfortunately, I read the gushing and reverent reviews of many critics and many in the IMDB comments community, BEFORE making my decision to purchase this movie in Blu-ray.
The best lesson I learned that day....ALWAYS read at least as many of the 1-star reviews as you do the 10-star reviews when deciding whether to add a film to your permanent Blu-ray disc library.
The best lesson I re-affirmed that day.....ALWAYS view a movie before you decide to purchase it if at all possible. (Broke my own rule and now I am stuck with a 20 dollar plastic disc that's only real value is that it makes an excellent wedge to keep the table from rocking)<br/><br/>I was extremely disappointed in this film's absolute bungling of what could have been an epic telling of this very real British triumph of courage and resiliency that occurred at Dunkirk.
In the face of a catastrophic Army defeat, the British Navy and civilian merchant and private fleets took to the English Channel in a heroic rescue effort that resulted in the rescue of approximately 330,000 soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk.
INCREDIBLE !!! HEROIC !!!!! INSPIRING !!!!!!!!<br/><br/>So what the XXXX happened with this pile of crapola entitled 'Dunkirk' ???
This film is a sophomoric, disjointed, bland, and uninspiring attempt to tell the story of Dunkirk. At least I think they were attempting to tell the story of Dunkirk.
This film is small in scale and the Battle of Dunkirk was anything but small.
The film was small in emotion. Dunkirk was NOT.
It leaves one to wonder, at what point is the director no longer allowed to say his movie is 'Based upon"" when he diverges so completely from the actual historical reality he is supposedly depicting ??
At least the characters were all still British. The director robbed the characters of their bravery, passion, selflessness, inspiration, patriotism, and camaraderie, but at least they allowed them to keep their nationality.
Such a sad waste of an epic cast and an even more epic historical tale for them to perform for their adoring audience. Alas, the only things NOT epic in this recipe of greatness are the director and writers.
Dunkirk, the movie. AVOID it at all costs.
Dunkirk, the battle of, a heroic and inspiring historical occurrence worth READING about until someone creates a worthy film."

","Dunkirk by writer/director Chris Nolan is the story of how the British at the beginning of World War II were able to snatch a small victory from the jaws of an enormous defeat.<br/><br/>The Germans had deployed their new military tactic, the Blitzkrieg, to run over the low countries, then conquer France in less than three weeks. In doing so, it defeated the combined French and British armies. The remnants of those armies found themselves on the beaches of Dunkirk, with the Germans on one side and the English Channel on the other. While England was less than fifty miles away, there were almost 400,000 troops on the beaches of Dunkirk and evacuating them would not be easy.<br/><br/>Hitler was convinced by Air Marshall Goering that the task of eliminating the troops on the beach was best left to the Luftwaffe and that the ground attack should be halted. After weeks of non-stop attacks, they could use the rest.<br/><br/>At that time, the British had the largest fleet in Europe, but getting the troops off the Dunkirk beaches was a tactical nightmare. Large ships became easy targets for German bombers, especially the terror-evoking dive bomber, the Stuka.<br/><br/>I saw Dunkirk at the Aero theatre in Santa Monica where the attraction was not only the large screen 70 mm presentation of the movie, but an after-movie talk with the writer-director, himself.<br/><br/>Dunkirk concentrates on three characters: a young British soldier's attempts to avoid getting killed (designated in the movie with the title, (The Land), a British pilot's crossing the English Channel in a spitfire (the British fighter plane) to shoot down German planes harassing the rescue attempt (The Air) and a 50-ish Englishman, played by Mark Rylance, who crosses the channel in his own small boat, the Moonstone, to pitch in (yeah, The Sea).<br/><br/>The movie is all about the special effects and the visuals. There is no attempt to give any of the characters, even the main ones, any kind of back story. Yes, we sympathize with them, but they are fighting Nazis so it isn't that hard to guess where your sympathies will land.<br/><br/>Perhaps no incident portrays the lack of any serious storytelling in the movie better than what happens to a teenage boy who makes the trip from England to Dunkirk on The Moonstone to lend a hand. Along the way, the Moonstone picks up a British sailor whose boat was sunk. He acts very strange and insists that the small boat turn around and go back to England since there was nothing that it could do at Dunkirk. Rylance ignores him and later tells his son that the man is obviously 'shell-shocked.' When this sailor tries to physically force Rylance to turn around the boat, he pushes the teenage boy down stairs and the boy hits his head which starts to bleed profusely. As they are caring for this young boy who appears to be in extremis, the boy says that all he ever really wanted is for his name to be in the local newspaper for doing something good. Need I tell you what happens when the boy dies and the Moonstone makes it back to England with a score of rescued soldiers?<br/><br/>And that is how the entire movie moves along, one plodding moment to another. Yes, some of the visuals are very good and so is the sound. You may have noticed that I have not mentioned most of the actors. In fact, in 45 minutes of talking about the making of the movie, neither did Nolan. The actors are irrelevant to his way of making movies. He did go on and on about how he wanted to make a movie to a certain beat or rhythm that would go like a bolero with all crescendos. Yeah, right.<br/><br/>The hook for this movie is that it is 'unlike any other war movie.' Not really. The idea of isolating a few stories in a battlefield of dramas is as old as All's Quiet on the Western Front. Technically, it cannot hold a candle to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. And as for portraying the reality of warfare, Kubrick's The Paths of Glory is far superior.<br/><br/>So, why all the buzz about Dunkirk? It is fairly short for a 'war epic' coming in at 1hr, 46m. And it does have the kind of appeal that video games have. In fact, there were many moments that made me think that Nolan was more inspired by Call of Duty than Battleground. If that is your kind of thing - and Dunkirk's box office of over $500 million is proof that there are a lot of people (my guess, mostly teenage males) who love this kind of mindless visual house of thrills - then go see it. Believe me, it's a hell of a ride, if not much of a movie."
"p-jonsson","4","4","5","1 January 2019"," Quite a disappointment.
","I have put off viewing this film for quite a while. The main reason for this is that I am somewhat reluctant watching a movie where the story is pretty well known before you sit down to watch it. However a few days ago I finally did and, given all the hype, I have to say that I expected more, a lot more.<br/><br/>Sure the movie is a cinematically very well down movie. Acting, camera and all that is excellent. Unfortunately that is all there is.<br/><br/>First of all, where the hell did the over-inflated budget go? Dunkirk was a major undertaking with almost 400 000 soldiers involved and hundreds and hundreds of boats. We get to see what? A few columns of soldiers, a handful of boats and three pitiful spitfires against a bomber and two Fock Wulfes. To add to this insult we pretty much get to see the same bloody event over and over from different angles. This is an insult to all the brave men that made this rescue possible.<br/><br/>There are a few likable people in the movie. Like the Navy commander and the elderly guy on the pleasure boat steaming to rescue. The rest are either psychotic or morons.<br/><br/>Realism? Not so much. Like the scene where a bunch of soldiers are trapped in a boat being shot to pieces. Would any one in their right mind really have thought they could plug dozens and dozens of holes with their hands and then sail across the channel?<br/><br/>Then we have the spitfire which runs out of fuel and glides around forever over the beach so the director can get some scenic shots done. Other times fairly large boats gets damaged and flips over in seconds.<br/><br/>I would also have expected some pre-story. Some build up. But no, the story starts right away with these measly handful of boats and planes taking for bloody ever to drag themselves over to where they are supposed to go.<br/><br/>Quite a disappointment indeed."

","...it isn't Nolan's worst film.<br/><br/>Where to begin? This was an all-star crew of filmmakers - cinematographer, vfx producer, sound designers and mixers, composer, producers, and yet somehow Nolan managed to undermine them all.<br/><br/>I think the intent was to show the human side of the event by giving us, I suppose, three vignettes of individual stories. And at that it (sort of) works. It's at least a good idea for a film, even if it's completely botched by cinematography that spends more time being artistic than serving the story.<br/><br/>Music is a powerful part of cinema and it's very apparent here because the score is literally the only thing that stirred any emotion in me at any point - when it wasn't making my entire body physically hurt. Maybe that was the point? To emulate the stress of actually being in combat? If so it's well executed.<br/><br/>The actors did their very best to make you care about them but they're fighting the script every step of the way. They're given nothing to work with: at no point is a first name revealed, nor are we given any solid reason to care about any of them, no relatable moments; unless I suppose you've had a head injury, been shot or bombed, or swam the English Channel.<br/><br/>The lack of dialog and overabundance of score combined with the lack of plot, almost non-linear narrative, and dependence on pretty cinematography make the whole thing feel more like an art film. Which is nice but if you want to make experimental cinema don't call it Dunkirk and sell it as a war film.<br/><br/>Nolan has in the past given us excellent sound design, brilliant mixing, a good score, great dialog, and cinematography that doesn't get in the way of the story - sometimes more than one at a time. This film fails on almost every point.<br/><br/>It could have been worse though. It could have been Interstellar - a film with its head so far up its own a#! that it's nearly unwatchable even once."

I guess people who are into war film are not unlike the fanboys in the Marvel world. This is an intense film. I'll admit that if I had to depend on it to explain the actual events of the Dunkirk rescue, I would say it was lacking. It's no ""Tora Tora Tora"" or ""The Longest Day"" which depict the breadth of the subject of war. It focuses more on fragile individuals who are more realistic. One reviewer referred to two of the men as cowards, doing whatever they could to stay alive. As if those who were trapped by the Germans wouldn't do whatever they could to stay alive. Yes, there is a bit of tackiness. These are fictional characters. There's lots of heroism to go around. There is cowardice. This is war and war is not desirable.

","I heard many good things about this film, and was looking forward to seeing it - although I had heard mostly things about the technical delivery rather than character, history, etc. From the start this is true, and I might as well get it out and say it - I don't think this film deserves to be as highly rated as it is. However, to say the positives about it; it is impressive in terms of how it is put together - if it is computer generated then I could not see it. Dog fights, huge crowd scenes, explosions, shots inside sinking ships - all of it is immersive and convincing in how it looks and sounds. As almost every scene is one of build-up or delivery, the film manages to have this engaging tenseness which is sustained through a consistent throbbing soundtrack. As a technical package, it is a great piece of construction.<br/><br/>More than that though, it is not. I echo the complaints that there are no characters to speak of - only some recognizable faces that we are therefore meant to connect to. This is understandable in such a big film, but it is not like the film did not include soapy character moments (such as the additional boy on the boat heading out), so it is not like it is above them; but when it tries they don't really work. In terms of engagement, it is just the soundtrack and the tension that did it for me - there is nothing to the heart of it. This doesn't just mean ""tearful death scenes"" but rather the film didn't deliver the scale of the Dunkirk rescue, the tragedy of the losses etc. By keeping it really focused and limited to a few planes and boats, Nolan is able to keep the film tight, but the price paid is that there is not an understanding of how big this was, nor a sense of pride and history by the end.<br/><br/>For what it does well, Dunkirk is worth watching. However it is surprising in how limited a lot of it is in terms of reaching the audience, engaging it with something more than surface, and ultimately moving us with the weight of history; it doesn't really do any of this."

Looking through the reviews on IMDb I seem to have 10 start reviews repeated multiple times, while unfavorable reviews only appear once.<br/><br/>I enjoy real creativity and originality, interesting plots and witty or smart dialogue. I've loved Christopher Nolan's previous movies for these reasons, but they are absent here in Dunkirk. But there are other things to enjoy in true story movies which tell of overcoming things when the odds are stacked against you and triumphing in adversity: in these movies you can hope to get some emotions of pride, admiration, wonder: perhaps even a lump in the throat. But, perhaps deliberately, Nolan avoids these big moments (thinks they are cheesy?). The problem is they are not replaced by anything else to elicit any feelings. This combined with the lack of background and development of characters meant that, for me anyway, the movie was emotionless and therefore pretty dull. Others have likened it to a docudrama on the History channel,but there is really almost no information conveyed about the history, so it wouldn't be a strong contender in that field either.<br/><br/>The only real originality I saw was telling the three stories on different timescales with them all converging at the end, but nothing about this impressed me and it just seemed more of an expedient so that the short (real time) story of the spitfire could be interlaced with the other stories. Others seemed to find this confusing, I didn't really find that a problem I will be very surprised if this movie doesn't become one of the biggest flops of the summer, if not all time: great marketing and spin can only go so far."

It's really unfortunate that movie producers today believe that, in order to get audiences into theaters, they have to focus on special effects and violent horror and, at the same time, can leave an audience to figure out a story on their own. I would bet that at least 90 percent of the audience at the theater I went to to see this stinker had no idea what 'Dunkirk'was really about when they left the theater.

After sitting through 1 hour of commercials and previews, this film disappoints as just another short half baked over-hyped waste of evening.<br/><br/>Not as bad as i describe but should have been more considering subject matter."

","Technically the film is a wonder. Nolan put me in the middle of the experience. The punishment on my ears will need a couple of hours to subside. I've noticed some reviewers writing about the story. In still trying to figure out if there was any. There were plenty of disjointed scenes edited in such a way that it bother me more than the massacres on screen. In the end. I can't remember any other time I felt so lost at the end of a movie.<br/><br/>There were some spectacular moments that makes me appreciate the quality of the special effects and the director's technical prowess. Unfortunately, what we get throughout is an exercise in fragmentation. With barely a thread of a story we can only say we feel as lost as the stranded soldiers hoping something would put us out of our misery as the constant barrage of explosions and foreign continued endlessly.<br/><br/>Sadly, the film could have starred no one special as all the major talent keeps looking a way from the camera or is in the dark, facing down, or covered with oil. There is very little emotion here and we get the idea by default. The Nazis are very bad and guns kill.<br/><br/>I do have to acknowledge the imaginative score by Zimmer, probably one of his beat giving us the promise of much better stuff to come but after the first 10 minutes, I felt as hopeless as the soldiers in Dunkirk. <br/><br/>It is hard to care for anyone when there's so little given as background. Would it have killed Nolan to have ar least one complete character? Posing nobly waiting for the ultimate demise doesn't count. Maybe we will get him back to the heights of his Batman trilogy. Not everyone hits a home run every time.<br/><br/>If you like fireworks you're in for a treat, otherwise prepare yourself for the longest day of your life."
"uprashanthnayak","5","20","38","21 July 2017"," Nolan misses the Slam-Dunk(irk) on this one
","With his newest release 'Dunkirk' , high-profile director Christopher Nolan ensures that I've seen more duds from him rather than successes. In fact, if I hadn't known Nolan directed 'Dunkirk', I'd never have suspected it after the movie , aside from soon forgetting the film anyway. Here's a fabulous example of how to spend a big fortune on a war movie, with all the sound and swooping visuals, and yet ultimately leave the viewer with precious little to hang on to after it's all over. Pic is based on the eventual evacuation of more than 330,000 British and allied troops from France's Dunkerque coast where they were trapped after the Germans pushed them there in 1940 in WWII. The Nazi's bizarre decision not to advance full-throttle on these cornered troops is perhaps not relevant to the movie but Nolan commits other glaring omissions - afraid perhaps of upsetting his current-day German pals, he uses the non-specific word 'enemy' instead of Germans ; more disturbing is the fact that he refuses to show even passing footage of how in real life more than 30,000 French soldiers gallantly assisted British evacuation while themselves having to surrender to the Nazis. Forgetful that he's directing a movie and not a mute show-'n'-read- out picture show, the movie's preamble informs us of the above background in print instead of having characters tell the situation to us with simple dialogue. <br/><br/>Nolan seems to have held his background-score composer to rifle- point and warned him of impending strafing if he ever stops the music - the result is non-stop keening from the foreboding cellos. The relentless background music, even if it is not that loud, ensures that there is barely any moment of reflection, perspective or poise in this hectic collage. I often accuse Indian mainstream film-makers of BGM overkill - Nolan here seems to tell them 'Don't worry, I'm with you'. The lens refuses to dwell on any given situation or character at length ; resultantly very few scenes pack emotional gravitas and I will be genuinely stunned if you remember in later months the sentimental impact of any character from this movie. A character comes to an unfortunate end unrelated to the direct strike of war but the story-teller here is unable to extract wrenching impact from that turn. Emotional force and even poignant throb was indubitably present in Nolan's genius 'Memento' and the monumental 'The Dark Knight' but the same conceptual somersaults hamstrung by an inadequate emotional core which afflicted his 'Inception' and 'Interstellar' are on unfortunate evidence here. Caught up in large-scale logistics again, the director fails to present an adequate supply of absorbing dramatic scenes as if to imply that the bare-bones appeal of elemental theater do no interest him. <br/><br/>But this is a war movie with a lot of action which is more important - some might say. Sure why not, I greatly appreciated the no-hold- barred carnage exploding in 'Saving Private Ryan' but that focus is missing here. The soldiers on the beach and wharf taking a pounding from the overhead planes is initially impressive but soon that is frittered away in shifty scene planning. Point of View shots from the fighter pilot's plane admirably show us how difficult it is to aim at the constantly moving enemy planes in contrast to easy video games, but that vicarious whiz-'n'-danger of those zooming fighter planes is not fully realized, with the editing of those aerial scenes not generating any thrilling continuity either.The ending is quite anti-climactic - I barely cared who lived and who did not. When you spend $150 million on a movie, such things should matter, I think. By UPN/EarnesTaster"

If you also have a good visual director, then you're a hit. <br/><br/>Dark Knight trilogy had only Joker as worth remembering (in 3 films). Interstellar was one of the worst sci-fi movies ever made - seriously people, there was no imagination, no creativity, no depth in it. And Dunkirk - as I expected - is a loooong & seriously boring war movie with endless poses, endless scenes, really boring characters etc.etc...

","I had high expectations when I arrived to the movie theatres to watch the latest film by Christopher Nolan but sadly my expectations fell way short. Nolan failed to capture the grand scale of the historic battle of Dunkirk. The entire movie revolved around a small boat that travels south across the English Channel along with a few other boats. In the air we have 2 to 3 planes engaged in boring, slow-paced dog fights. On the beaches we have a couple of hundred soldiers with no equipment except their guns. Now let's compare that to reality. According to historic records the following equipment was left behind on the beach by the British after evacuation: 700 tanks, 880 field guns, 310 guns of large caliber, some 500 anti-aircraft guns, about 850 anti-tank guns, 11,000 machine guns, 20,000 motorcycles, and 45,000 motor cars and lorries. During the evacuation 243 British ships were sunk and in the air hundreds of planes were involved in dogfights among which some 400 were shot down. The movie didn't come even close to capturing the scale of the battle and has very little dialog. You would think the soldiers were mute! I think Nolan should stick to science fiction movies rather than historic non-fiction."
"vigihawk","4","14","25","23 July 2017"," Dunkirk Disappoints
","Too much confusion due to swift cuts between drowning, crashing, and being blown up. No narrative line just two, three, (or are there five?) smaller tales. If you are expecting any historical value, forget it. Dunkirk may catch the mood of the evacuation with its confusion and frantic pace, but there are no explanations of the action. Oh, Branagh— being stoic and heroic—does try a few words about what's going on. Have to give the actors credit for spending a lot of time being very wet. Aerial sequences are good, but I'm soft about Spitfires. Problem is, airplanes keep appearing when you thought they had crashed a couple of scenes before. Have not yet checked on actual air combat at Dieppe, but willing to bet it was not as much as in the flik. Also featured are two very stupid pilots—you're supposed to open your canopy before crashing or ditching—and a Spitfire with engine-out glide characteristics better than a high performance sailplane. An expensive waste of effort."

There was no real feeling of the pain - just a cut and dried living or dead feel you can only achieve in a 12A.<br/><br/>I liked the tying in together of the seemingly disparate threads of story but the realism was massively missing and made it feel a bit 'Disney does war'.

","I was disappointed on seeing the movie Dunkirk, which was given a 4/5 rating. 1- Too much of the movie is made of very realistic computer generated motion pictures. It appeared to me that all of the airplane dogfight scenes were completely computer generated. There simply is too much computer generated graphics. 2- You need to know the history of this event to be able to make sense of the movie. Very little background info is given. If you do not notice the different types of helmets worn by the soldiers, you will not understand the movie. There is no background history given. 3- The soundtrack is a bit repetitive and when it becomes noticeable, it means that it hast lost its effectiveness. 4- During normal speaking volume, the background music is far too loud and makes it impossible to understand what is being spoken. 5- Last but not least, the audience cannot identify with any person in the story, and thus the movie has very little emotional impact on the audience. It leaves one cold and un-involved and hardly interested in the outcome. <br/><br/>Do not expect a story that pulls you in and grips you with sympathy for any one or more characters. There are just too many scenes of dying soldiers whom the audience has not come to know in any meaningful way. The actors all look very similar, and it is hard to distinguish which one has just died and which one is still living. This movie is a wannabe documentary with little historical context and no emotional appeal."

Horrible depiction of a true piece of history. No characters, no dialogue, hardly understandable English and surprisingly just mediocre cinematography. Remember the part when the soldier walked in the sea presumably committing suicide by drowning? How can someone auto-drown? Why would someone commit suicidal in such way? He had guns, use them and go painlessly. There is no such death as a voluntary drowning! It's the most painful way to go. That and burned by fire. Would someone just walk into the flames? You seen that? Ever? No no no! It's ridiculous. And if you think you can compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan.. You're wrong so wrong. Nolan is not Spielberg not even in his dreams.

It looked like a poor-man's Saving Private Ryan in all honesty.<br/><br/>But what got the audience (and the friend sitting beside me) all riled up was the presence of Christopher Nolan's ""glorious"" name in the sequence.

I've actually been surprised by many movies and I was eagerly waiting for this movie to surprise me. So I waited. I saw some mediocre, unoriginal and non- unique characters get introduced. I waited more. I saw some ships blow up.

I looked to my left and right, only to hear my friends and others praising this movie. Had they not seen what I had? Were they not also bored out of their minds? They unfortunately could not pinpoint exactly what made this movie so unique and amazing. I suspect that maybe, again, it has something to do with the fact that it was made by Christopher Nolan.<br/><br/>It really is unfortunate that movies like this receive so much praise and will most likely win many Oscars, though they do not deserve them.

"petricor","4","17","32","22 July 2017"," The struggle to write a positive review is real.
","It's hard to rate and review a movie like Dunkirk. To start off, I knew what I was going into, and yes, the film lacks character development, plot, and dialogue. I know this. I understand Nolan's reasons behind this. After all, I've seen every one of his movies and most at least once and I admire their direction greatly. So I get Dunkirk is supposed to be an intense survival action movie. You don't really need any of those aforementioned elements in a film but you better hope you have done enough of a good job on the other elements holding a film together. So instead of reviewing what we don't really have because that would be unfair, I'm going to review the things we're still given. Also divided into a triptych, because I, too, can be clever. <br/><br/>""1. The Cinematography: 1 hr 46 min 2. The Sound: 1 hr 46 min 3. The Theme: Last hr (as you are struggling to pay attention)""<br/><br/>The Cinematography : Lacking. The camera darted from frame to frame and scene to scene like it was the one shell-shocked. It's not that it was like one of those action movies with shaky camera where you have no idea who is fighting who and what is going on. It wasn't that bad. What I mean is it lacked gravitas. It stayed on each scene long enough for us to understand what was going on but it all seemed devoid of momentum which was strange given it was a survival film. For example, there are air scenes which are just long enough to see the sky and sea tilt on their sides, with gorgeous shades of blue, and then boop - cut to new scene. There is no gravitas because there's no time for it to happen. All the beauty of those particular scenes and other scenes gone and wasted because nevermind -- they needed to fit more disjointed scenes and give us a feel of ""air, sea, land."" Okay, fair enough, but let me enough the nice cinematography instead of butchering it up. <br/><br/>The Sound : Hans Zimmer is amazing, he basically made Interstellar the bombastic epic sci-fi it was, but the sound in Dunkirk just didn't do it for me. No melody. No distinctness. Boring. I'm not stupid regarding what they tried to achieve here - put a ticking clock in the backdrop and instantly amp up the suspense. It's kind of clichéd and feels cheap. Other people probably think it's a clever use. To me, it's more like film making 101. Boring and kind of insulting. The only thing it did for me was prevent me from going to sleep so at least it served some sort of purpose. <br/><br/>The Theme : I've seen a lot of reviews give Dunkirk flack for lack of character development and a lack of emotions however there are emotions to be experienced in this movie, but I'm not sure if they're anything but grim. The irony of Brexit negotiations going on right now and the rare episodes of emotion in the movie have not been lost on me. Suffice it to say, Dunkirk shows the dark side of human survival. At the end, I didn't really feel like the enemy of the film were the Nazis. The true enemy was people turning on one another. I don't want to give away any spoilers so this is perhaps too cryptic. In a struggle for survival, how do we not lose our humanity? And what if we do? Those are the big questions Dunkirk asks.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while I seemed to have gotten a lot of the intellectual decisions behind the production of Dunkirk, I still cannot applaud its execution. It fell flat. The only semblance of movie magic I am accustomed to from Nolan I got at the end with one of the British RAF airplanes. A rare moment of all three cinematography, sound, and theme combining into something poignant, moving, poetic. But just like that.. it was gone. Marred by the next scene which defied all semblance of events and time and ruined my moment of movie magic.<br/><br/>I am absolutely flabbergasted by Christopher Nolan. I am not sure why everyone's saying this is his best film to date. It pales in comparison to his other movies. It pales in comparison to other war films. Is it because it's the most accessible genre of the movies he has done? The least cerebral? Cue all the typical Oscar nominations and fanfare but Dunkirk can't and won't fool me. Nolan, here's hoping your next movie is not a big gigantic mess like Dunkirk is. <br/><br/>4/10, 1 for each element above and another for that one particular RAF airplane"

","I can honestly state that no other film has truly given me the feeling of actually being on location, which, in the case of Dunkirk, 1940, is not altogether a pleasant experience. But it's a great, great film. I've never seen anything like it. It is also the most un-theatrical film I have seen to date; it actually comes across as a documentary. The acting is admirably restrained, the dialog all but absent, and the cinematography to die for. The casting is inspired. From the crooked teeth of our main tommy, aptly named Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) to Commander Bolton (Branagh, who always looks any part he plays), everyone could be your average Brit in WW2. No gloss, no glitter. Not even elevated rhetorics: Churchill's speech of 4 June '40 is read aloud from a newspaper, with no gusto and interrupted.<br/><br/>Nolan takes the decisive moment of World War II, the evacuation from Dunkirk which was the bleakest hour of the war when it seemed like Germany would win after having subjugated every country in Europe save England. The colossal evacuation, performed primarily by private fishing boats, gave 300,000 men the opportunity to fight again. The subsequent Battle of Britain, one month later, convinced the US about entering the war and aid the allies before fighting in the Pacific, and this was what sealed Hitler's fate.<br/><br/>We may be apt to forget how easily the allies might have lost the war – but Nolan reminds us with a vengeance, especially near the end of film when the survivors return to England as they believe in disgrace. They have done nothing but survive. But their survival turned the tide."

","Christopher Nolan is a wonderful director and all his movies have either been good or amazing so far in his career and Dunkirk is no different. Dunkirk is an amazing theater experience and it should definitely be watched in the theater if possible. The sound was perfection throughout the entire movie, from the minute the movie starts you feel the intensity starts to rise and it doesn't stop for the movies relative short running time for being a Christopher Nolan movie of merely 106 minutes.<br/><br/>The set-up of the story not being told in a lineal way and instead in three different parts that intertwines with each other is a genius move by Nolan. These sort of things is where Nolan can really shine in his story telling abilities. A lot of the main actors have almost zero credits in their filmography but with Nolan's directing they seem to act as naturally as they possibly could. The absolute standout of the movie has to be Tom Hardy's performances, what that man can do with only his eyes is astonishing. For the major part of the movie, almost his entire face except for eyes is covered but he stills achieve some great acting and show emotion through out the movie. His character Farrier is involved in one of the most gorgeous shot i have even seen in a movie, it's so peaceful but still in the middle of the war.<br/><br/>This truly is a war movie and some scenes were horrifying to witness. It might be a war movie but it's just as much a survival movie. The middle part dragged at some places but the beginning and especially the last 30 minutes were truly amazingly done. The chemistry between the father Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and his son Peter (Tom Glynn- Carney) was very well done and their story caught and few bumps on the road but they managed to convey so much emotions with so few words. That goes for the entire movie, not that much speaking with dialogue but instead with what's going on around these characters and with great cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema.

There is virtually no dialog, what there is is nearly incomprehensible. The music - praised to the skies by other reviewers - is not original at all, it is very much like the Jaws score. Intense, 'sposed to make you realize the danger afoot. Loud, relentless. The story of the soldiers being evacuated from Dunkirk beach, and helped by a flotilla of British folks bringing 'round their yachts and other boats, is told from the standpoint of what the soldiers endured before the rescue. One thing they endured was bombing by certain aircraft. These planes had camouflage and big red circles on them; I thought they were Japanese! Very confusing!!

","Dunkirk was a vauge glossary of what happened. In reality 338,226 men were evacuated across the channel in 800 vessels over 8 days. The reason? 7 German divisions had cornered a large British portion of the British army including parts of the French and Belgian Armies. The Germans had haulted where an army of 40,000 French soldiers were positioned to try and hault the advance. The Germans decided to use the Luftwaffe to attack the trapped soldiers.<br/><br/>The Film.
I gave it 2 stars due to it being visually good, however it fails in many other ways.<br/><br/>No character building - I have no idea of any of the characters names.<br/><br/>No back story - It sets the scene with some text at the start?! At no point you see how formidable the German army is, how much danger they are in. You don't see the French desperately trying to hold the line while the British are retreating to the coast. There is nothing explaining how they have ended up in this situation, so all you get is some soldiers hanging around on a beach with no sense of urgency.<br/><br/>Numbers are way to low - You only see at most about 200 men in any shot. There were 380,000! You only see one pleasure boat for most of the film, then suddenly there are about 10 appearing from somewhere but still not the 800 that should have been there.<br/><br/>Random storyline and suicidal characters -
A group of soldiers go into a trawler waiting for the tide to come in. Someone starts target practice on the hull while they're inside. They then try and plug the holes with their hands while more holes appear?! Also at one point it's being shot under the waterline?! Again no character building so didn't care much if they sank.<br/><br/>Weird soundtrack<br/><br/>As it says above, just a horrible droning sound probably to make up for the lack of dialogue. The on board spitfire screens deserved the full engine sound it has a soundtrack of its own, adding to the drama and realness. But no, just more droning from random instruments.<br/><br/>Spitfires -
The pilots looked like they were out on a Sunday afternoon spin, no urgency, no sense of danger. The sceenes of the pilots were showing that it was a quiet comfortable place to be, not a loud vibrating, petrol smelling death machine flying at enormous speeds capible of death defying manoeuvres which required a lot of physical strength to pull off.<br/><br/>The ending -<br/><br/>A sptfire runs out of fuel, then glides. Shoots down a German plane while gliding. In the meantime the soldiers have crossed the channel boarded a train and got to Woking. The spitfire is still gliding!!! Some of these shots look like thunderbirds rediculous.<br/><br/>In short, ignore the hype and don't waste your time."

It turns the real heroics and scale of Dunkirk into an irrelevant close-call for a handful of miserable men.<br/><br/>330,000 men were rescued at Dunkirk, but for some reason this movie shows, at most, 2000. Hundreds if not thousands of civilian boats streamed across the channel to save these men.. but the movie depicts 4 or 5.<br/><br/>Why? It's as if someone forgot to fill the numbers up with CGI.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is such a great premise for a movie - a great escape; heroic soldiers; heroic civilians.. But this film has nothing.. It is factually inaccurate with no redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>Everything has been desaturated, why? Maybe the director thinks it makes the movie look more authentic.. As we all know from TV documentaries, there was very little colour in the 40's. What a ridiculous trope to climb on. A vivid portrayal would bring the reality of the past into the present day.. This is what you want from a historical movie, isn't it????<br/><br/>The desaturation of the colour is mirrored in the characters, story and pacing. The movie is lifeless, dull, overrated rubbish."

","So as you already know i like everything Nolan does, he is by far my best director, but this movie was total bullshi. . In movies that he makes, the most i like are realistic and not biased acts with solid logic , but this movie is all but not this. I guess he was forced to made biased and full of emotions garb...e movie like 90% of world war 2's are.
Watched half of the movie and was forcing myself hoping to get logical but nope. I mean we all know that German pilots kill scores were like triple of allied ones but nooo in this biased movie we have Hardy(who i also hate as actor and is annoying to watch) shooting down German pilots like some bugs. Just google wiki world war 2 flying aces you will see that like first 150 of best ones are German's, and than its 1 Russian guy and after that again all Germans, and in this crap illogical movie we have yea....Really really disappointed by Nolan.."

Second of all the weather was overcast and foggy but the seas were calm . The Germans were unable to see what was going on because of the fog. The British lost approximately 177 aircraft. They also lost eight ships do two actions by submarines motor torpedo boats or German bombers or mines. Most of the people that made it out we're loaded onto larger ships at various docks. Those that could not get into these docks had to anchor out because of the shallowness of the waters in that area and smaller craft ferried the people out to them.

first thing that struck me, tht the british were portrayed as cowards. the first group all get shot in the back as they run away from the enemy w/out firing a shot. all but one who seems not to know how to work his rifle, then throws it away.
the french actualy come out better as they are manning the defenses and are being left behind by the british (did i mention cowards?)
also, i assume it starts day one. if so, why were the germans so damb close to the beach? when he passed the french at the sandbags, he was three blocks from the beach, so the germans were what, 4 blocks? we have 4-7 more days to go here, and the germans are already close.

"olivergadlarsen","6","5","7","6 September 2017"," All the excitement in this movie is not from the war but by accidents
","I just wanted to point out how much this movie isn't really exciting because of what you would think of. Lets count the number of stupid things that happens and I am not sure I remember them all. 1. The brave kid that goes on the civilian boat to help bring back soldiers get accidentally pushed down a few steps of stairs and gets brain damaged where he first gets blind and then dies. He is called a hero in the papers in the end of the movie when he literally did nothing and could had done nothing more than take the space of one soldier. 2. When a pilot lands in the water because he didn't have enough fuel and his gauge broke he can't get out of the plane because the lock to get out of the plane is broken and now he is in the danger of drowning. 3 and 4. Some soldiers are going inside a grounded boat to wait on the tide to take it back out. Next thing the enemy starts shoot practicing on the boat. This of course makes the boat leak and they can't go outside because of the enemy. So when the boat is finally long enough out they go outside except one soldier gets stuck, yes stuck and not because of the other soldiers! So he drowns. What a humiliating way to die in a war. 5. When the other plane run out of fuel the pilot doesn't think of trying to land where the other soldiers are. No he want to land a long way down the beach and when he is close to the ground he pulls the lever to get the landing gear ready, but wait... The landing gear is stuck! Major spoiler: The landing gear goes down just in time, but he of course gets captured because he didn't bother to land in the safe area."
"rlindsay-88363","6","5","7","31 August 2017"," Looks like a war epic on a budget
","OK, a couple of pointers. If you can't stand films with basically no dialogue, give this one a miss. The story is told basically in a documentary style and for the first 10 minutes there is no real dialog. It does look like the story of a wet weekend in Margate where the territorial army was on a drill. This was supposed to be a massive evacuation of men. There were men everywhere. Even although this is shot in very nice wide format, it fails to convey the shear human scale of the evacuation. One of the other intersecting stories is supposed to be the RAF out on patrol giving cover to the troops on the beach. Unfortunately I think there are actually only 3 spitfires still flying in the world. And It looks like they are in this film. So unfortunately it just looks like the might of the RAF was 3 spitfires that were just on patrol. I think the director tries to make us believe that there were more, like a squadron of them, but it just looks like the same 3 planes. So when they are having a dog fight, unfortunately that's all you are thinking 'didn't that plane just get shot down? I'm sure that's the same plane, why is it still flying..' The rest of it is alright, there are some good scenes and then there are some where you are just scratching your head. The 1958 version with old Sir John 'rugged face' Mills and dikkie Attenbourough is much better, and gives a much better account of the scale of the amount of men trapped on the beach. But then again that was shot just after the war and they had plenty of old tanks, boats and aircraft to blow up."
"agmoldham","4","5","7","30 August 2017"," Disappointing
","Finally got to see Dunkirk last night. Having seen the reviews and IMDb score was expecting to see one of the movies of the year. Have to say that I found it hugely disappointing. There is absolutely no doubt that this is a very good film from a technical viewpoint. The cinematography and action cannot be faulted. However, I go to movies to be excited by the journey of the characters. There was very little put into the characterisation of the cast. There is no doubt that actors such as MArk Rylance are excellent, but their talent was totally ignored in this production. If you want to see a movie which knocks you out with the realistic feel of war then this is for you. If you want to see a movie that is full of interesting characters and story then definitely tune into something else."
"Robert_duder","6","5","7","17 August 2017"," Probably well filmed but a messy film to follow and take in
","War films are similar to Westerns, we just don't see many of them anymore. While I do believe Christopher Nolan did some incredible films, I felt like after the Batman franchise his ego overtook talent and now he thinks everything he makes is gold. I thought Dunkirk would just be a solid, potentially moving film about an important battle in World War 2 history. Some reviews seem to indicate that is what some people saw. To me, it was a story with good cinematography, impressive practical effects, a rousing score but empty characters, a non-sensical and pointless chaotic chronological plot and a slow pace. I get that the point is to focus on all the men and the event as a whole and that works but in order to get truly invested as a movie goer, I think you need some character development and hero or heroes that you care about and I couldn't even tell you a single name in the film. The performances are all perfectly fine but the script is non-existent. They are just faces on a battlefield and it's very hard to connect with the incident. Towards the end of the film there is a big moving moment when the civilian boats arrive and there are tears in the eyes of the soldiers and I felt nothing. It was like watching a documentary but even less connecting. <br/><br/>There is a lot of newcomers on the cast, done on purpose by Nolan to get fresh faces, and then a few names. Fionn Whitehead, Damien Bonnard, Aneurin Barnard, Barry Keoghan, Mark Rylance, Tom Glynn-Carney, Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Harry Styles (Yep that Harry Styles) and Jack Lowden are the main cast. Mark Rylance probably gives the best most memorable performance. He might be the only one you really get a back story on or something to actually understand him from. Everyone else gets plenty of screen time and some good scenes of fear and emotion but the lack of dialog and climactic scenes leaves you confused about whose who. I knew Tom Hardy was in the film but barely realized it was him until the end. Kenneth Branagh gives a very small, woefully underused part but has solid emotion to it. Harry Styles does a great job in his role as well. The film teases a few twists to the characters but it's so painfully forced down your throat that finding out otherwise is almost expected. <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has done some of the biggest films of our generation. He also did some of the most brilliant (Inception, Memento) but as he continues to make films he goes bigger and bolder and uses elaborate pontificating tricks to make his films seem so great. The reality to the movie going public of 70mm film or whatever it is being important is pretty low I think. I do really respect him for practical effects because I think CGI and Digital is way overused. The scope of the battlefield and the air fights and the ships on the water are all really well done. The claustrophobic feel of some of the scenes really is good. It's just lacking the connect that draws you into the battle. You won't find yourself invested in any of the characters period. I'm surprised this wasn't a November release for awards season though we will likely see it in the technical awards. 6/10"
"seniorbayir","7","5","7","17 August 2017"," A little overrated
","This is Nolan's first movie on an historical event. It's OK, but overrated by Nolan lovers I guess. There are a couple of serious flaws in the course of events, I was like watching a bunch of men, but in reality, there were 350K men trapped on that beach. We see no German side. Effects and acting seem quite good. There are thrilling scenes of course, but nothing to exaggerate."
"manuel-neves","7","5","7","8 August 2017"," Do not buy the hype
","It is a bad sign if a movie tries to inject suspense with an overwhelming soundtrack. It means a weak script or weak acting performances. A lot of money was clearly spent here but the end result (the emotion level you receive) is only a bit more than average. While the structure of the script / editing is sort of original, the story itself and the characters are so so. It all feels a bit flat and cannot compare to war movie masterpieces such as Saving Private Ryan or Come and See which have seriously dramatic scenes, acting and emotions."
"secretzfan","7","5","7","30 July 2017"," With a lack of character development Nolan manages to make the cinematography the star
","Christopher Nolan is a great filmmaker that is undoubtable to me. He had accomplished many amazing feats and this film is no different than those. However what his past films did have that this one lacks is a really care for the characters involved and what was going on in it. This film is lacking in that aspect and instead the camera angles and the overall feel of the film is what makes you care more than the characters themselves do. <br/><br/>I came out this film feeling a intense claustrophobic feeling throughout. There are many small areas that characters are in and the action feels so intense and it does this without any blood or gore. Instead it is all about the camera movement that makes you want to puke,tense up, and get scared for sheer life. Nolan uses the characters to put you inside the action and make you feel like you are there even if your not. <br/><br/>It is a amazing work of art and powerful as well. Dunkirk truly succeeds in every way of what it tries to accomplish."
"richardchen-85622","10","25","51","22 July 2017"," Visual and sound masterpiece
","For the naysayers on the depth of the story, the whole point of the movie is so that you can have an immersed experience in the battle scenes told from multiple perspectives.<br/><br/>This movie is truly a visual and sound combination masterpiece. In short, it is a masterpiece that brings out the experience. <br/><br/>The movie doesn't contain a lot of the dialogues but shows you scenes of realistic battle experiences which allows the movie-goers to taste the experience of the Dunkirk Evacuation.<br/><br/>Furthermore, because of Nolan's usage of real world objects such as the real Dunkirk beach, real destroyers, real boats, and real planes, the movie is second to none in terms of its graph effects. Nothing like those cheap CGI-generated movies.<br/><br/>In addition, with the combination of sharp sound of planes accentuated by the dark and ominous music composed by Zimmer, this movie is a master piece that shifts one from situation to situation, watching events unfold from multiple perspectives.<br/><br/>In addition, without the dialogue, the movie also doesn't lend itself to propaganda. Nothing like the intertwined love story of the Pearl Harbor. In addition, even though it was told from the British side and even though the cast and the movie producers are all British and Irish, the movie is surprisingly unbiased depicting the competency of both German and British soldiers of the time.<br/><br/>Due to these reasons, I'd strongly recommend anyone to watch the movie."
"stewartj-64471","1","15","28","24 July 2017"," Great Story - Awful Movie
","The Director missed a great opportunity with this movie. There is no effort to set up the context of the movie and why Dunkirk is happening. In 1940 most people knew of Dunkirk, its importance, and what happened there. That is not the case in 2017. I heard several patrons asking the questions; Did this really happen? Where is Dunkirk? There is a lack of dialogue between the actors but lots of explosions and machine gun fire. I felt like I was watching a remake of Vantage Point, seeing the same scenes shot from different angles and purported to be different actions. With only 3 British and 3 German aircraft, one civilian craft with a very few in the background and one mine sweeper - anchored, this was an underwhelming experience. The individual acting was very good, but could not make up for the lack of a good story line or the bad directing."

Cillian Murphy does absolutely nothing and Tom Hardy flies a magic plane with a broken fuel gauge because Hollywood had to figure out some way to make his plane fly forever while all his wingmates flamed out long before. Tom Hardy flies the ONLY plane to make it all the way to Dunkirk and he heroically saves everyone on the beach single handedly in plane that has absolutely no fuel left in it. Kenneth Branaugh paces up and down the pier in immaculate naval uniform dispensing folksy wisdom and showing grave concern while everyone else is getting the **** bombed out of them and strafed. Mark Rylance doesn't do squat either except show you how a timid pleasure boat yachter can still get up the nerve to steer his boat over to Dunkirk to pick up a few of the lads. Yet another in a long string of ""audience favs"" that I just didn't agree with."

"davidgee","9","9","15","30 July 2017"," Retreat for Victory
","Remember the opening scenes in Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN? The Normandy beach landings in June 1944. Explosions on the beach, bullets zipping through the guys in the sea. DUNKIRK offers the same visceral experience of combat, only it lasts for an hour and three quarters. There are a few moments of calm between battles and bombardments, but these are always the preamble to the next grim phase of the conflict.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has directed some weird movies (MEMENTO, INCEPTION, the DARK KNIGHT Batman trilogy). His only 'weirdness' here is to take three separate time frames â€“ a week for the men on the beach, one day for the flotilla of small craft setting out to rescue them and one hour for the Spitfire pilots fighting the German bombers â€“ and meld them into a fairly seamless narrative that condenses the drama into a solid 90 minutes of nerve-shredding tension. The scenes onboard a sinking mine-sweeper are among the most harrowing depictions of the total horror of war I've seen.<br/><br/>There are panoramic CGI shots to show the sheer size of the retreating army (400,000) but the script focuses on one soldier fighting to survive the day (Fionn Whitehead), one fishing boat captain (Mark Rylance) and one RAF pilot (Tom Hardy): these three are used to bring home to us that each of the soldiers and their rescuers had a backstory â€“ a home, a family, a life â€“ that they were laying on the line for their country, their king and their fellow men. A spot-the-celebrity element includes cameo appearances from Harry Styles, Michael Biehl and others whom I failed to identify. Kenneth Branagh and James D'Arcy play naval officers who occasionally veer close to the officers parodied in OH WHAT A LOVEY WAR! â€“ I hope this was intended.<br/><br/>DUNKIRK joins the 'pantheon' of all-time great war movies and will surely win awards next winter. I was misty-eyed through much of it â€“ and not just because my dad was one of the soldiers who went to Belgium and didn't come back (I was two years old). There's a temptation to see the 'strategic retreat' from the French coast in 1940 as an awful defeat, when in fact â€“ as this version makes clear â€“ many of the 300,000-plus men who were brought safely home to England returned to Normandy in 1944 to begin the destruction of Hitler's military machine."

"Dan1863Sickles","4","8","13","5 August 2017"," Smoke On The Water And Fire In The Sky
","This afternoon I went to see DUNKIRK since a dear friend from the UK (and she knows who she is) recommended it the other day. I thought the film really captured the panic, terror, and confusion of battle, but I didn't particularly like any of the characters and I thought the dialogue was very poorly written (and hard to hear.) Some things I thought were just silly, like the way the pilot in the ocean can't open his escape hatch just so the nice man in the boat can rescue him more excitingly! And the way those soldiers all climb into a boat that's just lying on the sand and then just wait until they get shot at and start yelling at each other. Worst of all was the Spitfire that just ran out of gas in mid air, and just went right on gliding along for another half hour! <br/><br/>Beneath the silliness, there was a lot of spineless political correctness. I listened closely, (had to, with such dreadful sound editing and a dreadful soundtrack) but I never once heard the word ""Nazi,"" or the word ""Hitler."" Or Gestapo, or Brownshirt, or Jew. You'd never know the ""enemy"" had done anything to fill the mild-mannered British people with such desperate resolve! Who on earth were the film makers covering up for? And what exactly did they imagine they were celebrating? Shell shock and shaky nerves? Men hitting each other in blind panic? Random explosions and tons of flame? Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky? (Now THAT would have livened up the soundtrack.)<br/><br/>If you watch this movie, you won't learn anything about how the British pulled off a miracle at Dunkirk. Or why Hitler was a menace and his army were criminals. But you will see lots of close ups of Kenneth Branagh and you will have lots of time to contemplate the sublime beauty of his flabby old face looking pained and noble. Thanks chaps! <br/><br/>If you ever want to see a really good movie about this exact moment in British history, you should watch MRS. MINIVER with Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon. It was made in Hollywood but it's such a loving tribute to the British people, their kindness and gentleness and sense of humor as well as their strength and patriotism. It's a million times better than Dunkirk!"
"desertfox1942-178-876030","5","8","13","3 August 2017"," Awful. A lost opportunity.
","A disappointment and lost opportunity for a good filmmaker.<br/><br/>The disappointment began from the first couple of minutes. Leaflets falling from the sky ""We surrounded you"" with a perimeter around the city of Dunkirk and right after the group of soldiers being shot at which means the Germans were already in the city and close enough to the beach to literally throw the BEF in the sea, as we soon found out when the one survivor passed the french barricade.<br/><br/>After that you merely had beautiful scenes. No plot, barely any dialogues, just beautiful scenes. You might as well work as a photographer if it comes to nice images only.<br/><br/>The soldiers standing like ghosts on the beach doing nothing. Not even simple things like smoking or eating. Look at any wartime photographs and you'll see how fake this film is.<br/><br/>No scenes showing the British retreating and being saved. You only see boats at the end of the film rescuing them while in reality it was a whole operation that lasted for days with a lot of action happening, but no let's just give it a surrealistic, poetic approach like Terence Mallick did with the Thin Red Line since it is one of the favourite films of Nolan. Pathetic.<br/><br/>Also, timelines. Why the timelines??? Nolan is obviously obsessed with them. They worked in INterstellar and Inception and I loved that. But leave them out of Dunkirk! And what's with the bad sound mixing? First there was Interstellar and now Dunkirk where you could barely understand what is being said because the music is louder than the actors!"
"Molongirl","9","8","13","1 August 2017"," Exhausting
","I found myself with fists clutched holding my breath and by the end of the film totally exhausted, that's what a great job Nolan has done of immersing the viewer in the experience of Dunkirk. Partly this has been achieved by the music which was so stress inducing, having an almost ""nails scraped down a board"" effect.<br/><br/>I was telling some elderly residents of a care centre today about the movie and one Scottish lady told us her father had died at Dunkirk and one of his friends carried his body all the way back home to Scotland. That spirit of courage is captured so well in this telling of the tale. The captain of the small boat who wouldn't turn back, the Spitfire pilot who kept on fighting knowing he was running out of fuel and the soldiers who queued, just waiting and waiting.<br/><br/>The opposite side is also presented and I'm sure we all fear we may be the one willing to push someone out of the boat to save our own skins. I enjoyed the way Nolan looks at so many different aspects of this incredible story. <br/><br/>My one wish is that the film would have cut away to the wonderful sight of people streaming in to churches across the nation in response to King George's request for a national day of prayer. Google ""National time of prayer at the time of Dunkirk 1940"" and have a read about this aspect that is missing from the movie. But well done everyone involved in this excellent movie."

","This was not my favorite Christopher Nolan film (that honor goes to Interstellar), but it was a solid movie nonetheless. The movie has a very tense and raw feel to it that made my adrenaline rush throughout. The dialogue is far and few between and there are 3 plots that are intertwined â€“ the land, the sea, and the air. The most entertaining to me was the air. At the end of the movie, I felt the underlying theme that Nolan was portraying was that of ""sacrifice,"" and how heroism (and cowardice) can come out even in the best of us in times of struggle and hopelessness. Hans Zimmer produced a wonderful score we have become accustomed to. He utilized the ""shepherd's tone"" perfectly to build up the gravity of each scene when appropriate. Christopher Nolan once again shows his versatility and ambition in taking on a challenging genre and does an excellent job of formulating a cinematic experience to his own style and pace."
"eagandersongil","9","8","13","31 July 2017"," The agonizing war of Nolan
","Agonizing, claustrophobic, oppressive, sweeping and sonorous, these are the verbs we can use to compose Nolan's new film, which this time stands out by the technique and not by the script, ""dunkirk"" is a film that invites the viewer to Sit in the armchair and sodomy in the best sense of the word, because you suffer, drown and fight along with the characters, ""dunkirk"" is a survival film, barely have hand-to-hand or shots, or even dialogues, That we have here is the purest survival instinct alienated to a setting and a wonderful sound mixing and editing. We have a script that is characterized by three nuclei that unite around a goal, rescue and assist the French and English soldiers trapped in Dunkirk beach, the script contains few dialogues and little character construction, and leaves the viewer more distracted completely Lost, but those who pay attention will be amazed by the almost orchestral narrative that Nolan builds. The script tells the story of the rescue of the British and French soldiers following three points, by the sea, where tells the story of a civilian who provides his boat to help rescue, in an area, where tells the story of three pilots responsible To give air protection to the soldiers trapped on the beach, and by land, where it shows the anguish of the young soldiers struggling to survive. ""Dunkirk"" does not soften, and makes the viewer feel the horror of war in its strongest fullness, we have no moral lesson or a message to convey, we have only horror and despair. RarÃ­ssimas times a film stands out for its mix and sound editing, but Dunkirk is a film that shouts ""ME WATCH IN A CINEMA, AND OF PREFERENCE, IN THE IMAX"" because its sound quality is something inexplicable, extremely terrifying, of jumping in the chair And bite your nails, to bend down along with the soldiers and hold your breath to keep from drowning, aligned to that we have a dizzying trail, we have a trail that draws attention and is always present, and a more fleeting that dictates the rhythm of Film, we have a ""TIC, TIC, ICT, TIC"" all the time, that sound, it is our heartbeats, that tightens and loosens according to the tension of the scene, this is wonderful and a great intelligence, To this sound and he dictates not only the film as our anguish, it was a play of master the introduction of this simple element that can go unnoticed by many, we also have to mention the great assembly of the film, which alienates the three nuclei perfectly The bluish photograph that shows us an extremely tropical and beautiful climate, as opposed to the terror shown on the scene, and last, but not least, the art direction, which performs its role with mastery, showing all the details, clothes , Accessories, boats, airplanes, is beautiful to see. Nolan has a giant budget for his films, and could bring practically the actors he wanted, since it was the money, he still has a name, but no, we have not one actor in the movie to put on the giant poster, our biggest name here is Mark Rylance, winner of an Oscar for best supporting actor, and of course, Fionn Whitehead, better known by his band than as an actor, nonetheless, all the actors are well in the movie and they fulfill their parents, and that goes yet another idea of As the war was made by anonymous in the midst of the multitude. Nolan is one of the most talked about names in the industry in the last few years, some love him, others hate him, I particularly think he's overrated, but I like all his movies, especially ""Dunkirk"". Even complex time, makes quality films that arrive and are recognized by the great public, so if the only options are to love or hate it, I get to love, but with reservations. ""Dunkirk"" is an interesting film that is sure to take a lot of editing and sound mixing and maybe a few more technical Oscars, but it's not going to happen, it's still a great movie that's worth the ticket."

","Dunkirk is an experience not to be missed. State of the art cinematography sees a welcome exchange for enthralling camera work, soundtracks and composure over bloody combat, resulting in a quintessential portrayal of the Dunkirk evacuation. <br/><br/>The plot, despite being gripping, is not the films strongest point. The films intention is to provide an accurate and stunning representation of the Dunkirk evacuation which the film was ever so successful at. Prepare to be taken back by tense aerial battles over millions of kilometers of vast, unforgiving ocean and experience the hopes of 400,000 soldiers rise and fall as each ship comes and goes, taking the lucky and leaving the rest to wait in fear. Unrivaled visual effects pose the relentless German forces as a greater threat then ever as you cling to your seat every time an enemy aircraft swoops in dropping fatal bombs and unceasing machine gun fire. Enemy threat will always be in the back the of your mind, allowing the film to be a never ending climax, providing every scene with captivating tension. <br/><br/>Be sure to watch this masterpiece in a cinema to experience the intended impacts of Dunkirk's splendid audio and visual effects which are best enjoyed by surround sound and large screens rather than on your laptop screen while sitting on the couch. <br/><br/>The film is complemented by terrific acting across the entire set with Harry Styles commendable acting debut adding a special kind of novelty to the film. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend Dunkirk to any and all history buffs, anyone seeking accurate depiction of the Dunkirk evacuation or anyone who appreciates quality cinematography and an altogether brilliant movie experience."

","The war should have been over in 1940 due to this massive error by the allies culminating in Dunkirk -- but the German High Command (Hitler) was told by those who pull the strings on war, to let them escape, which subsequently occurred without a whole lot of drama. As such, can't really depict the ""brave"" allies fighting the ruthless Germans, can we? Nope, nor can we make this movie very dramatic. Although some small groups of Nazis may have caused a few skirmishes in Dunkirk (out of confusion that such a ludicrous order would be given to let the Allies escape), it was nothing even remotely close to what they faced on the D-day beaches years later. In fact, there was more drama among the Germans (Panzer divisions, particularly) who were seriously contemplating disobeying orders from High Command and moving in to decimate and then capture Allied troops.<br/><br/>All war is a racket (phony) -- General Smedley Butler. And the Dunkirk debacle is one of the best instances of any major war that the top leaders on both sides are always in the pockets of those who control the purse strings and stand to make the most money from tragedy. But here we have the Hollywood spin masters flipping the script and telling us otherwise. Pure propaganda."

This movie depicts cowards and Biggles like air adventures. To Nolan I say - ""If you want to make a Biggles cartoon/sensitive new age pretty boy movie be inventive don't steal the true story of Dunkirk 1940"". The true Dunkirk event is not depicted instead replaced with a simplistic immature nonsense fantasy.<br/><br/>As another reviewer wrote if the Allied soldiers had acted as cowardly and undisciplined as the soldiers depicted in this movie the war would be lost forever. Thankfully for the free world the men that were at Dunkirk acted in the tough professional manner they were accustomed to not like the sulky brooding cowards depicted in this movie. If you know the real history of Dunkirk 1940 you will leave the theater furious with what Nolan has done to the memory of those that served and the professional British Servicemen. The men in the British Expeditionary Force that were evacuated from Dunkirk were experienced, highly trained career soldiers.

"menboy","4","6","9","5 August 2017"," Overhype reviews
","A few boats, a few planes, soldiers in peril and that summarizes this movie. There is no character development. There is no comparison to the great movies like The Longest Day, Saving Private Ryan or Patton and I just can't understand the high reviews and a score of 8.5 of this movie."
"zkonedog","7","6","9","28 July 2017"," Something Different From Nolan: A New Kind Of War Film
","Until this point, film director and all-around mastermind Christopher Nolan has made epic character films. Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar...that were all epic in terms of character arc or story. Heck, Nolan even created the grittiest, true-to-real life Batman the world has seen to this point.<br/><br/>With ""Dunkirk"", however, Nolan really goes back to his film roots: that of a cinematographer. He's no stranger to widely professing that the love of film, camera, and shot construction are what appeal to him most about film-making. While he usually has at least a hand in his films' screenplays, it is generally assumed that brother Jonathan (now of ""Westworld"" fame) does most of the heavy lifting in that department. Flying solo (w/o Jonathan) on ""Dunkirk"", it is clear that Christopher means for this new film to almost completely be told in a visual fashion. Whether that style appeals to you will determine your overall enjoyment of the experience.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Dunkirk"" tells the story of the famous 1940 WW2 scenario in which thousands of Allied soldiers are trapped on the beach at Dunkirk waiting for evacuation. The film tells this story of survival via three different lenses and time frames: <br/><br/>-The Mole (land): Two young soldiers, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) & Gibson (Aneurin Barnard), meet up on the Dunkirk beach and make an unspoken pact to find a way to escape onto one of the rescue boats. In their efforts, they run up against a number of obstacles, along the way picking up another friend, Alex (Harry Styles), in which to abscond with.<br/><br/>Paralleling the escape attempts of the young soldiers are a number of conversations between military officers Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) and Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy), effectively framing how mammoth of an evacuation effort will be needed to not still be trapped like sitting ducks when the enemy arrives.<br/><br/>-The Sea: Boats from the British mainland (just 30 miles or so from Dunkirk) are being commandeered to help with the rescue effort, but Mr. Dawson (Mary Rylance) sets out with no military presence on his boat. Joining him are son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and the son's friend George (Barry Keoghan). Along the way, the yacht picks up a shell-shocked soldier (played by Cillian Murphy), who's express consent is to never return to Dunkirk again.<br/><br/>-The Air: Patrolling the skies above the entire operation are Spitfighter pilots Farrier (Tom Hardy) & Collins (Jack Lowden), who must manage their fuel reserves, navigation techniques, and firepower to provide as much help as possible to ground/sea troops.<br/><br/>In stark contrast to Nolan's previous efforts, ""Dunkirk"" is not a character piece, nor is it reliant whatsoever on narrative twists or epiphanies. Instead, ""Dunkirk"" is almost purely visual. Long stretches go by with almost no dialogue at all, and no backstory is given on any characters besides what is being viewed on-screen in the moment.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" is also a very interesting sort of war movie in that it has almost no distinguishable ""message"" to it. It takes the event of the Dunkirk evacuation (one which must resonate deeply with Nolan, an Englishman himself) and portrays it via a visual medium. This is the furthest thing from a propaganda war picture. and also contains none of the overt violence of, say, ""Saving Private Ryan"". One almost has to re-train oneself to watch/appreciate a war movie like this one, since most of war cinema is more blustery and chest-pounding.<br/><br/>For me, then, the 7-star rating comes because I so enjoy character-driven films (or ones that feature intriguing narratives) that this one set me aback a bit. I wasn't expecting this approach. Perhaps it will grow on me as I learn to appreciate the subtleties to Nolan's craft, but for now I'll peg it at a ""solid 7"".<br/><br/>That being said, there is no doubt that ""Dunkirk"" is an excellent film for what Christopher Nolan set out to accomplish with it. It features perhaps the best cinematography one will ever see on the big screen, and it is never ""boring"", in the sense that something interest is always happening on-screen (even despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of dialogue or character-building).<br/><br/>While ""Dunkirk"" certainly will fall short when compared to Nolan's other more epic, sprawling masterpieces, it never was meant to be looked at in that way in the first place. This is Nolan taking a bit of a step back (at least in terms of writing) to expertly direct/craft a passion project. Viewed from that perspective, there is still much to enjoy and appreciate. I would highly recommend (almost command!) one to see this film in the IMAX format, as the video and sound are such important components of the overall experience."

Most importantly, the essence of the story is just plain and simple. Everything is just predictable and the action scenes are just average at best. I kind of felt very sleepy from the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>The only thing that make people give this a high rating is because they are all hypnotized by the sound effect.

","The movie obviously wanted to impress audience with how dangerous the situation was. But it tried to do it by twisting the historical facts. You see destroyers after destroyers bombed to sink without firing a single anti-aircraft round. They must have all been manned by blind and deaf soldiers. We all know destroyers were designed to have two major tasks: anti submarine and anti aircraft for the fleet, protecting the aircraft carriers. In real life it would have put up a hell of anti aircraft lead against the approaching German bombers. They may have been sunk, but not without a hectic fight. <br/><br/>For audience that have no knowledge on WWI topics, this is really impressive on how brave our ancestors had fought in how dangerous situations.

","Written, Co-Produced and Directed by Christopher Nolan. 'Dunkirk' is a magnificent technical achievement, that is a feast for the eyes. Nolan, a master in his craft, sadly fails as a Writer, delivering a War Epic that's ambitious & huge in scale, but also soulless. Its definitely a well-made film, but not in the level of how a Nolan motion-picture generally is.<br/><br/>'Dunkirk' Synopsis: Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.<br/><br/>'Dunkirk' puts 3 different time-lines together & jumbles them into a king-sized narrative. The film begins with a flourishing impact, showing us how the soldiers are in constant havoc. What follows is how survival is at stake & how the carnage of war can damage those who go at the battlefield to protect their nation. Nolan handsomely mounts a visually staggering war epic, that doesn't have a single frame that lacks ambition or genuine skill. The war depicted here in 'Dunkirk' is intense & hardcore, that's sure to leave you disturbed.<br/><br/>BUT, 'Dunkirk' lacks a cohesive Screenplay. Nolan's Screenplay is packed with intensity, but is too busy to make us feel for its heroic characters. Seen from three perspectives, 'Dunkirk' has too many characters, but not for one, do you feel for. And that's indeed disappointing, considering this is a film about War Heroes. Nolan crowds the film with three perspectives, but forgets too give its characters depth. And that's certainly unacceptable from a guy like Nolan. Nolan made Superhero films that were more about the heroes without the capes, and delivered an affecting family-drama while indulging in the Sci-Fi zone last time, but in 'Dunkirk' there is not a single character that you'll remember or even, feel for, despite their heroic courage. Nolan's Writing is a letdown & comes up as a minus.<br/><br/>Nolan's Direction is marvelous. He's a master at his craft & the atmosphere he sets in here, is simply terrific. How I wish his Writing was as strong as his Direction. Hans Zimmer's Score is magnificent & turns 'Dunkirk' into a heart-pounding experience. Hoyte van Hoytema's Cinematography is astounding. The lens-man has filmed each & every frame, with flawlessness. Lee Smith's Editing is razor-crisp. Art & Costume Design are fantastic. The Choerography of the War-Sequences, are tremendous. As mentioned earlier, 'Dunkirk' is a remarkable technical achievement.<br/><br/>Talking of performances, its only Tom Hardy as Farrier, a Royal Air Force pilot & the Legendary Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton, the pier-master during the evacuation, who stand out. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Dunkirk' is certainly a well-made film with plus points, but the lack of depth in its characters, are hard to ignore. Its a crushing disappointment."

In reality, it is still debated why Hitler called off the advance and inevitable destruction of the British Expeditionary Force and French and Belgium troops at Dunkirk, some even suggesting that he wanted to end the war on the western front before America and Russia entered the fight.

"tedcomer","5","2","2","1 February 2020"," Disappointing
","I was excited for this movie, as it was Christopher Nolan, but I was very let down because of its inaccuracies. Christopher Nolan has a strong reluctance to use CGI and that was a big part in this mediocre movie. First they filmed on location, and that is quite good after a lot of good movies (eg.Gettysburg) were filmed on location. But they filmed in a town that has been completely rebuilt since ww2. Where is that burning houses, the screaming civilians? Second, at the start of the movie, one of the characters says that there are 400,000 good men on the beach. That is true in real life but in the film... where are they? All we see is a few hundred people lined up. There should be people running around, it should be filled to the brim. Christopher Nolan should of used cgi on this, instead of pretending that was 400,000 people. Third, I love the fact that they used real spitfires. The dogfights and the ships sinking using only practical effects is amazing. But in the film we only see 3 spitfires go to Dunkirk. They didn't just send 3. In reality 3400 planes went to support the soldiers, but many of them did get caught in dogfights but the fact that the film says that send only 3 is absurd and took me right out of the story. Overall this film has amazing practical effects and amazing use of visuals, but the historical inaccuracies is what disappoints me. If you want to see a more accurate representation of this amazing event, go watch atonement."

"Apalerwuss","7","2","2","13 February 2018"," Good movie, but wasted opportunity
","I had high hopes for this movie, but was ultimately left a little disappointed. <br/><br/>Everyone knows the Dunkirk story, and how the steely determination of a nation helped rescue hundreds of thousands of stranded soldiers from the beaches of France. As Churchill noted, it was a miraculous escape, but wars aren't won with evacuations. <br/><br/>Anyhow, the movie was well acted, and well-enough made, but it felt as though they didn't really convey the true scale of the evacuation. Some 800 boats were used to transfer more than 300,000 soldiers from France to the U.K., so surely the English Channel should've been filled with boats. The movie just seemed to focus on a few boats, and a few soldiers, and it didn't do a particularly great job of illustrating the true scale of the evacuation. It was almost as though they were trying to save money by not having to recreate the scene.<br/><br/>One thing I did like though was that there didn't seem to be a ""star"" of the movie. There were many well-known faces, including Kenneth Branagh, Cilian Murphy, Harry Styles (who was actually not bad) and others. But they all had relatively small parts, and clearly weren't brought in to ""Hollywood-ize"" the movie, which was a good thing. It wanted to focus on the story rather than the famous names playing the roles. <br/><br/>Ultimately though, the story was a little disjointed, and it could've been told much better. I can't quite fathom why this has an 8+ rating on IMDB, it's more of a 6.8 IMHO."

","Terrible effects, over 300,000 evacuated but no use of CGI and there was typically around 200 just milling around, almost 1,000 civilian boats took part but the film decided to depict about 20 of them. There were modern building around the beach, the Spitfire effect at the end was just laughable, characters were terrible, didn't tell a story, no scenes really mattered, etc.<br/><br/>Most of all, one of the biggest logistical missions of the war with countless brave civilians stepping up and doing their duty for king and country (and significant loss of life) and we get a terrible action (!?) flick with no real acknowledgement for the heroes. I also believe Christopher Nolan said he didn't want to include Churchill in it as it would make it political. Genius."

"Rob_Taylor","6","2","2","8 December 2017"," Underdone-kirk
","Dunkirk is a movie that will not be for all tastes. Certainly I found it a bit of a slog at times and, having grown up with a diet of almost constant war movies, I found it lacking in a number of departments.<br/><br/>Firstly, though, what Dunkirk gets right. The visuals are well-done and the acting very decent from all concerned. There is no fault that you can point at in regards to cinematography or on-screen realism. Everything has been carefully shot to enhance the feeling of being there, at Dunkirk, during the evacuation.<br/><br/>Sadly, however, that is where the film's greatest strengths lie... in its mechanical execution of the film-maker's craft.<br/><br/>So what did I find wrong with this movie? Well, it has little in the way of heart and soul. For a film about one of the most memorable moments in World War 2, this lack of emotional core leaves you rather nonplussed. I have seen any number of docu-dramas of wartime events that had more life in them than Nolan's effort.<br/><br/>It was so marked, that I suspect that is what Nolan was aiming for all along. Namely, he removed the emotion from the movie in the hope that the events would carry more weight with the viewer.<br/><br/>If that was the case, then at least for me, he failed. For the most part, Dunkirk plods along with at first a rather boring and slow tempo, and then with a more urgent, but somehow equally dull, pace. At no time did I feel any kind of excitement or concern for any of the characters.<br/><br/>In part this is because there is almost zero character development. There is also little dialogue which leaves the viewer scrabbling for visual clues as to the characters motives and goals. You don't ever end up rooting for any of the people you see on screen. If they live, or die, it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>That, then, is Dunkirk's biggest failing. It has no soul. A moment in history where ordinary people stood up and ""did their part"" for the war effort is reduced to a dull, emotionless study of the event itself. For all the humanity on display, it might as well have been made by an alien with no understanding of our species.<br/><br/>In addition to this soul-less aspect, the scale of the movie is also rather limited. Perhaps this was due to budgetary constraints, but you never see more than a couple of aircraft at once. There is no artillery shelling of the beaches. Although there is some strafing of the beach, it is only by one plane at a time. You rarely see many of the little ships and, at the end, when one of the survivors reads a paper that reveals over 300,000 have been evacuated, you are left thinking ""How?"" At no point do you get the feeling this was possible given what you see on screen.<br/><br/>All in all, a rather disappointing movie that lacks any real emotional connection for the viewer to latch on to. Considering how loudly, and greatly, this movie has been praised, I expected more from it than it delivered.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Emotionless and rather dull. No character development, little dialogue and little real sense of danger. Nolan should stick to sci-fi."
"John von K","5","2","2","8 December 2017"," Oh dear...Rather disappointed.. it's a bit of a mess.
","This could have been a Disney live action film of the 60's it's that inoffensive. No blood or maiming, no cigarettes and no moustaches!! Narrative and editing a right old mess and to be quite honest I didn't give a damn about any of the characters really. Even the much touted air combat sequences are not too gripping. Deflection shooting is skated over to avoid silly us getting confused. Elgar's Nimrod is slower than Bernsteins version...so slow that is simply turgid and almost unrecognisable. 5/10"
"Sophoclaw","4","2","2","7 December 2017"," It could've been better.
","I saw «Dunkirk» last night. I must say I was expecting something else, something more complete, something more complex, so actually I was disappointed. I was expecting to get to know more about Dunkirk like why it happened, the background, how come the French, Belgian and British armies got surrounded in that peculiar way and why the German army did not finished them off, after all, they only had to drive their tanks some miles forward and bomb them to pieces. Why did this not happen? What was the strategy that left the escaping armies completely defenseless to a powerful enemy? Were the Germans just being kind? I doubt it. Who in the end was responsible for this situation? They could've easily wiped out over 300000 troops. As anyone can see there are a lot of unanswered questions, and this film doesn't help, on the contrary. If the RAF was so infinitely superior to the Luftwaffe, how come the British were surrounded and trapped between enemy tanks and the sea? The film is short in answers and therefore I cannot put it in the category of Great War films. It falls merely as entertainment with shock effects. There are already a lot of critics that have mentioned the lack of character development, the problems with real-time following, and the sudden clipping from one scene to another without relation, so I will not stretch this anymore. But there is another thing that bothers me a bit and that is the lack of knowledge about the enemy. In most Great War films we get to know the enemy so we can be related to whom our film heroes are dealing with. Well in this film the enemy is practically anonymous. The Germans are completely non-existing! This film makes it very obvious the superiority of the great English Spitfire above the likes of the German Junkers-Stuka and Messerschmitt planes which makes it even more demanding to know more about why the British were defeated and pushed to escape in Dunkirk, this film does not make it easy in answers because Nolan insists to see things only from his own navel. This film could've been much better without breaking the budget too much with skipping repetitive scenes and making the enemy more visible. It seems that consequently the director of this film is avoiding getting to know the enemy. This mistake cuts the potential excitement that this film could've possessed. ""Stalag 17"", ""The Great Escape"" ""The Longest Day"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""A Bridge Too Far"", ""Schindler's List"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" all great war films precisely because we get to know the enemy and therefore increase the complexity and interest in the scope of the film. Unfortunately ""Dunkirk"" is not one of these."

Whenever Christopher Nolan & Hans Zimmer comes together they make sure to make some intense background which is engaging & at the same time its thrilling.Be it Dark Knight or Intersteller. The film shows technically a defeat but this film doesn't include any heroism of a single character also.

"Theo Robertson","10","19","39","24 July 2017"," Made Me Proud To Be British
","Christopher Nolan ? Someone is rather over-hyped in my opinion. He's a director who often reverts to gimmicks in order to sell a movie. Woul MOMENTO have worked in a completely linear structure ? Would INCEPTION have worked without the groundbreaking special effects . Would THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy have worked without the ready made audience for a BATMAN reboot ? To be fair at least with a Nolan movie the film sells itself and with DUNKIRK there's always the problem that a film like this is going flop big time due to the fact that it involves a military defeat of sorts which is box office poison along with the fact that British stiff upper lips don't translate very well to an international audience. In other words I didn't have exceptional hopes for DUNKIRK but even I have to admit this film really delivers and it's all down to the director <br/><br/>If you've seen the trailers you know you're going to be watching cinematic spectacle and that's what you're getting . What the trailers don't convey is the oppressive and hypnotic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer which will grab you from the first scene. It's intrusive for sure and crushing but adds to the tension. Make no mistake this is a masterwork in tension . The fractured storyline concerns itself with three distinct sections . One involves the dilemma of the aptly named British soldier Tommy , one involves a RAF fighter patrol over the channel and the final storyline involves a civilian boating expedition to the Dunkirk beaches . These story lines are developed and edited superbly . One storyline is structured so ends on a cliffhanger cut to another storyline ending to a cliffhanger then cut to the dilemma being resolved but is really a case of out of the frying pan in to the fire<br/><br/>What also makes DUNKIRK noticeable and sets it apart from other recent war films is the lack of star power . Yeah okay we've got familiar faces like Hardy , Rylance , Murphy and Brannagh but it's the unknowns and up and coming actors like Whitehead , Barnard and Lowdon who carry the film and helps you buy in to the real life situations these characters are experiencing. It's refreshing that we don't get to see a name actor like Pitt or Cruise turn up to save the day complete with colonial accent . Despite the heart stopping tension and carnage constantly grinding the audience down there's also a distinct lack of gore and ""war porn"" which is also refreshing <br/><br/>One biting criticism the film seems guilty of is that it's somewhat cold and aloof with a lack of backstory to the characters lack development. I can understand these points but as I said this film is all about heart pounding tension. One also concludes that there's expressionistic elements in that the characters are shocked by what looks like nihilistic inevitable defeat and this is conveyed to the audience Imagine if Spielberg had directed it where sentimental clichés are to the fore , some soldier pulling out a photograph of his pregnant wife saying how much he loves her and the audience knowing there and then he's not going to make it the end credits. Here however you're thrown in to the cockpit of Collin's Spitfire , of Mr Dawson's small boat or being stuck in a sinking ship with Tommy <br/><br/>If there's one thing I regret after seeing this film it's that I didn't watch it in a proper IMAX cinema. I was left gasping at some of the scenes thinking ""How could this scene be possibly be better ?"" but a couple of days later after I've calmed down I do think not watching it on a proper IMAX screen has been a major mistake and I hope anyone reading this doesn't make the same mistake because DUNKIRK mixes spectacle with distressing personal dilemmas. Some people class the real life evacuation of Dunkirk as a defeat for the allies while other like myself class it as a ""Victory grabbed from the jaws of defeat"". Regardless of this opinion DUNKIRK is a victory of filmmaking . Filmmaking that made me bloody proud to be British"
"pascal-charpentier81","7","10","18","27 July 2017"," Even professional critics have been blinded
","We all know how good Christopher Nolan is, but this time he failed. How critics can overlook this is beyond me because it is not subjective. Objectively the film is missing essential tools of storytelling that are established for hundreds of years. Everyone who actually learned script writing would tell you the same.<br/><br/>The movie is lacking two major things: 1. characters 2. conflict <br/><br/>1. The movie has NO characters. I don't mean thin ones I mean NO characters. We never even get names of the main protagonists. We get no backstory, no mannerisms, nothing. Another review said the film concentrates on the ""event"" Dunkirk rather than characters and on other filmmaking techniques. Even if that is the case and a conscious choice by Nolan you can't do that and expect people to be invested in your movie. It is like saying ""a film needed no story, visuals where more important"". You can't just ignore essential elements like story or characters.<br/><br/>2. The movie has no conflict. And I don't mean conflict as in allies against Germany which by the way is also not really there because you never really get to see the enemy in form of a person. I mean conflict in dialog. There is almost no dialog in the movie therefore no conflicting views that make interesting dialog which is mind boggling since Nolan is usually very good in exact that field.<br/><br/>Since there are no characters in the movie just faces you never get invested. Nolan has been criticized in the past for his films being cold. This is the coldest one. That being said I am sure next time he will deliver again but I guarantee that in 10 years this is the movie from Nolan nobody will remember, because there is just nothing memorable in it. Even if you are that gifted you can't just ignore basic storytelling foundations."
"adrian-43767","8","13","25","20 July 2017"," Credible WWII Movie Inevitably Laced with Computer Effects
","Good WWII movie, admitting early on that historical accuracy is not its intention, and told in Quentin Tarantino fashion, flashing back and forward between incidents involving army, navy and air forces trying to flee Dunkirk (France), or help others make their way back to the UK.<br/><br/>According to Commander Bolton (played by Branagh), 400,000 men were on beaches of Dunkirk awaiting removal, and supposedly only about 10% of those men would get out of France - or so were Winston Churchill's calculations because the overriding priority was to use all resources to protect UK territory. <br/><br/>Direction is sound, photography competent (though computer effects are obvious), and acting is in such small patches by so many people that no one really stands out, with the possible exceptions of Mark Rylance, who embodies the famous courage of common British people as he takes his small yacht to Dunkirk and rescues British forces stranded at sea along the way; and Tom Hardy, who gets the plum part of the Spitfire pilot shooting the hell out of Messerschmidts and Heynckels.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to see a movie about Brits played by Brits, no Americans about, which is historically accurate as the USA pursued its isolationist policy at the time. <br/><br/>It is also credible that, at the beginning of the movie, the Brits should want their countrymen to travel first out of France and leave the French to their fate. It is not so credible that, by the end of the movie, Commander Bolton should say that he wants to stay behind to help the French get out, nor do I imagine the Admiralty agreeing to such a senior officer staying potentially within grasp of the enemy just to help the ""frogs."" It is an unfortunately overly sentimental touch that - in my humble opinion - smacks of Brexit apology.<br/><br/>In fact, what happened was that Churchill ordered the destruction of the French Navy's fleet, then the world's largest, so it would not fall into German hands and be used against Great Britain -- and many of the French ships were sunk with French servicemen inside. So much for helping the ""frogs""...<br/><br/>Perhaps that is why Nolan is not interested in historical accuracy about the events at Dunkirk.<br/><br/>All told, it is a film well worth watching that pays deserved homage to the British people's courage, intelligence, resourcefulness, firmness of purpose, and capacity to find the silver lining in the direst of situations."

","Remember that scene where the boat sank? Or the other boat sank? Or the the one? Or the other one? Thank God, a director who uses practical effects! Too bad I didn't know any of the characters on the boats, nor was Nolan's ADHD plagued camera able to focus on a scene long enough for me to concentrate or care before another quick cutaway. <br/><br/>Also Kenneth Branagh staring at the sky with a horrified look upon his face. Powerful stuff the first time. Not so powerful the second time. Okay, why is he doing it a third time? A fourth time? Now this is getting comical. <br/><br/>I demand subtitles on all future Nolan movies. I could probably understand 20% of the dialogue, if that. <br/><br/>I'm pretty sure they're using Hans Zimmerman's score on the next season of 24. Maybe that'll save the show, or at least fool you again into thinking you're watching something epic and suspenseful. <br/><br/>I miss the guy who directed Memento, the Prestige, Batman Begins and the Dark Knight. Nolan's last movies may appeal to you die-hard fans, but his best work is in the past. <br/><br/>Before you dismiss me, ask yourself honestly if, when this movie is released on DVD, you're going to prefer watching this to the aforementioned Nolan films."

Even if there were a story, it was impossible to hear because the audio effects were so loud as to render 75 percent or more of the dialog incomprehensible.<br/><br/>Sure, war is hell. And it's loud. What war movie since the days of ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" hasn't made the same point? And Christopher Nolan spent how much to reiterate that message?<br/><br/>The first aerial combat scenes of ""Dunkirk"" were beautifully photographed, but practically every subsequent scene was a replay of the first. Sure, Spitfires, BF-109s and Heinkels are hard to come by, but, seriously, the aerial sequences struggled to rise above the campy, repetitive air work of the late 1970s series ""Black Sheep Squadron."" <br/><br/>The only saving grace of ""Dunkirk"" is that it was mercifully short at 106 minutes. <br/><br/>It doesn't even come close to challenging ""Saving Private Ryan"" for bragging rights as the best war movie of all time."
"Laakbaar","9","9","16","30 July 2017"," Don't miss this one
","So far, over 80% of the people who have rated this movie have given it and 8, 9 or 10. Deservedly so. This is an excellent movie that successfully shows first hand and close up what Dunkirk must have been like for those on the ground, in the air and on the sea.<br/><br/>I don't want to gush too much about it, but the realism and cinematographic artistry are superb. This is a story of survival, after all, but it is a story that is so well told that it feels like time travel. I've seen so many movies about the 2nd WW during my life that I tend to avoid them now. But this one is different. It worked for me from beginning to end. <br/><br/>I'm glad I saw this movie in an IMAX theatre with a great sound system because it really enhanced the experience. The sounds were visceral, more so than in any movie I've ever been in. So this is what it feels like to have a bullet crack near your head. Or to be strafed. Or to be be in an aeriel dogfight. Or to drown. (Some of the negative reviewers found this too loud, too realistic perhaps. So be warned.)<br/><br/>Nolan has somehow captured the strange mix of selflessness and selfishness, cowardice and heroism, depersonalisation and intensive personal narrative that the military and war can bring out. Some reviewers have commented that there wasn't enough character development, but to me that lack of personalisation reflects what being in the military and a huge operation like this feels like.<br/><br/>I felt the desperation and hopelessness. The sense of being trapped. The terror of being shot at. I was moved by the ending. Some reviewers are saying the film lacked emotion, but I didn't feel that. My friend says he wasn't moved at all though. Did these negative critics want more emotion from the soldiers? Screaming? Weeping? I don't think that would have been realistic.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't too bloody at all, although I don't think I've ever felt more strongly the waste of war. It's too easy in these war movies to demonise the enemy and emphasise the bloodiness -- but Nolan did none of that. He didn't show the enemy or the carnage at all really. What he did show was the desperation and fear.<br/><br/>This movie had a few minor issues, but I'll see it a second time before reporting on them in more detail. Right now, I'll just mention a few:<br/><br/> Nolan didn't use CGI. I was surprised that there weren't more on the beach. Is this really what hundreds of thousands of men look like? I'm not sure this movie depicts accurately what it was like for so many to be trapped on that beach. Is this what 700 civilian boats look like? Why were there only a handful of aircraft in the air? Maybe CGI would have worked better here. <br/><br/> I sometimes had a hard time telling who was who. <br/><br/> I would have liked to have walked away from this moving knowing why Dunkirk occurred. <br/><br/> What happened to the 100,000 or so who were taken prisoner? <br/><br/>This movie puts action fans in the same theatre as old fogeys. That alone is a major accomplishment. You have to hand it to Nolan. He almost casually and unnecessarily turned from his usual fare to focus on an historical war drama. The result is a compelling, excellent movie. Imagine if all these superhero directors did this.<br/><br/>It is interesting that the world continues to make and watch movies about this war, even though the greatest generation has all but died out. This is a war we will never forget, even as those who lived it are no longer around to describe it to us. From now on, every generation will tell this story in its own way."
"treynolds57","5","9","16","27 July 2017"," Good, Not Great
","My wife and I went to see the current Dunkirk film as an IMAX presentation this past weekend. I went hoping to see a great film and left somewhat disappointed. What could've been a great film, turned out to be only a good film. As has been mentioned by some there is precious little if any character development and I mean very little. Kenneth Branagh has a very small part as a British naval commander overseeing the Navy's part in the evacuation from the beaches at Dunkirk. The score if I could be called that, it's not so much musical as much as pulsating noise very much like Jaws. The story arc is comprised of three different viewpoints of the evacuation: air sea and land. While this is somewhat compelling on the surface, without some details and character development it ends up being spread far too thin. Some things that were confusing or inaccurate: there is a curious back and forth between day and night scenes, but my take was that all three stories (land, sea and air) were supposedly happening simultaneously? That and those few British warships shown don't actually seem to fight. They do a good job of getting bombed and are shown sinking, but not fighting. Come on... I realize that there are few tangible assets (planes and ships) remaining from the WWII era, but surely British destroyers weren't sitting ducks for Stukas? One WANTS to like this film. The history is real and the reality of evacuation of an entire army compelling, but for us, it just didn't work. There is nothing from Churchill, no Admiralty meetings: the details are simply inferred. I'd love to be more upbeat about it, but can't. Sorry..."
"awih-90185","2","12","23","24 July 2017"," Mediocre Is The Best Word
","This movie was stunning, stunning in its disappointment. It totally fails to describe what Dunkirk was all about. It completely missed the scope of the operation. Long boring scenes that were senseless. Minutes upon end of air battles between 3 British and 3 German planes. A long stupid scene aboard a beached fishing boat. A RAF pilot who managed to shoot down a German plane after he had run out of gas (unbelievable nonsense). A few hundred men strung in rows upon the beach, a couple of boats in the water, a few broken down trucks. In fact, this operation involved hundreds of thousands of men, and thousands of boats of every shape and size imaginable , and hundreds of planes, tanks, and trucks. There was almost nothing of the what the Officers in command were faced with, or the agonizing decisions they had to make, having too little of everything they needed. Just some lonely Navy Commander staring wistfully out to sea repeatedly.Where were all the Germans? Yes Germans. Were they all whitewashed out for PC reasons ? Who then was doing all the shooting at the guys trapped on the beaches. Unforgivable BS. There was almost nothing to show the scale of the operation to send the hundreds and hundreds of small private boats that set out from every port on the south coast of England. If I were a young person who knew nothing about Dunkirk, I would have left the cinema none the wiser. Frankly, that is a tragedy, a $150 million tragedy. The sound track was awful, the noise made it difficult to hear anything that was actually said, although that was not much. I was not deaf when I entered the cinema, but I was when I came out. An absolute waste of time IMHO. The producers should be ashamed of themselves."
"danielharden","9","8","14","1 August 2017"," Pure Cinema
","Christopher Nolan is without a doubt one of the greats, a modern day auteur, and the filmmaker behind some of cinemas most highly anticipated indie films. The man has managed to find the sweet spot between blockbuster and art film, gaining the praise of critics and casual viewers alike. The man has become an event in himself, everyone knows when a Christopher Nolan film is coming and they flock to the cinema because of his name. I love Christopher Nolan's films, he has yet to make a bad film, despite The Dark Knight Rises being disappointing on reflection. Although not stepping many feet wrong his entire career, I don't view Nolan and his work as many others do, that being as the work of an untouchable God. I try to walk in without expectation or, without having already decided the film is a perfect 10/10, as it seems quite a few people don't do. However, I really wanted to enjoy Dunkirk for my own sake, God forbid I actually didn't like it, I would swiftly be told why exactly I am wrong in even suggesting Nolan could step a foot wrong Thank God I actually really enjoyed the film, phew. Dunkirk recounts the true story of the evacuation of British soldiers from Dunkirk in 1940. The film is high octane, action packed and suspenseful and again Nolan proves why he's a human cinematic event.<br/><br/>This film is obviously a Nolan film, there are some star talent in the film, but they are there because they want to work with Nolan, not the other way round. The film is, for the most part, wordless, this isn't really a film for actors to shine, it's for Nolan to show the world how the real thing can be, and is often, better than CGI. With the film being wonderfully wordless, Nolan shows he knows exactly what film is and always should be, the visual art of storytelling. He has obviously taken note from such greats as Hitchcock, using sound and dialogue to further aid the visual, not to overpower it. In today's film landscape this is quite rare, and so you have to give Nolan credit and respect for making a film the way they should, but rarely are, made. This is film after all, not radio. Also to note, Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography in this film is absolutely breathtaking, Dunkirk would be little without his work and he is in need of some serious recognition. <br/><br/>Dunkirk isn't a conventional war film, we don't get character development in the form of ""who you got back home son?"" campfire talks, nor do we get multiple battles throughout the run time. Dunkirk doesn't have a dull moment whatsoever. It is a battle from beginning to end, and so with this, Nolan does not allow us, the audience to rest easy. Nolan doesn't hold off on the tension at all. I personally loved moments where Nolan momentarily lulls us into a false sense of security, only to then provide a sudden jump scare in the form of gunfire, reminding us that you are never safe in the middle of war. Now this is how you use sound as a jump scare correctly. This film is high octane, tense and extremely gripping from start to end.<br/><br/>Also this being a Nolan film, he has to make things more complex, he can't just tell a war movie with a chronological narrative structure. Dunkirk follows the same story, from three different perspectives and three different time frames. For audience members, like myself, who understand Nolan's knack for complex storytelling, this will be confusing for a moment whilst you recall previous information to make everything make sense again, and then you will love what Nolan has done. However, audiences who expect to see a war film, which by our conventional understanding is often self explanatory, will forget that previous information and thus remain confused throughout the rest of the movie. I've seen negative reviews say that Dunkirk gives no indication of time, and to an extent they are right, but then again all I can say is watch it again, but this time take note of the opening title cards which read ""one week"", ""one day"" and ""one hour"" it should clear things up, but I do think maybe the title cards could be a little clearer.<br/><br/>To conclude, Dunkirk is Nolan's Full Metal Jacket. I wouldn't say this is his greatest masterpiece, I reserve that for Memento. But Dunkirk is an outstanding piece of cinema that proves Nolan's auteurship and that he is one of the greatest filmmakers alive, if not, who ever lived. The man knows film and knows how to make a great, complex one. Hell the guy has a knack for impressing the experts, having actual scientists make discoveries through Interstellar, and now by a soldier who was at Dunkirk, praising Nolan for his accurate representation of the event. Now if that doesn't say it all then I don't know what will."
"justin-fencsak","9","8","14","31 July 2017"," A movie that's worthy of a great war movie.
","After Interstellar came out to mixed reaction by the public, it was time for Nolan to direct a movie based on a real life rescue operation during World War II. The movie, called Dunkirk, is about that famous rescue of englishmen from the beaches of that town in France and the liberties it took for them to survive the ordeal. If you see this in the theater, be prepared to wear some earplugs if you're hard of hearing cause this film's sound mix is loud. Not only that, but the sheer aspect of this movie combined with the action scenes might give you seizures!!! There's hardly any acting in this movie just mostly lots of action scenes involving planes, ships, and ground attacks. The music is intense, and the visual effects are practical compared with CGI. If you see one war movie this year, then make it Dunkirk."
"alexpaintercanada","4","8","14","31 July 2017"," A story that fails to go anywhere; An extremely disappointing missed opportunity.
","Dunkirk is over-saturated with close-ups on actors, unnecessary filler, plagued by a pointless plot that goes absolutely nowhere, and leaves the audience wondering what in the world they had just watched. The French were merely alluded to, and the Germans barely made appearance. <br/><br/>At least, one could say that there was an attempt at making a different kind of war film. Opposed to showing the grit and highlighting the horrors of war, Dunkirk tried to be a war-drama - It did not work. A slow, impotent script, plus a boring, uncompelling cast of characters leaves me no choice but to poorly rate a film that should have been a masterpiece.<br/><br/>If I told you that the first twenty minutes of a movie follows two men running around carrying a stretcher, would you want to go see it? I would pray your response would be no. Suspense is a beautiful thing while being done correctly, but if by an hour into a movie the viewer is still wondering: ""When is something going to happen?"", there is well beyond too much suspense. <br/><br/>There was a lot of history to grasp from, including the inner turmoil that Dunkirk stirred among the Nazis. There was Churchill's famous speech, the French, whom helped a hell of a lot more than what the movie showed. This movie seemed little more than patriotic, as if the British are pining for more praise. <br/><br/>What seemed like a highlight reel of pretty camera shots, actor head- shots, and fancy editing tricks, missed the mark entirely. A war movie should make it's audience sad, maybe even a little angry. All Dunkirk did or me was made me feel immensely disappointed. This movie is not worth your money, and frankly, is unmemorable. Just watch Black Hawk Down or Hacksaw Ridge if you want to watch a decent war film. You'll get way more out of those two films. <br/><br/>Cheers."

","Dunkirk is about 400.000 soldiers that needs to evacuate from Dunkirk. We follow the civilians, the soldiers on the beach and a pilot played by Tom Hardy. The story telling of Dunkirk is told in such a unique way. I am not going to spoil it because you really should see it for yourself.<br/><br/>The movie looks absolutely fantastic beautiful cinematography and gorgeous camera work. But the movie wouldn't without the cracking score compost by Hans Zimmer, after you leave the movie the score will still be playing in you're head. Christopher Nolan's direction is so amazing, you can see that he has 100% control over his craft.<br/><br/>Everything about Dunkirk is amazing and you have to see it for yourself.

","Went to see DUNKIRK a few days ago. It's taken me that long to put my reaction to it into words. Fair warning; probably this whole review has some level of spoiler in the wording so consider this your spoiler alert.<br/><br/>Firstly, let me point out that I eagerly awaited this movie. Unfortunately, my thoughts at the end were, ""Well, it's a typical British movie."" In that, several subplots just started in the middle and ended in the middle. Case in point, no explanation given to how the school chum of the boat owner's kid got into the act of being at the dock to jump on board or why.<br/><br/>For that matter, there really wasn't much character development from start to finish which left the whole movie seeming to be pretty shallow and meaningless.<br/><br/>And, the whole Air:1 hour, Sea:1 day, Land:1 week thing just fell flat. There was no explanation of that whole flow at the beginning or throughout so the audience was just left to figure it out – or not. And, there really wasn't much credible attempt to tie them all together by the end of the movie. there were several occasions where the same event was suddenly and seemingly out of sequence relived from a different character's perspective. This left the audience thinking ""Wait! I'm confused. Didn't that guy already die/that ship already sink/that airplane already go down?"" So the audience had to figure out the ""reliving"" thing all on their own which risked the audience not connecting the events correctly.<br/><br/>That whole ""last Spitfire"" thing was an abomination to the point of being insulting to anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of aircraft, aerodynamics, physics, etc. Firstly, I thought the damned thing was gonna glide so long after running out of fuel that the pilot was going to need an ""expect further clearance"" time. And to think that an aircraft that's ran out of gas could be capable of superior aerial combat over an enemy aircraft is just downright absurd. The burning Spitfire thing at the end - to prevent it from falling into enemy hands - was fine and factual except that the obvious lack of an engine in the fire and instead a big broomstick was holding up the propeller was a joke.<br/><br/>Overall, this whole flick just seemed incredibly shallow. Like an attempt to be artsy that just fell flat.<br/><br/>About the only benefit to me seeing this movie was the new perspective to the Dunkirk evacuation that the troops evacuated may have left the beach more than once (as different ships were sunk out from under them) before finally reaching England."

","I'm a huge WWII buff, and really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't bring myself to. <br/><br/>The cinematics in the areal scenes were great, and the sounds of the Stuka dive-bombers seemed pretty on point. That said, everything beyond that was disjointed, or dumbed down from the reality. <br/><br/>This felt like a Disney does Dunkirk; very disjointed, and nerfed violent scenes. <br/><br/>There were probably only ~8 aircraft, maybe 40 boats, very limited ground vehicles, and at most 200 troops in the movie. If you've ever seen photos of the real retreat, they left just about everything on shore. <br/><br/>Bottom line, it's just not that great a film."

","I'm currently re-reading Hugh Sebag-Montefiore's ""Dunkirk"" (which is a fantastic book by the way and highly recommended for anyone who wishes to have a micro- or macroscopic view on the topic) and based on that source the movie is not always historically accurate. On top of that there are some events that seem too fantastic just based on common sense. This was my first impression.<br/><br/>Having now seen the movie twice, I forgot and forgave the inaccuracies, went with the flow, and I think the movie is a masterpiece. It is a collage of events from the viewpoint of individuals who in fact lose all traits of individuality when facing the monstrous war. The movie looks beautiful, the soundtrack is revolutionary and the way the different moments in time are sequenced is ingenious and impressionistic. Chapeau!"

","There are, I think by design, no standout stars in this movie. The star is the event. The only detraction and it is a minor one for me. Is that it took me a little while at my age to catch on that there were multiple parallel time lines. Once I realized that, it was much nicer for me to follow. I usually don't like IMAX all that much, the sound is usually over powering and I usually wind up too close to the screen. However, this time the theater resisted cranking up the sound and the photography was stupendous in IMAX. This easily matched the intensity of Saving Private Ryan but it lasted much longer. Go see it!"

","Well, I believe that Nolan should have done better. This movie is very noisy, emotionally flat, historically not so good.<br/><br/>As a standard these days it uses beautiful effects and stunning imagery, but the story is lost in the very loud gunfire and explosion and engines roars and other loud sounds. My opinion is that Director Nolan has used the sound to remind us of war.<br/><br/>It was for me personally a battle to sit and watch this movie."

","don't get me wrong, this is a good movie and well worth the visit to the cinema.

Oscar clean up? - laugh out loud. Im a detail person, so to be worthy of an Oscar Id have to say continuity of the basics must be right. If you look at the boat crossing, whilst the wind is blowing in the right direction for the journey -the sea condition and weather are lacking consistency in each scene. they go from very choppy disturbed seas to almost flat calm. The beach shots are more of the same. crikey in some shots the tide is in, others its not. I could go on and on with goofs and inconsistencies throughout the movie but wont - you expect these things in a many average films - but please... if this is an Oscar nomination then standards have dropped"
"ennoeoj","7","11","21","21 July 2017"," Great theatrical experience
","The film is separated in three sub-stories.<br/><br/>One follows a soldier on the beach of Dunkirk. This plot had much more potential than what has been done with, but also remains within a dull and realistic scope.<br/><br/>One follows a man with his common boat going at the rescue in Dunkirk. This plot was okay but that's all.<br/><br/>One follows a pilot flying with his comrade, clearing enemies the best they can in direction of Dunkirk. This plot was exceptionally amazing and moving. I was very touched by it.<br/><br/>There are three major negatives in my opinion: ----<br/><br/>Firstly, one of the attractive premise of the film was its acclaimed realism about war. And yet with a PG rating, the film stray quite away from the crudeness of warfare. The most blood to be seen is on gauze and bandage of the wounded. No physical obliteration, flying limbs nor anything in graphic nature of actual war.<br/><br/>Possibly, Nolan wanted to make the horror of war accessible to the popular audience, where war movies may not be that attractive in the first place, by using of his reputation. The film is mostly about the psychological perspective of living such event.<br/><br/>In short, a strawberry shortcake without strawberry. ----<br/><br/>Secondly, the ambiance brought with the aid of Hans Zimmer score is not without fault. At some point, around 3/4th of the movie, I found myself distracted by this music. The dramatically-epic sounds fill the film throughout, reducing their emotional impact and at time, as aforementioned, feel downright pretentious.<br/><br/>In short, no need to force drama upon the act of taking a load with epic music. ---- <br/><br/>Finally, throughout the movie, only a handful of German planes can be seen and some out of focus German soldiers at the very end. That's pretty much all there is about the axis in this film, which is a shame.<br/><br/>In short, the good versus the bad bias. Not addressing the enemy perspective and showing the allied in a general triumphant light.<br/><br/>The film is in a way contradictory in the sense that it is highly claustrophobic, focusing on characters that in turn have little development. There are few scenes of large and extended perspective, with the exception of the aerial sub-plot. A very large shot, encompassing the whole beach, showing the 400000 soldiers would have been epic.<br/><br/>Concluding, this is a somewhat great movie. More historic values than its ''censored'' realism despite tremendous practical effects."
"mvrk","1","31","72","20 July 2017"," Nolan just trying to beat Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Unsuccessful.
","This movie is just a bunch of vignettes joined loosely together by the fact that they all involve the Dunkirk evacuation. Just a bunch of small stories intertwined together and no real ending except that all the soldiers were evacuated somehow and the Nazi Empire remained an empire for the next five years!?!? I mean why make a Dunkirk fiasco movie in the first place? At least in Saving Private Ryan they show the allies winning in the end. Dunkirk is just the stupid invasion of Dunkirk in which the British didn't have any plan whatsoever on how to win the war. So they send the troops to the beach and then realize ""hey we got no plan on what to do next and darn all our troops are about to be killed!"" So they mount a form of evacuation in which the British civilians use their boats to help in the evacuation. Awww.....so sweet. <br/><br/>Don't be fooled. Nolan is just wanting to be a greater director than Spielberg by making his own WWII movie. And it fails. I mean why choose the Dunkirk evacuation as a source material in the first place especially when there are so many other interesting battles and facts about WWII? Dunkirk just shows the British stupidity in WWII and exposes the fact that Nolan is a hack. Nolanites, now burst with anger!"
"dermobreen","9","13","26","22 July 2017"," Almost cinematic perfection
","First off, it's great to be able to write a review and not be afraid of spoilers. Unless you have never opened a history book in your life, most will know how the story ends. The tag-line for Dunkirk is ""the event that shaped our world"". I'd like to think of it as ""the film that changed cinema - again!"" Too bold a claim? Read on.<br/><br/>My first introduction to Christopher Nolan's work was 2000's Memento which also introduced Guy Pearce to the big screen as he leapt from Ramsey Street in Neighbours (playing Mike Young for four years) to Hollywood. Memento is a film that had an instant impact on me. At the time I was not sure what I had just seen and it is a film I return to at least once a year and find something fresh in it.<br/><br/>The Noughties say Nolan immersed in the DC world with Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. 2010 saw Nolan revisiting his fascination with time and our perception of time in Inception. It played with our perceptions of reality, time, asking what is it to dream, what is it to be awake and are we a dream within a dream, borrowing an idea from Edgar Allen Poe.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2017 and we arrive at Dunkirk. Before I discuss the plot or the performance, let's talk technical. Nolan filmed Dunkirk in IMAX with an aspect ratio of 1:1 and that is how one should view this film if possible. Not all of us can access an IMAX theatre. I saw it projected in 1.666:1 in my local multiplex so I feel I lost some of the visual, visceral aspects that the director intended. Getting an IMAX camera into the cockpit of a Submarine Spitfire could not have been an easy feat! Despite the technical wizardry on display, Nolan manages to tell a series of personal stories using vignettes.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a sombre film. This is no celebration of life. Nolan tells the story of the evacuation of 400,000 service men from the beaches of Dunkirk, France in WWII by pleasure craft from the south coast of the UK. We get the perspective of the Spitfire pilot, the service men on the ground, the Admiral in charge of the investigation. Yet amongst all of these personal stories there is tragedy. We see the desperation of the men trying to get home and sneaking onto ships. We see the despair of a serviceman take off his helmet and rifle and walking into the sea while his comrades sit and watch, each as helpless as the other.<br/><br/>It is a huge credit to Nolan that while he paints this enormous palette of images, he can focus tightly on the smallest aspect of humanity.<br/><br/>Nolan also revisits his favourite topic of time. Dunkirk, while being told through vignettes, splits up the story-telling into one hour, one day and one week. He then proceeds to rearrange the sequence of events into a non-linear act of story-telling. This has huge echoes of Memento and Inception and at this stage is almost a trademark of Nolan's. Personally, I think the style will divide audiences who prefer linear story-telling. However Nolan firmly believes that audiences are smart enough to figure it out on their own. They don't need reams of exposition to understand what is happening. I respect Nolan for that. To be honest I was almost half-way through the film before I noted the time-leaps he was making, back and forth. It is a style that allows him to tell the same story from multiple perspectives. I love it!<br/><br/>Nolan has assembled a stellar cast including Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy, relative new-comer Fionn Whitehead, not to mention One Direction's Harry Styles as Alex.  Most characters only get first names and some get none. Cillian Murphy is ""the Shivering Soldier"" - it doesn't get more stripped-back than that. All performances are excellent. Character development is pretty much non- existent. It is not needed as motivation is obvious.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the soundtrack, provided by Hans Zimmer. He has provided the soundtrack for a good many Nolan films with Dunkirk their latest collaboration. Zimmer's syncopated style provides a stunning addition to Nolan's story-telling. There is not a note out of place. This is what soundtracks should be. Is Dunkirk the greatest film of the 21st century, probably not but Hans Zimmer's score certainly is. A masterpiece.<br/><br/>I was left wanting more and wanting to see it again in IMAX. My recommendation is to go see it on the biggest, loudest screen you can find. Size matters. So too does the sound system.<br/><br/>For me, it's a 4.5 out of 5 - almost perfection."

So thrilling, so visceral.<br/><br/>I was crying, cheering, proud, anxious, relieved: the whole gamut of emotions. I needed oxygen.<br/><br/>The splendid soundtrack was almost Metallica on speed with a syncopy similar to a heart rate beating faster and faster. My pulse was off the stratosphere.<br/><br/>I did feel a bit nauseous at the hand-held camera jogging along with the guys running across the beach, and although I dare say it is a clever technique and quite deliberate, some of the out-of-focus shots of background forces personnel were annoying. <br/><br/>Harry Styles cuts a convincing figure as a young soldier although Fionn Whitehead (pronounced: 'Finn', apparently) steals the show with his serious expression and the guy in the boat in the red jumper, Peter, 'the Captain's son', played by Tom Glynn- Carney, is just so polite, handsome and British, I wanted to hug him - I have a crush! - and his dad, a stubborn irascible Welshman is brilliant with his quiet deadpan determination.<br/><br/>It's amazing to discover that this is a 'first movie' for Fionn Whitehead and Tom Glynn-Carney, as well as Harry Styles. What great casting. Fionn comes across as a young glowering Tom Courtney, Harry, a rebellious James Dean/Mick Jagger type and Tom an affable Cliff Richard (as in Summer Holiday).<br/><br/>The upper-class airman on the boat sounds like an American trying to put on a posh British accent. It is, in fact, Cillian Murphy, who I found out later, hails from Ireland. It was the way he said, 'Yacht', that gave it away.<br/><br/>It was obvious Harry Styles is not RADA trained as his diction is poor and I struggled to understand what he was saying, although I got it (well, almost all of it) the second time round. He over-acted as well, but being a good actor comes with time.<br/><br/>The soundtrack goes right through you, you really have to see it at volume 11 with the screen in your face.<br/><br/>It is worth the extra five pounds or so to see it on IMAX, so I urge you to see it before it's too late and all you have is the DVD download or the edited TV film with commercial breaks.<br/><br/>Take an afternoon or morning off work - the evening sessions are all sold out - and just go see. Even if you have to sit in the front row at the end, beg steal or borrow and see it well.<br/><br/>I love this film with all my heart.

"rannynm","10","15","31","23 July 2017"," A Visual Masterpiece with a Timely Topic about British Pride
","Dunkirk offers the most intense, beach set cinematic experience since the iconic film Jaws. In this new adaptation of such a strong battle, Christopher Nolan's talent as director and writer shines through, creating a visual masterpiece that leaves you mesmerized.<br/><br/>The battle of Dunkirk was a short one, May 26 to June 4, 1940. Despite its minimal timeframe, it was deadly. WWII Allied soldiers were hiding, surrounded on all sides by the German Army and had to be evacuated on the beaches of Dunkirk, by way of an operation famously known as Operation Dynamo. On the ground, British Army Privates Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) and Alex (Harry Styles) are two of the men desperately fighting and struggling to remain alive and safely evacuate the beach, by whatever means available. Across the ocean, local sailors Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and his son Peter (Toms Carney) had been recruited by the Navy to help with the evacuation. From yet another perspective, members of the Royal Air Force including Farrier (Tom Hardy) attempt to shoot down the German bombers, in order to help the stranded troops evacuate the beach and ocean safely.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the production of the film. The cinematography, as expected from talented director and writer Christopher Nolan, is groundbreaking. Congratulations to Hoyte van Hoyterman for creating a visual masterpiece. Everything looks incredibly realistic and breathtaking, keeping you on your toes throughout the film. The scene that is the most memorable to me, is when one of the Air Force pilots soar through the sunset sky as the troops cheer in victory. I assure you that it will give you goosebumps and make you teary-eyed.<br/><br/>The sound effects and the music by Hans Zimmer make the movie that much more tangible. The bombing begins from the very start of the film, preparing you for an emotional roller-coaster. They are so loud that it sounds as if they're coming from the back of the theater. If you listen closely, there's a ticking clock throughout the entire film, (minus the ending, which I will keep under wraps for you to discover) hidden within each song, creating increased tension and suspense. By the end of the film, I was already down to the nub of my fingertips, so prepare to be antsy!<br/><br/>Harry Styles' performance is quite impressive, particularly since he is a known as a singer, not an actor. It is refreshing to see his excellent performance her, as he is the one with the most lines and delivers them eloquently, equal to an experienced actor. Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy also delivered remarkable performances. Dunkirk relies heavily on emotions since it barely has any dialogue, so it is important to have the story delivered by the visuals and the acting, which they achieved flawlessly.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is rated PG-13 for intense war experiences and some language. Because of the stunning cinematography and story line, I rate Dunkirk 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. Go check it out, whether you are a history buff or not, this film will remind you how history affects us.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Michelle C., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."

","The only explanation of the events surrounding Dunkirk are few lines of text and Nazi propaganda. Maps of France, covered in red demarcating German territory, which falls on a squad of British solider scavenging in an abandoned city. It declares: Surrender + Survive. Within seconds of an enemy encounter, only one soldier will survive. This sequence is the closest we will get to combat depicted in more exhilarating war movies. Not in this scene nor any other do we see a single Nazi solider.<br/><br/>War is a favorite subject, why is obvious. Any emotion can be provoked, any existential question explored, against a backdrop of war. As a result, a diverse pantheon of great war films have emerged. Dunkirk, by critical demand, is set to join these hallowed ranks. Call these proclaimers Nolan fanboys, but already comparison are being made to the likes of standards Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and Platoon. But this is a disservice to all parties. Of the three aforementioned film, all belong to the same genre, but when each are distilled to their most base essence, I would only describe 1 ½ as being ""about"" war. Almost unimaginable, there is a grander scale where war is just a subtheme e.g. an exploration of human madness. Nolan strives for the exact opposite in Dunkirk. Dunkirk seeks to narrow the scope, it is not about war, or WW2, or even really an event in WW2. Thus the opening scene, were context is rendered to a few measly lines. Don't panic, or at least not yet. Dunkirk is a story of many struggles for survival, and Nolan is going to root through his usual bag of tricks to extract this perspective from history's grandest retreat.<br/><br/>Nolan is back to his trademark storytelling technique in Dunkirk. There are three major plot lines cut together in nonlinear fashion. Two soldiers attempt to escape the beach, a trio of civilians cross the channel on a one boat rescue mission, and a pilot defends all against German aircraft. Individually, each account is almost overly simplistic, but they are edited so that a sleepy film-goer might find the narrative incompressible. The temporal dicing can lead to monumental changes in shot composition from cut to cut, including night to day, clear skies to grey, and from calm to raging seas. When plot lines do briefly converge, their might be a 40 minute gap between one perspective and its reflection. Audiences looking for plot to serve as a guide will be lost. Then, when they make the logical next step a look for a central character, they will grow more bewildered. Dunkirk relies on an ensemble cast, I would be impressed by anyone perceptive enough to walk out of the theater remembering any two characters' names. No time to really explore individual performances, but the cast is astounding. Quality notwithstanding, no single part is hefty enough to serve as a focal point. Without defining plot or characters, people looking to evaluate Dunkirk on their customary schema are going to be unfulfilled. Where the heart of most films lie, Nolan has created a void. Dunkirk is a masterpiece because beyond this absence there is only intentioned craft.<br/><br/>Dialogue is a rare interruption in Dunkirk. There is virtually no exposition. Still, gleaning motivation is never a problem. The solider pair making up 1/3 of Dunkirk observe their situation, and, without speaking, mutually understand the best path to survival. The closest we get to a comical moment is when the duo simply look to each other, no choice to what their next act must be. The audience understands these characters by the same method they understand each other. Only later we learn speech that could have espoused the situation was impossible. The score speaks clearer than any dialogue. What Zimmerman lacks in subtly here is compensated by his brutal effectiveness. Symphonic blaring with an omnipresent ticking, the crux is dissonance rather than resolution. Audiences will pray for silence and its arrival is rapturous. But the eyes will be as overwhelmed as the ears. Dunkirk is constantly upsetting with vastnesses of oceans, beach, and sky as counterpoints against confined quarters, dense with humanity and rising water. There is no rest, or even catharsis. None of the hallmark exhilaration associated with the genre. Death comes via suicide, stairs, water, and oil. Extinction by strafing is almost pleasant because it is familiar within the context of war. <br/><br/>Dunkirk should not happen under the laws of moviedom, it is a fortunate example of when a powerful director can tell a story of personal importance with personal style. The most common criticism will be from those who entirely missed the point, complaints about story and character despite the deliberate steps to make clear these ideals were never the goal. Saving Private Ryan fails if you walk out of the theater without remembering the name of Hank's character. Make a rule of thumb from this, but not a universal standard. For some, the blunderous beautify of war exemplified in films like The Big Red 1. These are their war films. That's fine, but you must also appreciate Dunkirk which requires a bit of investment and does not hold your hand. I can only hope this is not too much of a burden."
"falbpe","2","7","12","1 August 2017"," Outdated war propaganda
","The point of a new WWII clon movie always is something misleading. ¿Really we need a WWII movie every month? Now, the music and photography are very good; but soon we realize than the plot and the drama is thin, and the more important part of a movie always should be the dramatic elements. Of the three stories that is about the film, none has the slightest interest; the more weak is the aviator story, and really do not fit with the others. Maybe without this part the movie it would have been better. The problem with historical war films is that they only work when present themselves as allegorical or symbolic; for this reason Apocalypse Now (1979) is a great movie. The reality of the past is something than change with the time; and is really hard to believe today in the cinema like a neutral source of historical contents. And the point of filming a movie with the only sense to encourage the British and American people to enjoy the war against Germany, seem something outdated or very forced. But I have no doubt than Dinkirk will win one or two Oscars: it has the necessary measure of mediocrity."
"chandanshivaramu","5","7","12","1 August 2017"," Brilliantly hyped up as usual for a Nolan flick except for the sheer of joy of SFX less cinematography
","Seeing this flick on a wide screen theater and the charisma of WW2 was supposed to be a thrilling ride for me. But, it turned out to be an ordinary affair. The positives: ultra realistic 35mm shot, devoid of any visible special effects, shot from 3 different perspectives was indeed a brilliant piece of cinematography. The negatives: Too many. Firstly, there is none of the breathtaking thrills of Saving Private Ryan to which it is constantly compared to at the moment. Secondly, the story is wafer thin, it could have easily been made as a short 20 minute documentary with all its intended effects. Thirdly, the narration is skewed, land/air/sea scenes are deliberately shown 3 times making it a monotonous and irritating viewing at times. Fourth point: The set pieces look ordinary as i just cant compare it to the gigantic mass evacuation of 200000+ British soldiers to UK with just 100's shown on the screen. The arrangement is a drab affair for a epic scale as this. Fifth point: Most of the cast look washed, non-charismatic, very less screen time, sans basic emotion and simply ordinary. Noteworthy exceptions are obviously Harry Styles and the masterful Mark Rylance. Ken Bran looks comical with his pencil grin.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a decent WW2 movie muddled with repetitive scenes with no depth in characters made by a visionary director with a speck of vision bundled in to a boring plot (pun intended as it could have made with a brilliant opening scene and a climax to match it). Finally, to my utmost relief, this movie need not be watched many times to understand its simple simplicity as is the case for Nolan's earlier multi-layered flicks."

"cyifly-2","9","7","12","28 July 2017"," To Put It Short and Sweet -- Go See Dunkirk on the Biggest Screen You Can Find
","If you love war movies, Dunkirk is surely one not to be missed. It's quite likely going to be an instant classic in the ranks of Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, and - most recently - Hacksaw Ridge. It will loose something if you try to watch it at home, no matter the quality of your home system. It's one of those films that really needs the big screen -- the bigger the better -- and best sound system you can find.<br/><br/>With that said, the movie does have some flaws. Most of which I will give a pass and write it off as ""artistic,"" and Christopher Nolan has earned that right. As I discuss the flaws, please understand that I really enjoyed the movie and strongly recommend it. Most of it was very well done. If I was to be petty and pick out what I think some others might not like, I would say most movies have a heavier, more distinctive plot. A beginning, introducing and developing the characters and setting up the plot; a middle, setting up the conflict the main characters will spend the movie solving; an end, where the main characters solve the conflict. If you need such a movie, then Dunkirk may not be for you, because the plot was not that clear. This was more like showing the audience an event than telling them a story -- An event that was hard, yet entertaining, to watch.<br/><br/>The movie does have characters and somewhat of a plot, but they are not distinctive nor defined. The characters kind of run together and the plot is a bit unclear. The same scene unfolds slowly from three different points of view. From the view of an infantry group -- who are all basically the same height and build, same haircut and hair color, same uniform and mission. This is why they are difficult to tell apart when they are all running from some sort of peril during their screen time. Another points of view come from characters on a small boat and again in small planes and their characters are more distinctive, but never really developed either, because the plot is not really defined. Everyone just wants to survive and spends the whole movie trying to do so.<br/><br/>And that is the basic plot -- Survival. Everyone is trying to survive this long war scene. The whole movie takes place in, what seems like, one afternoon. But, somehow, that plot works. It was obviously not written or directed to be a typical story in a typical movie. It's the same tense war scene shot from the perspective of three different groups of people, with no single, distinctive, main character, plot or point... And it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>The scenes are shot so beautifully, that when you are with the infantry group, you feel like you were down in the dirt with them and want to dodging bullets. When the perspective would change, you got to see the same scene again, but from the air and the pilots' point of view and it felt like you were sitting in the tiny plane with them. When you watched the same scene from the boat crew's point of view, you could almost feel the boat shaking and the smell the sea salt. The shots are exquisite and details are fully thought out. You can hear the sand falling around your head, the gun chambers rattling the airplane and it seems you can reach below and touch the white caps of the ocean.<br/><br/>The only real flaw for me was the story was not clearly set up. Unless you had prior knowledge of Dunkirk and it's history, you would have to have an explanation. I'll give a short explanation with no movie spoilers: The English went to help the French when Germany invaded during WWII. Germany was too strong and not only pushed the French to the coast, but the English right along with them. The Germans changed their strategy from fighting the French/English by shooting one bullet at a time to coming in from the sea with planes and bombing the troops at the beach, on piers and on boats -- intending to kill many more in one attempt, in hopes that they didn't go back to England and regroup. The movie quickly moves to the beach in the beginning and you or only given a quick blip of how they all really got there. For that, I gave it 9 out of 10. That is not giving away the movie -- There is so much more to this.<br/><br/>The direction is great, the acting was on par and the special effects were seamless. If you are not a war movie fan, this will not change your mind, but Dunkirk will likely be around come awards season, and rightfully so."

","I'm a huge Nolan fan. I've watched everything he's ever done multiple times. I've been looking forward to this movie so much, and I definitely enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The story itself is worthy of being explored in a film: 400,000 British soldiers are stranded at Dunkirk, repeatedly being hammered by the enemy. If I recall correctly, they didn't show any German soldiers or even say the word Germans or anything like that. Regardless, the antagonist's presence is still powerful and terrifying. We've all seen and heard enough about the evil Nazis at this point in our collective culture to understand the threat they pose.<br/><br/>I loved how there was basically no back story for any of the characters. The movie starts, and the threat is immediate. It grabbed me from the beginning.<br/><br/>I loved the way it was filmed. The expansive shots combined with claustrophobic spaces made for a totally unique war movie. In fact, I've never seen anything that gave me the feeling it did. I had a sense of the geography of everything.<br/><br/>That being said, this wasn't my favorite Nolan movie. I was tense at certain moments, but I wasn't on the edge of my seat, literally getting adrenaline rushes because I was so afraid someone was going to die. I wasn't as emotionally involved as I wanted to be.<br/><br/>I also had a lot of trouble understanding what people were saying. The effects and score were so loud I couldn't comprehend about 40% of what the characters were saying, especially Tom Hardy and the other pilots.<br/><br/>My boyfriend thought it was the greatest war movie he's ever seen. Personally, Saving Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now are still my favorites.<br/><br/>But, let's be real: I'd cut off limbs to be able to write something like Dunkirk. Nonetheless, the emotion and suspense just wasn't there for me."

Nolan's specialty is building characters, great dialogues,thrills, engaging climax etc. I am sorry to say that all these are missing here. You do not feel for any of the characters in the movie.

I think the soundtrack is just plain bad and mostly droning. I never felt emotionally attached to any of the protagonists so couldn't care what happened to them and overall it just feels like nothing really happens throughout the whole film.

"thor_linnet","6","6","10","7 August 2017"," A (too) quiet tale from WWII
","To cut to the chase, this movie is entirely forgettable. I feel that there's a huge bias towards loving Nolan's films among critics, as he's deemed the best of the best, and as such, reviewers will, subconsciously maybe, adapt their opinions to suit this fact. It has happened before: Which movie was best, The Dark knight, or the Dark knight Rises? Correct, The Dark Knight. Yet, when TDKR arrived, it was so hyped that an explosion of unfounded positive reviews spewed everywhere. It was definitely a good movie. But it was also NOT near as good as The Dark knight, a fact most have come to realize in the following years. <br/><br/>I have loved basically all of Nolan's movies. This time though, a yawn too many escaped my mouth, and not from a lack of sleep. The movie has great acting, although it is quite simple to be fair. Not a lot of emotion or character development is present, so it would be hard to judge talent based on performances of this film. The thing that keeps the movie fairly enjoyable is it's awesome visuals and musical scores. You are not in doubt you are watching a Nolan film; the editing, lighting, and audio track is an art in itself.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these positive aspects are not able to compensate for the almost complete lack of storytelling and excitement throughout the movie. The brief scenes of suspense and action are quickly watered out by long sections of mundane actions by the characters. There is no palpable red line throughout, keeping the baseline interest in the movie at quite a low level. No real story is told, it's more of a depiction of a historical event.<br/><br/>I believe the creation of this movie is an attempt to show how young, inexperienced, and human the soldiers of WWII really were. It wants to portray bravery and weakness of civilians and soldiers alike. It does succeed, but if only the movie was not so dull in doing so. Most of Nolan's movies I've watched at least two times, but I don't think I will revisit this one.<br/><br/>People have compared this film to Saving Private Ryan and other WWII all-time greats, which in my mind is utter crazy talk. Watch Dunkirk and Saving Private Ryan back to back, and if you still hold the same opinion, I promise you we will never agree on anything. This movie's IMDb score, along with the Dark Knight Rises', are, in my opinion, inflated to proportions that do not match their quality."
"asb_deutsch","5","6","10","6 August 2017"," If you watched the trailer, there is nothing much more to offer except the IMAX coverage
","I got disappointed while watching Dunkirk as it is more or less like a tick-tock version of Saving Private Ryan. <br/><br/>The background score is so much emphasized that you can barely hear the dialogues between the characters. I recall that there was a similar problem in Inception where the old Japanese's dialogue was in a mutely tone. The surprising thing also is that there is any hardly any character development in the script, which many viewers may disagree with me as Nolan has smartly justified in Inception.<br/><br/>If you love war movies, go ahead. But don't indulge yourself much. Because it is the same scenes you have seen before.<br/><br/>My Significant digit score: 5.5/10"
"ambrosia_1","5","6","10","5 August 2017"," Powerful story poorly told. Know your history.
","There are NO spoilers in this review, but some helpful information to understand it if you see it.<br/><br/>This movie is based on the true story about the rescue of over 300,000 (out of 400K) British solders during WWII. I went into this movie believing the soldiers were POW's in a camp and most of the story would be about *them*. THEY ARE NOT. The troops are ""stranded"" on the beaches of France, cut off from England a mere 22 miles across the English Channel. Cut off by land by Nazi troops (whom we never see) and by sea in the heavily patrolled waters by German planes & ""U-boats"" (""Underwater boats"", aka: submarines.) The movie is told in three parts (actually 4): Land, Sea (2 sea stories) & Air... but the movie expects you to figure that out for yourself, making things quite confusing. Part one is ""The Mole"" and takes place over the course of a week, but here, a ""mole"" isn't a ""spy"", it's a French word for extended shoreline/pier. It would have helped immensely if the screen told you this was ""*STORY* 1: The Beach"" instead of ""1. The Mole"". I spent the first hour trying to figure out who the Spy was (and the paranoia of some of the soldiers didn't help.) The movie is well acted (and LOUD), a lesson in one of Britain's proudest moments, but the telling of that story is too disjointed... a prime example of why writers should not direct their own movies (and vice versa.) Christopher Nolan (Director of the Batman films) both wrote & directed Dunkirk. He's a great director, but should have outsourced the writing to someone with more experience.<br/><br/>I rated this a 5. Deserves at least a 7.5 for the story & production quality, but is just so damn disjointed, everyone who sees it says they would need to see it again ""now that they understand what was going on."" But no one wants to see a movie twice just because they feel they HAVE to to enjoy it *once*. :("

The film shows the same story from different perspectives; Is interesting,unfortunately the transit between scenes, that is, the management of the perspectives in time were misdirected. It could be said that it is a feature that breaks schemas, that is to say, it stops being cliché because it does not include what we could clearly call a main protagonist, it does not include a woman, there is not a love story in the middle of the tragedy, the film Not focusing on heroism but telling the event of evacuation of troops, but we could not say that he moved away from Hollywood cinema to show it from the historical point of view because the truth is very superfluous, etc. The film is acceptable as entertainment plus leaves a tasteless Christopher Nolan one of the best directors, writers and producers."

","Several times during the show I thought it was all over. I felt like I would drown or get shot out of the air and had to cover up as enemy planes strafed the rotting piers and the beach. That's the feeling director Christopher Nolan has created throughout ""Dunkirk"", one of the most exciting war movies ever made. He sustains the mood for the entire picture, together with the drone of planes and ack-ack fire of machine guns and at the end you feel almost shell-shocked - or at least have ringing in your ears.<br/><br/>Very odd, though, is the feeling that you have stumbled into the midst of an evacuation, which is pretty much the case. There is no beginning to the film to speak of, just thousands of troops assembled on the beach. Same at the end; you know the end to the war wasn't in sight for five more years. Christopher Nolan has made here the perfect war movie and is a must-see for WWII buffs as well as movie fans."

If you are unfamiliar with the story and you stayed for the whole story, you still aren't familiar with Dunkirk and its history. The film needs the beginning to show the Germans and how they got the Brits into the situation. There needed to be more ""stories within the story;"" however, if you enjoy gunfire and bombs for 90 minutes without a clue where it's coming from or why, this movie is for you."
"DVR_Brale","7","6","10","23 July 2017"," Horrific event without horror
","First and foremost, Dunkirk is PG-13 movie. There's almost no blood, sweat and real war horrors in it. What we're basically seeing is a sort of a documentary. Dunkirk's primary goal is making you aware of in how difficult situation British and French soldiers were.<br/><br/>That means that there's little dialogue in the movie. No personal story is embedded in it. But what is really strange is that there is not so much action neither. Action is distributed throughout the movie and always comes as a climax to previous developments. That's why you can hear silent but noticeable ""tika-taka"" sound throughout almost the entire movie. <br/><br/>Secondly, Dunkirk is a very tense and loud experience. Story itself never rushes but steadily grows until it bursts. I believe emphasizing that effect is the reason why Nolan decided to tell the story in a non-linear fashion from three different perspectives; that way he can constantly keep you on the edge of your seat. If that weren't so, Dunkirk would frankly be a boring movie.<br/><br/>All in all, if you're tired of violence, superficiality and too much talking but love tense story-line, Dunkrik is spot on. As for the war movie veterans: you may find it a bit unconvincing. It's still worth giving it a shot."
"avik-kumar-si","9","9","17","30 July 2017"," A brilliant experience of a horrible episode
","Dunkirk is a beautiful film, and an exceptional one. It's not entertainment in the usual sense. It's an immersive experience. Like any war film worth its salt, Dunkirk is, at its core, an anti-war film that harps upon the horrors of war and its futility.<br/><br/>As you watch men stranded on beaches, trapped in a boat awaiting to be killed, the pointless nature of war strikes you. Dunkirk shows you men trapped in a no-win situation, with a haunting background score by Hans Zimmer conveying the constant fear. If you think the constant bombardment of the score was an overkill, you are getting closer to imagining the plight of the men stranded on the beach, in the ships at Dunkirk.<br/><br/>In Dunkirk, Nolan parodies war, where old civilians are the only hope for young soldiers. Where small boats provide relief when the big, bad ships are easy prey.<br/><br/>Dunkirk featured the best dogfight scenes I have ever watched. The cockpit-view shots of a Spitfire chasing an enemy craft with the endless sea beneath you and the skies above meeting at horizon (which, ironically, you are in no position to savour) are wretchedly beautiful, painfully tense.<br/><br/>This film's very different from most of Christopher Nolan's earlier works, with a scarce screenplay, no major twists and an end you know. But Nolan's innovative non-linear storytelling breathes life into this tale, which he then teases out of you with the tremendous sights and sounds of a horrible episode from human history.<br/><br/>Congratulations Nolan, for once again bucking the conventions and leaving your signature in a new genre!"
"lasttimeisaw","8","9","17","30 July 2017"," we need more star-directors like Christopher Nolan
","From a point-of-view of an inveterate pacifist, any war film shouldn't be bothered to watch, whether it wields its anti-war flag or not, because it is either flogging a dead horse or being brazenly repugnant. But when one is made by Christopher Nolan, there is no excuse for a film buff to dodge from facing the man-made atrocity dutifully affixed with adequate dosage of individual heroism gleaming as the silver lining (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a clear forefather), and this is DUNKIRK. <br/><br/>Without any question, Mr. Nolan envisions and executes an immersive experience for pampering audience to vicariously partake in the action, its triptych structural arrangement from land, sea, and air with different temporalities starts as a tad discombobulating, but before long would we be utterly blown away by the sheer mastery of its grand-scale imagery and sonic accompaniment, in particular that muffled ticking sound blanketing the infantry pawns as they are continuously besieged by aerial attack, torpedo charge and stray bullets, our protagonist on the land is the Private Tommy, played by a young Tom Courtenay ringer, the rookie Fionn Whitehead, who has no intention to be heroic at any rate when the priority is simply to stay alive. He is first paired with Gibson (Barnard), so as to take a chance of getting on board of a departing warship along with those who are injured, which doesn't work. After biding their time hidden themselves under the mole, they finally land on their feet on another ship, surprisingly, Gibson chooses to stay away from his fellow compatriots, a decision which prompts his life-saving conduct when the ship is sinking underwater, among whom he saves are Peter and Alex (Styles), but the real reason behind that decision will boomerang later, which the ingrate Alex should partially answer for. Here Nolan's script pluckily wrestles with the shadowy underside of the internecine conflicts among the Allies, when nationality hogging the precedence over individual lives. And it is interesting to divine why Nolan doesn't swap the upshots of Alex and Gibson if he really wants to state a point. <br/><br/>On the sea, the evacuation aided by boats of civilians brings to the fore of an ordinary family's selfless deeds in a perilous situation, Mark Rylance superbly plays Mr. Dawson, a seafarer who has already lost a son to the war and volunteers to the rescue mission with another son Peter (Glynn- Carney) and a young helper George (Keoghan) in his own boat, en route, they successfully come to aid to a soldier on the flotsam (Murphy, in his best shell-shocked form) and a British pilot (Lowden) almost trapped to death in the cockpit before sailing near Dunkirk, but one might feel a bit disappointed that even Nolan has to predictably yield to the last-second-succor schtick in his own script. The Dawson's involvement also poignantly brings home to us the inconvenient truth: being heroic also entails that one must pay its price, however unpleasant it is. In the firmament, British Supermarine Spitfires (although riddled with malfunctions) engage in dogfight with German bombers, they are the guardian angels of those defenseless earth-bound foot soldiers and unwieldy vessels, Tom Hardy, as one of the pilots, is the ultimate hero specimen, laconic, unfazed and cool-headed, a sublimed understated performance.<br/><br/>DUNKIRK's robust box-office revenue bears witness to a reassuring fact that a director's name can still usurp bankability from film stars (whose power is actually dwindling significantly into the 21st century), because auteurism shouldn't only to be ensconced on the art house sphere, it should be the new norm if our film industry needs to prosper, we need more star-directors like Christopher Nolan and maybe this time, Academy members can finally cave in."
"fahycolm","9","9","17","30 July 2017"," Dunkirk - Nolan's Memento to Cherish
","Christopher Nolan is the blockbuster director with the Midas touch – but it is not all about the money. Behind a powerhouse visual style, lies a writer of substance, a skilled craftsman who knows how to build a film from its beginning, middle and end and stuff it with tortured souls, each on his or her hero's journey, with labyrinthine twists and decoys enough to put an audience of Black Watch renegades through their paces. <br/><br/>He has managed to take dollar-raking staples like Batman, and convince change averse nervous twitching studio heads that the Dark Knight needs to be dark and the fumbling penguin needs to be the tortured soul the subject of all our affections even if he is a mass murdering git. He did it and the coffers inflated like popcorn – who knew that inverting the norm could be attractive? But doing all that with the futuristic effects bloated blockbusters like Man of Steel or Interstellar is one thing - taking on the gritty and emotionally delicate subject of a war event that is as critical to British history and identity as the tower of London is another. <br/><br/>Yet, once again Nolan has proved that no holy grail is holy enough to remain immune from his dismemberment. But, if something has to be torn asunder and reconstructed – then Nolan has quite firmly established himself as the man of the moment and with the visually stunning and narrative hall-marked DUNKIRK, we have another Nolan game changer. <br/><br/>Jettisoning standard linear narrative ritual in favor of the iconic leaping and rebounding story line of his classic Memento, Nolan goes even one further abandoning the venerated three act play. In a most astounding narrative leap Nolan's Dunkirk casts off the 'WHY?'. It is an act of pure cinematic genius whose absence plays startlingly into his denouement of the infamous British forces rescue from the beaches of Northern France in the last week of May 1940. Many recent reviewers and critics have lamented the absence of a historical explanation as to why the events that were taking place were not fully extrapolated. But they have missed the point entirely. Nolan's approach was clearly to use his visual genius to saturate the viewer in the experience – the central character of the film is in fact the event – viscerally portrayed in vibrant immersive 70mm. The why of the event is not developed because the purpose of the exposition is to leave the viewer with a much bigger why they themselves most formulate having being fed into the action – it is not why Dunkirk – but why war? <br/><br/>Nolan has managed to do what few great war films - despite their aspirations - have failed to do – he has succeed in documenting an event that crushes the viewer with the irrationality, the savagery and inhumanity of it all and yet plants the seed of a hope that humanity is moving in the right direction – all without any character for the viewer to cling to. Even ""Tommy"", a representative ""Tommy"" played by Fionn Whitehead – is underdeveloped so as to avoid the audience pinning its affections too tightly on any one role – that was never the intention. Where Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, the Thin Red Line, Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July all railed against the savagery of war, the hook for the viewer was being dragged into a deep personal emotional attachment to a character whose fate punched the audience. Not so DUNKIRK. It is incidents within the event which hurt and the cumulative emotional response is much broader and much more impactful. For this reason alone it is hard not to begin to consider DUNKIRK as one of the very all-time war films. But there are other reasons.<br/><br/>Recounted through three perspectives, air, land and sea, unfolding across different time perspectives, with each one ultimately narrowing down to a single colliding event, Nolan ties the viewer into an authentic confusion of time, space , event and order – hallmarks of a conflict experience in which the semblance of command structures is subverted by the urgency of the predicament. It is only the representatives of the homeland – personified by the brilliant Mark Rylance in the company of Barry Keoghan and Tom Glynn-Carney – sailing with clear instructions and purpose, who represent the calm of normality – even when hit by tragedy. Outside that small oasis of hope, the desperation and claustrophobia of conflict is most brilliantly exposed through the cockpit firefights between the Spitfire squadrons and the Henkel escorted Luftwaffe attacks – making for some of the best aerial war sequences in decades. And although at times, the visuals are the stuff of small boys war stories – there is nothing trivial or scout in Nolan's treatment. In two very particular sequences he exposes us to the delicacy of heroism and the sometimes heroism in ordinariness. The aerial combat scenes stake on a particular significance when one realises the intensity and precarious nature of those sorties – a microcosm of the tremendous hazards of conflict, where the enemy is not just the enemy but the way circumstance leans.<br/><br/>DUNKIRK inspires a reflection on the immense courage that all those men and women showed, not just in that event – but in the wider war which raged on for years after - at incredible human cost but, in the end, for a prize that many of us have, all too sadly, forgotten. We need to be grateful to great artists like Christopher Nolan for treating this subject with the respect and brilliance it merited. We need to be reminded of the huge victory that was ultimately the prize of Dunkirk and what that means today. We need to be mindful of the men and women who fought that war, those who have passed on - but also those who are with us yet."

","Dunkirk is the story of the allied troops who were stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk and surrounded by German soldiers as they try to survive and escape, meanwhile volunteers sail their boats out to save the soldiers, meanwhile fighter planes attempt to defend the soldiers on the beach from German bombers. <br/><br/>Typical to Christopher Nolan, this movie is fantastic. Nolan directs the crap out of it. Not only is his camera-work fantastic, but the scenery he captures is beautiful. They manage to really nail the tone, with it being a little claustrophobic despite the location being a massive beach. The characters are stuck and there is absolutely no way for them to escape. Right from the opening scene, Nolan nails the tone and realism of the film. <br/><br/>On top of that, Hans Zimmer's score is far from only being the icing on the cake. In truth, the music proves to be something of a major character, assisting in the carrying of the rest of the cast through this horrible event. The music perfectly suits every situation, and whether or not you feel for the characters, the music makes sure you at least feel a little tense. <br/><br/>Speaking of the characters, there really aren't any. Sure, there are like 300,000 soldiers on the beach, yet we still feel for them. The main character has maybe four lines in the movie, yet the reason why he's so good along with the rest of the characters is because the movie sets up this horrible situation and instead of filling the movie with gratuitous war violence, a lot of it is psychological. When a character is desperately trying to escape from drowning you definitely feel for them. I don't know about you, but I don't want to drown. And even without speaking, the characters make decisions and do things that are completely logical and understandable. There are no dumb people in this movie, and as a result they prove to be very human. There is so much humanity in these characters, so it's very easy to relate to them in some way. <br/><br/>Part of why the characters are so humane, however, is because of the acting. From the big names like Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh, to the first-timers like Fionn Whitehead, there is not a single bad, or even average, performance in this movie. The lead, Whitehead, is absolutely outstanding in his first full-length film role, pulling off a very human performance simply by the way he moves, acts, and reacts. My personal favorite, however, was Cillian Murphy. He plays a shell-shocked soldier and absolutely nails it for the short amount of time he spends on screen. His character holds so much depth and intrigue, I looked forward to every moment he spent on screen. <br/><br/>The movie feels real too. The gunshots sound real, and the way the action scenes are shot are in-the-moment and authentic. When Hardy flies his plane and attempts to shoot down others, it's not epic. It's not really even that fast-paced. It's honestly just kind of tedious and frustrating, watching him carefully line up his shot before shooting. And again, the claustrophobia is very real. We get plenty of in-the-cockpit shots that show just how incredibly uncomfortable it would've been in that plane. Again, it's very real and no matter how 'weak' the characters are I felt for each one. And there's so little hope in this movie. Characters end up in terrible situations and don't always get saved last minute. Things happen that would happen in real life but in a conventional movie? No way. Just when you think the movie may be divulging to conventionalism it throws a grenade at your face and you remember that this is real. <br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie it felt a little over-dramatic. The music, the narration, the way it was shot. Of course then I remembered that this was a dramatic event. What happened was not pretentious, it was a big deal. Deciding to use a dramatic filming style at the end made sense. <br/><br/>If I can find one problem with this movie, it's that at times it felt a little slow. Not that it wasn't interesting, the movie is fantastic at showing the audience what happened without making it long and boring, but it does slow down from time to time. Certain moments may feel a little out of place, but in terms of the plot still make sense. <br/><br/>Overall Dunkirk is fantastic. Just about everything works, and you should absolutely go see it. From the music to the directing to the acting, it's great. Go see it. It's worth your money."
"targe1314","4","9","17","24 July 2017"," One of those Highly Annoying Jump Around in Time movies, about a bunch of guys standing on a beach
","I went into Dunkirk with high hopes, respecting the director, and impressed with what I had seen from the previews, but expecting they were hiding the best for last in the movie.<br/><br/>I left confused, disappointed, and as I walked back over the movie, I grew increasingly so.<br/><br/>This movie, which, if we were to believe the media hype around it, is a proud return to the stellar WWII movies of our youth, in short, a complete opposite to the disaster that was the 2001 Pearl Harbour movie. NO CGI!!! We are informed, as if that somehow indicates the signs of a GOOD movie...<br/><br/>Instead we are treated to an incredibly boring 2 hours of guys standing on a beach, an old fella driving his boat, and some very leisurely and boring flying.<br/><br/>I was disappointed going in that the movie was only 2 hours. 'Barely enough time to give such a subject the grandeur it deserves' many were saying.<br/><br/>Instead I was staring at my watch, begging this snore fest to be done, and begging that the ludicrous stories would not be overtopped by even more ludicrousness.<br/><br/>I was wrong, the finale, which I'll get to, is so completely ridiculous that one wonders if they were hoping for zero pilots in the audience.<br/><br/>No, I'm not a WWII war buff who is going to rip this movie a new one because of technicalities. The mistakes are both small and huge in this movie, and seemingly never ending.<br/><br/>The movie makes an attempt to separate the topics into 3 main areas: Land, Sea, and Air. Or, to be more accurate, Boring scenes of guys standing around at the beach, lots of guys drowning in multiple ship sinkings while grandpa putters with his son and friend to the rescue, and leisurely Sunday flight maneuvers with a couple of planes.<br/><br/>LAND.<br/><br/>In trying to be realistic, C. Nolan, instead of CGI'ing the spectacle of 400,000 desperate soldiers crowding on a beach awaiting rescue, we are shown maybe 500, many of which are apparently cardboard. It's about the size of a rock concert lineup outside the stadium on Friday night, for an old 70's band. The guys are bored, we are bored.<br/><br/>Occasionally a dive bomber comes down to drop some bombs and kill 1 guy or 2. Then back to smoking and staring at the sea. When this seems like it will just never end, we get a scene change as some soldiers find an old boat and try to sit in it and wait for the tide. Yes, this is a riveting scene of guys sitting in a boat waiting for the tide to come in. And it's exciting compared to what we saw previously. Then a guy loses his mind and decides someone must die, for some bizarre reason, he figures if one guy get's out the bullethole ridden hulk will finally float.<br/><br/>SEA.<br/><br/>We are treated so multiple ship sinkings and guys drowning. It's never ending. If you are a shipwreck survivor, I HIGHLY Recommend YOU AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!! It will re-ignite your PTSD. We see the same sinking over and over, from multiple angles because? THIS MOVIE JUMPS AROUND IN TIME.<br/><br/>I am biased, as I ABSOLUTELY HATE movies that jump around in time. This is one of the worst I have seen in years for that.<br/><br/>AIR.<br/><br/>They have only 1 German bomber left that can fly, apparently, so we are treated to that, exactly ONE bomber. Flying around and around, aka jump around in time, from multiple angles. Now the technical details come to the front, as droves of pilots walk to the exits. The spitfire fighters have an inexhaustible supply of bullets. The German planes refuse to get out of the way of the bullets. The spitfire pilots appear bored as bullets strike their planes. All planes execute lazy, civilian aircraft lazy turns and banks, as if they are all out for a nice Sunday fly.<br/><br/>The spitfire pilot flies around for the last ten minutes with his thumb on the fire trigger, as if he doesn't know what the heck he is doing. Then he proceeds to glide for about 10 minutes with no fuel, and shoot down a German plane, in a heavy fighter plane that would have been on the beach in 2 minutes with zero banking or turning. He glides up and down the beach like this for what seems an eternity. It is maddening.<br/><br/>Finally, a guy ditches his plane in the drink but FORGETS TO OPEN HIS CANOPY FIRST. A cardinal sin for any pilot. He is rescued by a kid with a boathook, who somehow manages to chop through his canopy in one blow, even though it's already under water. Cringeworthy.<br/><br/>MUSIC FAULTS<br/><br/>As a young lad loads lifejackets onto his dad's boat, we are treated to a hammering tension filled score that one would expect for the imminent attack of JAWS. No jaws, or Godzilla happens, just... a ... kid... slowly loading lifejackets... on a boat.<br/><br/>SOUND FAULTS<br/><br/>As stated, they accidentally put the '20mm cannon guns firing' noise over top of the German bomber machine guns firing. See Battle of Britain for a properly done WWII flying picture.<br/><br/>EDITING FAULTS<br/><br/>The movie jumps around in time so much one is quickly infuriated. It appears we are watching 20 minutes of film that is stretched to 2 hours using the multiple camera angles.<br/><br/>FALSE DANGERS<br/><br/>Finally,<br/><br/>There was zero rough stormy seas during Dunkirk. It was the opposite actually, unusually calm.<br/><br/>There was zero issue with the tide at Dunkirk. They had boarding options all the way from high tide to low.<br/><br/>Both of these are used as tension elements and plot elements in the movie."
"harshakick","10","9","17","21 July 2017"," Virtual reality sans the bane of headsets
","Christopher Nolan. A captivating storyteller. Dunkirk, his brainchild, is the exaltation of directorial passion. <br/><br/>Dunkirk is a poem. It has no heroics, no drama, no emotional flashbacks, even, no words for the most part, yet, immensely succeeds in conveying the entirety of it's message towards the end, to the already visually spellbound audience.<br/><br/>When you watch Dunkirk, you are not a third person. You are the wounded soldier, you are the killing one too. You are the rescuer, you are the pilot in the spitfire. You are at war within yourself, torn between the happenings that occurred during the World War's infamous evacuation. <br/><br/>Adding to the visual treat it is, the sound shall have no less of a mention either. There has not been a better score for a war movie to date. The simple sound has regained the throne it's once lost to the digital/techno music. The mood, context and above everything, what comes next has been so craftily elevated with the score, thanks to Mr. Zimmer.<br/><br/>Right from the opening shot, you are there. You hear the battle as a soldier does. You endure the explosions just as they do.<br/><br/>No movie-goer is eligible to critique this work of mastered art. <br/><br/>One can however, only enjoy the experience."

"williampsamuel","10","5","8","15 March 2019"," A Masterpiece of Epic Minimalism
","I wouldn't have thought you could make a minimalist epic. But that's exactly what Christopher Nolan did. I never would have thought it possible to make a suspense thriller out of events that everyone already knows the ending of. But he did that too. He's stripped away every unnecessary element; every subplot and war movie cliché until all that remains is the desperate men on and above the beach and an ever growing sense of tension. And it is magnificent.<br/><br/>It begins with brief narration, then volleys of gunfire from unseen assailants at frightened men running through the streets. This will set the tone for what's to come. Although dogfights and scenes of bombing and shelling are frequent, we rarely see more than a glimpse of the Germans. Instead we're given a growing and almost palpable feeling of dread; the knowledge that the enemy is massed just beyond the horizon and that time is running out.<br/><br/>With every near miss, and with each ship sunk or plane shot down the suspense grows. And no sooner is one disaster averted than another threat looms. We know from history class that most of the army will get home alive, but we don't know if the men we're following will be among them. The effect is almost like High Noon or Gravity in that the viewer is constantly kept on the edge of their seat, awaiting what comes next.<br/><br/>Though we see thousands of men and dozens of ships in some shots, most of the movie is almost intimate in its focus. Most scenes follow handfuls of men on the beach, a trio of fighter pilots circling over Dunkirk, and the crew of small civilian boat. We share their desperation and determination, their hope and fear. We see the bravery and sacrifice of ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances, and the cowardice and paranoia of men who have been through too much. Though we never learn their backstories or -with one exception- their names, their actions and their expressions tell us enough.<br/><br/>The film's visual aesthetic is as minimalist as its narrative. Long shots of sea, sky, and beach abound, with a single boat or airplane to remind us there's a war going on. Even when the camera takes in the whole port and the thousands waiting on the beach, it only reinforces how stranded and exposed they are. Even the explosions are fairly restrained.<br/><br/>The editing deftly adds to the suspense with frequent cuts between groups of protagonists during their tensest moments. There's even a bit of nonlinear storytelling, a la Tarantino. At times the film jumps back and forth between day and night scenes, and certain events are seen from characters' points of view half an hour or more apart. It can get a bit confusing at times, but it keeps things interesting and reminds us that the different actors are experiencing the same events in very different ways.<br/><br/>Though very different from the grandeur of Saving Private Ryan or the sweeping scale of Patton, Dunkirk easily belongs in the same class as those masterpieces. It's another hit in Nolan's unbroken string of home runs, and proof that you really can do more with less."

","I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan, I cannot count how many times I have watched and re-watched Inception and even more Interstellar, I consider his Batman trilogy the best ever produced. I must admit I was a littler doubtful about Dunkirk, I was wondering how Nolan could make a Nolan movie out of such story; but then I thought, ""hell, this is Mr Nolan we are talking about, he will do the trick!"" and I went to see it. Well, sorry for saying so, but he didn't, this time Mr Nolan's magic did not work out as expected.... I thought the movie is totally overrated, it is still a decent, watchable movie, but not a great one. The plot is rather linear (hey, this is not fiction, so what did you expect? exactly, that was my original doubt as above...), the cinematography is very nice...so, there is nothing terribly wrong, simply this is not one of the great Nolan movies."
"darioilg","9","5","8","31 August 2017"," A disappointing example of bad pacing
","I would never had thought that Christopher Nolan, the man that created some of my most beloved films as a young cinema goer, would film such an unusually bad paced film and I'm starting to think that all the fuzz about it comes from the natural instinct of patriotism it evokes rather than actual technical prowess. Sure, the film is beautifully shot, but it's a shallow beauty. There are so many films that show the horror of war and coming to face one's own mortality to the point of giving anything to ""go back home"": ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" come to mind. Both films are wisely divided into tense and relaxing scenes, so that the tension is shared by the public when it comes on screen. In ""Dunkirk"", the whole movie is a tension scene, which completely cancels any reason to feel tension after the first few dangerous situations our heroes find themselves in. And let's talk about these ""heroes"". It rarely happened to me to find a movie so crowded with useless talent: none of the characters mean anything to the overall story, they are sketches of the valiant, the mean, the wise, etc. and we have no time whatsoever to indulge in more intimate moments with them. This was definitely a conscious decision by Nolan, so that he could convey the feeling of telling the story of all 400.000 men and not only Harry Styles's, but if I don't feel anything for the few we actually get to know, then all 400.000 are misrepresented. Not to mention the only relevant death (which I won't spoil): it clearly just happens for some emotive involvement between such arid scenes, but it looks so artificial, so useless and stupid that it really makes you chuckle. One of the worst aspects of the film is the music, by Hans Zimmer. I would say by previous Hans Zimmer tunes, considering how any part of this score could have come from ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Inception"" and no-one would've noticed. Apart from its repetitiveness from other films, it's repetitive in itself: just like the endless action and danger, Zimmer's music is always tense, always on a high-alert tone, resulting in pure nothingness. Last, the week/day/hour narrative device. Nolan clearly needed something original to tell such an ultimately dull story so he and his team conceived this utterly useless idea. Throughout the film there is not a single time I thought ""Wow, now I see why he organized the story this way!"" and that is because it serves no purpose other than to give the feeling of an edgy, nolanesque feature. For reference, consider ""Memento"", Nolan's debut; there the complex narrative pattern makes complete sense and is functional -nay, essential- to the end result of the story. In ""Dunkirk"" this temporal distortion is completely useless: the film could've followed a more regular pattern without suffering anything on the narrative side. <br/><br/>I consider this the worst film Nolan has ever made, and I feel very disappointed knowing his potential."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","5","8","29 July 2017"," ""Dunkirk"" is impeccably made but lacks depth.
","Beloved filmmaker Christopher Nolan explores arguably the most important battle of WW II, following the allied forces in Dunkirk, France trying to survive a powerful Nazi attack. The British, French, Belgians, Polish and Dutch forces aren't trying to be heroes, they're trying to be survivors. Survival is what Nolan wants the audience to understand, and unlike most war films, it lacks a powerful message. This is where ""Dunkirk"" fails. Lacking not only character development, it portrays nothing interesting or captivating about this important battle. We get countless action sequences that look and sound amazing, but there's nothing worth-while to make you feel for anyone involved in the battle. While ""Dunkirk"" captures what the nature of the battle was like, it gives no meat to explore the people we see involved. If not for Christopher Nolan's name behind the camera, this film would not be receiving the praise it has gotten. See it for the mesmerizing editing and cinematography (most notably in the fighter-planes lead by an awesome Tom Hardy), but don't expect to be wowed by its story."
"bill-14329","7","5","8","22 July 2017"," Good movie but lacks grandiosity
","I have been transfixed with the story of Dunkirk since I was a young adult. More than a third of a million soldiers were stuck on a beach. What will happen to them? This movie tells the story in vignettes. What it is lacking is that it does not show the grandiosity of what was on the beaches. There was over a third of a million men, not a battalion or two. That is like the entire population of New Orleans being on one beach at one time. The immensity of the task at hand is what makes the real Dunkirk story so compelling. Christopher Nolan missed it. It was still a good movie, but that flaw was a disappointment."

I didn't feel involved and even though the movie is only 100 min (pretty short in today's norm, which has become AT LEAST 2 hours long) it still felt pretty long.<br/><br/>I should probably mention that the hand-held camera (especially in the beginning of the film) was way too shaky for my taste and felt very uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Nolan has his hits and misses.

"ciskowski","8","8","15","30 July 2017"," Strong work from a director at the top of his craft.
","Dunkirk is tense, sparse, and unsettling. Nolan makes many interesting choices, starting with the 1 week/1 day/1 hour non-sequential action structure, which is effective and yet disorienting. He creates a film about the fate of hundreds of thousands of men, crowded into a small pocket of land and into tightly-packed ships, that feels open, empty, and nearly deserted. Similarly, a film that conveys a constant sense of danger and dread features actors who remain withdrawn and almost unresponsive in nearly every scene. Mark Rylance unsurprisingly provides a standout performance; Hans Zimmer's score is unsettling and dangerous in perfect parallel with the on screen action, and Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is spare, beautiful, and evocative. Creating such a beautiful yet unsentimental war film is a bold move, and personally I felt a bit less invested in its arc than I might have expected. In this it's almost a counter-argument to Saving Private Ryan. But while I can't say that I fell in love with the film, I definitely recognize the mastery of craft and art, all in service to the director's vision. It's impressive and makes for a quite worthy film."
"StoryArchitect","8","8","15","29 July 2017"," CLOCKWORK DUNKIRK / Film magician Christopher Nolan tells the harrowing World War II story code-named Operation Dynamo by crisscrossing the Architecture of Place & Time . . .
","1. If you haven't seen DUNKIRK, don't read this. And if you have seen DUNKIRK, go see it again. Ideally, 70mm film (not digital), 2.20:1 widescreen.<br/><br/>Because DUNKIRK presents far more than a thrilling visceral spectacle and dramatic reenactment of an historical event. This movie must be seen twice--at least twice--to fully grasp its clockwork architecture.<br/><br/>2. For screenwriter and director Christopher Nolan, Cinema is Art--a grand creative chess game costarring Form and Story. On the rectangular chessboard of the silver screen, the White Knight of Form and the Black Knight of Story (my terms) engage in collaborative ""conflict""--""the basis of every art,"" as Sergei Eisenstein said in Film Form (1949).<br/><br/>Nolan knows, A movie is a game, and a game has rules. And in DUNKIRK, a Bobby Fischer level expression of the Chess Game of Art, Nolan plays by very special rules.<br/><br/>3. My second viewing confirmed things I saw the first time about Nolan's One Word Theme: Time. (And sidekick, Place.) And revealed far more I didn't see.<br/><br/>Time serves as Nolan's OWT throughout his work--for example, MEMENTO and INTERSTELLAR. Specifically, Story Time. Which in DUNKIRK, Nolan elastically shapes, bends, staggers, previews, rewinds, fast forwards, accelerates, and compresses . . . through his RASHOMON-like artistic filter . . . most obviously conveyed by showing us the downed British pilot's water landing twice.<br/><br/>Think about it. Nolan shows us that water landing twice!<br/><br/>4. Through titles, Nolan posts the Place & Time structure of his story up front. Events on the Mole (Land) take place over a week. On the Sea, in a day. In the Air, in an hour--virtually real time relative to the duration of the movie. Slow Land and faster Sea take place in the Past relative to fastest-of-all Air, which takes place in the Present--the Future relative to Land and Sea--until one fateful moment.<br/><br/>My second viewing revealed methodical nothing-is-random telling and retelling of key scenes as the Past of Land and Sea catch up with the Present of Air. Land and Sea time moves faster and faster, compression accelerating, to the second act climax when BAM, KABOOM . . . the German bomber (Villain) goes down. Conflagration ensues (signaling False Victory), the Moonstone rescues Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) . . . and action rebuilds until Land and Sea and Air intersect, EXPLODE, for one split second into a synchronized convergent Present of cheers at the end of the second act . . . when the three Place & Time Zones crisscross into a reversal, Sea and Land moving forward into the Present and Future . . . and Air gliding into the Past. All Place & Time lead to that crucial climactic Moment . . . when just when he thinks they're safe, startled--the Villain rising to strike one last time--Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) closes his eyes, resigned to their devastating fate . . . and the frame starts to go white . . . then suddenly, this False Defeat turns to Victory as the last German fighter plane gets shot down.<br/><br/>5. On first viewing, how could we know, Follow the Moonstone--captained by Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance)--which first-time viewers will unlikely spot in the frame of Nolan's first unspooling of the plane's water landing. How could we know, Follow the trawler--the beached bullet-riddled fishing boat--that we see sinking long before we see the soldiers climb into it. But on second viewing, we can see more clearly Nolan's magic act, his sleight of hand, his deft design, simultaneously concealed and revealed, of the Architecture of Place & Time.<br/><br/>6. The stunning Hans Zimmer score and the sound design reinforce Nolan's exacting choreography of Time. Listen for the tick tick. And watch how many times characters look at their watches, including British pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy), who checks his watch and chalks the time on his control panel to calculate how long his fuel will last.<br/><br/>See how beautifully Nolan edits the film at the end, collating the frames of Hoyte van Hoytema's breathtaking cinematography so that the slow peaceful heroic descent of the airplane onto the beach--when Air and Land and Sea again poetically merge--parallels the same slowing down, the same timing, of the train with our mole. (Nolan plays on the meaning of mole, threading our stand in, Tommy, through the story from beginning to end, seen from the back in the first frame and from the front in the last frame. Mole in a figurative sense: The mole is our spy, one of the main ways we get inside the story. He spies for us.)<br/><br/>7. I need a third watch to unravel Nolan's Möbius strip moves. When does Farrier shoot down that last fighter? Does he loop back after he glides by Bolton? Or does Nolan pull a MEMENTO, showing the sequence backward-because Farrier shot the fighter down before gliding by? A riddle signaling how Nolan ups the complexity of his artistic chess game of Form & Story at this dramatic moment. Not only crisscrossing Time and Place . . . but also Direction and Space.<br/><br/>8. Yes, a movie is a game, and a game has rules--rules that the magic of movies can sustain, bend, and break that the Place & Time-bound reality of life can't.<br/><br/>But at the same time, the Form & Story art of DUNKIRK presents a creative demonstration of the scientific truth of the relativity of Space and Time.<br/><br/>And Observation.<br/><br/>Nolan riffs on Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON (1950), gathering witnesses inside and outside the story, summoning us to witness the film's deep structure as we sort out what's happening . . . where . . . and when.<br/><br/>9. My Silver Knight Rating of DUNKIRK:<br/><br/>White Knight (Form): 8.5<br/><br/>Black Knight (Story): 7.5<br/><br/>=<br/><br/>Silver Knight (Form & Story): 8<br/><br/>8 Cameras<br/><br/>(I explain my Silver Knight Rating system in my IMDb commentary on ARRIVAL.)<br/><br/>© copyright 2017 by JEF7REY HILDNER"

The acting was great but the confusing time line and holes in unrealistic story line were terrible and the background synthetic New age noise was depressing and boring. If I were British or French I would be offended at the portrayal of my countryman as pathetic and cowardly.

The little boats were barely mentioned (except for the one where some of the action took place) and it wasn't until near the end of the film that they all suddenly turned up. <br/><br/>Also, the beach looked like they had a few hundred men not the over 400,000 we were being told were there. <br/><br/>I had an uncle who was at Dunkirk.

","I know this film is getting rave reviews by almost everyone, but in all honesty...I thought it stunk. From the very first moments, I felt like I was watching a bunch of GoPro videos on YouTube that were stitched together. The screenshots are very chaotic & non-sensical. To make my point, there are multiple scenes where it's nighttime and it's dark and flames all around, then the very next scene it's broad daylight with sunshine & blue sky. The director cuts repeatedly from ships being torpedoed, Spitfire aerial dogfights, men standing on a long causeway. This film has minimal dialogue in fact there's very little acting at all...it's all explosions, sinking ships & dogfights.<br/><br/>In the end, the one absolutely amazing moment was Kenneth Branagh viewing the wide panoramic vista of English civilian boats sailing in to rescue the trapped army.<br/><br/>Before going to the theater, I spent time reading Encyclopedia Britannica as well as Wikipedia too as I wanted to know the real ""factual"" history. Thankfully, this tale is extremely close to the truth with only one exception and that'd be the huge numbers of soldiers that were captured by Nazi Germans as POWs."

","I came out of Dunkirk thinking it was OK. I was just pretty happy it was over really. I sure would have liked a whole lot more character development. A big dash of story line would have been helpful. Dialog might have been nice. I remember thinking about ten minutes in, oh no, Nolan has gone off the deep end here with some kind of overly artistic self gratifying film. I kept hoping for about the next ten minutes that it would stop, that it was just his opening to a meaningful story about the brave successful rescue of an army that would live to later see victory. <br/><br/>It didn't stop though. It went on and on and on and on. I suggest Schindler's List, Das Boot, Letters from Iwo Jima, A Bridge Over River Kwai, The Great Escape, Patton, Sophie's Choice, or a whole bunch of other films that just escape me right now, if you wan't to see great films, with characters and story line that draw you in, and help you loose yourself in a meaningful story about a particular experience of one of the endless number of difficult experiences which that terrible war produced. This film is distracting, at times confusing, underdeveloped, and a rather poor story teller. It's not all bad and certainly did have its moments, but ultimately did not deliver nearly what so many other films about WWII have so eloquently accomplished."
"redmondstrickland","10","3","4","23 April 2020"," A phenomenal experience
","This movie had me sitting on the edge of my sweet the whole way through, it was incredibly engaging. The use, or lack or, dialect creates an indescribable atmosphere and forces the watcher to pay attention. The use of a nearly constant, if not constant sound bed includes the viewer in the experience and allows them to go on ups and downs along with the movie."
"ronakkotian","9","3","4","16 April 2020"," It made me feel like I was in the moment
","Every time Christopher Nolan makes a film, I get excited. He is a filmmaker who has made countless classics and possesses a lot of creativity. It's interesting to see him make a war film like Dunkirk and after watching it, I wish I witnessed it in a cinema.<br/><br/>Dunkirk recounts the extraordinary event where soldiers from Britain, France and Belgium are trying to get evacuated from Dunkirk whilst being surrounded by the Germans.<br/><br/>If there's one thing you can be sure of when going into a Nolan film is that the film is going to be a cinematic experience. I really regret missing Dunkirk at the cinemas and watching it in IMAX because this film is a technical achievement. I love Nolan's usage of practical effects in all of his movies. It shows how much he cares about realism in his films. Dunkirk uses real boats, real planes and thousands of extras to make this event look as authentic as possible. I couldn't stop marvelling at how amazing this film looked. The camerawork was absolutely incredible. There are a lot of beautiful shots and it wasn't too shaky.<br/><br/>The sound design and sound editing were fantastic. The spitfire scenes looked so real and the sound they made whilst firing didn't seem unrealistic at all. The editing is very tight. This is one of Nolan's shorter films but that's not a bad thing because it doesn't waste time or overstay its welcome. Right from the beginning you are in the moment and doesn't give you any time to breathe until the end. Hans Zimmer gives us another impactful score that heightens the tension during every scene.<br/><br/>A major complaint will be the lack of character. This film follows three different perspectives of the event but there isn't anyone you feel a personal connection with. That is the only flaw I can pick out. I would have loved to connect with someone particularly but it's important to remember that Dunkirk is about the event and not the people. During an event like this, it wouldn't feel right for characters to talk about themselves or their family since their main priority is surviving. I feel all the actors involved conveyed the intensity of the situation and fear of survival through their expressions.<br/><br/>Dunkirk was a riveting experience. It's a humongous spectacle that's makes you feel like you're there with the rest of the soldiers. It's a film that intense all the way through and another successful triumph for Christopher Nolan."
"MigLancer","10","3","4","14 March 2020"," A masterpiece of cinema!
","I am surprised by the negative reviews. I can only imagine is due to a heroic view of war and Dunkirk evacuation in particular.
The sound creates an atmosphere that matches the occasion throughout the movie. There may not be a classic view of war in this movie, but with every scene, the movie captures the details of the evacuation from all aspects of the soldiers involved: Navy, Army, RAF, French Army, civilians . The fact that the enemy is never visible, bar a few planes and silhouettes of soldiers is very powerful! This movie is a masterpiece! Only if you look with a jingoistic view at this movie you could find faults. Dunkirk was a retreat, not a victory! I guess that wasn't understood by many that keep an Imperial Britain view of the world! The movie is a great homage to the soldiers and civilians of the time and a very down to ground view of the events."
"johnrogula","4","3","4","3 January 2020"," Poorly Executed
","I think this film is very much a case of the Emperors new clothes. Most of the critics gushed over it, but I thought it was a bit of a yawn fest which didnt even tell the story particularly well (compared to the original with John Mills). They spent so much time bragging about their IMAX cameras but where were all the shots of 1000's of men and equipment on the huge beaches ? Where was the blizzard of small and large boats that were present in the real operation ? The aerial combat scenes were okay, but I thought the film could have covered the retreat to the coast more (like the original) ? In short it dragged a bit for me."
"jeroen-106","3","3","4","1 January 2020"," Terrible
","Saw Dunkirk with my wife and we were both seriously underwhelmed. I went out to the 70mm screening and everything. I found myself struggling to care about anyone in the movie and the story. I found the asynchronous time lines to be more irritating than clever. I found the lack of any real meaning in the deaths to be boring. There was a serious lack of any real grit or bite to the film. In the end, every emotional scene felt more manipulative than earned - a problem that was literally and figuratively amplified by the scoring by Hans Zimmer forcing emotions upon the viewer, instead of letting the story and its characters accomplish that. At times the music was unbearable.
Other people I know who went out to see the movie thought there was something wrong with the scale of the battle (apparently it was much, much bigger in scale in reality) but that didn't bother me personally. The cinematography was excellent.<br/><br/>Everyone is giving it so much praise and I just genuinely don't see what other people like about it. Can someone explain to me what I'm not getting?"

","I don't know what it is about Christopher Nolan's films but they just never appeal to me. Just like his previous films, 'Dunkirk' is technically great yet completely fails to connect on an emotional level. It's cold-hearted, soulless storytelling and no amount of visual effects can deflect from that.<br/><br/>I know that the purpose of this film is to take a wider, more broad approach to telling the story of what happened in Dunkirk rather than following an individual character/event within the war, but for a film like this to be completely void of emotion is disappointing and it can't have been what Nolan had envisaged.<br/><br/>The acting is good and the visuals are great, but beyond that 'Dunkirk' didn't do much for me at all. It's missing characters and emotion - two things that should be at the core of any war film."

This movie seems like a 2 hour documentary on the evacuation than anything else. There is barely a shred of any story. We have 3 different scenarios going on that have little to do with each other, besides the fact that they are going on during the evacuation. The dialogue seems to be written half the time by a 10 year old and the rest of the time by an expert in military communications.

"playtester69","1","3","4","25 June 2018"," Extremely dissapointing
","Clearly a movie which polarises opinions, I have to say I found this one of the poorest war movies I've ever scene.
Threading a series of individual stories together in this environment is not new - The Battle of Britain is a classic example of how this can be handled - it also did a much better job of portraying the scope of the event - a task which Dunkirk, despite widespread use of CGI, doesn't do: the near empty beaches over strained my capacity to suspend disbelief to the point where I quickly lost interest.
Then came the sinking of the unknown hospital ship at the Mole. Unfortunately, this didn't happen - given the number of vessels that were sunk, resorting to this sort of device seems unnecessary and cheap.
To me, it failed on every level - indeed there was a point when I kept watching only because of the one bit of suspense the movie tried to create - did he ever get to finish taking a crap?"

","I appreciated Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the events in ""Dunkirk,"" and how he focused on the sounds and sights to connect the audience to the terror and uncertainty experienced by those who were involved. Visually, it's very exciting, especially the dogfights in the skies and the strafing of boats on the water. He obviously made a conscious decision to reveal almost nothing of a personal nature about any of these characters, including their names in some cases. You simply don't know anything about them, which is risky in a movie. Why should the audience care about some character we don't know? As the movie plays out, you do come to fill in those gaps a bit due to the excellent actors involved, particularly Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy and Jack Lowden. I assume Nolan's purpose for doing this was to show that it was this very large group of individuals coming together to do something miraculous in a time of global peril, when truly, their whole world and way of life was in jeopardy. Still, I couldn't help thinking that he might have added a few minutes here and there to give us more information or background on these men. The younger ones seem completely anonymous and almost blank.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is very loud at times, and there's ""ticking"" that conveys the sense of danger and impending doom. It's almost as if you hear these men's hearts beating because they're just terrified. The action scenes are very well done. U.S. viewers (particularly younger ones) who are not familiar with the events of Dunkirk or the larger geopolitical situation of the start of WW2 would do well to read up on it a bit before seeing ""Dunkirk,"" because Christopher Nolan is not wasting any film on explaining it all to you. I think people who like war movies in general or scenes with edge-of-your-seat action will enjoy this movie, but anyone who wants deeper character exposition will find it wanting."

Why Dunkirk stood out among all the battles and atrocities of WWII? Yes, they had one boat with father, son and a friend who was hardly necessary to story line, but in history there were hundreds of vessels of all sorts that floated.

And people standing in queues for 2 hours? No action at all? No enemy?"" Nolan ""there are a couple of enemy planes sir, and we'll repeat the same dogfight 3 times. Oh and a boy falls down some steps and bangs his head."" <br/><br/>I agree with veteran signaller Alfred Baldwin, who was at Dunkirk in 1940, - ""You had the impression of people standing waiting for a bus.""

Half way through the movie we both felt we wanted our money back. My young nephew, however, was a little more positive. We hated that the movie never reveals the significant impact this event had in Britain's survival and war effort. More important today's generation has little knowledge of significant WWII events and this movie did little to enlighten them. I read some rave reviews for its artistic effort, but even Roger Elberg though raving it said he would not see it again. We hated that artistic value trumped the basic historical element of Dunkirk; The largest military evacuation, roughly 400,000 men with their backs to the sea, was represented in the film by no more than a few thousand men all lined up as if they were on a bread line. The lack of dialogue also did not help give any historical background, and the contribution by British civilian merchants was minimize to the actions on one ship. While Nolan's creative choice to take a week, a day, and an hour ws may be a creative novel approach, it only helped to diminish the grand scope of Operation Dynamo. What about the 80,000 soldiers left behind and the approximate 10,000 that were summarily executed by the Germans rather than take them as POWs. Yes War is not pretty, but this film came far short of depicting the situation that May and June in 1940. We were totally disappointed, and I would rank it as one of my 5 worst military war films. I don't if I would want to call it a historical film."

Talking about poor old Kenneth spent most of the film wandering up and down a pier... nice work if you can get it!<br/><br/>Stukas bombing soldiers who remarkably all stayed in one piece after being hit. In reality many of them would have been in seriously bad shape and not many would have been in one piece.

It's like in plot development somebody came up with that bright idea (not)... entirely predictable.<br/><br/>Characters were so wooden that no sympathy was allowed to develop.<br/><br/>And Germans bombing clearly marked hospital ships.

","What a disappointing, totally unconvincing and bizarre film. A tragic missed opportunity to tell one of the most dramatic stories in history - the escape of an entire army with only hours to spare from one of the most brutal and frightening enemies of all time.<br/><br/>Anyone with even the most basic knowledge of Dunkirk will see that the scenes in the film bear very little resemblance to the real events. In this film Dunkirk town appears without damage, the evacuating army is miniscule and the German air attacks laughable. <br/><br/>Just look at any of the real film or photos of the Dunkirk operation on the internet and you will see the contrast. For that matter look at any of the combat scenes in, say, Band of Brothers, to see the contrast also. <br/><br/>I was left totally disinterested in what was going on and was skipping forward through the film to get to the end.<br/><br/>I would recommend that you watch the 1958 film of the same name with John Mills if you want to see a tense and realistic portrayal of the evacuation."

","Last weekend we went to the cinema to see the movie Dunkirk. Our expectations were high because of many positive stories of people who already seen this movie. However, we were somehow disappointed after we saw this movie.<br/><br/>In my honest opinion this movie does not tell the true story of what really happened at Dunkirk and what really went on with all the men desperitaly trying to leave France.<br/><br/>Some scenes played next to each other but in a different time level. This made the movie difficult to follow. Also a plane without fuel which was able to stay mid-air for a considerable amount of time able to shoot enemy planes down, was so un-realistic.<br/><br/>At least it was a movie where blood wasn't spilled as there was hardly any blood visible. Even though the bombs went down on thousands of soldiers, no blood or any lost parts of bodies were seen.<br/><br/>Too bad that Dunkirk is not shown as it really was, however it is a good thing that events like Dunkirk are recorded. So people get a fairly good idea how WWII started."

That is, 400,000 British & French soldiers were TRAPPED, with no hope of escape possible, as the German army them surrounded.<br/><br/>How important is this? Virtually ALL serious military historians agree that if the Nazis took proper advantage of the situation, World War II would have ENDED, right then and there, and Hitler would have taken over Europe, Asia, Africa, and who knows what else.<br/><br/>Anyway, movie BORED me, and I'm a serious history buff. Movie focused on six or seven guys, under fire, yeah, private boats helped to evacuate them to England, but didn't come CLOSE to getting the message across that THIS was the greatest evacuation in world history. Too bad.<br/><br/>Oh, and could have used subtitles- those British accents are indecipherable.<br/><br/>As movie ended, and before final credits began to roll, audience should have been told, on screen, that ""This was the greatest evacuation in military history, thanks to the hundreds (if not thousands) of British citizens who used their own boats, at their OWN peril,to rescue their own countrymen, and so on.....

","I was blown away when I saw Dunkirk in the theaters. It was so thrilling just from the beginning sequence, and it kept that fast paced thriller until the end. The film is told in 3 perspectives;the land, the sky , and the sea. In all of those perspectives,I experienced a non stop thrill ride along with Hans Zimmer's score that sounds literally like a timer. The whole film is crafted with the fast paced tempo and time limitations. I really had a great experience watching it in a IMAX theater, and I just thought I was actually there in the movie.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with this film is that it is a Christopher Nolan film. I felt like this film didn't have the complexity and uniqueness most of his other films have. Meaning this film doesn't feel like a Nolan film, and I will disagree with those of you who say Dunkirk is the best entry to Christopher Nolan's filmography.

","Honestly. I had high hopes & expectations for this movie (which, I agree, might bias my rating) but it turned out to be bleach and boring. The plane part? Whoever thought watching a spitfire chase a bomber for half a movie will be a captivating experience was wrong (IMO). The beach part? Empty sand and lines of soliders, no military equipment on the beach (Allies left around 85.000 vehicles and 450 tanks behind while evacutaing, 100+ planes were destroyed), no action. Everyone just waits in line and then disembarks within 30 seconds since the civil vessels arrive. The boat part? Why this boy was killed?! To show how mature the other young lad is (especially when he says to the pilot that the boy will be fine)? To show what shock can do to a man (pilot)? It's unrealistic and fake to me. And then, after they finally reach Dunkirk, they take some soliders on-board and dip out as soon as the oil on the water starts to burn. You can even see that the boat is half full, there are still people in water (not in the fire!) and they just dip! <br/><br/>And when soldiers finally come back home, expecting hate from the people for ""disappoiting"" them, it all ends well with a bottle of beer handed to a soldier on one of the train stations and one of them reads a famous Winton's speach. Of course he did. <br/><br/>It's cringy sometimes, it is soul-less and brings nothing - even fails to show the terror that those soldiers most likely felt. Constant bombings, buring oil bringing the black clouds of smoke over the beaches, scale of operation (200 out of 800 ship vessels taking part in Dynamo operation was destroyed), chaos on the beach which required to abandon everything in order to survive."

What score? Nothing but two or three monotones sustained indefinitely while their waveforms are tweaked. Any kid with a synth could produce such stuff in a few minutes. The other part of the ""score"" consists of a pulse-like sound, played accelerando to give an impression of increasing tension. This was repeated several times. Cheap. Easy.

I don't know if it was due to budgetary constraints, but it did not appear that there were over 300,000 stranded soldiers on the beaches desperately waiting to be rescued, nor did it seem like there were enough civilian boats available to make this transportation possible. The whole scale of things simply did not add up. The sheer amount of humanity must have created numerous real life issues and this was never addressed.

Some claustrophobic moments in sinking ships are quite uncomfortable. The evacuation lasted a week so we get the feeling of a long wait.<br/><br/>ONE DAY: On the sea, we follow the story of one of the many civilians who helped carrying soldiers back to England with their own boats. The two-way journey lasted one day, so the experience was different.<br/><br/>ONE HOUR: The RAF pilots add more seasickness opportunities, with their daring manoeuvres to protect their stranded comrades. Their tanks could support one hour of flight, and this is the third, different view point.<br/><br/>For the above mentioned reasons, the plot is not edited in chronological order, which was slightly annoying, but there was enough tension to keep the story going without a dull moment. If you like character-driven stories you will not like this, but I appreciated the lack of personal stories and the focus on the general, dismal feeling of defeat.<br/><br/>Two small problems: the beach was too quiet, with relatively few soldiers waiting for a ride home. Over 300.000 soldiers were evacuated from Dunkirk, but we see at most a few hundreds waiting on the beach. Finally, the soundtrack was overbearing. It is clear it was a dramatic event without the need to have it hammered home with the hyper- dramatic, anxiety-inducing music.<br/><br/>PS I know Nolan did not want to use CGI, but in this case some extra men on the beach would have added realism, rather than the opposite..."

","Christopher Nolan delivers a monumental, stunning war movie, full of suspense and quiet performances. The best war movies in history, including Saving Private Ryan and Hacksaw Ridge, have also placed viewers in the centre of battle. Nolan has not reinvented that immersive approach, but he comes close to perfecting it.<br/><br/>It's a frightening, thrilling opening, but the thing that strikes you is the sound. At certain points, the musical noise engulfs everything, even the dialogue.<br/><br/>The opening scenes visually invite us, the viewers, into the movie. Several soldiers, their backs to the camera, walk down an empty street in the French town of Dunkirk. Nolan leaves a space between them where we, the viewers, can fit, as if we're following them along the street. Seeing the film on a large screen makes it especially easy to glide into its world.<br/><br/>Nolan's film focuses initially on one young man running from a flurry of bullets through the deserted streets at the beginning of the film. Running from sudden gunfire, the young soldier, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), arrives at the beach, which is crowded with troops waiting to climb onto too-few ships. From there, Nolan quickly establishes three different story lines and timeframes that are gracefully interspersed throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Tommy, innocent and fearful, meets a French soldier, and they desperately carry an injured man on a stretcher toward the shore. Theirs is not a noble act. They are pretending to be medics in the hope of getting on a ship and saving themselves, which instantly sets Dunkirk apart from simpler, hero-driven war movies.<br/><br/>Mark Rylance is the very heart of Christopher Nolan's brilliantly directed war movie, Dunkirk. Rylance plays a civilian who navigates his small boat across the Channel, hoping to ferry stranded British soldiers back home. Rylance's character, Mr Dawson, is part of the day- long sea action, in which hundreds of small boats are called on to help."
"tubzz","4","11","23","22 July 2017"," The History behind Dunkirk is far more great than it was shown in the film
","Had immense expectation with this film but was quite disappointing after watching it. Obviously many will disagree, so for them<br/><br/>Firstly, the history was really great and also very dark behind Dunkirk. Almost 400,000 British soldiers were strangled on the Dunkirk beach and the German forces were surrounding them. The French brave local men came to the aid of the distressed soldiers and the managed to pull out almost all of them. If someone doesn't know about the event the film will be quite confusing for them.<br/><br/>Secondly, there were so many chances for the characters in the film those could have stood out. The German point of view was completely ignored whereas it played a very important part. Not to attack the British forces on Dunkirk was Hitler's one of the greatest mistakes just to give Churchill the feel of the power German has. That part is very important in the film.<br/><br/>Thirdly, on the event of Dunkirk there was history's best Dog fights happened over the sea of Dunkirk that just wasn't in the film at all. That eagerness and intensity of the dog fight was just missed. <br/><br/>Fourthly, the brave Frenchmen who came to the aid of the soldiers were just neglected. Over 700 local boats came for help but in the film there were only one boat which the whole movie concentrated on. And the list goes on. Over all very much disappointed with the film. "
"ShadowRomeo1784","8","11","23","21 July 2017"," The Best War Movie That I Have Watched Since Saving Private Ryan. My Personal Best Movie Of This Year
","My Personal Rating 8/10<br/><br/>Short Review - <br/><br/>Dunkirk is a war film that shows us how terrifying being stuck in a war can be. instead of focus on character's development like most war films do, christopher nolan did not included many talkings because of he wants to show us that in a middle of a war we cannot just sit and talk about the character's back story instead we jumped into their situation and now watch them how to survive and endure being in that situation. that i understand that's the main difference between this film and the considered best war film ""Saving Private ryan"" the atmosphere and soundtrack of this film is so superb that it gives us chills the feel of fear of war, the trauma it caused. that's what i exactly felt watching this. horror is not the right term for this film it shows us how terrifying a war can be. <br/><br/>Impressions -<br/><br/>Dunkirk is an excellent film. what i love more about this film is the cinematography beautiful shots from the aerial combat the special non cgi effects the atmosphere. the soundtrack the plot did not mattered that much and in my opinion not that special but the way this film's message to us. telling us of the story is the superb. giving us the message by feeling it through soundtrack and seeing it on character's reaction being on that situation. amazing film. my personal best movie of this year hands down. and i will definitely gonna watch this film again. <br/><br/>Downsides - Dunkirk is not a film about a war hero. Dunkirk is not a film for everyone especially people who only cares about characters. Dunkirk's intention of just jumping in to the situation might not suit everyone. it did to me. but i'm seeing some people that are not satisfied with it. just like what i said above this film's intention is different than other war films do and in my opinion that makes it unique and love it even more.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/><ul><li>Great Cinematography</li><li>Great Sound Design</li><li>Realistic DogFight</li><li>Realistic Sound Effects</li><li>No CGI</li><li>The Tension And Fear While You Watch This Film Especially On IMAX</li><li>The Timeline Between The Land, Sea, And Air.</li><li>Very Immersive Amosphere</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/><ul><li>There is No Unique Story About Characters</li><li>This Movie Did Not Even Had Any Memorable Dramatic Moments</li><li>Not For Everyone Especially If You Like Story.</li></ul><br/><br/>

"dpaterson-2","1","7","13","4 August 2017"," It should be called Dumb Kirk, but worse, it's an example of fascist film making.
","This film is fascist because it is frame by frame intentionally coercive so as to deprive an audience of any sense of (1) reflection, and (2) personal power. We are taken though a soundscape of piercing, relentless psychological violence (hey, it's a war film!) with a ""story telling"" structure that creates hopeless, trapped characters every minute (hey, it's a war film!) in such aggressive editing that we, the audience, are dragged through at least thirty horrific keyholes and back again in the course of the ""story"". It's not a story. It's six, eight, twenty? stories, again edited so as to thoroughly disorient the audience and hammer us with one water boarding (often literally) after another. (hey, its a war film!) It's fascist because fascism breeds on violence, especially senseless violence and the emptying of personal and collective power violence brings. I forced myself to disconnect from the torture and was able to get both a perspective and angry.<br/><br/>Worse, the film wholly ignores the historical reality of the bone-headed military decisions by the French (the criminally absurd Maginot Line) and the British (war had been declared MONTHS ago) (and Hitler was the opposition). The film also sucks dry the already-desiccated hero narrative forced on US population these last twenty years. With writhing violins after an hour and a half of uninterrupted electronic chainsaw sound score, I almost threw up.<br/><br/>What I'd like to be sure of is that this Dumb Kirk crime somehow stops Britain but especially the US from continuing the endless wars in the middle east and Africa, where the war dead are beginning to creep up to that sacred WWII yard stick. Somehow I don't think it will. Because fascism wants to give us a world that is dominated by men and violence in which there is nothing to be done. Just like in Waiting for Godot.<br/><br/>The film would have been helped enormously by the presence of even one woman (not used for sex appeal), but preferably by thousands -- to counter the narrative of the coming world police state orchestrated by the global corporate state in which patriarchal, fascist principles rely on everyone staying at home, feeling scared, being compliant, and asking no questions whatsoever.<br/><br/>By the way, the stupefying dedication is (paraphrase) to all those who were affected by what happened at Dunkirk. So in a loose application, that's maybe all of the World War II population. But if it's trying to be specific, babies born around the time of Dunkirk are now 76 - 77 years old, and the armies of working class soldiers who were victimized by their Dumb Kirk militaries are approaching 100. I'm sure those in particular appreciated this coercive homage to mindless directorial self-indulgence."

","My Uncle Frank died on Dunkirk beach.<br/><br/>I was hoping to see a film that portrayed the horror of war - as means to deter others. What I saw was over-hyped, uncritical nonsense.<br/><br/>From what I know from relatives, the evacuation was utter carnage. Yes soldiers escaped - but many (at least as many as escaped) were mown down via aerial attacks. The film showed very few aircraft which was stupid (also not very many soldiers). Very few ships and aeroplanes now survive but I'd have thought the CGI budget would have covered that.The lack of planes, boats and people seemed very very strange.<br/><br/>Where were the Germans? We saw two German helmets when a pilot was captured. That was it! Did the film have German financial backing or something?<br/><br/>Also for a reportedly costly film - the shots were full of modern artefacts. <br/><br/>Garbage. Hype.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and watch something else."
"tobbens-89118","4","7","13","31 July 2017"," A boring war movie
","This is a movie you will soon forget. There is no personal story that will make you emotionally involved. The acting is limited to listening to officers discuss the facts: 400 000 men stranded with little hope to return to Britain alive. If you like watching bombs falling and men dying, this is the film for you. Else, avoid it."
"Mikef999","3","7","13","30 July 2017"," Wow- The MetaCritic Score is SO WRONG!
","Why, WHY would anyone WANT to see this movie... it was about the most depressing 1.5hrs I've spent in a long time. After 45min of unrelenting misery, I could hardly wait for it to end. I knew going in that the subject matter was tough, but totally unlike a similar movie in the genre, like Saving Private Ryan, there really wasn't any great acting, heart tugging moments or ANYTHING to cheer about.<br/><br/>Particularly annoying about this movie was the score... the constant high pitch sound, meant to evoke tension (?), will give you a headache and it never lets up. The ridiculous back and forth between story lines (and day and night) didn't work for me... and I never felt the empathy toward characters that I probably should have. The ending was SO dragged out... and lifeless.<br/><br/>A movie doesn't have to make me ""happy"" to be entertaining... but sitting through this one felt like punishment. The media critics are idiots... save your money for something else less depressing- like a root canal, maybe?"

"shadnyk","Null","7","13","30 July 2017"," About as epic as a cup of tea and a digestive.
","How on earth did Nolan spend upwards of $150,000,000 on this film. The BBC could have knocked this one out on twelve shillings and sixpence. There is no dramatic scale to the rescue, you are left with the impression that a few people had nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon and took a quick trip to France for some duty free and maybe pick up a few stray soldiers. Nolan has taken his collection of tools and tricks from Interstellar and recast them into war film. Epic it is not, a tribute to the thousands of men and women that risked their lives to save the British Army from Germany, it is not."
"austin0731","8","7","13","28 July 2017"," The immersive 'experience' of war that highlights human insignificance
","Dunkirk tells the well known British story of the decisive WWII battle held at Dunkirk, ""The Miracle of Dunkirk."" Dunkirk is a brilliant atmospheric drama/thriller, it serves brilliantly as to tell the story of a historical event from multiple perspectives through immersing audiences in the midst of the battle and the intensity of the atmosphere. <br/><br/>Dunkirk made the stylistic choice to not let audiences get attached to any one character and truly is highlighting the horrors and struggles of the event itself. It focuses on the situation rather than the characters as most war film does, as a result we never get much backstory on any characters and many characters can be confusing to follow and connect with. However as I said this is a stylistic choice not a production flaw and it is a decision that I liked. I liked that Christopher Nolan chose a less conventional route to tell a war story and I think that this is a very interesting way of depicting an event that for the participants must seem extremely dire and helpless.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy once again does an amazing job despite once again having half his face covered, yet he still manages to do such an amazing work with his eyes alone. Other than Hardy, Harry Style's acting debut also delivered well and I am looking forward to any of his future works. <br/><br/>In fact it seems like a direct personal comment from Nolan to the audience of the true atrocities and horrors of war, by not highlighting the story behind these individuals they seem to lose significance and character almost as if they never existed, now this is a powerful statement in contrary to the clichéd war film trope that depict things like, valorous men charging into battle, widows and children receiving the country's honors, men sharing stories in the thick of battle. No, Nolan chose not to glorify war by showing us what great characters these people are but chooses to throw out the stone cold truth of the insignificance of men in the thick of war and under the mercy of fighter planes. In fact it is even highlighted at one point that prime minister Winston Churchill demands a certain amount of men to return as if they were just statistics and figures, this is a film that doesn't shy away from the political truths of war and serves to caution and remind us of the horrors of war, a reminder to audiences to get their head out of some sort of a dramatised glorified depiction of war."
"oazam","8","7","13","23 July 2017"," A Nolan Masterpiece!!
","Although Momento which starred Guy Pearce isn't Nolan's best film but Inception, Interstellar, and Dark Knight have done more justice to his filmography than the first film. Christopher Nolan is known to be a magician to Hollywood which starts from the commendable cinematography to the scintillating editing and to its labyrinth screenplay. <br/><br/>Over the last decade, Nolan hasn't failed in any of these aspects and kept all his films on a consistent flow.<br/><br/>Dunkirk was something I was looking forward to especially the beautiful IMAX trailer they put up together. <br/><br/>So the movie is about what happens in WW2 in 1940 where Germany invades France trapping military troops on the Dunkirk beach. But with the help of British forces and French forces, how they manage to get more than 300,000 soldiers evacuated and back home is basically what this film is about.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, this film was a phenomenon. How Nolan manages to present the Dunkirk evacuation in the film will keep you to the edge of your seat. The screenplay is very gripping and has that historical feel once you watch the film.<br/><br/>The acting is your ticket to a good money spender.<br/><br/>Fionn Whitehead's debut is everyone's treat. His role as the British pilot was fabulous and his nuanced performance is a must watch.<br/><br/>Harry Styles acting quite surprised me. I always thought of him as a music lover by but he is getting better and better. He was so self-balanced that he is ready to hit it big in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy surely had that scarecrow mentality which is not bad thing but his role as the soldier was something similar and not different but he was good but could've minority been better.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer is a must when it comes to orchestrated composition. The ticking score was something perfect and how it was composed in the film. The score for the tide and how it was depicted during the evacuation was great.<br/><br/>The cinematography was beautiful especially shooting it in an IMAX format which makes it more eye opening for the audience even surprisingly on how it was edited. <br/><br/>Please watch this in IMAX!!<br/><br/>4.5/5- Nolan can only satisfy a good weekend!!"
"shayor","10","9","18","29 July 2017"," A visual,immersive and emotional experience not to be missed
","Don't listen to the people who are kinda overwhelmed by the huge wave of positive response and feel the need to nitpick this movie.This movie is like Radiohead's Kid A,where we finally see Nolan come into his own.A war movie with a concept that is mostly original which is absolutely rare in this modern day and age of movies.Every one is saying how this movie lacks emotion,when i was in the theater, a lot of people were in tears including me.Even if you do not like this movie,this is a visual experience like no other.But i agree,if you do a little bit of research about the battle and the importance of it beforehand,this movie will make you think about it for days and days.This movie puts you in the soldier's places,immerses you and horrifies you.This movie also shows you what sacrifice the soldiers made for you and me.This movie also reflects life itself kinda.This is a must see,no questions asked."
"peder-66515","10","9","18","27 July 2017"," This movie is not really a movie, it is art, and this review will treat it as such.
","First of all this movie is not really an entertainment product. Therefore what you know about film is now invalid. In order to truly understand this film you must expect it to be nothing like a movie you know. If you do not, you will not be able to see this film for what it really is, let go of prejudice and comparisons, because they don't apply.<br/><br/>Step 2: Due to cultural heritage of movies, letting go can be tricky, especially if you are a younger viewer, whose knowledge about movies is based on the MCU. This is because of dialogue and especially the kind of dialogue you are used to in movies where people die and baddies are really powerful. You will not find any dialogue to paint the background of any character. It is widely understood that a character must be specially known in order to care about him or her. However, there is no point in making a flat generic cliché story to really understand that this character is really important, if you actually don't have unimportant people to begin with. Caring about a few people out of 400000 is actually if you think about it a little messed up. We humans are equally important when it comes to our lives. Usually promoting one soldier in a war movie and defining bad people is done through cannon fodder stand ins and mass murder on gigantic scale, or just crucifying key people. However, if you see things from a more sane perspective, all lives matter, and if you were one of them you might find that desperation makes you think about yourself as more important. Once you find something different that is then a reason why. If 400000 soldiers are desperate, and one need to go for the pack to survive what would you do were you one of them?<br/><br/>Step 3 - watch the movie: There are no soap opera scenes, you will experience that bullets are terrifying. But most importantly look not to dialogue but to actions and situation to understand what is going on, where do they look what are their motives behind this and that action, and finally listen to the environment. They say that an image says more than a thousand words, or as Batman would put it: It's not who I am underneath, but my actions that defines me. This is a movie where you are meant to feel and observe the full experience. Because this war movie is as real as they get. Forget about faces and look at them as anyone even yourself, understand that who Harry Styles and Tom Hardy are really don't matter. The point is exactly that you shouldn't be able to tell, as they are not meant to be important, they are all just people fighting for their lives. England already lost the battle, they need their soldiers home if they are to not lose the war too! Each soldier want to be the one who survives, thus important characters ruins the plot; anarchy. This movie is really a window into the past, and one which quite accurately actually show what happened. Which is truly astonishing and terrifying.<br/><br/>Before concluding, we must understand that time in this movie plays a central part, as the noose tightens, so does the 3 time-lines, which get more and more intertwined, this means more and more cuts, because each time line has a different time span. These cuts are made with care and the music gets more and more intense as we go, it really is something you won't appreciate fully until you have left the cinema! This movie also looks beautiful, but it has to be authentic if you are to believe you are there. It is very rare I sit in a cinema and actually get physically engaged, I don't really recall that happening, not even with cheap jump scares. This movie is psychologically really heavy on a subconscious level, and you really should think about pg-13 if your children are not mentally strong, but it takes an intelligent and adult mind to also truly grasp the horrors fully, war crimes are being committed and they are not imprinted in your subconscious disbelief that these things actually happened in real life, but the true horror is that they did. Acknowledging the care and effort the director put in this movie is the only fair thing to do... you may not like what you see for entertainment, but that's not really the point either! This is art, a TRUE master piece. This is something else, which is what in my eyes is the best movie ever made, outstanding and incomparable. It is like saying that Mona Lisa is better than the statue of David, it doesn't really make sense. You may like the painting more than the statue, but that doesn't mean that the statue is better. What makes this movie better than any other movie to me, is that the director cared and broke all rules, because he followed his own. This movie might not be for you, but if people don't feel connected to the horrors of this movie, they simply didn't know how to appreciate it. Thus the two opinions on this movie are those who didn't get the point and people who don't like what it is, and then those who loved it and can appreciate it for what it is, however there are most definitely those who think any movie by Christopher Nolan is a master piece, and I don't think they are honest to them selves. Dunkirk is a master piece, and thus by definition and its own rules it can only be 10/10... but a thing of which there are only one, it's both the best and the worst. Thanks for reading."
"mike3386","3","12","26","23 July 2017"," Nonsensical vs. Nonlinear
","Christopher Nolan's directorial style is described as nonlinear. The historical significance of this well-known World War II event apparently caused Nolan to make a movie with no discernible plot whatsoever, no story, no character development.<br/><br/>This mess is capped off with the worst sound I've heard in a movie in the last 10 years. I will acknowledge that I'm an aging movie fan; however, when no more than 25% of a movie's dialog is understandable – even at a modern theater – something is terribly wrong. The spoken words, most already with thick British accents, are virtually drowned out by a grindingly loud score, gun and cannon fire, explosions, and the sounds of war machines. Tom Hardy has a garbled delivery on his best acting day; with an oxygen mask and a wailing British Spitfire ever-present, the viewer is left to guess what he might be saying . . . AND HIS DIALOG IS SOME OF THE MOST UNDERSTANDABLE IN THE MOVIE!<br/><br/>Some of the plot, where there is any, is silly (it pains me to even use that word in conjunction with a discussion of such a momentous event in history). When fleeing soldiers discuss throwing one hapless Frenchman overboard to save a sinking – and relatively large – fishing trawler, I felt that I'd wandered into a teen flick. Frankly, some of the ""hero"" characters are simply unlikable, the two fleeing soldiers in particular.<br/><br/>Surely there was some saving grace, right? No, and don't for a minute compare this travesty to such fine war movies as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Pianist"", or ""Schindler's List"". The horrible sound and missing plot are accompanied by flat, washed out color (no doubt begging for Oscar attention), frequently fuzzy focusing probably meaning something to egghead critics, flat and shallow acting without discernible emotion – even when a young boy is accidentally and tragically killed, and scenes that are SUPPOSED to fit together but do not, e.g., darkness in one, daylight in another, back and forth, ad nauseam. <br/><br/>Good reviews? Yep, tons of them, many by dutiful Nolan fans stepping up to point out that the rest of us are stupid, unable to understand movie art. Movies with lots of pre-release hype and critical acclaim make me nervous, but hey, it's a war movie, how bad can it be? Ans. Very bad."
"yaserali-27606","10","12","26","22 July 2017"," A suspenseful movie with a lot of intensity.
","Christopher Nolan has crafted a masterpiece with a lot of intensity and suspense with three stories that depict the real life events of the Dunkirk evacuation. With a beautiful and spectacular music score from Hans Zimmer makes the movie even Enjoyable to watch and with Nolan's direction makes the movie intense and eccentric. The actors are brilliant especially Harry Styles who was incredible in the film, Fionn Whitehead, Tom Hardy and all the other actors who made the movie feel intense as possible. I do think that Christopher Nolan may get the Oscar nominee for Best Achievement in Directing as I think that he was the one that made this film intense and suspenseful as possible and that I do think that he deserves and If he does win then everything will start to make sense right.<br/><br/>Watch this movie NOW!!! only in the Morning not in the afternoon there will be a lot of people waiting to see the movie in the afternoon."

"DKosty123","5","10","21","26 July 2017"," Seriously Disappointing
","Considering that Christopher Nolan wrote Inception and that was a technical masterpiece and an intelligent script, this film is a major let down from that movie. I like the concept of retelling one of the most major rescues in the history of civilization, but it could have been much better than this one. There are a few problems with the film I saw, and some of them are major technical flaws.<br/><br/>I liked the telling of he same events from different eyes. What I did not care for was the sudden jolts from daytime scenes to night scenes which did not make any sense in telling the story that happened during the first 3/4's of the film. Somehow, day should have been day and night should have been night. Take that and the going from Spitfires in the air in daylight straight to night sequences, and the continuity of the film becomes wrecked for me as a viewer. <br/><br/>Then there is the sequence of the men getting into the beached ship to wait for the tide to come in. There is almost no logic in this one. Hiding inside a ship waiting like sitting ducks is just not logical. When the ship starts getting used for target practice and they just stay in the boat like sitting ducks is just plain stupid. The sequence is even less logical than the long sequence inside the tank in the WW2 film FURY done a few short years ago.<br/><br/>There is little story in this as the director (Nolan) has very little dialogue in the first half of the film. While the film as a whole does make the history clear of the desperation of the situation, and the rescue, it could have been done much more spectacularly with the advent of CGI. The number of private ships actually shown coming into Dunkirk to rescue 300,000 troops is much too small. Without CGI, The Longest Day many years ago did a better job of creating an armada on screen than this film does.<br/><br/>The air combat scenes are great, but I am kind of curious why prop planes, Spitfire pilots, needed to wear oxygen masks on their faces? Most of the time these planes did not fly as high as jet fighters where such masks would be needed. Maybe it is to help the film maker here not allow the audience to get attached to any cast member. That goal this film certainly accomplishes. There are few women in the cast though Miranda Nolan, Christopher Nolans Cousin does make another appearance in his work, her 10th film role, as a nurse.<br/><br/>The main emotion displayed throughout the film is the patriotic cheering of people on the ground who seem to be able to see what is going on better than the film viewers. There is a lot of cheering for an army withdrawal of defeated soldiers just desperate to escape. With the exception of the opening sequence, most of the battle scenes are on the ocean. The Nazi Germans are almost invisible the entire film except for the German fighter and bomber planes in the air. <br/><br/>There is a lot of action drama here, and at the end the rescued are riding on a train and reading Churchill's most famous speech in the newspaper. ""We shall never surrender."" Considering the genius Nolan has shown in his other films, this one does not measure up on all the levels I have pointed out and more. Even the true Historian should be let down on how this one was told. The film has many technical flaws and needed to have a consultant to get the technical stuff right, but now that World War 2 is more than 70 years in our rear-view mirror, nearly 75 years since Dunkirk, those kind of people just are not around anymore.<br/><br/>I wish this film would have matched the advertising and hype, but if this truly the best film this summer, Hollywood is not having a good year at all. The emotions this film try to stir come up hollow."
"zardoz-13","5","10","21","25 July 2017"," Humdrum World War II Heroics
","Traditional armchair generals should know that director Christopher Nolan's World War II epic ""Dunkirk"" has little to do with the battle of Dunkirk. You won't see German Panzer Corps careening through Belgium and bulldozing into France. In fact, the only Germans in ""Dunkirk"" are either flying planes or show up as foot soldiers from undetermined units. Basically, ""Dunkirk"" breaks the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces (B.E.F.) up into three sections: one on land that covers one week, one on sea that covers one day, and one in the air that covers one hour. Of course, much, much, more occurred at Dunkirk than just the massive evacuation. Presumably, the ""Dark Knight"" filmmaker did not want to overextend himself a standard-issue battle extravaganza. ""Dunkirk"" was produced for $100-million, with probably millions more for simply publicity. So, if you're looking for something like ""The Longest Day"" (1962), ""Battle of the Bulge"" (1965), ""Anzio"" (1968), ""A Bridge Too Far"" (1977), ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" (2016), prepare to be disappointed. ""Dunkirk"" doesn't recreate historic battlefield firefights, not even the infamous Wormhoudt Massacre where Waffen-SS soldiers of the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler slaughtered as many as 80 British soldiers along with some French POWs. The SS crowded their prisoners into a stable, tossed in stick-grenades, and then finished them off with bursts of machine gun fire. Something like this might have given ""Dunkirk"" greater dramatic gravity. Instead, we see neither German tanks nor troops storming through France and Belgium like devils. This 107-minute movie boils down to a series of survival episodes that occurred strictly at Dunkirk. Notably, the RAF preferred to confine their resources largely to the island in preparation for the inevitable Battle of Britain, later made into the exemplary film the ""Battle of Britain"" (1969). Aside from the RAF, the Royal Navy and the Small Boat Owners are the heroes who rescued the BEF waiting impatiently on the beach.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" opens with several British infantrymen wandering down a road inside the Dunkirk city limits as the Luftwaffe drops propaganda leaflets. No sooner have they had a moment to glance these surrender summons than gunfire breaks out from an unknown source. As they scramble for cover, unseen shooters kill all except Tommy (newcomer Fionn Whitehead), who crosses a street and comes under fire from French troops. They wave him toward their lines, and later he saunters onto the beaches. As far as he can see, queues of troops are standing on the beach awaiting transport. ""Spectre"" lenser Hoyte Van Hoytema's atmospheric cinematography shows these soldiers in their brown uniforms standing like sitting ducks in a row on white beaches. These scenes resemble something out of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in all their sprawling immensity. Indeed, Van Hoytema's cinematography adds to the spectacle. Not long afterward, as Tommy tours the beach, screaming Stuka dive-bombers plunge from the skies like murderous seagulls on a beach teeming with baby turtles and do similar damage on a grand scale. The worst death in ""Dunkirk"" happens when bombs create marching explosions that blast a British soldier to smithereens as he shoots at the plane. Tommy meets another soldier under mysterious circumstances on the beach. Might he be a German saboteur? Without challenging him about his odd behavior, Tommy pitches in to help. They become fast friends who try to break the rules and the lines so they can get aboard a transport. Cheekily, they seize a stretcher case awaiting transport and scramble to an embarkation station. They reach the ship at the last minute, but they are denied access because they were Red Cross personnel. Nolan has these two heading off to find passage elsewhere by other means. Their exploits turn into shenanigans as they confront one setback after another, even after they get aboard a ship.<br/><br/>Although the RAF lost fewer planes than the Luftwaffe: 145 to 156, ""Dunkirk"" shows no more than six Spitfire fighters cruising the English Channel in search of prey. Again, budgetary concerns may explain the aircraft shortages. Also, Nolan doesn't go for too much CGI, so he resorted to cardboard cutouts of troops on the beach. Nevertheless, we get one hour's worth of the RAF giving the Luftwaffe literal Hell. Predictably, one pilot perishes in a crash, another ditches in the sea, but the third is far more fortunate. RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"") shoots up the Luftwaffe in ""Dunkirk's"" most exciting scenes. Christopher Nolan does a decent job of staging several tense scenes of soldiers confronting catastrophe. Unfortunately, aside from Tom Hardy's RAF pilot, Kenneth Branagh's Naval officer (who never endangered), Mark Rylance as a civilian sailor, and Cillian Murphy as the shell-shocked soldier, no celebrity movie stars of prominence. Indeed, most of the actors are unknown, except perhaps for ""One-Direction"" singer Harry Styles. Suspense works best when a character is conspicuous enough either as an actor or a character for us to care about. Everybody is virtually a nobody in ""Dunkirk."" Meantime, evoking sympathy for soldiers so desperate that they take refuge in a beached ship and become targets seems like the province of a horror chiller. Quoting the cliché, they die like fish in a barrel during target practice. Indeed, two soldiers trapped in the boat are the same who have tried to board transports. Oscar winning actor Mark Rylance has one of the better roles as a small boat owner who has already lost a son in the RAF. The episode with the shell-shocked soldier involving the inconsequential treatment of a civilian teen is the least savory scene. Nevertheless, Rylance's character is never in jeopardy. Often wearing an aviator's oxygen mask, Tom Hardy looks like the villainous Bane from Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" but he comes closest to being a blood and guts hero. Ultimately, despite its heartfelt tribute to British resiliency in the face of annihilation, ""Dunkirk"" qualifies as a routine war movie."
"AlsExGal","8","6","11","23 September 2017"," Nolan simply made an epic film about survival...
","... and it worked! At least for me. Now for a few words about that Nolan style in this film.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan wants to have his cake and eat it too, and he's been successful enough that he's one of the very few directors who gets the opportunity to do so anymore, in a franchise world where the auteur theory is dead and producers are way more important than directors (witness Kathleen Kennedy firing the Lord brothers from the Han Solo movie because they were actually attempting to impose a personal vision upon it, something the Star Wars franchise will never allow any director to do ever).<br/><br/>Nolan wants to work in super-mainstream genres: super-heroes, war, science fiction. But he wants his product also to be very self-consciously and in-your-face artistic. He sets up little rules for each movie and he plays by them, and it's up to the viewers to figure them out.<br/><br/>There are three main story lines in Dunkirk, and each one unspools over a different frame of time. So, the Harry Styles story line covers one week of time, the Mark Rylance story line covers one day, and the Tom Hardy story line covers only one hour! This information is provided to us at the beginning of the movie. There is a title card that reads ""1. The Mole: One Week"". This is supposed to tell us that this particular story line in the movie is going to cover one week. But I spent 15 seconds thinking, ""One week? What does that mean?"" before there was so much shooting I got caught up in the action on-screen and didn't think about the title card for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>It wasn't until later that I was enlightened as to Nolan's intent. I am accustomed to movies tinkering with time concepts, yet I didn't get that this movie was playing around with time for the entirety of the time that I watched it. I was like, man, Tom Hardy has been in that plane for a really unrealistic amount of time! I'm just arrogant enough to think that if I didn't get the time tricks, then I'm guessing most of the viewers of Dunkirk didn't get, or didn't even notice, all this jumping around in time. Doesn't really distract from one's enjoyment of the movie, unless you stop to think about Tom Hardy still being in that plane ...<br/><br/>Other extremely self-consciously artistic Nolan choices: no German soldier's face is ever seen clearly in the entire movie. Also, the violence is very self-consciously bloodless and sanitary. Nolan has said he wanted the movie to be about rescue and heroism; not war and violence.<br/><br/>There's also a ticking stopwatch motif playing on the soundtrack virtually the entire movie. Nolan's call or Hans Zimmer's, I don't know. The stopwatch features very prominently in the trailers, but I didn't know it was also going to run for the duration of the movie, as well.<br/><br/>If everything I have written seems like I didn't like the film, let me say that is not true. I get that Nolan could have made a conventional war movie, but he took a home run swing and went with something much more experimental, and I thought his reasoning for this was pretty clear by the end: this is NOT a classic ""hero's plot arc"" story. It just doesn't fit that mold. You could see in the conclusion that most of the fighters felt like cowards and failures. To paraphrase Churchill, you don't win wars by retreating. And, yet, there was a humble, understated glory in this moment. This was a movie about duty above all else - just many small people doing the small things asked of them."
"Turfseer","5","6","11","4 August 2017"," Standard action scenes predominate over character development as Nolan views rescue at Dunkirk as more tragic than uplifting
","I haven't seen the original ""Dunkirk"" film which came out in 1958, but of what I know of that plot the main focus is on a British troop's battle against the Germans before they arrive at Dunkirk, with the rescue at the beach as the stirring climax. Christopher Nolan rejected that whole approach and decided that all the action should be centered around the events that occurred at Dunkirk proper—hence, we never see one German during the entire film.<br/><br/>I am forced to argue that Nolan's approach is wrong-headed and despite his signature visual acumen, Dunkirk (2017) ultimately lacks punch. What happened at Dunkirk simply doesn't lend itself to much drama. Since the British were stranded on the beach and were unable to take any pro-active steps against the encroaching enemy, they basically played the role of ""sitting ducks"" until their miracle deliverance. Nolan's best scenes involve the British troops, unable to take cover on the beach, or lined up like sardines on the ""mole"" as they're unmercifully cut down by Luftwaffe pilots. The sense of fear is truly palpable as the defenseless men have nowhere to go.<br/><br/>It's the attendant fear, masterfully conveyed by Nolan, that grips us in the early part of the picture. But soon the scenes of dive bombing destruction give way to more conventional war action tropes, involving the sinking of various boats (the scenes of drowning victims are reminiscent of scenes from Titanic). In the middle of the action is one of the protagonists, Tommy, a British private, who survives two sinkings of boats intended to ferry the soldiers across the Channel—one boat is destroyed from the air and the other torpedoed.<br/><br/>Soon Nolan has Tommy along with a number of his confederates hook up with some Scottish soldiers who find a grounded fishing trawler in what I'm told (by Wikipedia) is the ""intertidal zone outside of the Allied perimeter."" Would soldiers have actually left the perimeter and put themselves at risk, with the unlikely hope of being able to get the trawler to float? And where do those unseen Germans come from who end up taking target practice? Somehow the soldiers inside the trawler miraculously escape being killed by machine gun fire. <br/><br/>The trawler sinks too but not before Gibson, a French soldier masquerading as British, gets tangled in some chains inside the trawler, and drowns. Nolan is determined to continually reiterate his ""wall is hell"" theme and serves up one additional destruction of a boat—this time Tommy and fellow soldier Alex surviving the destruction of a minesweeper —only to be rescued by a pleasure craft manned by its civilian captain Davidson, along with his teenage son Peter, and Peter's friend, George.<br/><br/>Davidson's saga forms the second in a triptych of stories, this time focusing on one of the hundreds of pleasure crafts conscripted by the British to sail across the Channel and save the beleaguered troops. In this tale, Davidson picks up a shell-shocked RAF pilot who's just been shot down by the Germans and wouldn't you know it, he can't handle the idea that they're headed right back into harm's way at the beaches of Dunkirk. Basically the pilot freaks out, hits poor George in the head while Davidson and son are trying to calm him down, and the poor kid sustains a severe head injury and ends up (as later reported in the local press) a ""casualty of war."" All of this unlikely turn of events seems rather heavy-handed or forced if you will, but Nolan is determined again to remind us that Dunkirk was more tragic than something to celebrate about.<br/><br/>The third story is told from the perspective of three RAF pilots who do battle with their Luftwaffe counterparts out above the open sea. It's noteworthy that the action takes place far from where the troops are stranded, none of whom who are able to appreciate the sacrifices the pilots make. (Since the pilots couldn't be in all places at once, they were unable to stop some of the dive bombers responsible for the all the carnage we see at the beginning of the film.) Hence, a familiar query was sounded after the battle with the troops asking the pilots, ""where were you?""<br/><br/>Nolan's attention to detail is evident in the battle scenes in the air. But after a while, it feels a bit perfunctory and one longs for some character development in place of one plane being shot down after another. Nolan continues to commit himself to a non-glamorous view of war—when the last pilot runs out of fuel and sets his plane down—he ends up burning it so it won't fall into the hands of the enemy. And the pilot ultimately is taken prisoner (again no heroics).<br/><br/>In addition to lack of character development, Dunkirk suffers from the lack of a visible antagonist. Instead of the Germans, war itself becomes the antagonist and the film becomes more a generic anti-war film than a film rooted in history. If there were real heroes here, Nolan ignores them. Those would be the French troops who fought the Germans inland, to give the British time to put their rescue mission into action.<br/><br/>If you like seeing ships being bombed or torpedoed, scenes of men drowning, the unlikely death of a civilian at the hands of a shell-shocked soldier as well as a series of somewhat repetitious aerial battles, all presented on a non-linear time line, Dunkirk might be for you. <br/><br/>Ultimately I understand what Nolan is driving at—that in the larger context, the rescue at Dunkirk was still part of the overall tragedy of war. All well and good but the tragedy is conveyed through a series of standard war scenes without character development, so necessary for compelling drama."
"johnclark-1","4","6","11","2 August 2017"," Where's a Narrative with Connected Tissue?
","Mr. Nolan thinks that he can break the basic rules of story telling without fear because, well, he is Christopher Nolan.<br/><br/>One of the first rules is you have to CARE about your leading characters. Does this happen here? Did we ever get to know anything about the characters' character? No. We look at the thin-lipped dour-faced fave of British drama, the Right Hon, no, Lord, not yet, Sir, Kenneth Branagh.

"jrarichards","9","6","11","29 July 2017"," Strives successfully for grimly realistic portrayal of war, but still leaves ""the Dunkirk Spirit"" strengthened
","We watched Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" as maybe the only Brits in a cinema in a country for which consequences and memories of ""the War"" are different. For them this was another WW2 depiction, for us an examination, not just of the reality of war, but also of a British legend, and Britishness itself. There were fewer tears in surrounding eyes than in mine.<br/><br/>For ""Dunkirk"" is indeed a moving experience, but also - rightly - a powerful, shocking one - so much so that I felt moist eyes might give way to a full-scale blub even 10 minutes on from the credits. <br/><br/>Few films achieve such a two-level emotional impact.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" is epic in spite of itself, but this is no ""The Longest Day"". But then the latter was portraying an advance towards victory, while Dunkirk was - as Churchill noted - a severe defeat - and equipment-less retreat - that made any subsequent victory look far less plausible. In the film, we are reminded of the toughly correct decision to hold back some ships and planes ... in anticipation of the next blow.<br/><br/>Yet - again unavoidably - Nolan's presentation captures the spontaneous (and hyper-British) emergence of feelings of pride and joy and relief at being reunited, in some sense ""safe"" with ""our boys"" on our beautiful and (comparatively) tranquil island once again. The end segments of the film are done perfectly - all is understated, entirely unjingoistic, deeply affecting as a visceral solidarity suffuses us, even as the returnees themselves feel unsure of themselves.<br/><br/>The main body of ""Dunkirk"" resembles that ending in being ""of few words"", as Nolan intended, but also differs. Patriotism is pared down, nuanced, mostly down to vaguely ""running commentary""-like remarks from Sir Mark Rylance in his role as a captain of one of those little ships, ""Mr Dawson"" - as based on a figure whose taped voice lives on at the Imperial War Museum. While a 1930s boat is filmed, it WAS NOT a Dunkirk participant, though other shown vessels WERE. <br/><br/>Dawson's voyage crystallises the ""sea"" component of a ""land, sea and air"" configuration that Nolan deploys, to hint at what the British Army was doing on land, the RAF in the air, and the Royal Navy plus other craft (800 in all, with up to 60 apparently portrayed in the film) on those 25-odd miles of sea separating a Bosch-like vision of hell from ""home"". <br/><br/>We are warned at the outset that these stories run to different time-frames, but enigmatic information given so soon will probably go unabsorbed by most. In fact, the RAF chunk actually (faithfully) reflects a 1-hour mission, while Dawson is taking a day to cross the Channel, and the lads are at Dunkirk for a week...<br/><br/>This ""separation by elements"" at least might seem clear-cut, but is not, as the different media and forces keep interacting, with this just adding to the sense of fluidity ... and chaos. Nowhere is really safe; water might seem better than an exposed beach, but is cold, can even burn and can fill a cosy dry place in seconds; bullets enter boats stuck on land; ships and soldiers fire at planes; planes strafe ships and soldiers; planes come down on sea or land; soldiers walk into water, come back out and then wade in again... <br/><br/>Given the nearly-340,000 rescued in real life, as set against the few thousands that died, Nolan's film might seems a bit death-obsessed; but what we see - perhaps more than in any other war film - is how random choices, attempts to ""beat the system"", just being in the wrong place, can mean death, while others live on in chance fashion. <br/><br/>As the above sentence hints, plenty of less-than-noble behaviour is shown. There's some Army-Navy solidarity, but we also watch ratings abandon ship while soldiers are stuck below. There is also Army-Airforce resentment (""Where were you?"", asks a young soldier - well the RAF had indeed been there (flying 2739 fighter sorties over 9 days), and the film makes their risks and sacrifices clear - with real planes used in the film-making; and history tells that 106 of those precious assets were lost (to 262 enemy aircraft)). There is even tension between soldiers of different units, as well as an incident in which a panicked soldier (accidentally) kills a civilian, etc.<br/><br/>A counterbalance here is Sir Kenneth Branagh's mostly cool and gritty ""Commander Bolton"" character, alluding to real-life hero James Clouston - a Canadian-born RN Officer and ""Pier-Master"", who indeed spent days on ""the Mole"". Hopefully, the Branagh portrayal also pays homage to Clouston's boss, Capt. Tennant, who patrolled the beach with his megaphone for days (and perhaps even to the great Admiral Ramsay, in overall charge of the Naval operation then, as also at D Day). Notwithstanding ""the Little Ships"", Dunkirk was a Royal Navy show, God bless it...<br/><br/>Indeed, one is overall swept up by a growing wonder at Operation Dynamo, in spite of the many smaller-scale ugly incidents depicted. The desperation, lack of thought, inability to see the big picture and sheer fear that overcome young and often inexperienced military personnel at the given moment are made clear, and we in our comfortable cinema seats must be ready to forgive. Cleverly, the Rylance character (for noble enough reasons) also consciously overlooks misconduct he's seen, in order to start building the Dunkirk legend. <br/><br/>And, even if we do know how selfishly and crudely certain individuals behaved at given moments, doesn't that merely offer enrichment in terms of truth and reality? <br/><br/>Hence Nolan's great achievement with ""Dunkirk"" would seem to be to offer realism of setting and equipment and behaviour in his vignettes, to shock and move us more than ever before with the manmade debacle that was Dunkirk; and yet to leave us more convinced than ever as to the manmade miracle."

"virek213","10","8","16","2 August 2017"," Revisiting DUNKIRK
","British director Christopher Nolan is known for being an individualist when it comes to the films he does. Although he is known for doing ""commercial"" films like BATMAN BEGINS, THE DARK KNIGHT, and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, many others have seen a more complex side to Mr. Nolan with such psychological thrillers as 2000's MEMENTO; 2002's INSOMNIA; and 2010's INCEPTION, as well as his 2014 science fiction epic INTERSTELLAR (a film to be placed up there with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY). Now, in 2017, he tackles the dark subject of the early part of World War II in DUNKIRK.<br/><br/>The film essentially ties five different plot lines into the evacuation of French, Dutch, and British soldiers from the French city of Dunkirk in the late spring of 1940 as the German army is about to sweep in and annihilate them. This includes, among other things, British civilians evacuating as many soldiers as they can on the dangerous English Channel crossing, including one portrayed in usual brilliant low-key style by Mark Rylance. Apart from the appearances of Rylance; Kenneth Branagh as an English commander; and Harry Styles as one of the British soldiers caught up in the horror of this battle, most of the actors are young and anonymous types convincingly portraying average people caught up in an apocalypse that threatens to engulf not only England and Europe, but the entire human race. In an era where linear spectacle is the order of the day, Nolan does just the opposite, intertwining several different strands into one complete film, with a maximum amount of visual spectacle, but also putting this battle into focus in a mere hour and fifty minutes. While Nolan doesn't go into the graphic horror of the opening D-Day invasion of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, he nevertheless makes the tension palpable the entire time.<br/><br/>Nolan wisely doesn't explain all that much, which is what any good filmmaker, especially if he has written and directed the film (as is the case here), should do. This is what makes DUNKIRK a compelling film, and a sure contender for one of the best films of 2017."
"josedumpy","10","8","16","31 July 2017"," Beautiful, Intense, and HOPE
","Christopher Nolan brought out a movie about a British story that children grew up with. A story that not just one person could solve an issue. That people together have to gather up and solve the issue as a group. Dunkirk is not an ordinary movie. It is a war experience. It is the most realistic war film ever. Dialogue is sprinkled in the film. In all seriousness it is not needed. Soldiers are on that beach are emotionally unstable. How could people talk when the don't even know what they are feeling. If these soldiers see a plane in the sky. It was a 50/50 chance if it was going to bomb them or save them. The movie is intense. With Han's Zimmer's beautiful original score, dialogue between the faces of people, the spitfires, and so much more this movie has you on the edge of your seat. Because Christopher Nolan uses another realistic element in war. No one ever knows what is going to happen. You are looking at the screen never knowing what is actually going to happen. The soldiers from the mole are in a roller coaster of luck. They go through several moments where they are the luckiest people alive to moments where they probably walked under several ladders or broken a million mirrors. Their luck was horrifyingly bad. But in reality nothing is fair. These soldiers used what they had and tried to get back home. This film shows that humans will grasp at anything for a few more seconds to survive. This movie is based on hope. It's a movie that shows that humans can not move forward with out it. It shows that even if humans have a 1% chance of surviving they will take that 1% because it's better then .5%. Courage from all of those people like Mr. Dawns who went through the English channel just to save people who they don't even know is a characteristic of humans. This movie really shows that even though there is so much controversy that humans are the worst. That we destroy our own home. We have a natural gift of being evil. That we betray our own kind. That at the end we still have good in our hearts. That deep down we would help those who are in trouble. That all of us are moles. That dirt are our problems and difficulties. Humans are moles who dig through the dirt blind and reach the surface. The surface is our HOME."

"lorenzruwwe","10","8","16","30 July 2017"," Dunkirk - a lesson in empathy
","Just a few thoughts after seeing the movie (spoiler free):<br/><br/>This movie is an important one. It achieves something that not a lot of war movies can. Which is staying objective and not using (or exploiting) the perils and real suffering of men fighting in war for the mere sake of dramatization. Dunkirk is based on historical events. It should not be expected to please or entertain. Think about it: Why would you look at something like war and use it for entertainment? That is just wrong. I read a lot of reviews by people who criticized the film due to its lack of 'characters'. Well, this movie has actual humans. Are they telling me they can only feel something when they can identify with a character? If they know their backstory and if they are portrayed in a sympathetic way? ""There was no emotion in the film?"" ""It wasn't romanticized?"" Well, then maybe that is a problem with the viewer and not the film (there is always Pearl Harbor.. :v). And for the record, my initial reaction was also one of being a bit underwhelmed, maybe mostly because I expected something different, a narrative type of movie. I was waiting for some gripping storyline, action sequences and fleshed out characters etc, too. (And I will always love Saving Private Ryan) After the film ended my wife quickly said that it is her favourite Nolan film which then made me think twice about it. This film requires the viewer to have true empathy. To feel for another human being that you don't know and might not have anything in common with. It teaches us what actual unbiased empathy is. If you tell a war movie in a subjective way and create favorable and unfavorable characters you're mostly creating division. Why is one soldier's death more tragic than another?<br/><br/>I appreciated that the Germans were 'faceless'. They were the enemy in this case, yes. But they weren't painted in an exaggerated, Hollywood-style demeaning way so as to create animosity towards them. The viewer isn't made to feel hatred. The Germans were simply the historical opposing faction.<br/><br/>This objectivity is nicely reflected in the outstanding cinematography which used many wide shots and aerial establishing shots to show the global action. It focused more on the group, and not so much the individual. It also beautifully showed their movement in a given space. This objectivity demonstrates why Dunkirk wasn't really about individual people or characters, but the bigger group, the bigger picture, as seen in a historical context. (Oh, and dat 70mm film, mmmhh) If you look at the events of Dunkirk and what meaning they had for the outcome of WWII and maybe even history, it becomes more clear to choose an objective lens to portray these events in an unbiased way and from an elevated viewpoint. You are literally seeing history unfold from afar. I had one gripe with the film, which was the constant soundtrack playing. There were no moments of silence but that's just a personal nitpick. This is the type of movie they will probably show in history class and should. -Some real cinematic piece of art."

"eonbluedan-1","10","8","16","29 July 2017"," Staggering cinema. Not ""getting it"" is very much on you...
","It' s 1940, 400,000 allied troops are cornered and cut off on the beaches of Dunkirk; with the enemy closing in, and no cover or defence, they await annihilation or a miracle. We experience the moment as the characters do, without unnecessary exposition or dialogue! This proves quite the departure for Nolan; there is a lot here that owes more to silent cinema than anything else, but his images often say all that needs to be said.<br/><br/>An opening frame invites us to join a group of soldiers. Next, the loudest onslaught of gunfire kicks the film into another gear. We are given as much pause for thought as the soldiers we follow. We run with Tommy, played here by a Fionn Whitehead, and like him, we are aware of comrades falling dead next to us, but it is all panic and no time; we will lament their loss later. Set to the ticking of a watch, we feel Tommy's heart pounding with ours, and we know the tone for this audacious movie has been set.<br/><br/>We see the event from different perspectives and from within different time frames. Right now, not many directors can build momentum like Nolan. The jumping to and from different characters' point of view, the corkscrewing impression of the editing, events echoed and mirrored by Hans Zimmer's Shepherd's Tones and persistent, all enveloping score, acting at times more like sound design than music; it all results in a constant rise in tension, to the point of almost being exhaustive.<br/><br/>This said, the editing also serves another purpose. The ""Miracle of Dunkirk"" is a grand story, with every soldier, every pilot, and every civilian having their own point of view. Nolan wants us to build up an overall picture of the event purely through subjective experience, so of course we spend a tiring week with the terrified boys. Of course we spend a desperate day with a fisherman as he and his familial crew sail their way into action. Lastly, given the fuel constraints of the RAF, whose decisions had to be immediate and impulsive, always a choice between defending the beach or getting home, why would we spend any more that an edge-of-your-seat, quickly-cut hour in the cockpit of a Spitfire, as they do their duty and enter into dogfights to keep the German aircraft at bay? Each timeline is contracted or dilated to give everybody equal measure and importance, whilst staying true to and very much in their situation. Yes, this means we're kept on our toes; we have moments of confusion as timelines cross over and we see the same thing happening from another point of view, but as we head into the finale, as well as the aforementioned tension and release (which is just exciting cinema), we also get to see how, despite very different perspectives, everyone was working together, and how sacrifice and struggle for duty were par for the course for all involved, whether other people knew it or not. It is important that we the audience recognise this bigger picture, and as everything clicks together in an emotive final convergence of efforts, we not only see the justification for the techniques adopted, but struggle to imagine the story told another way. That is, at least, without going down a standard route, with objective storytelling employed.<br/><br/>A proper review not being complete without comment on the elephant in the room, it must be said that Harry Styles does not stand out like the proverbial sore thumb at all. Frankly, he carries his scenes with aplomb, and surely, following the Heath Ledger lesson, and now this, it is time we learned that, maybe, Christopher Nolan just knows what he's doing better that we do? As to the other big names, there are moments from that remain with me so long after having seen it: Kenneth Brannagh and Mark Rylance can say so much with so little, their faces and gestures doing the heavy lifting to deliver a lot of the human emotion, and it would appear Tom Hardy has Oscar-worthy eyes! You need see nothing more through the course of his drama to have a complete sense of the type of man his Farrier is. We talk about great acting and achieving realism through imagination, but with the knowledge that Nolan actually took everyone to Dunkirk, sank real ships, sailed real ships, flew real Spitfires overhead, employed real explosions on the beach, and even rejected green screen and CGI in favour of cardboard cut-outs, it seems imagination wasn't too necessary for these already consummate actors.<br/><br/>Nolan's principle fan base will be well prepared for what they get; but with his insistence on holding back from the audience any perspective not afforded his characters, ala 'Memento', some knowledge of the ""Miracle Of Dunkirk"" might put the more casual viewer in better stead. Regardless of which camp you fall into, or indeed of whether or not the movie does it for you, certain things are for sure: With no melodrama or cheese, and no superfluous fluff or emotional subterfuge, 'Dunkirk' is a purely experiential movie, a technical marvel of a war film unlike any other I can name. It also stands as a beacon in Nolan's career, characterised by his desire to cultivate an audience willing to keep up with him. And perhaps most importantly, this is a key moment in world history that is often overlooked; a disaster averted which, had it not been, would have seen the history books written very differently. That this event has been marshalled by a confident and sincere director, who has surely by now cemented his name alongside those of his own heroes, is reason enough to see 'Dunkirk'."
"ctowyi","10","8","16","28 July 2017"," This is a great war film because of the things it didn't do.
","Dunkirk was literally my third war movie at the cinema in a roll. It started with War for the Planet of the Apes, which was one of the most evocative and unsettling human war films I have seen. It was followed by a Japanese anime, In This Corner of the World, an exquisite time-capsule of a movie, which showed me a new way the harrowing story of Hiroshima could be told. Then there was Dunkirk and what a film this is. I can't remember the last time I sat in stunned silence as the end-credits rolled, my mind awashed with the feeling that I have touched greatness. This is not just an excellent film, it is a great war film and it is great because of the things it didn't do.<br/><br/>A word search of ""dunkirk"" in IMDb threw up 19 entries! (N-n-n-nineteen in the metallic voice of Paul Hardcastle's 19 ðŸ˜¬) I had no idea the evacuation of Dunkirk became the inspiration of so many films and documentaries. First up, Christopher Nolan didn't need to serve up a history lesson again. A few simple opening sentences give context and we are thrown into the deep end. Dunkirk is about men trying to survive into the next hour with the onslaught of danger coming from every conceivable angle, plain and simple. It is how Nolan goes about showcasing it that is sheer masterclass.<br/><br/>When was the last time you saw a war film without someone screaming jingoistic slogans in your face or not seeing a scene of a conflicted protagonist trying to justify the reason for war? When was the last time you not see scenes of carnage and human viscera? When was the last time you not see the face of the enemy in a fire-fight? These are practically the foundation of which the war genre is built on, but Dunkirk never treads the path of familiarity. Heck! It doesn't even have a single drop of blood (the bloodied bandage on the wounded soldier is not counted ðŸ˜Š). But yet the tension is so nerve-wrecking, the fear so real that I gripped the armrests for dear life and I thought I forget to breathe for over an hour.<br/><br/>The dialogue is so spare and functional, it might as well have been a silent film with sound effects, but yet my entire being was transfixed on the big screen, ogling at the spellbinding vistas of war from the land, air and sea. The characters, what characters, are nameless, but yet their fear is so palpable they are instantly relatable. The heroics of ordinary folks is monumental but never felt emotionally manipulative. The cinematography is astonishing, recreating the combat of WWII so marvellously. I felt like I was running with the hapless soldiers or trapped in a God forsaken place praying for deliverance.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's music score is an interesting detour from the usual soundtracks of blockbusters. It has no recognisable melody or an infectious refrain that will cement itself into your consciousness. It is largely monochromatic, like a few repetitive notes linked together, but by golly it worked. This is a score that makes absolute no sense when you play on your hi-fi system, but together with what transpires on screen the music feels larger than life, building that suspense to a mind-blowing crescendo. IMHO the music and the action share a symbiotic relationship, each element helping the other to create the biggest impact. On its own it wouldn't have worked as well, but together, it is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>There are some superb films I have seen this year, but so far there is only one great film â€“ Dunkirk. Throw away all you think you know about war films and immerse yourself in the biggest possible screen (that would be the IMAX and it is worth every cent) and feel the crushing blow of grim defeat. Next year's Oscars may be far away, but I am willing to bet my bottom dollar that the Academy will remember this big time."
"mayri-39910","Null","8","16","21 July 2017"," Major Disappointment
","Been looking forward to Dunkirk to come out forever (since there were trailers for months). Love this director and his other works. What a disappointment in so many ways. Without dropping a spoiler, the story telling has a complex structure. If you don't understand it, the rest of the movie is mostly confusing. I felt kind of dumb when my friend explained it to me after the movie. He's an expert in military history and it took him half the film to figure it out. <br/><br/>I also love Hans Zimmer and can listen to hours of his work (and do). This score could leave one with PTSD. Rather than let the story induce an emotional response, the music is overbearing, telling us what to feel. Personally I got that this was a tense situation, and I didn't need fingers on the chalkboard music to tell me that.<br/><br/>Then there's the characters. It is sometimes impossible to distinguish one British soldier from another (apparently, they were all the same height with the same hair color and same haircut). For me the only compelling part of the story was that of a family on one of the civilian rescue boats. Excellent acting and story telling there. However, Kenneth Branagh, another favorite, either forgot what a brilliant actor he is, or was extremely limited by the script and director. His primary job seemed to be standing in one spot,looking well dressed, with no emotion, and appearing nothing like his dirty, desperate, exhausted, hungry and thirsty soldiers.<br/><br/>There is some good in the movie especially the photography. But, I can't remember when I have been so disappointed by a film. I seem to be in the minority here. But, please, please don't give Best Picture to this movie."
"Christopher_Reid","10","11","24","25 July 2017"," Relentless, realistic, unforgettable
","I'm a huge Nolan fan. Almost all of his films are in the IMDb top 250 and deservedly so if you ask me. Dunkirk lives up to his high standards but it's different from anything he's done before, including the fact that it's based on real events (during World War II no less).<br/><br/>It's a pure movie. It captures events as accurately as possible with little artistic ""interpretation"". The enemy acts like the shark in Jaws or the Joker in The Dark Knight, they appear at any time, without a face, and cause havoc, fear and destruction. The planes in particular are terrifying as they scream from afar and get 10 times louder when they pass overhead, dropping bombs or strafing along the way. The soldiers drop in anticipation. Most of them get back up once it's gone. Also, it captures the loudness of the bullets and explosions in a way that I think hasn't been done before. It's in-your-face from the beginning.<br/><br/>Many films try to affect us by having characters *emote* and tell us their thoughts and feelings. Nolan understands that evoking emotions is really about creating striking images and situations with characters we can relate to. No-one screams out ""NOOOO!"" or sobs as a friend says their last words. It's like classical music in its restraint. The movie is emotion-less in a way but I found it powerful and moving. I don't need ""sad music"" and melodramatic acting to tell me to cry. Simply understanding what is happening and why, how it relates to world history and what I might do in such a situation is enough. We feel the continually alternating terror and relief of the characters all the way along.<br/><br/>There is little if any CGI in the movie (I can't tell because all of it looks completely real). It's depressing the extent to which movies depend on CGI these days. It frequently doesn't look real at all and can take you right out of a movie (the Justice League trailer shown before Dunkirk was a good example of this). As a result, Dunkirk looks spectacular.<br/><br/>The music makes use of ticks (from Nolan's personal watch), constantly reminding us of the scarcity of time and the impending doom surrounding the soldiers. Like the opening of The Dark Knight, there's a lot of string ostinati, gradually building tension as the events unfold and lives are on the line.<br/><br/>The movie is made up of three main aspects/locations which unfold in parallel but on different timescales: land (a week), sea (a day) and air (an hour). Nolan has done this several times now. In Inception, dream layers occur at different paces from each-other and reality. In Interstellar, time dilation causes great discrepancies in the passage of time between characters. Memento is made of two main story-lines (one going forwards and one backwards) which eventually meet. Many of the climaxes in his Batman trilogy involve multiple events occurring in parallel. Dunkirk similarly cuts between multiple lines but it is easy to follow and it helps build suspense and connect the parts of the story.<br/><br/>There is little dialogue. And that's appropriate, there isn't much to talk about. Characters exchange looks and that's all they need. They're alive. The stranger next to them may as well function as their best mate for now but who knows what will transpire.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a profound experience. It doesn't try to be beautiful or sad or triumphant but just real. And yet, I think it's all of those things. It's thought-provoking and haunting. It's about one of the darkest periods in human history and the biggest evacuation of all time. It's incredible film-making and a serious contender for Best Picture IMO."
"chernan-21744","5","12","27","21 July 2017"," The film lacked that ""WOW!"" factor.
","This film was average. Maybe I went in expecting too much from this production. It show definitely be on WW2 enthusiast's watch list. It was worth my time, though. I just can't seem to come up with what the film was lacking. Hopefully, others will get more out of it than I did. I really expected much more action in the form of actual battle scenes. I won't say the film is a 'must' watch, more like ""should, but not missing anything spectacular if you don't watch it."""
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","14","33","18 July 2017"," Dunkirk Gets Lost on the Beaches
","There's no denying director Christopher Nolan has pretty much been crowned the torch-bearer for smart, contemporary, mainstream entertainment ever since The Dark Knight (2008). The fact that he backs up his visionary works with intelligently written screenplays and analog bonafides - such as real special-effects and shooting on film, only further engenders him to the minds of film aficionados. There's no denying he's one of us - a filmic omnivore and true believer in the power of the form who not only adores the trappings of his craft but is willing to subject his carefully crafted stories to obsession, scrutiny, and obsessive scrutiny a la constant fan theories.<br/><br/>Thus saying Nolan's newest movie Dunkirk isn't all that and a bag of potato chips, actually hurts to say. Whatever misgivings anyone has had about Nolan - his characters lack emotion, his stories too heady, his pacing, so syncopated as to be robotic, have all come home to roost in this one. What's more, you can add loud, fractured, disorienting and at only 102 minutes, overlong to the list of complaints.<br/><br/>Of course that may be part of the point. The evacuation of Dunkirk was, no doubt a fractured, loud and disorienting event for the over 450,000 soldiers who experienced it. The movie, re-cobbles the harrowing World War II military disaster from perspectives of land, sea and air; attempting to give the audience a fuller picture. The film opens with a nameless British soldier lining up on the beaches hoping for deliverance (Whitehead). We then jump to RAF pilots (Hardy and Lowden) providing what little air cover they can before tossing our hat in with Mark Rylance and his conscripted fishing trawler. In between these interweaving stories, we're reminded of the stakes by Commander Bolton (Branagh) who's exposition feels more like a godsend than a clunky add on.<br/><br/>Yet even then Dunkirk can't help but feel like an ordeal. The non-linear storytelling (not just told from varying perspectives but also out of sequence) does little to immerse the audience into the film's claustrophobic settings. It doesn't draw attention or make comment like Rashomon (1950). It doesn't create the illusion of omniscience like in The Thin Red Line (1998). And it certainly doesn't get into the head space of the characters like in Slaughterhouse-Five (1972). It winds up forcing the viewer to continually update their context, using brainpower to figure out the time of day instead of caring about whether Tom Hardy is going to win his dogfight.<br/><br/>Dunkirk does has a well received cousin in the form of A Bridge Too Far (1977), which similarly used fluid story dynamics and a large ensemble cast. In that regard Dunkirk improves on that formula by using mostly no-name and workmanlike character actors to do most of the heavy lifting. Yet A Bridge Too Far actually reached its climax. It did so through anticipation and dramatic irony. Dunkirk on the other hand starts at level eleven and stays there.<br/><br/>This is turning into a much more negative review than is warranted. Dunkirk is still, for all its faults, a worthwhile movie. There are some masterful shots in this film, the immediacy of the situation is always clear and present and the utility of the IMAX format is on full display. If you don't believe me you can take the word of Christopher Nolan himself. Also while the score by Hans Zimmer is likely to be polarizing to some, I for one found it aptly encompassed what the movie was trying to achieve (even if it is too much of a good thing).<br/><br/>Additionally the muted work of Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard, Cillian Murphy and the rest of the petrified soldiers is just excellent. With precious little dialogue and even less to differentiate themselves, these soldiers brilliantly capture the primal desperation and numbing exhaustion of the situation. Let it be said that out of all the sleek, heretofore unnecessary movie magic that Nolan employs, what saves this picture are the anonymous faces of horror who live or die based almost entirely on circumstance."

"cdjh-81125","10","7","14","5 August 2017"," This Generations ""Saving Private Ryan""
","Sometimes when I anticipate a film for so long, all the way through its production from the time it is announced it's almost an odd feeling when i finally sit down in the theatre and watch it for the first time, But unlike in the past this film did not disappoint me in the slightest, not only did it live up to my, honesty unreasonably high expeditions, it exceeded all of them by being something I never expected. <br/><br/>The structure of the film was something I wasn't sure would work, having three perspectives all in different times could have been rather jarring and incomprehensible but it wasn't, it only helped to add to the scale and stakes of this whole event and not only how important it was that it succeeded but also just how difficult victory was going to be to achieve. <br/><br/>This film doesn't put much effort into developing its characters, usually that would bother me but here it didn't. I got the impression that this film wasn't about the characters or the actors playing them but instead about the situation they were in. I didn't have any issuer getting behind any of her because the importance of this operations success was so well established it was clear how important it was for them to survive and get home. <br/><br/>While Dunkirk is most definitely not a performance piece all the actors are great in this film. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy are probably the stand outs but the new comers do deserved credit, they don't have much dialogue but they but still perfectly convey they're need to survive. <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has been one of my favourite directors of all time for so long and I knew he was going to do magnificent things with this movie and he did not disappoint. He did some of his best work ever here. He kept such a consistent pace from the opening scene he puts you right into the situation and doesn't let up by constantly showing chaos and destruction all within camera with no cgi or green screen making it feel all the more real. The aerial dogfight sequences were incredible, nothing about them felt fake, they felt real, intense and confined and because of them only lasting one hour of time they never let up. <br/><br/>As much as this film showed a lot of death and insurmountable odds it also has such a great message about hope and what people can truly accomplish when they band together which gives this film a much needed heart instead of it just being a non-stop thrill ride. <br/><br/>Dunkirk is a cinematic masterpiece, it lived up to everyone of my incredibly high expectations and exceeded them giving me one of the most unique war films ever made. Everything from a technical, performance and writing standpoint was done perfectly to the pout where this film felt more like an experience and less like a viewing. <br/><br/>10/10-A+ (Incredible)"
"kimayarawat","Null","7","14","2 August 2017"," Probably the most historically inaccurate war movie
","As a person who respect Christopher Nolan as a director, I was so excited that he is finally making a war movie, but Dunkirk left me disappointed. It is probably the most historically inaccurate war movie that has ever made.There is no mention of Indian soldiers who were also fighting in Battle of Dunkirk. Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, claimed that Britons stood alone against Germany once France fell,when, in fact, hundreds of millions of Indian soldiers were also fighting with them.They were led by Mr Dawson who answers the call for a civilian armada and sets across the channel in his little boat to take part in the great evacuation.<br/><br/>There is no room in the film for the pluck of the hundreds of thousands of soldiers from undivided India who fought for the British in that war, the largest volunteer army in history. At least four companies of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps served in France during the campaign and three contingents were evacuated from Dunkirk and one taken prisoner by the Germans.<br/><br/>One of the evacuated officer, Jemadar Maula Daud Khan even won a Distinguished Service Medal for showing magnificent courage, coolness and decision. When his troop was shelled from the ground and bombed from the air by the enemy he promptly reorganised his men and animals, got them off the road and under cover under extremely difficult conditions, but there is nothing about him in Dunkirk.<br/><br/>Nor does the film have any room for the many lascars who operated the merchant ships that came to rescue the British troops stranded on the beach. By 1938, one in four crewmen on merchant ships were lascars mostly from South Asia and East Africa. Instead the only brown to be seen in the film is the tea that the Englishwomen offer the English soldiers scrambling aboard the rescue boats and ships.Even the Indian mules, some 2,500 were shipped from Mumbai to Marseilles, did not get a cameo.<br/><br/>Like I said I respect Nolan as a director but now I have realised that making a war movie is not his forte. How I wish another director or director/actor who has proved himself in making a war movie and still currently active in the Hollywood would have directed it because Dunkirk was an very important part of history that I am sorry to say, have gone bad in the hands of Nolan. I hardly write a review but others were claming it ""the mother of all realistic war movies"" and I couldn't just let that go so Dunkirk compelled me to write one. My rating is 1/10 for balancing out the unwarranted 10s full of biased reviews."
"Rawal_Afzal","10","7","14","1 August 2017"," Two hours in the war zone, Nolan's best work!!! Hans Zimmer you beauty!!!
","What a fabulous film, what a great depiction of the battlefield. Nolan has doubtlessly pulled off his best work and one that he'll himself find it hard to surpass. Right from the scene where the first aerial attack takes place and the Allied soldier trying to gun down the plane gets wiped away from the earth, the film never looks back and provides one gripping moment after another. The dogfight between the air forces yet will forever go down as the most thrilling scenes in the history of any war film. Mind-blowing work!<br/><br/>As many World War Two films do, this doesn't resort to showing blood and gore, or deformed dead bodies to depict a war (which isn't necessarily wrong), but yet makes the point of the horror of a war in a most eloquent way. It seems as if Nolan had over the years been watching war films as a layman instead of a film-maker, and had realised that the public is demanding for something more than just deformed dead bodies. Yet on the other hand, it doesn't show any false bravado on part of the Allied forces. It just depicts the reality of the battlefield, and gives a hint of Forces beyond their control having made it happen.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's background music will forever be remembered as the ultimate decoration of any Nolan film. That music was killing and created nail-biting suspense even in moments of relief, coupled with it the sound effects that make you feel as if bullets are coming your way from every direction - another highlight of epic film-making. I'd a time of my life, two most thrilling hours ever spent at a cinema. #ThankYouNolan - thank you for the heart palpitations and the shortness of breath!<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>Now, let me address some of the criticism directed at this film by a minority of people, two of which were my brother and my brother-in- law, who went to watch it yesterday with me (first time by the way that I've walked out of the cinema with a split opinion with anyone that I've gone in to watch a film). Yes, the film doesn't show a background or even a short history for the laymen watching of the Battle of Dunkirk. So anyone going into it with expectations of a proper story will be disappointed, as will be those who haven't done any bit of a research on the battle.<br/><br/>Secondly, yes it has no characters and doesn't even show a single German soldier, and as a last bit of the criticism, omits reactions or the talks of the people in command from either sides, or discussions from the offices as to what the plan is to get them evacuated and how much under stress they're regarding this, or how the Germans are plotting to attack them. But that's not criticism, that's a misinterpretation of the purpose of this film. Showing all of that to please some viewers would make it a film, and this isn't a film. This a literal presentation of what war is or what the happenings of the surroundings of a battlefield are. Ask yourself, if you were amongst the Allied soldiers stuck there, would you on that beach have an idea of what the people higher up are planning to save you, or what the Germans are plotting? No! The problem is, showing any of that would make it a film with breaks and stopages and will never give you the feel of a battlefield. A war zone, a battlefield is exactly like this and it offers no time to wipe a sweat from your forehead. It is relentless, it is unfair and it constant. Watching it, by the 40th or the 50th minute I myself was exhausted and was saying that such a film should have an interval of 15 minutes, but again, the battlefield has no intervals and being exhausted is a part of it. There are moments when you scratch your head as to whose plane is flying overhead, but here too one has to study to understand that it is after this particular battle that the Allied forces chose to draw a colour- based distinction on their planes for identification. So here again Nolan makes you go through exactly what the Allied soldiers on the ground had to.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Nolan but not a huge fan. I criticise his films when I don't like it, but here he has succeeded tremendously in making you as an audience feel like a soldier effected by it. It's a project, not a film. As for characters and a story, a war does have a story, but a battlefield doesn't. A battlefield just has gunshots, grenades and bombs, and soldiers fighting for survival. At most, the only criticism that I can remotely accept is that the action or the plot didn't have a prelude, which would've been useful for a layman watching this film without having studied the Battle of Dunkirk, But again, Nolan has his own thought process here and it has its own justification.<br/><br/>All in all, 100 out of 10 for this masterpiece. I wouldn't mind it getting a well deserved Oscar. Nolan and co. have richly deserved it."

"vborn","9","7","14","28 July 2017"," Unique, emotional and fascinating as usual
","As a big fan of Christopher Nolan, I'm still waiting for a really bad movie of him, so he can improve his skills better. I know there might be many Nolan Fans, who are exaggerating. But this doesn't mean Nolan is overrated, no way. He even deserves more respect for his vision and skills. <br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of the ""war"" genre to be honest and only like a few war movies, but this movie was very different. It was once again a non-linear film and it showed once again that film rules are film tools and can be broken in the right way. So everyone who isn't a fan of war movies as well can enjoy this movie as well. <br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is the excellent casting. I felt like literally every actor was fitting perfectly into his role. Great performances by everyone, but especially Cillian Murphy and Harry Styles were out-standing. I'm very proud of Harry Styles taking this path and I hope he will continue with such great performances. <br/><br/>Once again Nolan rocked with an unique story-telling. It's a non- linear movie focusing on three perspectives. But what fascinated me most is how I could relate to every character, although there isn't hardly any character depth. It's like making us having compassion with everyone and not only with one specific character. <br/><br/>And the combo Zimmer-Nolan worked again brilliantly. I felt like the visuals and the background score were stabbing into my heart. Especially in the most dramatic scenes it was a well-fitting score. Just incredible how he makes a scene terrifying and hopeful on the same time. <br/><br/>So, you can expect another masterpiece by Nolan, which not only makes your brain feel satisfied, but plays with your heart as well."
"PrashunChakraborty","9","7","14","28 July 2017"," Not a Nolan fan but this was monumental
","I was quite uncertain about Dunkirk, I strongly disliked Nolan's last two films and the one before that felt a bit too inspired from Satoshi Kon's Paprika to really have an identity of it's own like his Insomnia, again not an original work. Nolan has been a director who has been out of form for nearly ten years in my opinion however with this one, Nolan has again become one of the directors to look out for. This is indeed worth the hype, the best war film in years. A technical masterpiece worthy of the IMAX experience. What really surprised me about the film is that dialogues are kept to a minimum and Nolan is always a dialogue heavy director, first 15-20 minutes or so just have a handful of lines, it's all about the environment and the atmosphere, which was very refreshing, I have always criticized his films for having more to say and less to show but he makes amends here. Nolan does add his own signature to the film by mixing the timelines of multiple story characters but it's done to a minimum so that isn't gimmicky and doesn't overstay it's welcome. However it's more of a technically flawless masterpiece of a war film (Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down etc.) rather than an emotional or character driven one (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, The Thin Red Line) which is fine, I wouldn't necessarily rate the latter group higher than the former, I do like the latter more but each group has it's appeal and I enjoy both. In the acting department everyone gets the job done but I wouldn't single out anyone as giving a standout performance, Mark Rylance almost gets there though, he is the audience's character, the heart of the film, the common man. This is as much as Hans Zimmer's film like it's Christopher Nolan's, so much so I wish there was lesser usage of background music in it which is almost present in every scene, background music doesn't necessarily enhance the atmosphere of gun shots, shells and bomber planes flying, was sometimes being a distraction and breaking the immersion. All in all these are minor nitpicks of an otherwise an excellent film. Nolan's finally back on track after nearly ten years and this is his best in my opinion replacing his previous best Memento."
"mikkjall","9","7","14","28 July 2017"," The Unknown Soldiers
","This film left me speechless and I found myself left alone with the titles and Zimmermann as all the other members of the audience had left the cinema. Contrary to what others have said the music was the star of the show. It sometimes intruded as far as it actually told the narrative, but Zimmer's score underlined and reinforced the emotions to an even higher level. Despite desperate scenes of terror, most of the most white knuckle moments were more individual and close camera, like being trapped in a box. The fact that many of the characters were not given names meant that they came to represent thousands of others who shared the same fate, a sort of mass Unknown Soldier. The theme of the movies is Getting Home and how and if that would happen and what sort of a welcome awaits you. The high point of the movie when this possibility moves from hopeless to possible, is underscored by a remarkable synthesis of music and environmental sounds as Elgar's Nimrod gradually appears through the mists and for a brief instance the White Cliffs loom in the memory on the horizon. This wonderful music ebbs and flows like the tides of hope. Nolan's use of real planes and boats wherever possible gives this movie intimate credibility, and his general avoidance of CGI extravaganza makes it both more believable and more personal."

","If I look at it in story perspective may not be the best of Nolan's filmography. There are other movies like Inception and Dark Knight series. If I look at it in war films - it is not the best of war films. Still I prefer other movies like Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now and others.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a cinema that needs to be experienced like your have never before. Spectacular Sound Design, Amazing music by Hans Zimmer (I am his fan for Inception's Time Soundtrack), Tom Hardy's brilliance that you can see in his eyes, you can't see editing - that's how good Lee Smith is.. that's what I experienced watching Dunkirk. <br/><br/>Less duration with rich visuals is a huge advantage to keep the audience hooked till the last shot. But still I am moving towards the sound of this film. Right from the time you hear the first gun shot - till the end of the movie it's mainly based on sound design. Comes down to one thing - brilliant screenplay by Christopher Nolan."

","Looks to me like Mr Nolan's director career is on the same track as Mr Night's (shamaya, Shimalaya, whatever). Their first or second movies (Memento, superb) were by far their best and it's all downhill from there (Interstellar, yuk).<br/><br/>Dunkirk kind of lets you down on all accounts. No attention paid to the anachronisms (modern buildings, container cranes... lol). No characters whatsoever, except as solid as usual Mark Rylance. The storyline would fill half a page on a notepad. Seeing each scene from three different perspectives at different times does not make the film any better, just the story shorter. No suspense, no action, no acting, no nothing.<br/><br/>Photography is decent, but it's not Private Ryan or Band of brothers.<br/><br/>Honestly don't bother, watch it on freeview in 2 years you'll be equally disappointed."

Whatever human elements shown is at the superficial level. Very disappointed.If they had started and ended the movie based on some family drama then it would have scored big. Churchill's famous speech in the Parliament is read by one of the character from a news paper and does not have any effect.

"SeattleDeanr","6","7","14","23 July 2017"," So Much Missed Opportunity - Another Movie Is Needed!!
","Went and saw Dunkirk last night. If you plan on seeing it, STOP reading - my short review will likely spoil it.<br/><br/>Not a typical war movie, not at all actually. Was feeling like the Director missed a great opportunity to tell more about the amazing history. There was a lot of great filming, but the three stories within the overall story with how they switched back and forth was so complicated, it was hard to keep up on what was going on. It did make you feel like you were IN the scenes though - which was the best part of the movie. The biggest flaw as so many others have stated - very little character development that resulted in my not having much empathy on a personal level. As another reviewer put it, there was no difference in the sense of loss between a main character getting killed any of the extra's getting killed. Nothing at all like the character development that occurred in Saving Private Ryan and other great war films. The second flaw (also mentioned numerous times by others), the background music was non-stop and got to be quite noticeable and annoying.<br/><br/>I got bored and started looking at my watch about 3/4 of the way wondering when it was going to end. Overall, a disappointment - won't ever watch it again. <br/><br/>I hope someday another Director will take another shot at focusing more on how the miracle happened at Dunkirk, both from the Allied's and Germany's perspective (like how they did in The Longest Day, Patton and Tora Tora Tora). Seeing exactly HOW so many of the small boats got organized for the rescue would have been good. Watching some scenes of German commanders making decisions to not go in for the kill would have been also good. And then seeing their eventual surprise when they realized that they let 300,000 troops escape through their fingers - would had made an excellent scene. And then finally, a voice recording of Churchill's inspiring speech at the end, rather than mere words on the screen would have been much better and satisfying.<br/><br/>The biggest mystery to me is why this movie is being rated so high. Guess the difference in style is what is being praised mostly? As of this writing, the IMDb rating is at 8.7 - way too high of a score, needs to be down in the 6-7 range."

There are no scenes of dialogue where the characters are humanised, nor any visceral scenes of battle to hammer in how hellish war is.<br/><br/>Instead, the implication of horror and sparse dialogue, coupled with Hans Zimmer's excellent soundtrack, creates a tense atmosphere where time feels like it's running out.

","This movie is a mix of very good and very bad. The good parts are superb but the faults are glaring. <br/><br/>First of all the bad parts. The soundtrack is terrible and intrusive. Good music would have made a world of a difference. The dialog is 75% incomprehensible either behind masks or with excessively heavy accents. The movie jumps from one scenario to another too often breaking up the narrative and causing confusion. Night and day seem to be mixed up - suddenly it's day time in the air then night time on the boat and back and forth. Some of the things that are shown seem hardly worth screen time like the 17 year old boy dying and Cillian Murphy's character with his shell shock. With all the brave stories to tell why so much of that awful story?<br/><br/>Good points: This is no Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor movie with it's silly love triangle. Quite an antidote to those war movies with too much love story. It's all Dunkirk.<br/><br/>The airplane battles are quite well filmed.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are the most tense in War movie history. Worth mentioning are the scenes on the ships when the torpedo strikes, bombing of ships and the men in the water with the fire on them, and strafing on the pier are second to none. The action is really seems in your face. The downed pilot almost drowning was quite scary. But the part with men being shot while hiding in the beached ship seemed overkill. <br/><br/>Good that they mentioned how the evacuees weren't sent enough ships and planes for the evacuation and how civilians had to help.<br/><br/>This movie is still worth a watch for the great parts."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","11","25","19 July 2017"," Nolan; masterpiece; immortal
","I cannot recall any movie that has a better establishing first 10 minutes. A few cryptic written lines tell you what you are going to see is about 400,000 retreating Allied soldiers trapped at the French beach Dunkirk, waiting for a ""miracle"" to happen. Whether you are born half a decade (this IMDb user) or half a century after Dunkirk, you would likely have heard of this unique historical event during WWII. If not, Google is your friend.<br/><br/>The first sequence shows half a dozen British soldiers running from German firepower, pinned down one by one, with only one survivor Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) escaping, running towards a French barricade yelling the he is ""Anglais"", allowed through, crossing the remains of a seaside hotel and finally with the beach suddenly opened up in front. While there are a dozen long lines of soldiers, well-spaced, awaiting rescue, he has to answer nature's call first, then spots a soldier (Damien Bonnard) burying another in the sand (a story right there that I'll leave you to discover) and lends a hand. Tommy's story is one of the plot lines.<br/><br/>The first ""title"" appears at this juncture: ""The mole; one week"". A seasoned moviegoer, your subconscious would probably register ""week one"", assuming this to be the usual chapter title denoting a linear narrative. Cutting right to the next sequence with civilian boat owner Mr Dawson (Mark Rylance), his son (Tom Glynn-Carney) and a passionate young man George (Barry Keogham) getting ready to sail across the Channel to Dunkirk for the rescue, the next ""title"" appears ""The sea; one day"". Now you take note: this is definitely ""one day"", not ""day one"". Finally, with pilots Farrier (Tom Hardy) and Collins (Jack Lowden) on separate fighter planes comes the third and final ""title"" ""The air: one hour"". You are finally on the same frequency as Director Nolan: what he is showing are three parallel, concurrent stories. There is a fourth set of character, in charge of the rescue at ""The Mole"" (which, incidentally, refers the pier structure that is vital for getting the stranded soldiers onto the rescuing vassals), Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) and Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy), from the navy and the army respectively.<br/><br/>Through these brilliant ""close up"" narratives, Nolan traverses time and space, bringing you directly to Dunkirk to share this historic moment, revealing all aspects of human nature from noble sacrifice to cowardly selfishness, and everything in between. There are many, many more characters, of which the only one I would mention is a favourite of mine, Callian Murphy, playing a nameless, shell-shocked soldier rescued by Dawson from the sea.<br/><br/>As this is after all a commercial film (as opposed to strictly art-house work), some nick-of-time, edge-of-seat moments are expected. Two that cut back-and-forth are a pilot trapped in the cockpit in the sinking fighter plane and a group of soldiers hiding in the hole of a Dutch merchant boat awaiting the incoming tide to bring them out to sea while all the time the Nazis soldier are using the apparently deserted boat for target practice. Allow me one spoiler: both have happy endings. (Sorry, two spoilers).<br/><br/>This masterpiece concludes, which is entirely expected, with Churchill's immortal oratory: We shall fight (them) on the beaches, etc. etc., an uplifting note."

","When I saw the IMAX feature clip for this film before watching Rogue One back in December, I just knew I had to watch this film in IMAX. Christopher Nolan is probably the most successful modern day director going today. He was able to establish a niche early on, then came out with a very well received comic book trilogy. He was audacious to go for a sci-fi film that turned out to be quite grand. Here, he took a shot at a war film and I think he has done very well.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is told in three phases. On the land, in the sea, and in the air. Each section is connected but the duration of time of each segment differs. The week we see on land involves a young Englishman trying to survive while along the way meeting two fellow young soldiers and being sunk by enemy German fire. The sea portion takes place in a day and involves a civilian boat that is run by a father and son and their attempts to rescue as many soldiers as they can from Dunkirk. The air portion lasts only an hour and follows a fighter pilot and his attempt to take down enemy planes while trying to ration the fuel in his engine.<br/><br/>Time is definitely a construct that connects each section in a non linear method. You can literally hear the ticking of a clock in the score, and its persistent. Speaking of the score, Mr Hans Zimmer has outdone himself. The score is ever present and it carries on nearly throughout the entire film. It never lets up and is at times majestic, tense, and absolute momentum building madness. The jarring sounds (especially in IMAX) is phenomenal. IMAX was able to heighten the experience. Every loud gun sounding off and every roaring plane is so precise, loud, and absolutely brings you into the world of the film.<br/><br/>The script and dialogue is kept light and its so great that way. There isn't a whole lot of dialogue and there doesn't need to be in this type of war film. Nolan isn't exactly trying to build the strongest of characters. The film is really a cinematic experience. The long shots are beautiful. There is heavy use of practical effects and virtually no CGI. It feels so authentic, and Nolan masters the art of cinema here. The film introduces a few fresh faces and includes some familiar ones, even those who have worked with Nolan in the past. Also Harry Styles (who was surprisingly quite good).<br/><br/>I think this film ranks quite highly in Nolan's work. I may need to give it a rewatch to see exactly where it does. I can see why people won't enjoy it because its so different than what Nolan has done in the best. I for one, love the direction he is going in now. He's become a bold and ambitious filmmaker doing what he thinks is write and not really pandering with this one. Its got to be one of the best war films of all time already.

Director depicted the story from three different perspectives with three different time horizons that intersect each other eventually!<br/><br/>Dunkirk merely a character driven film with their heroic tales as it never explains the background of any of its characters that much on how, why and from where they got stuck in a French port and their purposes rather portrays the fact of the survival of those 400,000 soldiers from their counterpart by the only means of evacuation.<br/><br/>Nolan's Dunkirk remains as a visual treat with the best cinematographic experience and splendid sound design till date! It feels like you are in the actual situation!<br/><br/>The movie hardly has any dialogues and might be the only of its genre where the background score never stops breathing and keeps the audience gripped in it spontaneously! It acts like the heart which keeps it alive.<br/><br/>It's not an ordinary film that you watched and understood on a first go with the perplexed time horizons involved but the storytelling is pretty straightforward this time unlike Nolan's other films like Memento, Inception or Interstellar lately.<br/><br/>Forget everything and stop expecting any of that sorts, if you have already watched Schindler's list, The pianist, Downfall, Saving Private Ryan or even recent release Hacksaw Ridge. Dunkirk hardly belongs to that genre. It's not a typical war film rather a survival film with almost no bloodshed!!!<br/><br/>Director Christopher Nolan crafted the thought of making Dunkirk almost 25 years back.

","""Wars are not won by evacuations..."" Words spoken by Churchill after the events depicted in Christopher Nolan's latest film DUNKIRK. Yet, Nolan chooses this backdrop to deliver a war movie that is as immersive as the D-Day landing in Saving Private Ryan. But the similarities end there. <br/><br/>Nolan uses three different vantage points each with a different time-line: The Mole, the rock wall protecting the harbor, over a full week; the Air over the course of only an hour; and the Sea over a full day. All this is presented with typeface near the beginning of the film to help orient the viewer to what's being shown. <br/><br/>What is unique is that Nolan uses non-linear storytelling. By doing so, we become immersed in the events as though we are each of the characters. Similar to Memento or Interstellar, Nolan again shows confidence in the audience and we are rewarded for it. We won't find long lines of exposition to explain things. Neither does he ask for our emotions in conventional ways. Rather by utilizing visual angles, intense sound, and non-verbal cues, he urges us to become immersed in the story with these soldiers, pilots and merchant marines and day fisherman bringing home across the channel. In only one instance did I sense Nolan obviously building a crescendo of emotions at the events on the screen. Despite this, there is much to appreciate in this film.<br/><br/>Where many war movies generally depict impressive battlefield or theater heroism against great odds usually resulting in rescue or victory. Nolan delivers a more poignant look inside war from what Churchill also called a ""colossal military disaster."" Because of its unique look at war, it is definitely worth a look.<br/><br/>B+"

","As a history buff, I am easily drawn to historical films, including biopics. I understand the dramatic license filmmakers must take to make what is sometimes flat material into a compelling story. However, the story of Dunkirk and the evacuation of over 300,000 trapped British soldiers is as full of natural drama as stories about D-Day, or the Alamo, etc. My biggest complaint about this undeniably beautiful cinematic special effects party is that if you don't already know the story, the context is murky and the narrative very fragmented. My second objection is to the filmmaker's need to fictionalize characters--there are so many heroic and amazing stories found in this event--no need to make up characters. I would strongly recommend that before you see this film, if you don't know the history, do a little research. Of course, if you do, you'll probably be as disappointed as I was--this could have been a great epic war film. Instead, it is disconnected and hard to follow, both in terms of the interior chronology and the context."

While we do have big names like Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy...none of them have a significant role in this movie, which is the point I think Nolan was going for.<br/><br/>Usually a movie features a protagonist, and an antagonist. But the way a friend of mine pointed out, the War itself, is the main character. The actors we see, just are small pieces to the larger story. There is no useless dialogue in this movie either...the action starts within a minute or so of the start. And really doesn't let up!

"IngJane","9","8","17","23 July 2017"," Nolan's new Masterpiece to behold
","Dunkirk or also known as Dunkerque is a true-story of teamwork, heroism and humanity which took place during the World War II. British soldiers are surrounded on all sides by Germans as are French soldiers. The film focuses mainly on British soldiers, and the presence of French soldiers as war- allies is addressed as well.<br/><br/>Before watching it, I already was super-hyped for it, it was after all my most anticipated film of the year along with Call Me by Your Name, and Oh My God, it did not disappoint. What an incredible movie, it is not just my favorite movie of 2017 by far so far, but also my favorite Nolan film.<br/><br/>Nolan's new masterpiece, instant-classic, film-treasure or whatever one wants to address it like, is an incredible achievement not just only for directing, but most of all an achievement for technical aspects of cinema. Every sound detail, the score (I'll get to that later), cinematography, editing, sound editing and of course the directing by one and only Christopher Nolan were perfection to witness. I don't know if Dunkirk will win Best Picture but Nolan will win the Best Director Oscar, I wasn't this impressed by directors work this decade, not even by Birdman, Gravity, The Revenant, La La Land and they all won Best Director.<br/><br/>The story, the story is real, it happened. Would you believe it could've happened if it wasn't a proved true story, would you think it can only be fiction? Probably not. Just try to imagine it: Dunkirk a Film by Christopher Nolan When 400,000 soldiers couldn't get home; Home came for them. And after you watched the movie. Two scenes in particular were so scary to imagine being real but how many soldiers died that way in WWII? Countless. And also there is character development and you really feel for them, especially George, Peter and Mr. Dawson, but still none of the characters are going to be iconic like Oscar Schindler is, because, again the story doesn't center around one, ultimate hero.<br/><br/>So many things I love about the film, the only criticism of the movie was that there's no character development. It was so smart of Nolan to not give one of the characters a girlfriend he loves so much and he probably knows he will never see her again but he has to serve his country. The film starts at the event, the evacuation at the mole took a whole week, it took civilians one day to come to Dunkirk and the air force fought for an hour. Why adding an irreverent story for just one character when the whole point of Dunkirk wasn't just about one person? I did like every performance by every actor, it doesn't have a lead character as all of those soldiers that got saved, the civilians that helped, and the air-force were all heroes; Churchill too.<br/><br/>The three actors I think are really stand-outs for me at least are Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy, but of course, everyone does a great job. Mark Rylance is the only Oscar winning actor in the movie, and although he won the Oscar for being quiet he proves those who thought he didn't show anything besides a quiet character, well he can yell. And Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy are such a professionals. Tom's just great in everything and he owns every scene he's in, and Cillian is one of the most underrated actors of today. And I saved my favorite part for last: Hans freaking Zimmer's score is eye-opening, the best score he's ever done by far and Supermarine is one of the best pieces of music ever. While I was going home, I still felt like I heard the music, every sound I heard I tried to make Supermarine of it, and I still feel like I hear it. An unforgettable experience."

","This movie is an experience in itself. Nolan puts the viewer into the battlefield at Dunkirk during WWII.We experience the same dread , urgency and tension as the solders of the 3 allied nations felt whilst being surrounded by German troupes, facing attack from air, land and sea. <br/><br/>As a Nolan fan i've come to love his unique way of storytelling and the cerebral mind-games he plays with his viewers. This movie(except maybe insomnia) follows a rather straightforward story line, thought he does play with perspectives that intertwine and overlap in time(his trademark non linear storytelling) amplifying the intensity with each passing minute.<br/><br/>Hats of to Chris. He no longer has the luxury of making a ""good"" movie, only excellence will satisfy us. Also hats off the Hoyte van Hoytema for a spectacular cinematography and Hans Zimmer for his compelling sound design.<br/><br/>Peace."
"roykfrapp","9","8","17","22 July 2017"," Nolan's War Epic
","War is Hell! That infamous phrase isn't necessarily the first thing you think when watching Chris Nolan's masterful World War 2 epic Dunkirk. Nolan isn't really interested here in the gratuitous and awful nature of war( Hacksaw Ridge take note) but instead relies on cinematic, visual storytelling in its purest form to bring home a more melancholic, elegiac tone. It still has shocks and suspense and although minimalist in certain scenes(the faceless enemy, the stripped back approach to explosions) its scale is huge. Nolan is almost a contradiction...he seems to blend an artistic, philosophical approach with a more bombastic and populist edge to wonderful fruition.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are vaguely drawn but much like Mad Max Fury Road its all about the mannerisms, the looks that people give each other to convey emotions. Everyone is superb in this, even dare I say it, that young upstart from One Direction(that's one hell of an agent) but its Tom Hardy's spitfire pilot that bears the brunt of the emotional heft and has, by the last few scenes, become an integral part of the story( giving away no major spoilers). And this is an actor who's wearing a mask for almost the entirety of the movie.<br/><br/>Nolan has often been accused of a cold, clinical approach that disrupts the flow of his technical achievements to become something greater. Personally its far from the truth..Inception and Interstellar both contained father issues that were touching and tender and stayed the right side of tender and sentimental and even Insomnia had a very poetic underpinning with that mournful bittersweet ending. Although Dunkirk does perhaps tip near to that theory ironically, its within its last half hour that theory can be well and truly put to bed. Its simply stunning cinema thematically and structurally bringing about Nolans fetish for fiddling with time periods melding together cohesively.<br/><br/>There may well be the whiff of commercialism especially regarding the 12a certificate but this is more like those war films from the 50s and 60s that were not very violent and were more about grace and determination and spirit of soldiers in a seemingly hopeless scenario. Nolan knows how to create cinematic magic in a world which has become obsessed with cgi and over the top action set pieces and that in itself deserves recognition. The mainstream crowd are not all stupid.(take note Bay)<br/><br/>Dunkirk is intimate and tense with another superb Zimmer score(only once is it too overbearing) and many may want their War films dished up with blood n guts and profanity attached. But Dunkirk isn't about War or a particular genre..its a showcase for Nolan and how he now has a legacy behind him that the likes of Spielberg and Kubrick once knew. In Nolan we trust."
"beyzfrommars","10","8","17","22 July 2017"," Masterpiece
","First of all I want to say that Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors of all time. In fact, I was really nervous about the film as a Nolan fan because it's his first war film. I've read some bad reviews and they all wrote that the film was a total disappointment. I don't agree with that. <br/><br/>In spite of I couldn't see the film in IMAX, I still felt like I was in the film. All the sinking and drowning scenes were so realistic that I felt I was there and drowning with them. The characters were emotionally strong. Especially Cillian Murphy's character was so strong that I could get into his head and see through his eyes. The scene when he asked about the boy that he accidentally killed was so touching. <br/><br/>The only thing that I didn't like about the film was Harry Styles' acting performance. He just couldn't make us feel the film's spirit. For example when they realized there was a foreigner soldier in the ship with them he got angry but it was so phony. <br/><br/>But I can simply say that I loved the film. Nolan did a perfect job. I'm sure that he will keep doing great films like this film."
"shawthingproductions","10","9","20","24 July 2017"," Stunning masterclass in filmmaking.
","I've been looking forward to this film for what seems like an eternity and usually - when that's the case - I tend to end up nit-picking and getting frustrated with the finished product. A film that promises more than it can deliver. Thankfully, this is not the case with ""Dunkirk"" and Christopher Nolan reminds us, again, why he is one of the most important film directors of the now. <br/><br/>From the opening scenes, this film is tense. The story follows three situations: a young soldier trying to get away from Dunkirk, the fighter planes sent to try and keep the troops on the beach safe and one of the ""civilian"" ships that crossed the channel to try and bring the troops back. Each little story being tense in their own right and telling their own story. Not a single frame wasted in this beautifully shot film. Dialogue is minimum but Hans Zimmer score stops there from being completely silent. A score which doesn't really let up for the 1:46 minute running time. A running time, again, which is nigh on perfect. Too long and you'll be bored. There is no padding here. The story tells what needs to be told.<br/><br/>Even Harry Styles didn't do the bad job people thought of him. Sure, he's not going to be an award winning actor any time soon but - for what he had to do in this film - he played the part well; as did the rest of the cast. Mark Rylance as the father setting sail from England to help those he can, with his son. Tom Hardy the fighter pilot... Hardy doing a great performance considering, for pretty much the whole film, we only see his eyes through his goggles. The emotion and intensity burning through just his eyes is immense. That being said, there are a lot of names in this film (Hardy, Rylance, Brannagh....) but no actor is bigger than the film. They all play their part and none of them distract from the story. <br/><br/>I was excited to watch this film. I'm more excited to see it again."
"bcooknycnj","3","9","20","22 July 2017"," Disjointed and Fragmented
","Disappointing. After seeing it recently, I am surprised by all the positive reviews for 'Dunkirk'. <br/><br/>A Major Historical event but the film did not build a coherent plot around it . Poor story-telling. In an early scene, soldiers are fired upon, but who are they and who is shooting at them? Is it 'friendly fire'? It is unclear.<br/><br/>And, where are the enemy ground forces, how close are they to Dunkirk, are the enemy armies advancing or standing still? We are not shown that.  <br/><br/>Also, I expected some portrayal of the reaction by the British command in London. How was the leadership deaing with the very possible loss of 300,000 soldiers, (and of the war!). Nope, not portrayed.<br/><br/>And I don't recall seeing any of Dunkirk's civilian population in this drama, surely they must have had concerns that could have been demonstrated. Or did Dunkirk's civilians manage to flee earlier?  What of the men, women and children who lived there?  Surely that is part of the story.<br/><br/>An artistic, creative film that derives its substance from a real event needs to have respect for historical accuracy & background.  And for the interest of the audience in such context.  Otherwise, just make a totally fictional movie & call it 'Donburp', 'Seatown Retreat' or something else.<br/><br/>The music was loud, mediocre and somewhat annoying. The photography was good but the enduring images are of lines of fully uniformed soldiers standing knee deep in the sea (Engish Channel) waiting for their ships to come in. (I hope the extras were paid well; It has been reported that the film had at least $100+ million financing).<br/><br/>Dunkirk is the story of a crisis that had, incredibly, an unexpected positive outcome.  It deserved better treatment."
"davidarcher","5","10","23","22 July 2017"," Not a great war movie - just a 106-minute series of vignettes
","I went expecting to see, as one critic put it, ""the greatest war film ever made."" I was disappointed. Not only is it NOT the greatest war film ever made, I'm not really sure what it is.<br/><br/>And, if you're not familiar with the Dunkirk evacuation, you're probably going to be a bit lost. The movie begins with the soldiers lined up on the beach, and offers just a few expository comments about how they ended up there. There are no visual cues to help you understand the magnitude of the challenges they face. You never get the feeling that you have almost 400,000 men stranded on a beach, or that they're being attacked by hundreds of (rather that two or three) aircraft. <br/><br/>Putting that aside, I had three major problems with the movie:<br/><br/>First, I felt like I had walked in during the middle of the movie. Nothing is really put into context, nor do you get to know any of the characters. Instead, it feels like you're watching a series of vignettes, or perhaps a montage, from another film, albeit for nearly two hours.<br/><br/>Next, the evacuation involved 340,000 men, hundreds of aircraft, and about 860 vessels, many of which were ""little ships"" that sailed from Ramsgate. Unfortunately, the movie never steps back long enough to provide a sense of the scale for the operation, and instead just shows a few boats and aircraft and a handful of men.<br/><br/>Finally, while thousands of men were killed, the film never lets you feel that on a visceral level. When a soldier or sailor is killed, with a few exceptions, they merely fall to the ground. No one is ever grievously wounded, screaming in pain, or making any commotion at all. Contrast that to the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan, which is probably the most intense battle scene ever filmed.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, but has very little dialog or character development with which to work. Will Attenborough, grandson of Richard Attenborough, plays an RAF pilot, while singer Harry Styles plays the son of Mark Rylance, a ""little boat"" captain. (Rylance could give an amazing performance just reading a phone book.)<br/><br/>The film was shot mostly in 65 / 70 mm and is being screened in 125 70mm-capable theaters. The film is incredibly loud, and veterans of the Dunkirk evacuation noted the movie was louder than the actual battle.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to recommend. If you're looking for a great war movie, this isn't it. If you don't like war movies (like Marie​) this won't change your mind. Maybe wait for it to stream."
"eden-rabatsch","9","10","23","19 July 2017"," Nolan delivers the most beautiful war film in decades
","Christopher Nolan who might be the most consistently celebrated director who makes both art and money has delivered a masterpiece. Nolan has envisaged the disaster at Dunkirk as a window on the experience of war. This is not a classic war film. With sparse dialogue, even less blood and no Germans, Nolan has given a prism which explores the battle through the lens of a thriller. Throwing away all the usual tropes the viewer is put into the film from the first scene and then spends 108 minutes surviving. The director most often compared to Nolan is Kubrick and here we can see an echo of ""Paths of Glory"", Kubrick's second and famously anti-war film set in the trenches of the Great War. Nolan takes a wide angle, a cold eye and sets it to form a triptych: three stories unfold and converge. One from the air, the sea in the form of the Home Fleet and finally from the land with the soldiers trapped on the beach. There is no overarching narrative or rhetorical flourishes but just the image and soon a magical thing occurs. The sheer humanity of the events takes your stomach and grips it as tightly as any thriller has and does not let go till the film is over. Nolan is helped immensely on all fronts. The score by Hans Zimmer is always reminding you of time. Time spent in the wrong direction can be fatal, even looking at the sun can be the difference as you hear the notes of a watch ticking away. The film is absolutely glorious. I mean arguably the most beautiful war film since ""Apocalypse Now"" and Hoyte Van Hoytema (who worked on ""Interstellar"") has created the best aerial combat I have ever seen. I am not sure how it could have been filmed. The entire vista looks real, the battleships are British and there is nary a CGI effect though the one downside is you never get the impression that there are hundreds of thousands trapped there. This is the best sound effect editing I have ever heard. These are craftsmen at the zenith of their art. The cast is impressive. Totally British as insisted by Nolan, the ensemble includes Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy and Mark Rylance. Fionn Whitehead is a newcomer and the closest to an audience surrogate but even there it is only because we meet him in the first scene. Everyone is strong but it is Rylance who steals the film. His nobleness in impossible times serves as a sharp contrast to modern views on duty and sacrifice. Nolan has delivered a piece of art which is hard to review. Like all great art there is a visceral experience required. There is little sentimentality and it invokes intimacy despite being on a huge canvas. It is the work of someone at their peak."

There's also a medic at some stage in the movie but I wont spoil it and tell you when.

","I watched several war movies in the past years, and I always enjoyed the most the fighting scene, the rapid movement or the story regarding the event, the planning of the mission,action. What I loved in this movie is that it doesn't tell you a story as if you were a far away spectator, it takes you from your sit and puts you straight on that shore and tells you: ""This is war, now we are going to experience it together"". I felt the stress the private felt while trying to escape in every possible way, I felt the lack of oxygen in the underwater scenes, I felt the heaviness of the silence in the infinite seconds of waiting. Generally war movies, always try to draw a line between good and evil, underling who is the friend and who is the enemy; what I felt during this movie is that, more than trying to create two different groups, from the very beginning what is pictured is the human nature in the war zone: surviving instinct. There are a few scene where it does not matter on which side they were, the only thing that matter was: ""Mors tua vita mea"", another detail that add truth and authenticity to the story. Another thing that this movie has is, at least for me, being unpredictable. I didn't know, or catch, the destiny of the characters, until the end, until the very last scene I didn't know what was going to happen to every single character of the story."

The British officer had an automatic weapon and could have easily killed every Nazi standing in a row and out in the open. The British were in a building which provided cover from return fire. You shoot the officer first then whoever remains. Maybe rules of war have changed but there is a reason officers in battle don't have their rank on their helmets. You shoot them first. I think now after all the reviews that I have read that Maybe I should have stayed. Like I said maybe I missed a good movie."
"joshbarton15","10","6","12","31 July 2017"," Nolan delivers yet again
","Christopher Nolan is a director who doesn't really do things by halves, so when it was announced that his latest film would be a war film, the levels of anticipation I had for it went through the roof. He's directed some of my favourite films so to see Nolan make a war film for the first time, particularly about something like Dunkirk, was always going to be one of my most anticipated films of the year.<br/><br/>As 400,000 men wait to be evacuated from Dunkirk beach with the enemy closing in, Dunkirk follows the efforts of men on land, at sea and in the air who fought so bravely to make it possible for them to return home to Britain.<br/><br/>Desperation runs rife during war and Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk doesn't waste any of its runtime is depicting just how desperate a situation it was as men waited to be taken home, not knowing when the enemy would strike next. Nolan's boldest decision in Dunkirk is to not show one German soldier throughout and it really adds to the film's intensity, the fear of the men trapped on the beach fully embedding itself in the audience's mind as a result.<br/><br/>The narrative choice was one that surprised me but, while it took me a few minutes to work out exactly how it was panning out, it's a choice that makes Dunkirk unlike any war film I've ever seen. The three narrative threads the film follows take place over different time periods however, Nolan ensures they come together rather magnificently, intercutting between each narrative seamlessly thanks to Lee Smith's sharp editing.<br/><br/>Nolan has formed some incredible collaborative partnerships throughout his career, most notably with Hans Zimmer who has scored a number of his films. Zimmer really feels as if he tries to outdo his previous works each and every time, which is only a good thing for us, and his work on Dunkirk is up there with his finest to date. The inclusion of the ticking clock superbly fitting in with the theme of time and emphasising the desperation of the situation.<br/><br/>A relatively shorter collaborative partnership in comparison is that between Nolan cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, who first worked with Nolan on Interstellar. Just like Interstellar, van Hoytema's breathtaking visuals fit with Nolan's narrative superbly well, accentuating the scale of the operation at Dunkirk even in such a close-knit narrative.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Nolan's Dunkirk features an ensemble cast who all impress despite having to work with very little character development. People may find it hard to connect with the film as a result however, I felt for these characters as much as I have in films with well-rounded characters so the lack of character development didn't really hinder my experience. It was a real pleasure to watch actors like Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh bring their usual qualities to a film but it was even better to see acting newcomers in Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles, yes Harry Styles, make their mark in Nolan's film.<br/><br/>Myself and other film fans may sound like broken records when describing each new Nolan film as a masterpiece however, when the man keeps on making the films he does, it's certainly justified. More so because Dunkirk is exactly that, a masterpiece."
"phil20972007","9","6","12","31 July 2017"," Beautiful depiction of Threat, Time and Hope.
","An exceptional Nolan's venture into the war drama genre that had me captivated from the start. It's pure Cinematic thrill cleansed the ongoing plethora of superhero films being churned out by the likes of DC/Marvel to offer a serenity that was missing.<br/><br/>It's not a history lesson. Purist will look at the Spitfire's fuel range and complain or the presence of a French Destroyer rather than an English one, or of how the yellow nose of the German planes did not come in till later in the actual war. But trust me, it gets drowned out in the outstanding visuals Nolan offers without sacrificing the pace of the film or the narrative.<br/><br/>It's captivating to see how, without showing any actual enemy soldiers, Nolan could make us feel the threat by just using brilliantly shot scenes and a heart pounding sounds by Zimmer. Man! The pure adrenaline rush at each moment the soldiers faced was equally perceive by us, taking us along in every bullet sizzling by and the suspense of not knowing when another German bomber will fly by.<br/><br/>You can actually hear the roar of the Spitfire's Rolls Royce long before it approaches, or the imminent threat of the German war-birds swooping down for a fish in a barrel run. Even if you closed your eyes, you'd actually feel the fear grip you simply by the sounds on these scenes. <br/><br/>Nolan perfectly uses the concept of illusion to great effect. While at first i thought the enemy was the German army invading and cutting off all exits and closing in for the kill, upon further pondering, the real enemy i think was ""Time"" itself. And i think he used the Beach, the Sea and the Air scene transition just to reaffirm that.<br/><br/>While the Beach scene probably lasted about 1week, the Sea was about a Day and the Air fight about an hour. At first, the transition was confusing, but towards the end of the movie, you realized it was all leading up to the climatic closing and it had the impact, at least to me, of what the film was about. How different people perceive time.<br/><br/>Without showing us the enemy except for a few dogfight scenes and never from the perspective of the enemy planes, you are immediately made to think about the ""enemy"", and the film goes on to gnaw at your thoughts to affirm who's the enemy? Time? or the invading Germans?<br/><br/>We've had brilliant films based on war from ""The Thin Red Line"" to ""Saving Private Ryan"" that I've watched and loved. Dunkirk, while not focused on a group of soldier to tell the story, relies on the overview of the war and tells a broader story while feeling every sting of the bullet and then feeling hopeful when Farrier, played by Tom Hardy, shoots down the German fighter on a beeline for the French & English soldiers awaiting transportation to go home, even when he was out of fuel.<br/><br/>The film left me with a broader sense of how an event plays out and how different people react and perceive the actual threat of Humanity, Time.<br/><br/>To me, This one is for the Oscars. Thank you Nolan & Zimmer and to all cast & crew of Dunkirk for giving us one of the best movies of 2017."

","28 July 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Dunkirk. This is a name everyone has heard of, how the allied troops were forced north onto the beaches and how a grand flotilla of small boats went and rescued them, but how many people have really sat down and thought about what actually happened. Films often romanticise war, and it's not always their fault, stories transferred to the big screen often make heroes where there are none and hide true heroes in the background. That is not the case with this film......Christopher Nolan has written and produced a masterpiece. The raw edgy style of cinematography draws you in from the very beginning and you feel yourself running alongside these soldiers, sitting in the back seat of the spitfire willing the bullets to find their mark, and on board the small vessels urging their engines to go faster and get the job done. The film is full of heroes, not just the pilots or the skippers, but every single fighting man, played by actors representing real people, in a very real and terrible situation. I thought the way the film jumped between the three main parts of the story was captivating, I found myself getting immersed in each bit, not wanting to leave but eager to jump to the next part to see how that group of people were faring. There was very little in the way of blood flying around, but that in no way lessened the impact of the horror of war, and the desperation these men must have felt as they tried again and again to get off the beach and head for home. There were no fanfares, no trumpets, just a quiet satisfaction of job done and a sadness for all those who didn't survive. An excellent job from Christopher Nolan."

"WhimsicalVonia","6","6","12","25 July 2017"," A Triptych of Colors & Zimmer's Score Not Enough To Compensate for Nolan's Artsy Excess
","This is one of those films where a lot of nothing happens. Not exactly nothing, but there is a focus on the mundane, if that can be said in regards to anything during wartime. This is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I can name several films, especially international ones, in which this is the exact reason I love it. It did not really work in this film, though. <br/><br/>The Good: * The best thing about this film is Hans Zimmer. Aside from the music, constant clock ticking creates the almost claustrophobic and every present fear in the film (Zimmer actually used a pocket watch belonging to Nolan). With very little dialogue, Zimmer's score is its own character. * Along with the score, the cinematography was gorgeous. Wide angle shots of the beach, dark colors, the mise en scène. The film was actually divided into three segmented colors; sky blue, dark blue, and orange, referring to the triptych plot of air, sea, and land, respectively. (Note: Continuing his advocacy for film over digital formats, Christopher Nolan chose to shoot the movie in a combination of 15/70mm IMAX film and Super Panavision 65mm film in order to achieve the maximum possible image quality. After The Master (2012) and The Hateful Eight (2015), Dunkirk (2017) was the third wide release motion picture of the current decade to be primarily shot and shown theatrically in 70mm. I was fortunate enough to see this version.) <br/><br/>These two things set the tone and mode for the entire film. <br/><br/>They made the film. <br/><br/>The Bad: * I hate to admit that I was greatly disappointed. Nothing happened. It was depressing and depressing and sometimes that is a good thing. This is war, after all. There are other ways films that do this, but Nolan screws this up by trying to interweave all the stories. * Nolan always has admirable concepts, in theory. Lamentably, he then makes the mistake of being excessive with the special effects + unnecessary fancy tricks. His splicing of three different timelines and stories not only made watching it a little confusing, but killed the connections I could have felt with any characters. <br/><br/>The film is told from three points of view: on the beach with the infantry, the evacuation by the navy (showing how civilians came to the rescue), and in the air. Speaking about the narrative structure in Premiere magazine, Christopher Nolan stated: ""For the soldiers who embarked in the conflict, the events took place on different temporalities. On land, some stayed one week stuck on the beach. On the water, the events lasted a maximum day; and if you were flying to Dunkirk, the British spitfires would carry an hour of fuel. To mingle these different versions of history, one had to mix the temporal strata. Hence the complicated structure; even if the story is very simple.

","Let me first say, I'm a fan of Nolans other work, and it's not that I have anything against war movies. The movie was very intense, not only in direction but also due to the score. But I must say I found the film mostly confusing, at first anyway, and actually a bit boring. This is by no means a ""run of the mill"" war film. It kind of reminded me a bit about Black Hawk Down in the way that it depicts a situation more than having a storyline. After a while I got that the three situations did not happen at the same time, and I figured that the pieces would fall into place at some time, which of course they did. But I couldn't help but thinking the way the story was told, was because it would have been even more boring to tell the story chronologically. So I guess Nolan did a good job in that sense, but I still found the story to be uninteresting, even though it is based upon an important and significant event in WWII."
"dave-mcclain","8","6","12","23 July 2017"," ""Dunkirk"" is an innovative, well-crafted, engrossing and enjoyable film.
","The World War II battle and evacuation portrayed in director Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" (PG-13, 1:46) involved no American troops, but had a big impact on the U.S. role – a full year and a half before it (officially) joined the fight. As the Nazi blitzkrieg swept through France, Belgium and the Netherlands in May of 1940, the armies of those countries, and their ally Great Britain, were pushed westward until they were trapped in the area around Dunkirk, France (near the Belgian border), with nowhere to go but into the English Channel. Nearly 400,000 of them. <br/><br/>Nolan's trademark creativity led him to write and direct this film as a triptych, telling three related stories which took different periods of time to unfold, but showing them running concurrently throughout the film. A slate on the screen introduces each narrative (and the amount of time that it represents) from the first shot of each: ""1. The Mole | One Week"" (a mole being a pier-like, but solid breakwater built out from the beach); ""2. The Sea | One Day""; ""3. The Air | One Hour"". Once each of those printed designations fades from the screen, the movie moves back and forth between stories. <br/><br/>On the beach, close to 400,000 men awaited their fate, whether it be rescue or annihilation. The German Army (which is barely shown and referred to only as ""the enemy"") has the British, French, Belgian and Dutch troops surrounded on three sides, with the channel blocking their escape on the fourth. The Germans seem content, at least for the moment, to keep the troops bottled up on the beach and pick them off from the air with strafing missions and bomb the ships and boats attempting rescue. Among those struggling to survive on the beach are Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), a British soldier who barely escapes unseen German rifles to make it to the mole, Gibson (Aneurin Barnard), a mysterious soldier with whom Tommy teams up and Alex (Harry Styles), another soldier whom they end up saving from a sinking ship and with whom they explore various opportunities to save themselves. When one of their plans goes awry, they end up overhearing a conversation in which a British naval commander (a composite character played by Kenneth Branagh) discusses with other officers how dire the situation is. <br/><br/>On the sea, the British ships aren't up to the task of a rescue operation under these conditions. The Admiralty is unwilling to send over more than one large ship at a time for fear of losing ships that may be desperately needed for a last-ditch defense of the British Isles against an expected German invasion. Many of the smaller ships and boats that do arrive to assist with the rescue find themselves unable to navigate the shallow waters at Dunkirk, and only a few of them can even get close enough to load men who have walked out onto the mole. The attempted solution is for British naval officers on the English side of the channel to commandeer just about anything that floats to make the crossing to either bring soldiers back or ferry them from the shore out to the larger ships. Some boat owners take up the challenge personally out of a sense of duty and compassion. One of those is a mariner named Dawson (Oscar winner Mark Rylance), who brings along his teenage son (Tom Glynn-Carney) and his son's friend, George (Barry Keoghan). Their first encounter with someone who needs rescuing is a downed pilot (Cillian Murphy) who is on the verge of an emotional breakdown and becomes a danger to the mission.<br/><br/>In the air, a squadron of three RAF pilots (including Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden) patrol the skies for Luftwaffe planes and, when they find them, try to shoot them down to keep them from shooting the soldiers on the beach or bombing the ships and boats trying to rescue them. They doggedly and heroically pursue their mission, in spite of the unpredictability and danger of the Luftwaffe planes, very limited (dwindling) fuel supplies and the loss of comrades. As this and the other two narratives develop, the movie interweaves all three stories and brings each to logical, but fairly unpredictable conclusions.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" is an innovative, well-crafted and enjoyable film. Nolan (best known for his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"") effectively joins his three differently-paced narratives (although the back-and-forth between day and night in the beach scenes can be a little disorienting). His script contains a relatively small amount of dialog, instead building suspense by concentrating on the details of what's happening and showing all of it through the eyes of his actors. He chose to cast (mostly) unknown actors in order to focus on the characters' personal stories and he conducted an exhaustive casting process to make sure his approach would bear fruit. (And it did, even with the casting of One Direction singer Harry Styles in his first film role.) Nolan also shot using creative and evocative camera angles, he favored practical effects (rather than an overuse of green-screen technology) for his crowd scenes and action sequences and put a lot of effort into shooting with authentic period planes, ships and boats, some of which participated in the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. Oh, and Hans Zimmer's original score (complete with a synthesized version of Nolan's own pocket watch ticking away the time) stands out. In short, Christopher Nolan has dramatized a vital, but under-appreciated chapter of World War II history in a style that is all his own and has made a film that should appeal to Movie Fans of all styles. The little that it lacks in excitement, back story and narrative cohesion as compared to more traditional war films, it mostly makes up for in artistic and entertainment value. ""A-"""

","The Dunkirk evacuation can be seen as three distinct elements working to accomplish this overall goal. The mole, where thousands of soldiers were for a week trying to survive and escape their hopeless situation. The sea, where civilians spent a day sailing their boats to transport the troops. And the air, where spitfire planes could last for an hour before refueling. All have stories worth telling. And as three separate episodes of a mini-series, it could work. Instead, they're mercilessly inter-cut, with this confusing time-line preventing the otherwise willing and game audience from becoming properly engaged with what we're seeing. It works as a series of tiny moments of humanity. Not as a whole.<br/><br/>The entirety of this is using the snowball effect previously used well by Nolan in his third acts. This could become exhausting. However, there's time to breathe. Small victories that are celebrated(with whatever tea is available at the time. Not even kidding). There are no leads, merely characters that have more screen-time than others. No development, no one to get into? I disagree. They're all relate-able, trying to make it past the day. Or even just the second. This is tense, and you're never truly safe. It moves briskly, without rushing. This *is* indeed very loud, and those with genuinely sensitive ears may have to wait for the home release, despite that they'll lose out.<br/><br/>I recommend this to any fan of Nolan. 7/10"

","I see the review trolls are at it again. Statements like ""Soul-less. Confused. Loud. Disappointing."" with a rating of 2/10 are actually ironic, because, that is a very accurate depiction of war. Soul-less. Confused. Loud and disappointing. There are no winners. Everybody who complains about this movie being boring and tedious has no clue about war. A lot of war is sitting around and waiting wondering what the enemy is up to, or hoping you will make the next day, which can be boring and tedious but also soul killing. I really enjoyed every aspect of this film and was invested in the characters and their survival all the way. The sound editing and Zimmer's music was also phenomenal and I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It was way more realistic and historically accurate than many other movies. I'd say it's an accurate depiction of war. The writer and director set out to tell the story out of the perspective of those who were trapped on the shores of Dunkirk and who escaped to tell the tale, and I can honestly say, he did a good job of it. I have never seen war first hand, but have some close relatives and friends that have seen and lived through it. Those include the Angolan war in South West Africa, as well as civil war in Northern Uganda and Southern Sudan. I have heard many first hand accounts of war, and have also seen the effect of war on people's personalities, bodies and on nature and cities up close. It's not the ""sexy"" version Hollywood has sold to us many times. It's really terrible. I can imagine after you've killed so many times, and you have seen so many people killed and mutilated around you, there are not much emotion left. The way those characters in the movie were depicted, I feel is very accurate. Everybody just keeps going. Some commit suicide. One person I knew, who died several years ago as an old man, was actually in Pearl Harbor shoveling coals on a ship because he was too young to fight. He survived the ordeal because some guy offered him a plank that kept him afloat when their ship was sunk in the harbor. He even named his son as a result of this. He did not talk much about the war, but sometimes when I drank coffee with him, he would speak about things he did and saw. He was also a POW in Japan where him and his mates were tortured. Among things, he managed to escaped by strangling his captor and torturer with bare hands. War had a permanent effect on him and his family. His daughter has told me many times, how he used to wake up screaming at night. That is war for you, and that's what is depicted in this film. I live by the ocean, am involved in maritime sea rescue and also have aviation experience. This film ticks all the boxes for me."

"jnswick","5","4","7","5 August 2017"," It Was Off to a Good Start, then...
","Possibly the film was over-hyped and my expectations were much too high, but I can only express great disappointment in 'Dunkirk'. Three failures come to mind, of which none existed in 'Private Ryan' or some of the other great WWII films. The camera placement on both the French and English coastlines was inconsistent, thus very difficult to realize where we were at times during the film. Short of having small titles to tell the audience of where were were in some of the scenes, they should have had each coastline (France & England) on one side of the screen or the other. For example, we went from the 'White cliffs of Dover' immediately to the French coast line with both beaches on the right side of the screen. I think that type of thing was a huge error in making the film. As a pilot I found it interesting that the Spitfire pilot, with plenty of time to prepare for ditching and was not injured, did not have his canopy in the rear position prior to hitting the water, a very basic safety measure even in a Cessna with the door released prior to impact. I felt the story line was very disjointed and part of that could be the fact that I'm American and it was difficult to understand all of the lines in the Queen's English. For this movie the popcorn was the best part."

It can't be mentioned in the same breath as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, for instance, and I could name a good handful of others. I was confused by all the separate scenes each lasting but a few seconds. This made it seem an eternity before the Spitfire shot down the German bomber, and there was the damaged Spitfire, gliding and gliding. The huge budget provided for merely a few planes and a token number of rescue ships.How else was it spent? Plenty of noise, stupendous action, and very little acting or even dialogue. No, this war movie was disappointing to say the least."
"ianmet-65148","5","4","7","5 August 2017"," Lots of noise but lack of scale
","Oh dear, where to begin? I expect that this film will now become the defining 'history' of Dunkirk for young people, many of whom probably confuse it with D-Day anyway. The big problem is that it lacks scale. The director wanted to avoid using CGI but as a result the beaches look like an out-of-season Morecambe, as someone put it. To be fair, he would have needed the combined manpower of the present-day British, French and German armies to replicate the scenes of 1940. And where were the vast quantities of trucks, guns and equipment destroyed by the army and abandoned on the beaches? Instead we were given half a dozen old lorries, fewer than you'd see in a scrapyard.<br/><br/>Then the fabled 'armada of little ships' hove into view – with no more than about six to eight boats forming a pathetically small flotilla. At least Nolan managed to get weekend skipper Mark Rylance's dress right for the period – collar and tie.<br/><br/>But he got it badly wrong for the troops being rescued. In the publicity still of the men gathered on the mole (jetty) they look as though they have popped out of an Airfix kit, with freshly painted helmets and uniforms straight from the QM's store. Not a dented, scarred or missing helmet, and not a missing or bloodied battledress blouse. No helmet straps worn over the brim and no other headgear (forage caps or berets) visible. No bandages or slings, just everyone in parade-ground order.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Kenneth Branagh managed to stay stubble-free after seven days non-stop directing operations on the mole.<br/><br/>I'll end there, except to note that when the men travelled back to London by train they did so in brightly-upholstered carriages that bore no resemblance to the brown-hued trains that I remember from the '50s and '60s, let alone those of the '30s which would still have been in use in the 1940s."
"roysach","5","4","7","5 August 2017"," Dunkirk is war itself, long periods of boredom interrupted by periods of intense activity.
","For some reason, given this films antecedent director / cast / crew history, I expected Dunkirk to be a bit of a Marmite, and I wasn't disappointed. Or rather, I was. The story of Dunkirk must surely demand a massive canvas, within which the myriad of individual characters stories can and must be be drawn, but for me only the latter were played out to a backdrop of something of a day at the seaside with occasional bits of chaotic interference provided by an anonymous foe. There's no cast of Hundreds and Thousands in this confection. That said, those incidents of conflict are exactly what I would expect from a director of Nolans pedigree, up close, multi faceted, slamming, highly personal, and rammed home by thumping sound effects that are the perfect foil to Zimmers delicate and uplifting score, but for me the sum of these parts most certainly do not exceed the whole. Then, Integrity is all when handling history at its best. Modern floppy hairstyles and a mooring line clearly attached to a Royal Navy ship foundering ""at sea"" made me gasp for all the wrong reasons, that and the protracted flight of the superb Tom Hardys Phoenix that must surely rival the ""magic bullet' for historical incredulity. Dunkirks cast is a brave mix of old and new. The twain only rarely meet, with little screen crossover between the youngsters headed by the competent Harry Styles, and the old guard stoically represented by a committee of leading men who seem to deliberately underplay their roles in the manner of the one and only Mark Rylance but are devoid of his presence and depth. I'm sorry, but without all the 'little boats' (such as they were) this film could have been anywhere. Over the years I have come to accept that occasionally history will not be allowed to get in the way of a good story, but this has neither. For me, this version of one of the most pivotal and chaotic engagements in our history has completely failed to engage."
"silarpac","6","4","7","5 August 2017"," Visually stunning but...
","One must give credit to the director for style points. It is very well done cinematically. But the minimal dialogue does not allow the audience to get to know the characters well enough to care about them. Nolan uses the well worn multiple plot lines device but in this case it doesn't work. Hitchcock is Nolan's role model but Hitch would never have used this device in one of his thrillers. Hitchcock always had straightforward plots with compelling main characters. But here, the characters are almost unimportant. Nolan is more interested in the danger that they are facing. But that doesn't work dramatically if the audience doesn't identify with the character. <br/><br/>Nolan seems to be uninterested in the battle as a great historical event. Little effort is spent on giving the audience the necessary background to understand the battle's significance. The director wants to treat the battle as a series of human survival dramas. That is only partially successful. The episode of the soldiers getting into the beached ship was just too obviously a suspense inducing gimmick. Why would anyone that was not completely stupid think that would be a safe refuge? <br/><br/>The enemy is almost faceless. This is another device meant to create a feeling of dread. All of these devices work in some movies but here it doesn't come together. For the British this battle was very emotional because they believed at the time that they were facing a German invasion of Britain. That was why it was so important to save the British Army. It wasn't just national honor. Nolan doesn't seem to care about any of this. I think that Nolan should stay away from historical subjects. It just isn't his forte."
"justanotheruser752","7","4","7","31 July 2017"," Great movie
","SPOILERS ALERT<br/><br/>When I was told that Dunkirk was directed by Christopher Nolan, I was immediately drawn to it, and I knew I had to watch it. Needless to say, I had very high expectations, for I am a huge fan of Nolan's work. Once the movie ended, I was left feeling empty. There wasn't a major plot twist. Instead there was an attempt to make the audience feel slightly better. Let me clarify: from the very beginning, the movie is clear – this movie is about war, death and survival at its finest. Soldiers die and if they want to survive, they must not look back and continue to run until they've reached a safe – or better yet, less dangerous, - place. The story line develops and we become aware that there are about 400.000 British soldiers (plus French and Belgium ones) trapped on a beach in Dunkirk. The goal is to get at least 30.000 of them. How? By the ocean, obviously, but this is a very hard task, for the enemy is constantly attacking, making it nearly impossible to escape. The movie doesn't focus on many characters. On the contrary, actually. Truth is, even though the screen time isn't split by many soldiers, we still don't get to know the name of some of them. Or their background, for that matters. Some people might feel like that's the movie Achilles' heel, because it created a lack of emotional connection to the characters, but I am forced to disagree. I felt incredibly sick since the very first moment. There's no need to know much about the characters – the situation they're encountered in is the emotional connection to the audience. They know that they are most likely to die, because not all of them will be able to leave the beach. And it was impossible for me not to feel deeply for all of them. Certain philosophical themes are, too, explored: there's a scene in which the soldiers get into a heated argument because some of them try to force a French soldier to leave a boat (that they all found and were planning on using it to escape, before they were under attack) and one British soldier strongly stands up for him, for is it really fair to stop valuing someone's life to save our owns? Is it ethical to throw someone into the wolves (quite literally) for the sake of other people's lives? Due to the situation they're in, is it justifiable to value certain lives over others'? In the end, they are able to save many British soldiers (over 300.000) and yet, the captain (?) chooses to stay to help the French soldiers get home – I couldn't help but think what would've happened if that number was far lower. But afar from the plot itself, Dunkirk has another trick up its sleeve: the cinematography. It's a beautifully shot movie. The colors are cold: a lot of grey and pastel colors are seen throughout the film to enhance the fact that there are no really happy endings in war. Once they soldiers are back home, they are seen on a train passing a warm green field, but even after that, the audience doesn't really feel any better – but I think Nolan wanted us too. The soldiers are worried they will be portrayed as weak and a waste of space, since everyone went through so much trouble to save them and the war isn't even over yet. However, the soldiers are welcomed into warm embraces. But, we cannot feel better, because the truth is many of them are dead, and the ones who aren't will always have the horrifying memories of what happened and of what they were forced to become."

The cinematography is absolutely stunning and each scene is full of suspense. However, there is one big flaw that I can not overlook. The film is practically devoid of a single compelling character, and is forced to lean more on its spectacle and action. And even the action can get a little tiring, specifically the air battles, where by the third downed plane, it just starts to feel repetitive. Overall, the film looks exactly like what you'd expect a film directed by Christopher Nolan to look like, but without an emotional core, I can't help but be disappointed by it. Is it a good film?

Here, he finally makes a film that seems to go out of its way to not touch on any of those things. The premise is simple and we are out in the middle of various characters at wartime. Many scenes go on without dialogue. Further, this is one of his shortest films, definitely in quite a long time. I don't think it's a perfect film (sometimes the mostly effective score seems a bit much and at times the film would benefit from not jumping back and forth between story lines). However, the more simple approach taken here actually elevates his characters to become actual human beings rather than thematic symbols, which is also something that he has suffered from in the past. It's not an overly emotional film at all, but I found myself more emotionally invested in these characters than I have in previous films. The ending montage seems like it was a bit overdirected, but other than that I left the theater feeling quite satisfied. only time will tell how my feelings change (and with Nolan films, many times they do)."
"mikeyf9","8","7","15","24 July 2017"," A Beautifully yet weak film.
","Before I bash the film, I should at least praise it. The film like every Nolan film looks beautiful. The cinematography alone can keep you engaged. Also the crew did a nice job creating the look of WW2. I also like the non-main character way of telling a story a little bit because it feels like your in an actual battle where your focusing on multiple peoples lives instead of just one. The acting was also on point from all of the cast as usual in a Nolan film. <br/><br/>Now the bad. From the start of it, the film assumes you know who the combatants were at Dunkirk, when it was, and also where it was. There isn't even any slang by the British like ""Hun"" or ""Jerry"" to identify the enemy. Were just supposed to know. Also back to the main character problem, although it's good from a war perspective, for the audience perspective, it just seems a very artsy move, which it is. We have no band of character to latch onto. Also the ""why"" problem. There is no mention of why they are at the beach, why there is a German advance. There is no background!"
"flmovie","6","7","15","23 July 2017"," well made, b minus
","Dunkirk is being compared to the best war movies ever. It is not in that class it is a solid movie that has very good cinematography. The acting is decent but the story is not that great. Best thing that the film does is make you believe war is hell. The characters will quickly be forgotten."
"Solnichka","8","7","15","22 July 2017"," Should have been a three-hour epic
","First, the event itself deserved more screen time and exposition. Only 107 minutes for this real-life story? Not enough time at all. Also, no explanation whatsoever of why the ""enemy"" didn't press the advantage, which is a key element to the story. Second, the three-tiered narrative gets jumbled at the end, obviously on purpose, but it's not a good way to end the film. The out-of-sequence editing ruins the hitherto-positive effect of the trio of story lines, potentially confusing the audience. Those two things out of the way, this is a very good film: good acting, good writing, good cinematography, etc. The three story lines are woven well, demonstrating the different experiences at Dunkirk, and until the end of the film (as noted above), it's edited very smoothly and effectively. Definitely worth seeing -- but it could have been SO much better."

","I have never given a ten on any movie...until now. This movie moved fast, and was intense from the very beginning. Nolan does a great job with several viewpoints being woven together. There isn't time spent on deep character development, and some won't like this. The hero of this story is the action...and there is a ton of that. The visuals are stunning. If you want to be entertained on the edge of your seat, and you are tired of 2+ hour investments, this is your movie."
"wendyluhardy","9","8","18","24 July 2017"," This movie could have waited for Red Box
","I had been waiting to see ""Dunkirk"" for months & planned on seeing it on 21 July, the opening night. Rarely does Hollywood put out a movie that I'm willing to see right away, but ""Dunkirk"" looked like a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>What a letdown; I was so disappointed. The trailers made it look so exciting. I mean, how could it be otherwise? The Battle of Dunkirk was perfect movie material: in the spring of 1940, over 300,000 British & French soldiers were trapped on the beaches around Dunkirk, making them sitting ducks for the Germans. The British military called for civilians w/boats to sail across the English Channel to Dunkirk to pick up as many men as possible & bring them to larger ships, as the larger ships could not make it to the beach- -and they succeeded. Surely an event worthy of a movie on a grand scale.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the trailers showed the best parts of the movie; everything else was a letdown. Not a lot of dialogue (which could barely be heard above the background noise) and little to no character development, which I consider essential to any movie. I swear Kenneth Branagh--one of the best actors in the world--did not have more than a few lines. Neither did Cillian Murphy or Tom Hardy, both great actors. Only Mark Rylance had a decent speaking part. There was not an opportunity to get to know the characters in the movie, what kind of men they were or personalities they had, what they might be thinking or feeling in their horrendous situation. Nolan never gives you a chance because it's the focus of the movie seems to be everything but the characters themselves.<br/><br/>And the film was disjointed & lacked continuity. Of course all aspects of the battle had to be shown: from the air, from the sea, from the land, so jumping from Mark Rylance in his boat to Tom Hardy in his fighter/bomber and Fionn Whitehead on the beach was necessary. BUT you couldn't always tell when anything was happening. At one point it was nighttime at Dunkirk; you could see the fires & the lights on the beach. Then you'd see Tom Hardy in his plane or Mark Rylance on his boat--in broad daylight. Why? What time of the day was it? I thought it was night. If it's nighttime on Dunkirk then it's nighttime in the air & on the Channel, but we never see that. The events seemed out of order.<br/><br/>Chris Nolan is a good director, but he could have done so much more. There should have been more character development so you could get to know these men better & empathize w/them & their situation, thereby becoming more involved in the movie. But he did not do that.<br/><br/>My mom had wanted to see this movie (she's almost 80 & hasn't been to a movie in years). I told her to wait until it comes to Red Box and watch it. I mean, it's not a bad movie; just not as good as it should have been. It's not so much a war movie as it is Chris Nolan's version of a war movie."

This is a must at Oscar time, especially for the cinematography.<br/><br/>A genuinely real experience and snapshot of nine days, not just British. Where 192,226 British and 139,000 French soldiers – 331,226 in all – were rescued by the 700 little ships (British, Dutch and Belgium) and around 220 warships. On a personal note pity Nolan did not get hold of the PS Medway Queen. Which my father was evacuated from Dunkirk on, he would never talk about his Dunkirk experience. <br/><br/>Minor continuity error, the scene with Harry Stiles (good acting by the way) and others sitting on the beach.

"coreyjdenford","10","8","18","21 July 2017"," Survival is Victory
","This review of Dunkirk is spoiler free<br/><br/>***** (5/5)<br/><br/>CHRISTOPHER NOLAN HAS shown time and time again that he is no stranger to massive box-office breaking productions which come with genre busting techniques, he's done magic in The Prestige, he's done superhero in The Dark Knight Trilogy, to a mind-bending dream world in Inception and finally he's done Matthew McConauhey being sucked into a black hole in Interstellar. His latest is essentially his The Longest Day having trying his hand at a war drama, although it is in fact his shortest film since his 2002 remake of Insomnia standing at only 106 minutes it's an epic feat showing that he doesn't need length. In fact, throughout it's entirety it's one big battle in a slight deviation from that first thirty minute opening of Saving Private Ryan or the big battle towards the end of Hacksaw Ridge no, Nolan kick starts this with the action and refuses to let up. <br/><br/>Dunkirk is intense, set in May 1940 on the beaches of Dunkirk, France 400,000 allied soldiers with teams of French, Canadian and British soldiers are evacuating the battle in a desperate attempt to get home, instead during their fight for survival home comes to them. During this evacuation there are several destroyers, medical ships lead by Kenneth Branagh's naval captain, all while in the midst of German fighters trying to gun them down. There are spitfire's that fly through in protection for the allies flown by a team of pilots led by Tom Hardy's hot-headed pilot Farrier, in the water, Mark Rylance's Man on the Boat is heading towards the war in an attempt to pick up soldiers. A powerful introduction to an intense war drama which is incredibly by Nolan on his IMAX camera, along with the beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's eerily incredible score and it's brilliant. Every scene is handled perfectly nothing feels out of place from the fighter jet's gunfire, through the incredible heroics of Rylance, to the rough waters below Nolan's camera weavers through these intense dramatic moments smoothly not avoiding any detail and it's wonderful.<br/><br/>Where the action is its strongest is in the skies. The allied soldiers are constantly bombarded by German fire, there are allied planes flying in from every corner in a desperate attempt to gun them down. Yesteryear's audience would've settled at watching digital laser dogfights in Star Wars but today we get bullets flying, planes dropping and smoke engulfing the screen and it's brilliant. In addition, unlike any other war film Nolan doesn't linger on the violence of war he doesn't refrain his camera to piles of bodies with there intestines hanging out, or having missing limbs, no here he finds a new path for his focus; the psychosis of it all, the pain of being shot or nearly drowning, the torment of constant gunfire, and the fear of having shell shock a message which Cillian Murphy fantastically conveys. The performances are excellent too, though there is limited dialogue Nolan handles his actors brilliantly teetering through several different perspectives, there's one on the docks, on the planes and on the ground with the youngsters. <br/><br/>However, despite having the star power of his older cast their characterization is sadly limited to their jobs Murphy is just a whining soldier, Rylance is the man on a boat, Branagh is just the naval captain and Hardy is the pilot there's no other characterization that goes beyond that. It's the newcomers who are the real stars led by Fionn Whitehead's Tommy who leads the team of young survivors to rescue, they're put through a string of dramatic moments they are shot at, they are drowned and they are forced to make sacrifices to save themselves. Their performances excel Whitehead is brilliantly quiet he is teamed up with Alex (Styles) who mostly seems disappointed that he didn't fight for his country. The two work together to save themselves and their teammates. Still, despite the slight drop in the older characters, Dunkirk is an excellent piece of filmmaking which excels in brilliant cinematography, a fantastic score, shining camera angles and brilliant performances this is easily Nolan's best film since Inception and it could just be the best film of 2017.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Nolan's latest is an intense war drama which holds no bars to the torture of those men and ultimately pays off in style as an excellent lesson in history."
"shobanchittuprolu","10","8","18","21 July 2017"," Dunkirk is the most realistic war-movie ever made.A Christopher Nolan's Masterpiece (Which is quite common to him).
","Dunkirk (2017): Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest director of this generation who can handle several complexity themes and can make them commercially successful.Christopher Nolan is the name that makes the internet generation of movie lovers go nuts. He is worshiped by them. Seven of his nine movies feature on IMDb top 250. Five of his movies have earned more than $500 million at the international box office. One would assume that such fame must be a blessing for Nolan. And blessing it is, but it also comes with massive burden of expectations.He never disappoints and after a sci-fi masterpiece Interstellar,Nolan made this war masterpiece Dunkirk.All the early reviews already showed that Dunkirk is another masterpiece from Nolan.<br/><br/>Plot: The story of Dunkirk is well known. During the early stages of World War II, Allied soldiers from Britain, Belgium and France are surrounded by the German Army on the beaches of Dunkirk, France. In one of the single largest operation of its kind, commonly known as the Miracle of Dunkirk, around 400,000 soldiers were evacuated.<br/><br/>My Review: Nolan is infamous for his non-linearity screenplays.His Inception,Interstellar,Memento all are mind-bending screenplays.But when he took up the project of Dunkirk,all the fans of his got disappointed.But surprisingly,Nolan even molded this war film into non-linear screenplay. Each of the stories occur in different timelines and then merge together in an explosive and breathtaking finale.<br/><br/>Each and every scene in this movie is an art of realistic suspense.There are lot of tense moments all over the movie.Nolan successfully made us feel the agony of war in all the possible ways.Be it infantry,air force or sea..it is a true horror. You will feel your pulse racing every single moment of the film. In ways more than one, 'Dunkirk' works more like a thriller than an action drama.<br/><br/>'Dunkirk' won't be the film it is without the cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema and the score of Hans Zimmer. The visuals of the film are just extraordinary, be it the wide shots of the beach or underwater sequences. Hoytema does his career best work here after Interstellar.Hans Zimmer's score is inspiring Even beyond the visuals and the score, the film is a technical marvel. I expect the film to sweep all the technical categories at the Oscars, from editing to sound design. I won't be surprised if Nolan himself walks away with the first Oscar of his career.<br/><br/>Last but not least.Nolan made me cry in the climax sequences.He once again brilliantly made audience get tears with his heart-warming climax.<br/><br/>SO,Dunkirk is the most realistic war-movie ever made.A Christopher Nolan's Masterpiece (Which is quite common to him).<br/><br/>My rating 10/10"
"FabledGentleman","9","11","27","18 July 2017"," An attack on your senses
","Back in high school i wrote an essay on what happened at Dunkirk. And i was especially intrigued by Hitlers major blunder to not attack the beach with his tanks. If he had done so, the outcome of world war 2 could have been very different. It was one of the biggest mistakes Hitler ever made, and we should probably be quite happy about that.<br/><br/>When i heard Nolan was going to make a movie about this, i was afraid he would paint the wrong picture and not tell the entire story. Nolan is good at bringing in nuances in his films, but i was still afraid he might forget about the French and the Belgians. And focus entirely on the British.<br/><br/>Turns out, this movie is not at all what i expected. This is not the kind of movie you go see to get a history lesson. Nolan does not go into specifics on what led up to this point in history, and the movie has no character buildup. The movie starts where many other films ends their second act, right in the middle of the action. What this movie does is to focus on the share terror of war, and we see it from the viewpoint of the trapped soldiers on the beach of Dunkirk. Awaiting their fate, totally surrounded, hundreds of thousands of them.<br/><br/>The movie tells three main stories. One on land, one at sea, and one in the air. And it jumps forward and back in time, so you feel you lose total control. And that is exactly what this movie needs, this is all about not being in control. German planes do regular sweeps, dropping bombs on the beaches. Planes and u-boats bombing and torpedoing the English warships. And the allied soldiers just standing there, with nowhere to run, they are basically just target practice for the planes. Who will survive? What would you do to try and survive? How would the consequences of your actions afflict you and your fellow soldiers?<br/><br/>All these questions are at the very core of the film, it is all about survival in the darkest of times, and the movie is carried by Hans Zimmer's hypnotizing score which feels like a psychotic hymn that drills into your subconscious and attack your senses with brute force. It is accompanied with ear deafening sound effects that pound your ears until you feel very unsettled. The imagery presented here are outstanding, with lots of wide open shots in insane resolution. Never have i felt a movie so claustrophobic, using so many wide and open shots. This movie is indeed best viewed on a huge cinema screen.<br/><br/>War is hell, war is chaos, and rarely has it been displayed better than in this film. Nolan has again showed that he can master almost any type of storytelling, and this time he even wrote the script himself. There are times in the film it feels like it might get a bit too sentimental, or that the film overly focuses on a few things that i feel i didn't need to be told again and again. But not before i start to get those feelings, it drags me back in with yet another pounding action scene.<br/><br/>This is like nothing i have ever seen before. It is a war movie told in an unusual way. The movie doesn't have much dialogue, most of this movie is expressed through the eyes of the characters. And the terror in those eyes when the German bombers comes diving down for another sweep, making the most terrifying screaming noise, speaks louder than words. There aren't really any main movie stars in this film, it's the event itself, and the terror of war that is the primary character. And with the great cinematography, the loud sound effects, the pulsing music score, and the intense battle sequences, you feel like you are right there, on that beach. And that is probably the last place you would ever want to be. It is an intense thriller packed with suspense from the very first frame to the last, it never let's go.<br/><br/>This will be a strong contender for many movie awards this year, and it's one of Nolan's best movies so far. That is saying something indeed, the man has a habit of making quite good films.<br/><br/>Highly recommended"
"mrinaldutta90","10","9","21","19 July 2017"," Christopher Nolan's most visceral film till date
","Disclaimer: Being a lifelong Christopher Nolan fan the review may seem biased to many, but Dunkirk is in so many ways not a typical Christopher Nolan movie.<br/><br/>A few words about the screening: It was 6.45 PM midweek on a Wednesday, booked tickets for the first Australian public screening of Dunkirk in its 70 mm glory. Imax Melbourne went to the extent of reinstalling their 1570 film projectors to project this movie as was intended by Nolan. Dunkirk would be screened in both the 1570 film format and its upgraded Dual 4K Digital Laser systems for the weeks to come. <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has been making movies mostly centered on the science fiction genre. That is not necessarily a bad thing. The Dark Knight Trilogy, Interstellar and Inception are all deeply steeped in the genre and could be easily classified as Sci-Fi Action films, but very well made Sci-Fi Action films, some of the best in the genre it is created in. Whereas Memento, Prestige, Insomnia and Following could be roughly put into the Mystery genre. All nine films had something in common, the scripts were based out of works of fiction if not original fictional screenplays. Realism is not a genre Nolan operated in. Neither did he make a movie based on war. Operating in a similar genre throughout their whole career is not a trait of a director striving to be one of the greatest in his generation. Nolan tries to become one of the best in his generation with Dunkirk with one of the most realistic war films ever produced. <br/><br/>Dunkirk is a film about the epic struggle of 400,000 British troops trapped in the shores of Dunkirk as a result of a military disaster, probably one of the worst military disasters of all time. With the German troops closing in on them the only way they could save themselves is to somehow cross the narrow English Channel and reach home. As easy as this sounds the reality of the situation prevented the troops from getting home easily. The shallow shores of the beach prevented big ships to land and rescue the troops and the strong tides prevented small boats to be paddled. Nolan decided to narrate the story from three different perspectives inter-cut into each other- land, sea and air. Each perspective spans out over different time periods, the Land narrative plays out over a week, the sea over a day and the air only an hour. As usual with his films Nolan employs non-Linear narrative to tell his story. Editor Lee Smith plays a very important part in cutting between the three narratives to provide a crisp and expectedly perplexing view toward the story. Match cuts are used expertly to bring a visual coherence between the three perspectives. Nolan and Smith is successfully able to provide different vantage points to the same events taking place in the movie making the experience complete. Dialog is sparse in the movie, and character development very thin. The script is only half the size of his previous films like The Dark Knight which were all heavy on character development and narrative momentum mostly built through dialog. This was done by Nolan advertently as he didn't want the characters to be at the center of the action, he wanted the viewer to be. He also wanted to tell the story by what's happening on the screen rather than what was spoken. The same reason made him cast actors who are not famous faces with the exception of Tom Hardy (who had his face covered like he has for most of his films) and Cillian Murphy who played the character of a scared pilot afraid to go back to Dunkirk. He didn't want the audience to relate to the actors as heroes, just feel the experiences they are having being part of this incredible situation. The objective was to provide a visceral experience to the audience which can only be experienced to its intended extent in a theater. The bullets fired feels it's fired at you and you can smell the sea in the drowning scenes. The tension in the film is gripping. Nolan decided to cut the movie around the 100 minute mark because beyond that it would have been impossible to hold the almost Hitchcockian suspense. Hans Zimmer was masterful as always and played a massive part in adding to the visceral experience, the sound of the ticking clock (synthesized by Hans from a recording of one of Nolan's own watches) plays a very important part in the visceral experience. Van Hoytema shoots this mostly using 70mm IMAX cameras, I could only imagine how difficult it would have been for him to shoot using such a mammoth camera from such difficult vantage points. His wide angle shots are expansive and helps provide the scale of despair we were looking at. <br/><br/>Nolan and his production team delivers and hits the ball out of the park with Dunkirk. People walking into the theater expecting a Dark Knight or even an Interstellar may be disappointed as he shifts his genre and objective with this production. Although Guardian's Andrew Pulver's comparison to Kubrick may be a bit premature, but he is definitely on the right trajectory to becoming one of this generation's greatest."
"Toocooltoobefooled","5","5","10","3 August 2017"," An almost cinematic masterpiece lacking connection and the true grandeur of this event.
","This movie is just short of a masterpiece. It's failing is it's inability to build the suspense and anticipation in the viewer that it tries so desperately to achieve. The first time I saw the trailer I was mesmerized, ""man i can't wait to see that movie."" The second time, a little less. By the 4th and 5th time I saw the trailer with it's constant ticking of the clock and the attempted anticipating buildup at the docks, I felt like I no longer cared. In fact my son reacted in the same way. He also said, i'm not sure I really want to see this movie anymore, I'm kind of sick of all the build up in the previews that never seems to deliver any hint of what it's building towards. The whole movie has that feel. It's all about getting these boys home and there is a constant attempt to build up to something, that just really never arrives. They show the same scenes over and over, but from multiple different perspectives. I felt like I was watching a preview, a coming attraction, that never gets to the point. When I say the movie is a masterpiece, it really is, the cinematography is amazing. The actors, while they have very little dialog, are so authentic you feel like it's 1940. However, there is no back story on any of them and no main character, so there is no connection. This was I think an attempt to build on the theme of 400,000 nameless faceless individuals, but it leaves you disconnected from their plight. The attention to the clothing, the surroundings, all little details are amazing, but it all adds up to a few ships being sunk and a few planes being shot down viewed over and over from different perspectives. You do not get a sense of the overwhelming accomplishment this really was. Think about it 400,000 men having to be evacuated. You don't really see the enormity of it, you only see a few hundred, maybe a few thousand men, a few ships, there were over 800 in reality. The film fails to deliver the grandeur of the true historical event. As a result of all these failings, you never feel the anxiety the film is attempting to create, you never feel the sense of dread, despair, nothing. There is just no connection, just beautiful cinematography. A masterpiece without any direction, without any real connection. Too bad."
"jfss-69191","8","5","10","2 August 2017"," DUNKIRK is a Good Movie
","For me the true focus of DUNKIRK ought to be about the English people who risked all to get their troops off the beach. The scared young soldiers seemed to dominate more than stories of their brave elders who rescued them. The flying scenes and British pilots were magnificent, and especially the courage and valor of the older man and his son to the rescue in their boat. A good movie!"
"benruiz-78852","9","5","10","30 July 2017"," Christopher Nolan has done it again!
","Christopher Nolan has had a marvelous run as a director, especially in the last 10 years. He has been able to adapt his grandiose style into a variety of genres such as the superhero genre (The Dark Knight Trilogy), sci-fi (Interstellar), and ""thiller"" (Inception). With his latest movie he has decided to adapt the infamous ""disaster of Dunkirk"" to the big screen and here, we have another fantastic film to add to his already impressive filmography. Nolan manages to make an emotionally grueling war movie that frankly does not feature any of the genre clichés one might expect. It is solely about the event which means Nolan refrains from ever giving the viewer a moment to breath. Without giving too much away the structure of the storytelling the movie provides is probably its strongest element, that will keep you buried in the films grasp. As well as Hans Zimmer subtle yet effective score which, just like the movie, almost never lets up. The technical aspect of the movie is perfection, everything from the sound design, the cinematography, etc. Nolan once again brings us a technically beautiful film. One small thing to keep in mind is that this more of a suspense movie then it is a war movie but that did not bother me, it is just worth noting. Regardless, this is a fantastic movie that will most definitely be defined as a classic. BR"

","What can be better than returning Home? Nothing..I suppose! Hans Zimmer probably delivered the most riveting and immersive sound experience of his career which essentially keeps the urgency of the matter Alive and Kicking until the closing second. Nolan retorts to his unusual story telling delicately knitting the different horizons between Land, Water and Air which unfolds at their own pace eventually culminating at the goal.<br/><br/>DUNKIRK has it's script limited to the secluded evacuation of Allied forces from the clutches of a dreadful and merciless German army. It's the sheer brilliance of a terrific screenplay and direction combined with a captivating background score which testifies the horrific sequences which the Allied forces would have battled through the intermittent Nazi strikes. The other beauty of the movie lies in the nano aspects taken care of throughout the 107 minutes of visual excellence resulting from a genius Cinematography. One such would be the sequence involving Spitfire pilot Collins to escape his defunct jet somewhere in the English Channel while the water gushes in leaving a dead drop silence throughout the theater. Farrier and Mr Dawson get their share of heroism to display which was essentially a race against time as the enemy was round the corner.<br/><br/>DUNKIRK is probably, in fact, the best IMAX movie which you can enjoy in a 2D atmosphere till date. A movie which essentially demonstrates the emphatic usage of time and resources to represent the cause vividly. A war has it's own emotions associated, returning home is altogether special! Kudos DUNKIRK team, both the real and the reel! 8.5/10"
"redfor","9","5","10","28 July 2017"," My awestruck eyes, ringing ears
","This Nolan Brilliance, from the beginning:<br/><br/>Imagine running for your life, to escape your enemy in a World War. In this case, the German Luftwaffe suddenly releases propaganda leaflets (urging your surrender) on your mates and you. Not dropping your weapons immediately, a sudden burst of bullets downs your unit members, as you frantically flee to stay alive. <br/><br/>Thus is the opening of 'Dunkirk'. It sets the remaining roller coaster ride of death versus survival, often with mere seconds determining the fates of many. Wounded warriors on a ship with LARGE red crosses on its side are also fair game: the ship explodes and floods because not enough Royal Air Force Spitfire fighters are available to defend it.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography are wonderful. Numerous subplots are so closely interspersed that transitions between them may sometimes startle you. But there is no denying that this is a massively, memorable, cinematic classic. Kudos to all involved with its making.<br/><br/>Was the editing fun? As stated during the end titles, this movie was shot and edited using (70mm!) film. It's playing in at least 35 mm, 70mm, digital, and IMAX formats. Standard cuts so smooth they're not noticed, cross cuts, and sometimes the fading in and out of madness and/or darkness, are intense. The 'B-rolls' created with additional cameras are astounding. <br/><br/>The courageous civilians in private boats – seemingly without (except for skirmishes with the German military), serious injury to but one only – is alone amazing. Correct that: a shell-shocked crew member of a sunken English warship causes the demise of a selfless, courageous young man. The private vessel is the 'Moonstone'. The scenes leading to this heartache caused my greatest pause: if one is bleeding badly from the back of their head (and clearly growing weaker), wouldn't it make sense to role him over, to a face-down position? At least then, might the hemorrhage form a life-saving clot?<br/><br/>The history of the Dunkirk rescues raises more questions. Are nurses and doctors not civilians? Are hospital ships, even when saving soldiers, not off-limits to torpedoes? They weren't, just as rescue boats of private civilians were not exempt from attack.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh's 'Commander Bolton' delivers easily-noticed exposition. He quickly states he's not leaving Dunkirk, for there's so many more souls to be saved by the miraculous, civilian flotilla bound from England. Even more rescue vessels arrive, chiming in. Shortly after the film was released, Branagh appeared on 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert', and mentioned the ""Dunkirk Spirit"", which members of his generation grew up with. He also mentioned that some Dunkirk veterans – now in their mid 90's – attended the UK Premier of the movie. Quoting Kenneth: ""I said, What did you think of the film? They said, 'The film was louder than the battle.' "" Colbert's audience laughed loudly.<br/><br/>About 90% of the way into the movie, I had to move close to the rear of the theater. My ears could no longer deal with the volume level of being about a dozen rows back from the screen. You'll feel low- frequency sound effects within your body without damage; your ears may need plugs to fully avoid hearing damage."

","Going into Dunkirk I had no expectations, only because I saw the trailer once and moved past it. It was a friend who got me to go.<br/><br/>The beginning held little dialogue, which turned out to set the tone perfectly, causing me to become immediately immersed into a war torn world (WWII). There was a small bit of reading and as an English junkie, or so I like to call myself, that had me stumped on whether or not it was correct grammar. In the end, it was correct. Other than that, the movie was well paced, full of action, and created a connection with all of its characters. The revisited story made for a movie that will not easily be forgotten in my mind.<br/><br/>Also, Harry Styles played his role incredibly well. I was impressed overall."
"coolantic","7","5","10","26 July 2017"," Good but could have been better
","Went to see this yesterday, since my uncle was at Dunkirk and there is an apocryphal story about him and a bike which I hoped might just be featured (it wasn't of course). Unfortunately, being the age I am, I will automatically compare this film with the 1958 version, rightly or wrongly. That version of course has character story lines whereas the 2017 version doesn't. I was impressed by Nolan's use of extras rather than cgi, but I have to say that the beach looks more crowded and chaotic in the earlier film which of course would also be using extras. It has been mentioned ad nauseum that the differing time windows for the three parts of the story cause confusion and this has to be admitted. I lost count of the number of aircraft shot down, only to realise belatedly, I was watching the same scene in a different time slot. Regarding the aircraft, again commendable that Nolan used real planes, and everybody loves to see a Spitfire in the air but, we needed more of them. Couldn't he have pinched some footage from the Battle of Britain, or even resorted to the dreaded cgi? Having said that, Tom Hardy helped us all realise just how difficult it was to get an enemy aircraft in your sights and then how much effort it took to actually shoot it down. However, the explosive sound effects were awesome. When the Stuka bombs hit the beach, I felt the explosions coming towards me rattling the rows of cinema seats. Similarly, the firing of the anti-aircraft gun from the ship made me feel as if I was next to it on deck! I also felt in the initial scenes on The Mole, the soldiers looked too clean and not like they'd just been chased halfway across France but, this was rectified in the end when they were boarding ships looking like scarecrows. Others have mentioned that the Nazis are not mentioned. A shot of a couple of German panzers and troop-carrying lorries advancing down a French country lane would surely have added to the air of menace and desperation. But, in the end, I'll admit to having an enjoyable afternoon watching this film; and my eyes did prickle a bit when the little boats appeared on the horizon. I thought they'd banned smoking in cinemas!"

","...However, if you go to see Dunkirk under the impression of having your mind blown by the next great wartime classic of our generation, then you may be slightly disappointed.  I admit I was in this group.  Earlier on, I mentioned Nolan is my favorite director, and he still is.  But after watching him in previous works do things like dismantle the predecessors of the superhero and sci-fi genres in one shot each, I wanted so badly for him to do the same with the war genre.  I wanted to leave saying, ""Tom Hanks needs to step his game up now with the historical war films, because Nolan set the bar higher again!""  But I didn't find myself saying thatat all.<br/><br/>To read the full review, please visit www.reelmoviesmatter.com"
"joeravioli","6","5","10","23 July 2017"," Visually stunning, but emotionally unsatisfying
","At the risk of sounding like a fanatic, Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly the only one we can trust to save original, franchise- less cinema from extinction. His willingness to create wholly original spectacle, mayhem grounded in reality, crafted with skill, sensitivity, and a deep, but mellow Tarantino-esque affection for the freedom of the silver screen renders him the most admirable big- budget blockbuster director working today.<br/><br/>Which is why it's such a goddam shame that his biggest films aren't that great.<br/><br/>Dunkirk recounts the story of the Dunkirk evacuation, probably the most celebrated event of the entire second World War. Hundreds of thousands of British soldiers found themselves pushed back by German forces to the beaches of Dunkirk, so close to Britain that they could see it. Stranded between hell and high water, the British soldiers seemingly had no choice but to wait for the Nazis to pick them off, one by one. In desperation, the British military commandeered everything that could float, from fishing boats to pleasure yachts. And with these small boats, around three hundred thousand British soldiers were saved, at least until they returned to battle. It remains an impressive story even now, not as a military victory, but as a wonderful example of human action, much like the Berlin Airlift of 1948. It can't exactly be labelled as a humanitarian effort, but the fact that so many lives were saved makes it very tempting.<br/><br/>The film tells this story through a tense narrative divided in three: land, sea, and sky. One narrative follows a young British soldier as he attempts to escape the beach, another follows one civilian's attempt to help evacuate, and the third follows an air force pilot as he battles the German airforce above the waves. While this division of narrative allows for more of a story to be told, it ultimately reduces the effect of the film. We are told all three stories at the same time, Nolan cutting from one to the other in a choppy manner, not giving any one story the opportunity to form any sort of emotional resonance or any one character enough screen time for us to develop sympathy for them. The result is a curiously thin experience, curious because each story is rousing enough, but together and at the same time, they become weak. While Interstellar wallowed in maudlin nonsense, Dunkirk finds itself on the opposite side of the spectrum: virtually devoid of feeling.<br/><br/>All that being said, the film is nothing to sneer at. The plane scenes, while occasionally disorienting, are very thrilling, Hoytema more than pulling his weight in that department. The soundtrack, which ticks like a time bomb throughout the entire film, provides the film with a wonderful intensity that kept me engaged and excited. And whatever fears you may have about this PG-13 war film not accurately depicting war in all its horror and brutality, let them rest. Nolan doesn't shy away from the peril of the circumstances, one particularly frightening scene of soldiers burning to death in the middle of the ocean making this clear. However much Nolan was wooed away from the human side of storytelling by the technical aspect of the entire thing, it's always fun -- and terrifying -- to see a great director at work.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, Hardy and Murphy perform as expected. But of all people, Harry Styles brings it to the table with surprising gusto, outperforming veteran thespians like Branagh and almost even Rylance. It's worth noting that he has no formal training as an actor. However, the drawback of his performance is that he emerges as the only truly compelling character in the entire film. Everyone else, perhaps excluding Murphy's character, is boring, existing as only a ragdoll for all the spectacle and fury to toss about.<br/><br/>Dunkirk isn't a bad film. It's a good, maybe even a great film, turned into somewhat of a mess by non-linearity. There are rousing bits, moments of peril, and a few that are undeniably beautiful. Watching the film and taking into account certain strokes of creative genius, you'll know that you're in the hands of a great director.<br/><br/>However, you're not in the hands of a great writer, and that perhaps makes all the difference."
"yrallabandi","8","5","10","23 July 2017"," Nolan does it again.
","Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk has been perhaps one of the year's most awaited movies, quite rare for a war film. The man has been behind some of the best movies of the 2000s and 2010s, such as Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Prestige, Inception and Interstellar.<br/><br/>So how does Dunkirk fare against his other works?<br/><br/>Quite well, actually. Dunkirk is an amazing movie, and you can really tell Nolan put loads of effort into it (the film was a passion project of his, apparently). The guy certainly knows how to direct a film, deftly weaving through multiple plot lines. It's a visual achievement: The film looks gorgeous, even in the digital screening I was subjected to. I can only imagine how incredible the IMAX 70mm version was. And yes, the film is rated PG-13, meaning there's not as much blood and gore as an R-rated movie like Saving Private Ryan. But the way this film is shot, it doesn't need it. The blood and gore may be an added bonus at best, or a gratuitous distraction at worst.<br/><br/>The same can be said for the swearing: Of course, there is the usual PG-13 swearing (and even 2 f-bombs) but nowhere near the level of, again, Saving Private Ryan. But the way the dialogue is written, you probably wouldn't notice. Speaking of dialogue, there's not that much in it. This is a departure from Nolan's usually verbose scripts. He often lets the cinematography and sound design do the story telling.<br/><br/>Speaking of sound design, there is some incredible work here. It is quite realistic, making the experience more immersive and terrifying; I can see an Oscar nomination in this area. The score is also insane: Thunderous and tense, this one is probably one of Hans Zimmer's best works, and that is saying something. He is one of the greatest composers working in the film industry.<br/><br/>So, tight direction, beautiful cinematography, smart dialogue, incredible sound design and a fittingly intense score - why did I still give this movie an 8/10?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the shallow characterization is more than a small handicap to the experience. Nolan did this on purpose, but this is one of his decisions that, in my humble opinion, backfired. None of the characters are given any substantial character arcs; we don't even catch the names of a few (which sadly include the lead of the movie). This makes it difficult to latch on to the characters and care about why they're fighting. The closest we ever come to any character fleshing-out is Mark Rylance's Mr. Dawson, and even that isn't much. It's an unfortunate choice, and prevents this movie from being the ""masterpiece"" it probably could have been.<br/><br/>Overall, though, I was really impressed with Dunkirk, and I'm really excited to see what Nolan does next."

","Parts of the movie are very good but most of the movie left me thinking ""that didn't make sense"" or ""that it wasn't really engrossing"".

It's like the music to a murder scene designed to drive you to clench your hand around the armrest and prepare to be scared... But this movie never reached any climax and I felt cheated by that music leading me to the next dull outcome. <br/><br/>I have already warned my friends and now I'm warning you to not set your expectations too high."

"bwh-44688","7","5","10","21 July 2017"," Worth seeing, but not Nolans Masterpiece
","Dunkirk review spoiler free unless you know how history turns out lol. First impressions: sound effects are loud, makes me feel like I'm in a war, music from Zimmer is great and at times I felt like it sounded very Similar to interstellar soundtrack. The pacing is pretty quick through the whole movie and it does jump back in forth between characters (air, sea, beach, civilian boat). You get a blend of thriller/war feel as each character life is constantly put in danger. This is NOT saving private Ryan or band of brothers. The violence as intense at all; their are lots of explosions, bombs, dog fights, sinking ships, and chaotic swimming; but you won't see men bleeding out on the beach or picking up body parts. This movie is very much focused on the navy and air aspect of the Battle of Dunkirk. Hardly any land gunfights at all. You won't see men storming bunkers or fighting house to house. Favorite character was the old man boat captain. Hardy does well but has a face mask on most of the time (doesn't sound like Bane think god). Harry Stiles actually did well and is placed as a Everyman character that just wants to get home. Interstellar, The Dark Knight and Inception are better movies than this one IMO but you can definitely tell this has Nolans fingerprints all over it. Overall 7/10"
"lordbusiness19","3","54","183","16 July 2017"," Too many confusing story lines about individuals
","I had the opportunity to preview this movie and was very excited to see it as I am a history buff. **Spoiler**As the movie starts out, we are introduced to a few characters, whose names were either never said, or I could not hear them. (The background sounds--the ""subtle"" music that was playing while the characters talked, or sounds of walking, just any ambient noise--was so loud that it covered much of the dialogue, and the sound effects of the war were headache-inducingly loud--don't know if that is the movie itself, or the theater--but why wouldn't the dialogue have been louder as well if it was the theater?). So we have these characters, and then all of a sudden the story shifts to some other people, who don't seem to have any connection to the first few characters. And then we shift to more new characters, and then to more. All in all, there are about 10 story lines going on, I guess to tell the story of Dunkirk from more than one perspective. However, the movie seems to just randomly jump from one character story line to another without connecting all of them, or having any kind of overall plot arc (other than the story lines are all about Dunkirk). It reminded me of the multiple story lines from Love Actually, except that in that brilliant movie, all the story lines are connected and make sense together! <br/><br/>I wish the focus had been a little narrower, and stayed on one or two characters and their experience, rather than showing a breadth of experiences, but no depth. There was no character background given on anyone, so I never developed any kind of connection with any of them. As there was no character background, there was also no way to develop the characters. They all seemed very flat. And surprisingly, unlike almost every other WWII movie out there, there was no ""historical synopsis"" at the end--you know, like ""Dunkirk was a success, and is the only time in history that civilians were called on to aid the troops."" (I don't know if that's true or not, just saying something they might have said), or some little nugget of history that really finished the story. <br/><br/>Overall, it was filmed well and acted well, but I felt like the dialogue was lacking to really tell the story of the characters, and the dialogue that I did hear was not sufficient to enthrall me or help me to know the people involved. So disappointing that we don't get to know those characters better, I think their stories would have been very interesting, and lent a greater depth to the movie. But the stories, their experiences, just aren't there."

","Dunkirk. I have never heard of the events of those fateful days during WWII. Thank you Mr. Nolan for bringing this incredible human story to life. And you pulled it off by peeling back the fluff most movies have nowadays to keep us focused. No obvious special effects (if there were, I didn't catch them), no over-the-top explosions or a silly love story to pull our heart strings. No, you managed to keep me enthralled for 106 minutes by keeping things simple, and transporting me to the Port of Dunkirk. In your typical style, you did get me to the edge of my seat. I genuinely, on an emotional level, felt what our protagonists were going through. I was cold, thirsty and feared for my life every time I heard those engines.

"msbreviews","9","6","13","6 August 2017"," Rating: A
","Some things are undeniable: the sky is blue, fire burns and Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors alive. His originality in the way he tells a story is always mind-blowing and very unconventional, which makes some critics' minds go against him simply because they just can't understand the brilliance of said director.<br/><br/>Once again, Nolan directs the hell out of this movie! Not only his storytelling is very different, it actually fits perfectly into the film's line of events. Once you get it, it literally makes you go ""Oooooohhhhh, so that's what you wanted me to understand. Cool!"". The fact that he used 6000 extras plus real boats and planes from that era elevates the movie's realism. The real locations make the whole film look stunning and the cinematography is pure perfection.<br/><br/>As for the story itself, I gotta emphasize on this: it's literally a WAR movie. From the very first shot, BUM! You're in it! This might be one of the best (if not THE best) pure war film in history: the dizzy air fights, the bombs constantly being dropped on the beach, the gunshots, everything feels and SOUNDS so real! Hans Zimmer's score proves that he's one of the best composers ever ...<br/><br/>For the first time in my life, I honestly felt sick and uncomfortable watching some scenes on IMAX. Normally, this would be a negative, but not on a war film like this: it delivers the message it wants in the most REAL way possible. If I didn't feel well, seated on a chair, watching a war going down on a screen, I can't even imagine what it's like to actually experience it.<br/><br/>The cast is great, especially Mark Rylance as Mr. Dawson who brings a needed level of emotion to the movie, Fionn Whitehead as Tommy who we follow throughout the major part of the runtime and also Harry Styles as Alex who surprised the hell out of me, the kid can actually act!<br/><br/>Like I said above, this is a very unconventional film which portrays the war in its most horrible and fierce state. There's almost no dialogue during the whole runtime, there's no chat around a fire where the soldiers talk about their pasts and families, there's never a moment to rest. That, for me, it's perfect because it depicts the war as it probably was! I can't imagine people having dances and chats on the beach while bombs are being dropped, so this aspect of the film, for me, it's as real as it can get.<br/><br/>However, this leads me to my only issue with this movie: its characters. Since there's no backstory to any of them, I can't really connect or get attached to a single character. I understand that that's exactly what Nolan wanted, but the truth is that I didn't feel scared for someone's imminent death or worried that someone might not make it to the rescue boats ... God, I needed to go to RottenTomatoes to check some of the characters' names because I couldn't remember them! They are nothing to me because I know nothing about them ...<br/><br/>Still, I can only see this as a minor issue for me because I can understand what Nolan was going for, I truly can. Dunkirk is about the EVENT and not the people in it.<br/><br/>The whole movie gives me that sense of danger and urgency with the thrilling air fights, with the soldiers' fear in their faces every time a plane goes by, as well as their hope every time they go away. The worry and sense of duty that the sailors show navigating into the war to save their fellow compatriots is emotional and captivating ... Every single one of these aspects elevates the film in such a way that I can't look at it and not see a perfect portrayal of WAR.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Nolan does it again. His unconventional storytelling and beautiful cinematography, as well as Hans Zimmer's score, turn Dunkirk into one of the best war movies of all time! From the dizzy air fights to the bombs being dropped, everything feels incredibly real and scary, which makes this film probably the best portrayal of a war in its most fierce state. The cast is great, the characters not so much, but the story is about the event that happened and not about the people in it. So, go and (try to) enjoy a war through a screen without throwing up or leaving your seat: after all, you are safe ... They were not.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"
"CANpatbuck3664","8","6","13","3 August 2017"," Dunkirk is an Intense and Memorable War Movie About Courage Against Insurmountable Odds
","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* I would normally do a plot summary but the movie Dunkirk is so focused on telling the story of this escape in a unique way that even giving you anything but the bare bones information feels like giving away too much. If you know your history, the evacuation of Dunkirk took place over approximately a week from May 27, 1940- June 4, 1940 where Allied troops (predominately British and French) were forced out onto the beaches of Dunkirk by the German army. With so many soldiers in one place and with the Allies lacking clear evacuation plan, it made them easy targets for the German air force and navy. The lives of over 300,000 soldiers hung in the balance. This movie primarily centres around soldier Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), mariner Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) and their heroic efforts in this conflict.<br/><br/>A lot of Dunkirk will take your breath away. The best parts of Dunkirk are white-knuckle tense and I found myself breathing heavier and trying to turn away from the screen. The movie envelops you and puts you right in these soldiers' inevitable doom. This movie wants to place you in the middle of the action and they accomplish that on every level. There are scenes of soldiers drowning or being burned alive that are just gut-wrenching. I've seen some war movies feature similar scenes but I think that Dunkirk might have performed them best.<br/><br/>There is so much in Dunkirk to be appreciated and Christopher Nolan's commitment to practical effects and filming things in a unique and interesting way are chief among them. The action here is mind-blowing but it feels grounded and that makes it more effective. Nolan could have rested on his laurels and just turned anything out but it feels like he took this story to heart and was committed to bring an understanding to the world of how important this event was in British military history.<br/><br/>Dunkirk takes a surprising turn in that there aren't a lot of big name actors despite it being a Christopher Nolan project. That isn't to say the acting is lacklustre, the cast does their job admirably. Instead of relying on the material, they have to let you know through their body language and their expressions. Tom Hardy is his normal excellent self, he can convey more with just his eyes than some actors can in their whole bodies. Mark Rylance also does good work, he's good at being reserved yet he can really get you to feel. Kenneth Branagh also fares well, he's a veteran and he does his job capably. Fionn Whitehead is excellent for a relative newcomer. There are many more actors and I didn't find a weak performance among the cast.<br/><br/>I do have some small complaints about the movie. The first is that even though the movie does detail the timelines of the main characters, things can become confusing when the stories interweave with each other. Second, it can be hard to distinguish who lives and who dies because you don't have any personal knowledge about who each actor is playing. The characters blend together at times and there were a couple of emotional deaths that I couldn't figure out who didn't make it until I could determine it from a process of elimination. My biggest complaint is that the beginning and the end of the movie drag a little bit. I feel like that even though this is a fairly short movie, they pad certain things out or the movie falls in love with its cinematography (which as mentioned above is phenomenal) and forgets to tighten things up. I also found the score a little overbearing early in the movie but that concern faded away as the sound editing and the haunting musical choices are excellent at producing horror and nail-biting suspense are great on the whole.<br/><br/>If you think about high points and low points, Dunkirk's highs place it an elite category of war movie. The look, the action and the fascinating story can stack up against the best of the best. My low points weren't wrecking the movie for me but it did take me out of it here and there. I'm so glad I got to see Dunkirk on the big screen though, even if I was a couple of weeks late. It's a movie to be seen in the nicest theatre you have around to fully appreciate it. I applaud Christopher Nolan for taking on this story and even though this isn't my favourite movie of the year or even my favourite war movie, it is a valuable piece of cinema in its own right. If you can, I definitely recommend you check it out on the big screen if you can."

"carolethecatlover","9","6","13","20 July 2017"," The big picture on a personal level.
","All British people know the story of Dunkirk, but few other nationalities may. A written prologue of what happened and why might be useful for other nations. Also, what happened to all the French? It tries to encompass the entire event by telling the story on the land, on the sea, and in the air. All the actors are superb. The sets are amazing. I felt dirty, wet and cold after watching it. As a movie it cannot be faulted, but it is not enough of a documentary for those who don't know the story. Also, I understand that 100s of small boats took part, but only a few are shown. The Spitfires are the real stars of this film. Aerial dogfights have not been seen (outside of star wars) for decades. The Music is annoying and distracts from the 70mm visual action on beaches and in the air. Do see it in 70mm. Take a blanket and a cup of tea."
"Jesse_Ung","8","6","13","20 July 2017"," An immersive, visceral experience.
","Dunkirk plays almost like an old-fashioned disaster film. The film follows characters on land (Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard and Harry Styles), on the sea (Mark Rylance, Barry Keoghan and Tom Glynn- Carney) and in the sky (Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden) - each with a very different role to play in the events that unfold.<br/><br/>Director Christopher Nolan paints visual poetry with Dunkirk. Shooting on film in 70mm, IMAX-- the whole nine yards pays off with relish. The film is beautiful to look at and the carnage is jaw- dropping. I had the pleasure of being invited to an IMAX screening of the film and having the images truly fill your field of vision immerses you even further into the events on screen.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's score sets the viewer on edge from the very beginning - a distinct ticking sound permeates most of the score. That, paired with the ear-ringing sounds of explosions and gunfire - which often occur without warning, establish a sense of dread and unease that an attack could happen at any moment, no matter how calm an on screen exchange may be.<br/><br/>There is a certain level of emotional detachment throughout most of the film, albeit with certain moments that pop. I think this works in the film's favor in that we see that some soldiers will do whatever they must to survive - with one expressing that ""survival isn't fair"". This isn't a rousing war film with swelling strings and beautiful sunsets. Dunkirk is grimy and grim with death at every corner. There is a sense that the suffering of its characters do not end when the credits roll.<br/><br/>If I were to note any caveats, the pacing is a little wobbly in its second act as the film bounces between characters, and some may take issue with the repetitive, prolonged nature of certain sequences of carnage. That being said, these caveats are minor. <br/><br/>Nolan has crafted a beautifully tense and viscerally immersive spectacle that you should see on the biggest possible screen you can find. Dunkirk is an experience to behold."

","Story telling:<br/><br/>This movie is one original and unique experiment on how best an ordinary story can be told in a very very intriguing non linear way.<br/><br/>It is the same known story from the history books, told from three different points of view, spread across three different time duration, moving at a three different paces on three different elements , intervening with other time lines finally converging to one breathtaking climax.<br/><br/>First is from the POV of the soldiers, on the ground, spread across a week, gloomy dull sky, with constant fear on their faces. Second is from the POV of the civilians with boats, on the water, spread across a day, with sacrifice for home as the emotion. Third is from the POV of the royal air force, in the air , spread across an hour, blue sky and bravery against all odds. All the major incidents in the story line are shown from all three perspectives and edited in such a brilliant way that one has to put their brains to work on to know if they have already seen that from a different perspective. Every time, something is assumed, Nolan comes back with a surprise in a different time line only to remind you that this is his movie!<br/><br/>How is it different?<br/><br/>It is not a conventional story. It does not start with an innocent young lad, volunteering, bidding adieu to worried family and loved ones, fighting in the combat zone, coming back victorious with head held high to the fluttering flag.<br/><br/>Its not about damn characters and there are none(spoiler: there is no Batman and Robin too). Its just about the war. Its just about the action. No god damn lines to put on your bedroom posters.<br/><br/>Overall - worthy of the money you spend on expensive ticket at IMAX with Dolby Atmos surround sound. Only boring part is when they paused in the middle to sell popcorn."

Every scene sounds like a nerve-wrecking, pulse-pounding climax. The problem for me is that there is no coherent story and you don't really get to know the main characters.

","It's INCREDIBLE! But some people are blind and deaf... physically and emotionally too it seems.<br/><br/>It used barely any CGI, and it wasn't a standard mainstream Americanized action-packed movie with clichéd characters. It didn't need any elaborate dialogues or ""heroes"". Nolan conveyed the emotions through classic cinematography (i.e. real planes, real people, real boats, and real locations i.e. no green screens) and through a haunting score (music track) by Hans Zimmer. It's a masterpiece. It's more about humanity and our struggle to survive. War isn't ""fun"" as some films portray it to be... War is about survival, death, sacrifice, betrayal and being in the present moment at all times. <br/><br/>I was blown away."

","This is not a film. This is not a story. This is an experience. See this film at your loudest, largest theater. Nolan's next masterpiece immerses you into an intense war-zone experience with incredible visuals and directing. Unlike most conventional films, Dunkirk does not focus on the characters and their backstory, it has no time for that. War has no time for that. Instead it focuses on one thing and one thing only; escape. Every moment of this experience has you on the edge of your seat, cringing, biting your nails, all because of the intensity of the score alone. I enjoyed every single second of Dunkirk because it forced me to. There was no part I found boring. I truly felt that I was trying to escape from Dunkirk myself. I can't say that about any other film I've seen."
"tyson-hunsaker","9","7","16","22 July 2017"," An intense and terrifying IMAX experience unlike any other.
","The latest film by Christopher Nolan takes a substantially different approach to how the audience experiences another real-life based war event from our history. Make no mistake of it, this isn't a by the numbers war epic with character arcs and dramatic dialogue. Nolan utilizes the spectacle of practical effects, core-shattering sound design, and genuine shock and terror of survival in war to deliver an intense 1 hour and 47 minute roller coaster. It was bold, different, and frankly terrifying.<br/><br/>The film presents three different perspectives: beach, sea, and air to immerse the viewer into the various and thrilling aspects of the events of Dunkirk. Each perspective gives an interesting context to how the events unfolded and at first, it was difficult to grasp the timeline and when things were happening in relation to each other. However around halfway through the picture, the pieces fell together naturally and made a cohesive movie; surprisingly without too much effort from the audience to ""figure out"" (which one can come to expect when watching a Nolan film).<br/><br/>During the presentation, a genius element to the film became quite clear which felt consistent with the actual event. While the characters got no back story and the protagonist/antagonist relationship was essentially nonexistent, the intention and execution of why Dunkirk was made the way it was became clear. During these events, no one had time to become personal with anyone or care where they were from. They didn't want to talk, relax, connect, or continue fighting. They wanted one thing: survival. They wanted to go home and not experience this anymore. So does the audience feel the same way. As precisely effective as the experience was, I wanted to leave. I became so blown away by the reality of what I was watching that I was begging the film to end. Moments made me feel sick to my stomach (and definitely done so deliberately by the extraordinary filmmakers). The audience will ""survive"" this experience of Dunkirk and it's difficult to say it's enjoyable but assuredly one of the most unforgettable experiences in a theater.<br/><br/>Pacing was perfect. The score was thrilling and constant like a ticking time bomb that won't stop. Acting was decent but nothing that stands out. Technically, it's the marvel of the year that can't be missed (especially in IMAX). Having earned the title of ""masterpiece"" it's difficult to see myself watching this again and even rushing others to go see it. It's something you can't quite be prepared for and maybe something that's difficult to make it through. I'm amazed at the cinematic ability Christopher Nolan has at showing us how when a master can understand the rules of movies so perfectly, he can break all of them to mold and change the medium of filmmaking to something we can't expect."

"brodyreyno","10","7","16","21 July 2017"," One of, if not the best Nolan films yet
","Dunkirk is more than a simple summer blockbuster. It is a thriller with masterful directing, execution, and music. It is a work of art.<br/><br/>Let's start with the practical effects. There isn't any CGI used in the film. All the planes, boats, and explosions are real. It adds to the authenticity. Hearing the Stukas as they bombed the troops on the beach was terrifying and made you wonder what exactly it felt like to be on the beaches of Dunkirk in May 1940. The spitfires and ME109 German fighters were amazing too. <br/><br/>The Stukas are never seen from an aerial view as well, just from ground, really selling the dread and fear people felt when they heard its infamous whine as it swooped down. That was captured perfectly in this movie. The aerial combat looks very good, and is done with real planes. It is amazing. <br/><br/>There isn't a lot of dialogue in this film and there isn't a central character to develop. That may be a bad thing to some, but I don't mind it. It is telling the story of the battle rather than a person's story during the battle, and I like that.<br/><br/>All three phases of the battle, air, seas, and land are shown and three different groups of characters are portrayed. It does a great job jumping from phase to phase.<br/><br/>This movie looks incredible. The sets are all practical, the explosions are real, and the performances are great.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer made a great score that builds intensity, adding a ticking clock to the pieces to build suspense. This movie is suspenseful and a thriller meant to show the terrors of war, rather than the horrors (not the same thing). Every moment had me on the edge of my seat. It was intense.<br/><br/>The film is only one hour and forty seven minutes, which is quite short for a Nolan film, but it feels longer because of the constant action and suspense.<br/><br/>Dunkirk should be considered for movie of the year. It is one of Nolan's best films. He can do no wrong it seems.<br/><br/>10/10"

","For those of you who watched the movie but knew nothing about what took place at Dunkirk, you still don't. According to this movie this magnificent heroic event only consisted of a couple dozen boats, a couple of airplanes and a few hundred men. I think this was an insult to the thousands of civilian heroes manning the largest ever civilian flotilla rescue in history by ignoring that little item. I don't know what they were running from because the only Germans (other than a few planes) that we saw were a few at the end that seemed to come out of nowhere, kind of like the bullets being shot at everyone. There was so much drama and action and heroism that could have been shown, it could have made a dozen movies. This is obviously what happens when a young person decides to do a film of an historical event by leaving out the historical patriotism and heroics that made the event what it was at the time. If you are in a certain age range you don't have the ability to feel or be sympathetic to the patriotism and sacrifice that went with the people that lived through world war II. The current war battles that younger people would be exposed to are nothing compared to what soldiers AND civilians lived through during that time. The ""young"" director/writer is unable to relate to that so decides to forget about it to shoot something he can relate to, survival. I hoped for a whole lot more from this film but was left terribly disappointed at the obvious lack of historical fact and drama that actually took place at Dunkirk in favor of the ""single man"" viewpoint that a ""young"" director could comprehend."

","My WW2 knowledge is very limited and i never heard of Dunkirk before this movie. I still don't know much about it, it seems it's a town or some place, where a WW2 battle took place. 
And i guarantee that the vast majority of people don't know much about it either, so, you basically have to know the plot of the movie before watching the movie. Because you won't get it from the film. It's just a bunch of guys that don't talk much and try to run the whole movie from an invisible enemy. 
Oh, and a plane pilot that shoots other planes, although that was confusing, i wasn't sure if there was just a pilot we were following, or more that looked similar. Even during the battle i could not understand if he was shooting the other planes or the others were shooting him. Everything was a mess.
I don't expect everyone to hate this movie, but i know a lot of people were just as confused as i was which makes me very intrigued by the high ratings it received."
"danimation88","8","3","5","3 April 2018"," Dunkirk
","A crispy clean, thunder sounding of a war movie. It made me almost regret not watching it in theaters. The blu-ray of this movie made my tv sound like a home theater system. Dunkirk tells the story from three different points of view. A gaunty British soldier, a civilian rescue boat, and a fighter pilot. The thing that makes it unique is that each point of view is different lengths of time. They are a week, a day, and an hour respectfully. I was initially confused about the length for each viewpoint. But I realized that it is like having a race between a turtle, a runner, and a car. The car is the farthest, the runner is closer, and the turtle is the closest. The thing is that they each start at the same time and finish at the same time. And each situation and viewpoint intertwine with each other. The editing for that must have been a challenge and hats off to the editor. Other than the excellence of a technical cinematic experience, the film didn't do much for me. I didn't feel any real dread or tension during the times when it should have, some scenes went too much longer than they should have but the big thing was the rating. For me, there is always a ""what if?"" aspect to war movies, especially WWII movies, that are PG-13. As if the director is not willing to make it as realistic as possible (I should look into why Chris Nolan didn't do that. Maybe the battle of Dunkirk wasn't that bloody and I'm just a bloodthirsty kind of guy). But that really did take away the validity for me. There are bombs and bullets going off and the soldiers appear unscathed. There is no sense of consequence, just bleakness. The sense of life comes from the excellent sound, as if you are actually part of the group ducking away from the fighter jets that come across every once in awhile to take out the troops."

","I have seen a lot of movies in my 70 years of life and I think that this one was the worse. I rented it because I enjoy war movies but this one was a big disappointment.<br/><br/>After a very brief opening scene of typical war violence, the lead character when to the beach and took a crap.....really. He dropped his pants, squatted down and did his business, then covered it up a token amount, pulled up his pants and wandered off. I have never seen any such thing in a movie. It was disgusting, and to start the show that way? What were they thinking.... oh... maybe they were not thinking.<br/><br/>As the show progressed, there was very little dialog, no real story line, no real character development and even the war violence was not that good. Mostly, people stood around a stared at the water as the movie switched from one unrelated scene to another. The air combat scenes were fake looking and in few spots somewhat unbelievable. <br/><br/>The rescuers did not say much either as they piloted they boat. They were portrayed as a mind numbed lot out to do their duty, rather than the bold courageous folks that there really were.<br/><br/>There was very little explanation of what was really happening and nothing told about how the rescue effort was organized. Then suddenly, a few boats showed up and boom! Everyone got rescued.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time. It was a boring movie and I could hardly wait for it to be over.

The whole ""soundtrack"" of this movie surely will not be sold as a CD like other many movie-soundtrack did because its NOT music and the mood it catches doesn't fit to 80% of the film, not even when they switch from one scene to another the ""music"" keeps its disturbing perpetual loop... Some scenes are quite good and dramatic and no music would have fit better than this.<br/><br/>Then the historical catch up fails big time.

","Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors and easily a very talented one. I had high expectations when I heard he was making his war movie and taking on a significant Battle during the war. Many great directors like Spielberg have sought to make great war movies and now Nolan was adding this to his resume, I was excited. <br/><br/>Dunkirk had a great start but that's where it ends. The film was somewhat disjointed and did not flow too well. The film was ambitious and looked at the Battle from different views but sadly this did not seem linear and while viewers could get the idea of the battle a number of unnecessary and even confusing scenes distorted the overall premise. As in real life the majority and most of the focus should have been on Dunkirk and the rescue effort but instead we had other scenes from Tom Hardy and an unwanted cameo from Harry Stiles that did not add value to this film. The acting was also sub par, we didn't see any breakthrough performances to carry the film. <br/><br/>Overall a decent film with great cinematography but the exciting trailer, subject content and Nolan's involvement did not make this a great film. This was my honest take on this film, I see people are acting like sheep and giving high ratings. This is nowhere near the masterpieces Nolan has made like the Dark Knight Trilogy or Inception but its not too bad. <br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Dunkirk: While in one place all hope might seem lost, in another place someone is making sure hope remains intact.<br/><br/>Dunkirk, is the life story, shown in land, air and sea, of 400,000 brave soldiers who couldn't make it home and are readily waiting by the French beach for the British military to come pick them up. Both, British troops and Nazi troops give a start to this movie. The British army finds it stuck on the beach and with their enemy's threat roaming them. On one side, the Spitfires offer their help on the skies by taking out the enemy's planes. On the other side, ships filled with soldiers and civilians are sailing towards Dunkirk, in order to rescue the troops that remain alive. The movie occurs in several places simultaneously; The pier: For one week, the things happening in the beach of Dunkirk in France start a week prior to the zone's evacuation by the military personnel. The sea: One day prior to the troops' retreat, civilian and military boats are summoned to the rescue of the troops stuck on the French beach. The skies: One hour prior to the military retreat, the aerial battle between the British and the Nazis. It's important to highlight that in every place the movie takes you to; a specific character gives that moment its life and relevance. In the pier, Tommy, a British soldier is stuck on the beach alongside thousands of French and British troops. While on the beach, Tommy finds another soldier burying a body. This soldier, later on reveals his true French identity and it's named Gibson by the British peloton. Tommy and Gibson enter the first ship, the one that hits the pier, with a wounded soldier on a stretcher and save the third soldier of the crew, Alex. Tommy, Gibson and Alex enter a second boat which ends up being torpedoed by Nazis. However, Gibson refused to enter into the dining hall because he couldn't afford to raise any suspicion by the fact that he was a French soldier passing as a British one. Gibson ends up saving Tommy and Alex's lives after the torpedo hit, which ends up saving Gibson's own life. It's time to analyse now what's going on in British waters, where the most influential character is the ethical Mr. Dawson, owner of a fleet of boats for entertainment purposes, comes into play. He's a former navy member and father of two kids, one whom is already killed by the war. His helper, a young boy, ends up going with him and sadly being killed after an altercation with a mentally ill soldier they rescued in the waters. Mr. Dawson is a guy who is as ethical as they come, for him; the first thing is to do what's right. He does not only care about his business or being safe, his ethics do not allow him to do that, he feels the need to help others and use his stance of privilege to do so first and foremost. He is socially aware before anything else. The third place where things occur is in the skies, The British send 3 pilots, two of them who die rather soon and Farrier, played by Tom Hardy who becomes the biggest hero. Their mission is to prevent Germans to attack the beach so people can evacuate successfully and safely. Farrier ends up taking most German air crafts by him and ends up clearing the beach from aerial threats all by his lonesome after his mates end up dying. Another ethical character, his duty before anything else, including his life. To conclude with, Dunkirk is about accepting, it's about honor. It's about being grateful, there's honor in surviving, even though you don't come off as victorious from a battle and are forced to retreat, your bravery is enough to be deemed as a hero. And on the other side, being a hero does not guarantee your survival. Both concepts, of heroism are related in plenty and multiple ways."
"fattoconamore","Null","3","5","21 August 2017"," Waiting to be dead
","Summary of the movie:<br/><br/>This movie is about one of the most important strategic operations done by The Allies, known as the Dynamo Operation or The Miracle Of Dunkirk. The operation consisted in the evacuation of Allie soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk to England. At the time the soldiers were waiting on the beach, the Germans attacks kept coming. Despite all the dead in those beaches, the Britain army saved around 200.000 soldiers and destroyed several German planes.<br/><br/>Analysis:<br/><br/>This movie is very emotional, but the feelings are not transmitted by words. Music, body movement, expressions and stages were the channel between the film and the audience.<br/><br/>I chose to analyze one particular scene at the beginning of the movie, when the main character (The Britain soldier) saw other french soldier burying a dead Britain soldier to wear his uniform so he could have the chance to get out of that infernal beach. Despite of hurting the french soldier, he helped him to bury the man, after that they stood next to each other trying to get inside the boats ahead to England. I think this scene shows us how humanity should work. CSR has a target: Humanity. Countries, companies, organizations, institutions, governments, people should work for the well being of human kind. In this, It did not matter that the soldier he saw was french, he knew he had the right to live and it was necessary to help him. <br/><br/>Another situation that got my attention was when the sailor from England (The one that was going to Dunkirk to help those soldiers in danger) refuse to go back when the saved soldier told him what was going in those beaches.<br/><br/>He knew it was dangerous from the beginning, but he also knew that was the right thing to do. In company of several small ships they saved a really large amount of soldiers from the Germans. That bravery should be copied by the organizations. He demonstrated that if we work with good purposes we can achieve big things. People should think about other people. <br/><br/>I think every institutions in the world has to know that the final reason of everything they do is to help our communities. If you sell a good or service you can not forget that you are trying to help people's life, not just to earning money to olive comfortable. Once they understand that CSR would be present in every institution."

","It's not that Dunkirk is a bad movie, it's just not as amazing as the advertisements or Box Office gro$$ lead you to believe. Between the lack of character development, and the uneven, time switching perspectives this movie was hard to follow and hard to invest in. Dunkirk has some interesting, moving scenes and historical info, but for the most part, it is slow and awkward. It took a while before I even realized that there were scenes being shown out of sequence. There is little done visually to inform you that a different perspective or flashback is happening. You'll see a plane looking down on a sinking boat and then a scene or two later you see people on shore boarding what looks like the same boat, and a few scenes later you realize you jumped back a few hours in time. I'm not sure why they chose to format the movie with all this time jumping when there was only a matter of hours between the flashback scenes, not days or years. It just made the film confusing. Your mind is so busy trying to work out the scene order and playing catch up, that you aren't concentrating fully on the details of the movie and you're not able to just enjoy it unfold. There are definitely a few standout actors, but because there are so many characters and very little character development, along with the weird formatting, most of the scenes have you struggling to figure out who is who, and which actors match with each story's flashback. Maybe if you read this before seeing the movie you'll go in more prepared and be able to follow the film better than I did. All in all, although it is worth a look, Dunkirk is not as awe-inspiring and impressive as other war movies, like Hacksaw Ridge, Saving Private Ryan, The Great Escape and Sergeant York, in My Humble Opinion. 8/2017"

Shocking as the events may seem on the screen, the film fails to connect the death and destruction with a broader cause that the British were fighting for against Hitler. Despite the uplifting ending, the movie never makes a case for why the losses were worthwhile. Absent the same,the movie gets only a qualified favorable review. Worth seeing, but not best picture material by any means."
"jim9tan","Null","3","5","2 August 2017"," Limited in scope
","A big project. It has scale and intensity. <br/><br/>Dunkirk is now a mythical moment in history. The film is a welcome reminder of the tragedy of WW2 as ordinary men are crushed by the weapons of modern warfare. <br/><br/>There is much horror. Screaming men on fire in a flaming ocean. Soldiers burrowing for cover against aerial attacks. Trapped soldiers going down with the ship. <br/><br/>On the other hand, there isn't much gore or body parts.<br/><br/>Shown from the shifting POV of infantry men, pilots and sailors. We get a view from the ground/sea, then the same scene viewed from the air.<br/><br/>What are the film's weak points? <br/><br/>It provides a narrow claustrophobic view of the beach operations. There is no appreciation of the terrible tactical decisions made by the commander of the BEF. <br/><br/>He made the unilateral decision to abandon the fight without proper preparations for the evacuation or rearguard protection.<br/><br/>There is no insight into the triumphant Germans, or the plight of the French civilians. Insufficient tribute to the terrible losses suffered by the Little Ships of the evacuation.<br/><br/>As the events cover less than a week, there isn't time for character development. Does not have the same impact as The Bridge over The River Kwai.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Interesting but not memorable. Recommended for those who like immersion, without getting their feet wet."
"alexandermangoldt","8","3","5","31 July 2017"," Great film...but exceptional...I'm not sure!
","First of, I enjoyed (for lack of a better term) this movie. I wasn't exactly on the edge of my seat, but there was suspense and I wasn't bored one bit by what I was offered on screen.<br/><br/>Having seen quite a few war movies (Platoon, Apocalypse now, Saving Privat Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, All quiet on the Western front, etc.) and having read a lot of war novels (The Naked and the Dead, The Thin Red Line, From Here to Eternity, etc.) I have come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as an anti-war movie or anti-war film. It is my contention that young men will continue to be easily lured into the military because it offers something they supposedly miss in their private life: action! I know, because when I was eighteen I signed up for an additional two months to my mandatory military service because I was keen on getting away from home and I had no idea what awaited me. Fortunately, I didn't stay long enough to be picked for IFOR or KFOR.<br/><br/>Dunkirk will not keep young men from joining the army for certain aspects that I find in a lot of war films. For example, the protagonists are almost always good looking (Fionn Whitehead as Tommy) and they have always a great character (Tommy aka Whitehead protects the French soldier who poses as an Englishman). War also allegedly offers young men the chance to prove themselves, to grow and to turn into men (Tom Glynn-Carney as Peter - Mr. Dawson's son). Apart from that, you also have acts of bravery and heroism that appeal to young men (Tom Hardy as the heroic pilot who risks his own life to save that of others). And there are these moments of patriotic triumph that you find not so often in Dunkirk but which do exist and seemed to me typically Hollywoodish (not sure this word exists): the moment when the private boats arrive or the moment when Commander Bolton aka Kenneth Branagh sees the boats arriving and says ""HOME"".<br/><br/>All in all, I don't see how an entertaining film like this is supposed to make young men consider war something dull and boring. An actual anti-war movie to me would be a man who refuses to pick up arms and kill other men and escapes to a place where there is no war and hides there until things blow over. I just don't see Christopher Nolan making a film about that and turning the protagonist into a hero.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, I'd like to point out the things I liked about the movie: The fact that most of the film is about survival and not heroism, the fact that almost no CGI was used, the fact that the pictures are beautiful and impressive in every sense of these two words, the fact that it mostly spares us typical (American) patriotism and the fact that the German soldier remains almost completely invisible instead of being portrayed as evil as it happens in so many other war movies.<br/><br/>But there are also things I had problems with: The score by Hans Zimmer. Don't get me wrong, I like the score, but I believe some scenes would have worked better if there had been silence. I perceived the music in this film as a tool intended to dictate my feelings, and I don't like it when music tries to tell me what to feel. Especially the boat arrival scene was a caesura to me, until that moment I had experienced the film as rather naturalistic in style and then in this scene it turned into Hollywood.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This film is good and thought provoking, but other war movies have done that before, so I don't think Dunkirk stands out among the other war movies I have seen. It's different in parts, but it is also a very typical war movie in other parts."
"dbogosian-1","8","3","5","23 July 2017"," Tensely gripping but hard on the ears
","There is much to like in this film, particularly if you like to be held in continuous tension for the better part of two hours. The screenplay interweaves 4-5 different story lines, all happening somewhat simultaneously but presented in not-always-chronological fashion. It's sometimes disconcerting, but there are many moments where you get to view an event from two or three different perspectives, which is very creative and adds interest. The narrative is of course harrowing, but you see it not so much through the eyes of a few individuals, but of the collective whole. In other words, the story doesn't dwell very much on any particular soldier or airman, and the ones depicted pretty soon all blur into one.<br/><br/>The one exception is the Mark Rylance character, the boat owner who takes his sons into a war zone and thereby saves a couple dozen lives. His selfless courage and dedication to his mission is memorable, though I found his stoicism in the face of personal loss and tragedy almost too much to believe.<br/><br/>The movie does an incredible job at immersing you in the battle scene, the confusion and madness and chaos. The air-to-air dogfights were easily the best I've ever seen; just the footage of the Spitfires, Bf-109s, and He 111 were worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>However, there were some serious flaws. Most notably, one's ears are continually assaulted by super-loud noise. Perhaps this was an attempt to be realistic, but it went overboard. Every explosion, every round hitting a metal hull is over-amplified and painfully loud. Even scenes where ordnance is not being detonated come off as too loud, and I found that I could understand only a small fraction of the dialogue. Fortunately there isn't much dialogue and it's not very important, but it's still annoying. <br/><br/>The story line is also fragmented and disjoint, with too many things going on at once. If they had stuck to fewer story lines, focused on a few of the men more closely, then I might have been more drawn to their fate. In the end, when the survivors reach England, I felt elation because of national pride and all that, but not because Private so-and-so made it home alive, since I knew nothing about him or what he was coming back to.<br/><br/>Finally, I wish some aspects of the high-level strategic planning had been depicted. Who decided to requisition the little boats, when, how did they implement that plan, what sort of political dramas were played out among the Admiralty and the Government? This would have added historical depth and relevance.<br/><br/>PS: upon a second viewing, the film got a WHOLE lot better. Definitely need to see this twice."
"Parks","4","9","23","22 July 2017"," Dunkirk or ""Christopher Nolan Wants To Hit You Around The Head With a Bat""
","There's not much said in ""Dunkirk"" for a lot of the time. Occasionally, officers heave into view for some handy bits of exposition, but mostly this is a film where the soundtrack consists of tortured metal grinding, diving bombers screaming, engines roaring and Hans Zimmer's score.<br/><br/>And what a score it is. More industrial BWAAAMPS and thuds, as if the sounds of battle were not horrific enough.<br/><br/>It's to make the point that war is hell. I get that. Although I've also come to the conclusion that war could potentially be worse if it was accompanied by a Hans Zimmer score.<br/><br/>The story mainly consists of one event that took place during the Dunkirk evacuation, seen from three different points of view, that you then see three times during the movie. Yes, playing around with a non-traditional narrative structure is cool and clever. But it's also kind of pointless in a film like this.<br/><br/>I mean, we in the audience sit there, potentially in suspense - will the thing that we've seen happen twice before in the movie happen again the third time?? Well, of course it will. Suspense gone. Patience running thin.<br/><br/>The movie ends abruptly on a note of patriotism. Nothing wrong with that. But hearing Churchill quoted as Elgar swells isn't exactly subtle is it? But Christopher Nolan seems to have lost touch with subtlety. He wants his audience bludgeoned, beaten, BWAAAAAMP'ed into submission. I think I'll stick with David Lean."
"xnikcac","10","9","23","20 July 2017"," Just one word. SPECTACULAR.
","I went to see the movie last night and didn't want to have my hopes and expectations high, I usually do that, if I wait for a movie to come out for over a year, so I am not completely overpowered by the hype of seeing the movie finally. From a start, in second or third minute of the movie I had tears in my eyes. It may have many reasons, why. But even the start made me feel like, its gonna be good. And as it starts, the movie is packed, Christopher won't let you take a deep breathe, there isn't a single boring scene. You will be constantly on edge, and even though I know the whole story, I know a lot about WWII, i still hoped everyone included in the movie will survive. Also seeing how important the boats were, when I confused-donated last year to get one back to museum, it just made me really happy seeing how even a slight help can mean the world. Fionn was realistic, easy to believe and easy to love and support and cheer for him not to die. Harry Styles did a spectacular job, knowing that guy for about 5-6 years from the medias and the ex boy band, he outdone himself. He did everything so right and everything seemed so real. Cillian Murphy did amazing job, I truly could feel his emotions trough the screen and it just proved me he is one of the greatest actor of this age. Also, Tom Hardy, doing as much as he could till the end. If you are emotional about what happened in the war, you will definitely will be happy about how this movie was filmed, how great it was and how every character was real enough for you to tear once or twice. I am actually going to see that movie again tonight, and probably will later than on DVD, just because it became my favorite movie, replacing Gone Girl and American Sniper quite easily. Definitely recommend."
"bkoganbing","9","7","17","27 July 2017"," The Citizens Mobilize
","Dunkirk played a small part of that classic from the World War II years Mrs. Miniver. If you remember Walter Pidgeon took his small craft out and said he would be returning the next day. You then see his boat joining other small craft and then there's an armada of them heading down the Thames and out to sea. They were heading for Dunkirk and were going right up to the beaches where the large naval vessels couldn't go and taking several hundred thousand British soldiers and a few French who later became the basis for the Free French army headed by Charles DeGaulle.<br/><br/>There's's mention here of Winston Churchill and Sir Bertram Ramsey whom I believe was First Sea Lord. The only criticism I have of Dunkirk is that I would like to have had some scenes with the top decision makers as we saw in such films as Patton, MacArthur, The Longest Day, the Battle Of Britain, and others. Especially in The Longest Day we saw the ordinary soldiers and their story mixed with the brass and the critical decisions they were making.<br/><br/>On the plus side Dunkirk is a film wonderfully cast with several poignant stories about what was being done and the sacrifices made. My favorite is that of young Barry Keoghan all of 17 who comes on the small craft of Tom Rylance and his son Tom Glynn-Carney just to be part of a great adventure. His performance will bring a few tears to the eye. Of all in the film I hope young Mr. Keoghan will get some notice for a Supporting Actor Oscar.<br/><br/>No doubt Dunkirk is in line for some technical awards as well in addition to the big one. With 10 now in the race for Best Picture I have no doubt that Dunkirk will be one of the ten.<br/><br/>I've always loved the story of Dunkirk and how that island nation put aside its differences among the subjects and worked together to get that army off the beach. Make no mistake this was citizen mobilization at its finest. No matter what your views were unless you were an out and out Nazi sympathizer you knew what getting those troops home meant.<br/><br/>Nothing less than the fate of civilization itself."

","I saw ""Dunkirk"", starring Kenneth Branagh-Jack Ryan:Shadow Recruit, Valkyrie; Cillian Murphy-In the Heart of the Sea, 28 Days Later; Tom Hardy-The Revenant, Inception and making his movie acting debut, Harry Styles-He is from the boy band, One Direction.<br/><br/>This movie was a bit of a dud for me. It is based on true events in 1940 during WW 2. It's directed by Christopher Nolan-Interstellar, The Dark Knight movies and Inception.The movie looks great. But, it is incredibly boring. Maybe die hard history buffs might enjoy it more than I did. For those unfamiliar with the situation, the Allies, including the British, Belgium and French soldiers, were surrounded at Dunkirk, France on 3 sides by German forces, with the English channel at their backs. It was about 26 miles across the channel to Dover, England. The troops were trying to evacuate while being pounded by German forces, including enemy planes. Kenneth plays the leader of the English forces just trying to get home. Cillian and Harry are a couple of soldiers that get stranded off of sinking rescue ships and Tom is an Allied fighter pilot trying to protect the escaping boats from being sunk. It is a testament to the spirit of helping people in a crisis-British civilian vessels were used to help ferry soldiers across the channel-with about 360,000 of the 400,000 troops eventually being rescued. But it is not so much as a war movie but more of a rescue and evacuation movie. There are a few air battle scenes, but overall, it was just slow. It's rated ""PG-13"" for war violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. It might be alright as a rental."

","Just got back from seeing Dunkirk. 5 out of 5 is my rating. I have a special affinity for WW2 flicks, and this one kept me engaged and the music and sound gave it a dimensional feel without the aid of matrix floating and blowing up space ships. To top it off, it had my favorite actor Kenneth Branagh who I have been following since 1983 and his career with the Royal Academy and his early Shakespeare offerings, and even before his marriage to Emma Thompson. Was surprised to see him since I had not read up on the movie before I saw it with the Mom. Since I loosely follow the WW2 string of battles this one will leave those who have no knowledge of the a fore mentioned, at least engaged and not wanting to go to the bathroom. The movie combines 3 stories that intertwine at the end. Mark Rylance is a pleasant surprise, if you are familiar with his work in Bridge of Spies. Good film to educate teens on what happened with the era of their Great Grandparents. Recommend. Be sure to see on the biggest screen and sound system possible."
"frasermcconnel-70795","10","7","17","21 July 2017"," Apocalypse Now, Saving private Ryan now we can add Dunkirk to the list.
","Christopher Nolan is arguably one of the greatest movie directors in recent history and some of his movies will go down as one of the greatest in a respected genre. After his release of a highly confusing, yet satisfying Interstellar movie, we had to wait three years for another release. Dunkirk is Christopher Nolan's first war movie and shortest movie ever released and that are only some of the important facts to know before seeing this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Since we already know the ending, there is not much point in describing the plot. We are placed in the year 1940, when the battle of Dunkirk took place in France. The story follows three different perspectives in the World War II â€“ mole, air and the sea. Each sequence pictures the struggles of their respective units to save the wounded and do their part in the Dunkirk offensive.<br/><br/>In order to fully emphasize the importance of the battle of Dunkirk, Nolan used very little CGI and even used some old artillery in the movie. One of his most frequent collaborator, Hans Zimmer did the score for the movie and it is easily one of the most important parts. The rescuing scenes with the sense of Zimmer's music will give you chills. And don't get me started on the Imax 70mm shooting. Just go and see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Nolan managed to tell the story about WWII and he did not only manage that, but this looks like a documentary. Fionn Whitehead is not only debuting in a major movie role, but he represents the faces of all the soldiers that survived the Dunkirk attack. I firmly believe that from this day on, the term for the greatest war movie of all time will add one more title. Besides Apocalypse Now, Saving private Ryan now we have Dunkirk as well."

I understand it would be a struggle to have nearly 400,000 extras on set, but surely nowadays it can't be that hard to digitally add them to the film.<br/><br/>Poor from start to finish."
"wilsr","1","4","8","2 September 2018"," How can a film this bad be financed?
","I was delighted when I finally tracked down a Bluray version of Dunkirk: it is a movie I had been waiting to see since it was released.
What a disappointment: no, disappointment is too weak a word. Disgust is more appropriate. Disgust with myself for being taken in by the professional reviews and especially for wasting 1hr 46m of my life.
The cinematography is superb - some of the best I have seen. There - that's it: everything else is truly awful.
The dialogue is barely understandable. The background music - why have background music anyway? - is unremittingly dreary, banal and mindbendingly tedious. Much of the acting could have been panned by an audience at the village amateur dramatic pantomime.
The only reason I could thing of that the discombobulated storyline - if indeed there is one - is so was an intention to display the disorientation and terror war produces. It doesn't actually do this: the total lack of narrative in any meaningful sense firstly irritates and then engenders a fury at the waste of time and money represented by making this monstrosity.
Because of the way the film has been envisaged and constructed, without any character development I found I had absolutely no connection with the people in it, and no empathy either. Nolan may have wanted to show various soldiers in the same situation, but as a plan it just doesn't work.
Comic relief is provided at times: a spitfire with a dead prop glides at various heights for an eternity, even with flaps down. Bullet holes appear in the hull of the ship in groupings that would win medals in the local firing range.Branagh displays several varieties of facial rictus straight out of Python. And so on.
And NOTHING - not even a mention - of the War office decision making, the on-the-fly planning and logistics which made the Dunkirk rescue of much of the army a ""success"".
You may ask - so what did I really think about this movie?"

","What a shame. I was hoping for the definitive modern 'Dunkirk' film. This isn't it.<br/><br/>Right from the start the film fails to offer an overview of unfolding events, instead presenting the viewer with massed British and a few French troops on a beach with no explanation as to how they got to be there. The style is annoyingly disjointed, switching continually between a Spitfire pilot, a small rescue boat chugging across the channel, and various troop predicaments. Irritating background music is meant to create a mood of tension where there is none. You don't even get a sense of the magnitude of the rescue operation. What happened to the huge flotilla of small craft that braved the dive bombers? I counted a group of about fifteen boats, and that's it. In an effort to link the whole mess together Kenneth Branagh keeps popping up wandering up and down a makeshift jetty looking stern/emotional as required. The subject matter deserves much better than this.<br/><br/>
If you are still thinking of seeing this film then here comes the spoilers and some ridiculous errors that you will be inflicting upon yourself.<br/><br/>1) A Spitfire pilot shoots down an implausible quantity of aircraft before running out of fuel. Just how much ammunition is he supposed to have then? He's not finished yet however. He then appears to pull off an amazing feat by downing a final plane even though he has now been gliding at low level for what seems quite a few minutes. What! Give me a break! Also, wouldn't pilots be under strict orders to bring their aircraft home in order to fight another day? This chap burns his perfectly serviceable plane on a French beach and gets himself arrested.<br/><br/>2) A group of troops in a beached leaking fishing boat decide they need to lose weight in order to re-float it. While they argue over who should be forced to get off at gun point, tons of water flood in up to their chests, rendering their deliberations pointless. The viewer has figured out this failure of logic already of course but still has to watch. It could be a good moment to consider visiting that cafe down the road for a cup of tea and a sausage sandwich and not bother going back.<br/><br/>3) A soldier swimming in an oil slick has oil everywhere except his eyes and mouth. I am fairly certain that one of the horrors of a face full of crude is that it pretty effectively blinds you. A couple of shots later and most of the oil has washed off. I don't think so. No points for realism here either then.<br/><br/>I would advise going to see this film expecting it to be awful, then you won't be disappointed. A Bridge Too Far was a war film done properly. This is the opposite."

One reason it's confusing at first is due to it not being filmed chronologically; but honestly, after a little while, that is one of the unique and saving parts of the film. The movie follows three separate sets of people with different missions, but the same goal. The unique part is, that they show several of the scenes from all three points of view.

This rescue saved so many soldiers who were able to return to battle later in the war it is remarkable, because the Nazis had superior equipment and manpower at the time.

"HillstreetBunz","5","4","8","30 July 2017"," Well told, dramatic and moving, if abstracted, story of a key WWII moment.
","The beginning of this obviously genuine and heartfelt version of an emblematic story of the broader British narrative within WWII seemed confused and out of time (I even wondered at the scenes of Dunkirk seafront which seemed to look as it does today, full of late 20c buildings)! Such distinct lack of context early on seemed deliberate (those who don't know this part of WWII history may take a while to be hooked) there was no mention of the Nazi war machine, or even the Germans, the ill defined and absent of menace foe was only briefly referred to, and then just by that almost passive verb 'enemy'. Sensitivity to our own time perhaps robbed the early narrative of immediate tension, and subsequently required a much longer build towards any real emotional involvement.The device of weaving the three services into a single set of events was an effective and engaging one, although director Nolans ever present commitment to convoluted story telling sometimes led to this viewer playing catch-up with which protagonist was where and at what point in the time line of the story. As one would expect from a director with his credentials, Nolans delivery and handling of action scenes was always impressive, but as the story unfolded and we started to gather some more intimate knowledge of the characters, and the complexity of the reality of the individual protagonists stories, as well as the moral fudging that is of necessity a part of war, this became an appropriately dramatic film and an ultimately satisfying version of one of the defining moments of the conflict, with enough emotional wallop to bring a tear or two to the eye. Rylance channelling the late and much missed Sir John Mills brought an Everyman integrity to the role that most reflected the story of the 'little fleet' that we know represented the best spirit of the British home front. All in all a very good film prevented from greatness only by an apparent unwillingness to fix the story fully in its time and place."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","4","8","30 July 2017"," One of the most disastrous events in British wartime history depicted in a less than triumphant but hardly disastrous film
","Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.<br/><br/>'Dunkirk' had me interested in it from the get go. Not just because Nolan was the director, though he is to me one of the ""appreciated"" directors than a personal favourite, and, while all his films range from decent to outstanding, again from personal opinion only 'Memento' is a film without faults, so like him and his films but don't consider them the best thing since sliced bread. There was also the involvement of Hans Zimmer, who has penned some great scores (both in his collaborations with Nolan, being a regular, and elsewhere) and a cast that includes Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy. Plus 'Dunkirk' was based off one of the most disastrous events in British wartime history, actually cited by Winston Churchill as ""a colossal military disaster"".<br/><br/>Seeing 'Dunkirk', after hearing a lot of acclaim but also a lot of divisive opinions on both sides, there was a lot to admire about 'Dunkirk' but, although it is a visual, technical, audio and directorial masterpiece, it is not the triumph of film-making it could have been. As far as Nolan's films go for me it's a lesser effort, meaning often impressive but flawed where ambition gets in the way of execution, feel exactly the same way about 'Interstellar' which has similar strengths and flaws to 'Dunkirk'. Personally do feel strongly that regardless of how disappointing it would have been to others it is a long way from a 1/10 film, even if the film didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4 at least from me.<br/><br/>Let's start with the strengths first. First off, 'Dunkirk' looks amazing, so far being one of the best-looking films of the year. Very evocatively designed, atmospherically lit and the cinematography is dazzling with some grit but also some audaciousness. Nolan's direction is often superb, especially in the very visceral spectacle, and on an audio level it is just as big a triumph. The sound is constant but didn't bother me, coming from somebody who can have hyper-sensitive hearing but is used to loud noises and high volume (necessary for the experience) when going to the cinema. If anything it added to the authenticity.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's score has garnered a lot of praise, acclaimed from most in part, but has had some dissenting opinions. Count me in as someone who loved it, there is an ominous quality but also a pathos and rousing bombast that enhances the pulsating heart-beat.<br/><br/>The action is often enthralling, and there is some nerve-shredding tension and some heart-wrenching emotional pathos (like in Cillian Murphy's performance). Loved the performances as well, the best coming from a quietly dignified and understated Mark Rylance who can say little and still speak volumes with just a small gesture, his eyes and his facial expressions. Kenneth Branagh's role is not a large one but he does make much of it. Nolan regulars Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy command the screen effortlessly, Murphy's shell-shocked soldier in particular is genuinely moving. Was absolutely shocked in a good way at how good Fionn Whitehead's and Harry Styles (on paper an insane casting choice) feature film debuts were.<br/><br/>On the other hand, what makes 'Dunkirk' less than triumphant is that the characterisation, writing and story are on the messy side. Didn't mind the minimal dialogue and understood completely why it was done, did mind that the characters were underdeveloped and severely lacking in depth, one never gets to know them which is a shame because the acting is so good.<br/><br/>'Dunkirk' has been criticised for being emotionally cold and not getting enough into the horrors of war. Do agree with those criticisms actually. There are times actually where both actually come through, there is tension and suspense, there are some harrowing moments and some poignant ones, but we don't want moments, we want consistency. 'Dunkirk' is not horrifying or gut-wrenching enough (for war films it is fairly tame) and does lack consistent emotional investment.<br/><br/>Nolan could have done more with the historical side of things, it is a good thing that a good deal of people here have knowledge of the event but it can't be assumed that everybody knows about it or all the facts, nobody expects a history lesson but there was a missed opportunity in this regard. While being a technical and visual masterpiece, some of the editing is chaotic in places, as an epileptic it was just about bearable but still felt too much even for what it was trying to do. Lastly, while having a non-linear structure is not a bad thing (Nolan did it with 'Memento' and masterfully) how the three stories were told did get confused at times and it was hard keeping up with the constant back and forth.<br/><br/>So overall, less than triumphant but hardly disastrous. Often impressive but problematic. 6.5-7/10 Bethany Cox"
"kriskennedy-79484","5","4","8","29 July 2017"," Not the kind of movie I expected...
","First let me say that I give this movie top marks for cinematography and how it tells the story strictly from the standpoint of the soldiers on the beach at Dunkirk and the difficulties they faced in escaping the continent for England. Unfortunately at this point the movie loses relevance and goes downhill in a serious way because for any movie depicting events in wartime it is essential that the story be told from the opposing side as well. Christopher Nolan would've been well-advised to watch just about any other film about WW2 from the classics of the 1960s and 1970s up to and including Clint Eastwood's portrayal of events in the Pacific theatre with Flags of our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima.<br/><br/>I believe Nolan's response that portraying the German side of the story as irrelevant today is completely misguided but also a distortion of history in the worst possible way. The fact remains that the Allies were able to escape from Dunkirk ONLY because the Germans halted their advance for a period of 48 hours and yet none of this is depicted in the movie or the conflict that may have existed among the German High Command at such a decision and why it was made. Suffice to say this level of breathing room allowed for the successful evacuation on the scale it occurred and not merely because of a few rickety boats coming across the Channel helmed by sporting yachtsmen who answered the call on behalf of Jolly Old England. Its almost a hagiographic assessment of the British when in fact they themselves saw how doomed they were in the words of Lord Gort, the commander of the BEF who stated ""I must not conceal from you that a great part of the BEF and its equipment will inevitably be lost in the best of circumstances"". Which it was in point of fact as the amount of material left in Dunkirk took quite some time for the British to resupply and even then only with American assistance.<br/><br/>I really wish I could've given this movie 8 or 9 stars because the potential was there for so much more but shooting it in 70MM film just isn't enough to merit a higher rating in my view when a great deal of the story here was completely omitted. For those unfamiliar with these events in time, and in truth Dunkirk is one of those war stories not frequently told, it serves to inform a younger audience in a misleading manner about what really happened, how and most certainly why."
"itscree","7","4","8","28 July 2017"," Lack of Connection
","Dunkirk is beautifully shot, its score is wonderful and it's sound puts you right in the action. The story has some okay moments but overall I didn't feel even remotely connected with any of the characters which is a shame. Perhaps the lack of dialog is meant to symbolize the stress of the situation but if that is the point the actors all failed. Anything could have happened to any character and I would have had zero reaction."
"robertguttman","7","4","8","28 July 2017"," Disjointed Movie:
","The story of Dunkirk is one of the most dramatic episodes of WW-II. However, as presented here it is disjointed, difficult to follow. Worse still, there are too few individual characters that the viewer gets to know well enough to care about very much.<br/><br/>The movie is presented in such a disjointed manner that the viewer is completely disoriented as to time and place. One scene is at night, the next is in broad, sunny daylight. In one scene the sea is calm, and in the next the wind is blowing a force 7 gale. Worse still, apparently the same scenes are presented over and over again from different perspectives. I'm sure I will be told that this was done deliberately, and that I simply do not understand the new style of filming.<br/><br/>One of the most annoying aspects was the inaccuracy of some of the things that went on. For example, the filmmakers laid a great deal of stress on one scene in which a fighter ditches in the sea, and the struggle the pilot goes through to get out through the canopy, which is stuck closed. I only mention this sequence because it is one which the filmmakers deliberately chose to dramatize by showing it over and over again, in great detail. The point is that one would think that it would have been part of basic RAF pilot training to open the canopy BEFORE ditching in the sea. That is the sort of thing one would think that an RAF pilot would have been trained to do, and would do instinctively. In other words, there is more than enough real drama in the story of Dunkirk without coming up with phony material such as that. <br/><br/>Incidentally, this business of showing the same scene over and over again may be the ""new way"" in filming, but all it indicated to me was that the director was padding his movie. In other words, it seems to me that the movie could have been half, or even a third as long, and still told the same story without leaving anything out. In fact, while watching Dunkirk I could not help thinking of Noel Coward's film, ""In Which We Serve"", part of which also recounted the story of Dunkirk. Somehow Noel Coward managed to say everything that needed to be said about Dunkirk - and he did it in about seven minutes."

There is plenty of action that feels and sounds better at the movie theater.<br/><br/>Now, The movie was not outstanding, and not Nolan's best work (hard to top The Dark Knight). However, It definitely was a very interesting and well-done film. The action scenes are definitely there, and I always felt like I was on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>There is a constant track playing in the background of nearly the entire movie that gets your heart rate up a little bit, and just adds to the already thrilling adventure. There's not really a ""story"" like there is in other war movies (i.e. Saving Private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge, etc...) There is a plot, which is mainly rescuing the British soldiers from Dunkirk, but it doesn't feel like a cohesive story. However, it works... somehow...<br/><br/>The two characters who were most prominent in the movie rarely spoke, but that doesn't feel like a negative. I think it was actually a brilliant move, sort of to show how intense war was. They seemed so shook up all the time, like they weren't even able to talk at all. <br/><br/>All in all, between the wonderful musical composition, and Nolan's superior directing and writing skills, this was a good movie.

"littleging12","8","4","8","24 July 2017"," A Masterful Technical Achievement. Can't say the same Storytelling-wise.
","Christopher Nolan's newest film ""Dunkirk"" tells the true story of the evacuation at the titular location where allied forces were miraculously shipped across the British channel by civilian boats. Christopher Nolan does what he does best and puts the viewer right in the dead center of this significant battle of WWII. The result is an immersive, realistic, and intense experience that better give Christopher Nolan his first Oscar nomination for Best Director. However, the film did not meet the hype (at least my own personal hype being my most anticipated film of the year) with its unnecessary non-linear storytelling, emotional detachment, and pretentious cumpulsion for uniqueness. <br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" started out with a very jumpy bang. Christopher Nolan throws the audience right into the action and never lets up with the thought of an imminent attack lurking at any moment. The opening scenes are cinema at its most grandeur. The usage of practical effects for the ships, planes, buildings, soldiers, and locations are outstanding and say a lot about Christopher Nolan's dedication for telling realistic stories. The strafing runs and dog fighting scenes are directed to perfection and for a split second make you forget you are watching a movie. ""Dunkirk"" is undeniably gorgeous that'll definitively win Oscars for its craft.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" may be a winner on a technical scale but a movie needs a little more to be a truly remarkable film. A common complaint about the film is a lack of character development. Going in, I knew this would be a more visceral film with little dialogue where the emotional core banks on common human empathy. Christopher Nolan wanted to focus on the event of Dunkirk, not the characters, but it is hard to feel for these people especially when you don't even know their names. Frequent Nolan collaborator, Hans Zimmer, provided the score, and he delivers with pieces ranging from gut-wrenchingly intense (Supermarine) to searingly hopeful (Variation 15). A misstep the film took was overplaying Zimmer's score which ended up toning down the actual sounds of bombardment. I even had trouble hearing some of the dialogue (upon first viewing) resulting in a lot of confusion on what was happening when there were dialogue driven scenes. I couldn't even judge the acting because half the things people said didn't register, but at least everyone looked the part.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan structured the film with three different perspectives -- land, air, and sea -- all interweaving at a critical point. Some perspectives last longer than others (an hour, a day, a week) and Nolan jumps around between perspectives without any indication where the viewer is at in time. Some may think this is a clever and unique way to tell the story but it just killed some of the tension when you see the same scene for a third time, or when something is about to climax and it just cuts away. Nolan overcomplicates a quite simple story. He tries too hard to be unique when certain conventionalities would have been more effective like making his film R-rated for maximum realism and intensity.<br/><br/>Given the potential, mastery, and high expectations, ""Dunkirk"" is a bit disappointing. It's a sensation for the eyes and ears but it leaves your brain in a knot further causing a blockade to the heart. It's a film that in order to fully appreciate, must be viewed on the big screen. For all of ""Dunkirk's"" flaws, it's still one of the best theatrical movies ever made, and can't be missed in theaters. 7.5/10"
"RussHog","7","4","8","22 July 2017"," Amazing visuals, lacks character development
","This movie tells the true story about the battle of Dunkirk - a small town in France taken over by the Nazis and the British soldiers had to be evacuated. The only problem is - the navy is too far away to help and the Nazis are moving in for the kill. So a civilian fleet of ships launches to rescue them.<br/><br/>The movie takes place from the POV of three main characters - a pilot, a civilian boat captain, and a solider. There are other supporting characters such as a commanding officer and a shell shocked rescue.<br/><br/>The German soldiers are basically never seen - but when they attack the scenes are really harrowing. Nolan does an amazing job with the battle scenes and the epic score that holds the suspense together. But the story never really explores any of the character's enough to have a huge emotional reaction to their success or failures to succeed.<br/><br/>I do not know of Nolan did this on purpose - or if there is a lot of backstory left out that will be in a Director's Cut. While I did enjoy the filmmaking I did not exactly bond with the character's and it held the project back for me."
"grantss","8","4","8","21 July 2017"," Engrossing, immersive war drama
","May/June 1940. 400,000 British soldiers are holed up in the French port town of Dunkirk. The only way out is via sea, and the Germans have air superiority, bombing the British soldiers and ships without much opposition. The situation looks dire and, in desperation, Britain sends civilian boats to try to evacuate the beleaguered forces. This is that story, seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two RAF fighter pilots and a group of civilians on their boat, part of the evacuation fleet.<br/><br/>Engrossing, immersive war drama. Hooks you from the word go and keeps you hanging on to the very end. Great action scenes with stunning visual and sound effects - very realistic. The sound of the Stukas diving is chilling.<br/><br/>Quite a departure for director Christopher Nolan. Clever fictional dramas (eg Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar) tend to be his forte and an historical war drama seems, on paper, too constraining for his imagination. Yet, he pulls it off with aplomb, and uses his talent for mind-games in doing so. The three separate stories operating at different times and eventually syncing provides the alternative to what would otherwise have been a linear, less interesting story.<br/><br/>Not perfect though, and certainly not in the same league as the masterpieces among war movies - eg Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Tora! Tora! Tora!, Full Metal Jacket, Cross of Iron, Das Boot, Platoon, The Deer Hunter. <br/><br/>Some plot developments and actions seem implausible and dumbed-down for a wider, more ignorant audience, and to simple make for greater drama. Tom Hardy's endless supply of ammunition (and 5 kills, including one while gliding) was a touch laughable. Rifle fire being able to penetrate the metal hull of a ship was interesting too...<br/><br/>Allied with this, the movie is not as gritty as it could have been. Yes, we see death and destruction everywhere, but some things seem straight out of the book of Hollywood war movie clichés. <br/><br/>In addition, the characters aren't that engaging - this is definitely a plot-driven drama, despite focusing on a handful of characters.<br/><br/>Not a masterpiece, but very good nevertheless and certainly worth watching."
"rhut_tiger","10","6","14","4 August 2017"," Nolan recreates the terror of Dunkirk which is cruel , ticking clock, relentless but real. Its a Horror movie , the horror of war.
","A portrayal of a hopeless situation which turns out to be such an visceral experience that starts from the first frame till the end credits. Its a war movie unlike any other war movie by many terms. Sure there is despair , anger , pain , fear and most importantly terror filled in the entire movie. But the movie never ever lets you sit and catch your breath and relax till the next heart pounding scene comes as the entire movie is a non stop thrill ride, nor it fills you up with hope of a victory but it states that sometimes avoiding annihilation is a triumph. This is movie is somehow not about war its about the terror of war, the horrific outcome and the unforgiving-unjust nature of the war.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan in his 10th film achieves a sense of fear among viewers that lasts even after the movie has ended. There are no consoling conversations between soldiers nor any personal choices or family details , but what there is , is the only instinct that anyone on earth is born with, Survival. Movie doesn't waste time in developing characters and motivational dialogues as no one in that situation will actually do that. Sure the lack of deep characters can be a sore thumb for many but that's the point of the movie , its about the situation and the event not about characters. You still root for these guys and feel sad when they die in horror, without knowing their names, and that's the beauty of the cinema that Nolan has created. <br/><br/>Then there is the genius of the storytelling via distinctive vantage points. All in different timelines and without spoiling it i would tell you to read the minimal text very carefully when these are introduced for the first time very early in the film. That just adds layers to the story telling which will definitely be appreciated more on a second viewing. I rather not tell you about the cast than just that its filled with award winners and future award winners. Without having much to do verbally they have conveyed many things through their actions and large portion of the credit goes to the direction. <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has brought freshness to an era and genre of film making that has been a choice of directors since almost last 80 years. A war movie without many war scenes, one which during the entire length of the movie has not shown the opposition once , as in you definitely see enemy bullets flying , bombs jumping , aircrafts piercing air but not a single German face up until the last minute of the movie, still you are in dead fear of the situation and terrorized by the opposition like the Britishers and french are as if you were there. This is mostly achieved by the beautiful practical visuals effects from Hoyte Van Hoytema and an superbly original and chilling score by Hans Zimmer. When you go in a war movie you feel what can a world war II movie bring to the table that's fresh, still while exiting you are left with an experience none like any other in this category. <br/><br/>Its a must watch for any war movie fans or any movie fans , don't expect a one to one gun-fight here rather than its a survival movie in which the hell is cut loose and you have no where to go other than to be with them , feel with them, fear with them....<br/><br/>9.5 /10 AMAZing"
"yoonkicoolguy","9","6","14","2 August 2017"," Very Powerful...
","Christopher Nolan's newest film Dunkirk is a psychologically harrowing war film about one of the terrifying events occurred in history. <br/><br/>While it may not be one of his best films, it still is a profound, powerful war film that truly honors the fact based story and event. Nolan crafts this film as if we, the audience is one of the frightened soldiers attended at the tragic yet distressing event that plays at the big screen extensively realistic. Dunkirk does the best job at satisfyingly delivering the frighteningly realistic portrayal of war and the evacuation in the outlook of the soldiers who were desperate at reaching home. What makes Dunkirk one of the best war films and eminently realistic are the production designs which has a usage of substantial boats, planes etc, the impressive performances and the top- notch sound design.<br/><br/>Most films especially superhero or blockbuster action flicks consistently include large reliance on CGI. It has become the crucial trend in the film industry. Nevertheless, Dunkirk has none of that. It uses practical effects, real-life locations, and substantive components. As a result, when boats sink or planes blow-up, it makes these additionally terrifying and hand-gripping. Dunkirk has some of the best aerial dogfights ever put to screen. <br/><br/>Unlike the typical war films, Dunkirk isn't about sympathetic characters whom we know about their history or the amazing, drastic action sequences. This film mainly focuses on the evacuation and the survival throughout these drastically harsh conditions that are far from survival. It shows three directions which are the beach, standpoints at the boats, and the air. These three viewpoints intertwined concentratedly expressing the chances of survival of the 400,000 soldiers stuck at Dunkirk. The sound design was terrifyingly perfect embodying the gunshots, airplanes, and the crashes more resonant and an enhanced viewing experience that was memorable. <br/><br/>All of the actors are great. Nolan used plentiful of young actors as the frightened soldiers. The main standouts were Tom Hardy (Farrier), Kenneth Branagh (Commander Bolton) and Mark Rylance (Mr. Dawson). All of these characters appear as the central focuses at the beach, the air, and the boats as they balance these stories. Mr. Dawson appears as one of the civilian vessels marching to help the soldiers. Additionally, Harry Styles (Alex) had an impactful presence along with Fionn Whitehead (Tommy). <br/><br/>Overall, Dunkirk is an emotionally impactful and powerful war film about heroism, survival and a deep message that evacuation can be the victory along the supports of civilians. Nolan crafts this film thoroughly realistic, gritty and brutal for a PG-13 rated film. While the characters may not be the strongest, this is about war, the horror of the moment."

"davideo-2","10","6","14","1 August 2017"," An all new cinematic experience, delivered by none other than Nolan
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>For his latest big budget, big spectacle cinematic experience, Christopher Nolan has taken his first foray into the world of a war film, rather than the sci-fi/fantasy flicks he's been known for in recent years. And yet, in his desperate quest to push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking, on this occasion he's produced a film that doesn't actually have any discernible plot to speak of, and is based entirely around the plight of a situation a group of disparate men from different sides of the Allied front during the titular battle. This is a film based entirely in the unfolding moment of the here and now, and his distinctive style has never been more tightly stamped on anything he's made. It may leave some wondering if he was the right director for the project, and how it could have panned out in the hands of someone with a more traditional approach to a war film, say, Steven Spielberg with Saving Private Ryan, but this only serves to highlight how this is an all new filmic experience in its own right.<br/><br/>We open in a scene completely drowned of any dialogue, completely soaked up in atmosphere, punctuated by a harsh, drained camera lens and reinforced by a typically heavy score from long time Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer. The immediacy of the moment is captured quite magically, in spite of the lack of superficial things, and the feeling of being an average soldier in the middle of the unfolding fear and madness is feels as real as you can imagine. In focusing on being in the moment, and not on the characters as individuals, yes, Nolan does drown out some sense of character development and emotional investment, but this is further evidence of the films experimental style, asking you to be moved by the immediate plight of the protagonists, rather than the inner battles each respective person is fighting.<br/><br/>Once again, an all star cast has been rounded up, including former One Direction star Harry Styles, as well as the likes of Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance, although in roles that don't mark any of them down in any individual way. Later on in the film, Nolan also unleashes some of the most breath-taking cinematography he's ever delivered us, over the seas and over the cliffs, almost as magical and majestical as flying over these places for real (but under different circumstances.) In spite of the minimal characterization, there's still a genuine sense of peril and tension of characters during danger sequences, in tightly confined quarters and with time racing against the affected party.<br/><br/>Nolan is a director who refuses to do things by half, or in a way that an audience expects or can even comprehend, and while it may overwhelm many, it can be beautifully appreciated by those who look beyond the surface, and absorb a new filmic style. *****"
"Rsacto","10","6","14","28 July 2017"," Real WW II vintage fighter planes in aerial combat, and abject fear etched on every face faithfully deliver the film's sole premise: War Is Hell.
","As a pilot myself, the gobsmacking POV aerial dog-fighting sequences alone were worth the price of admission. Director Chris Nolan used actual World War II vintage fighter planes instead of CGI, cartoon-like substitutes. Real pilots flying real fighters, chasing the enemy planes through the clouds and skimming over the surface of the English Chanel. Punctuated by the visceral growl of twelve-cylinder Rolls-Royce Merlin engines powering the British Spitfires overflying the bedlam on the beaches below. Wow.<br/><br/>Before I saw pic (at an IMAX in 70mm, the only way to fully appreciate pic), I read a scathing review by Rex Reed, usually a reliable and fair critic. Reed's review scolded Nolan for having the music pot out much of the dialogue in pic. Incredibly, Reed totally missed the point of pic, which is an almost total reliance on visuals, with the music track and voice tracks in distant secondary and tertiary roles respectively. <br/><br/>Pic is a quintessential motion picture, meaning it is meant to be seen and actually felt by the audience, not heard like a play. In this regard, Nolan succeeds exceptionally well. Pic is clearly reminiscent of many of the silent films of yore, which relied more on visuals than the talkies that eventually succeeded them. Yet Nolan avoids the often hammy performances found with most silent film actors, instead relying on the bowel-stirring fear etched on the faces of soldiers either trapped in a sinking ship or helplessly being shot at by an unseen enemy.<br/><br/>In short, Nolan understands, and, most importantly, executes the most basic premise of motion pictures: show us, don't tell us.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have complained that actors of some stature, like Kenneth Branagh, were relegated to embarrassingly minor roles, and the meaty roles were given to unknowns. Well, this historical event is about 400,000 British soldiers trapped on the French beach at Dunkirk. There was no Patten, MacArthur, or Montgomery involved. It was a rescue effort thrown together and run by whomever was available. There will be no nominations for Best Actor. There is no place for such an upstaging role when juxtaposed against this colossal cinematic tableau of an entire army facing either rescue or utter defeat.<br/><br/>Reviewers who have complained about the lack of character development simply fail to understand exactly what, and not who, the real star and the premise of pic are: War itself, and that War Is Hell. <br/><br/>The absence of the standard-Hollywood, predictable, three-act American Narrative format is a refreshing change indeed, yet many have complained about the ""lack of story."" There are four hundred-thousand men trying to escape annihilation facing a cold, empty sea, getting shot to pieces with the Germans at their backs. No story? Are you kidding?! That's 400,000 stories, and we get to see a handful of them registered in extreme closeups of their faces. You feel like you were really there, within the claustrophobic confines of a ship full of soldiers desperate to escape the slaughter, or the dizzying POV shots of aerial combat filmed from real fighter planes in real flight. <br/><br/>As for music and the shattering sound of bombs and ordnance exploding covering up dialogue, it gave pic a verisimilitude that most war pics lack. War is noisy. Really noisy."

","I've watched in IMAX where you get the full IMAX experience. And I got it, image was OK, sound was OK. But still, the story itself - which would be an exciting story - was super boring. I never felt a moment of excitement. Probably Hans Zimmer's music didn't helped a lot in feeling this. Storytelling was also too much, repetitive scenes, events all over the story which makes you fell asleep. Perhaps was intentional, to feel that ""foreverness of time"" of the solders, but still, movies are about entertainment, and an IMAX camera is not enough for that."
"kim-kirchhoff","4","6","14","24 July 2017"," Disappointment - not recommended
","Verdict: Disappointed, do not go and see this movie, unless you are a fan of war films, and can accept that you never get to know the way to many characters, never getting an emotional connection. Revisit either Interstellar or Inception instead. Do not relay on the critics and their reviews, this film is like a musical director having way to many instruments and way to many musicians, the potential is there - but Nolan failed for the first time i a long long time. Story: I have so far been a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, both his choice of stories and how to tell the story, but this film leaves me with a feeling of being an very close observer to battle/war, hearing and seeing the action - but missing backstory, the touch, emotional connection and depth of the way to many characters. This is actually one of the greatest issues especially when Nolans uses great actors like Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy and many others. The potential is huge. The trademark non linear story telling, gets a bit confusing, as you see plane fights from multiple angles during the film, daylight and night is mixed in a strange way, sometimes it takes you minutes to notice the time jump. Many scenes are repetitive, seen from different angles/different characters. Visual: Great cinematography, by Hoyte Van Hoytema who also did cinematography for Interstellar too. Nolans choice of using 70mm film, instead of going digital might work better in a real 70mm theater, but the completely renovated theater with the best in both digital projection and sound I attended resulted in a ""fuzzy"" look compared to recent digital films, this might be how Nolan chose to do the print the film. HD Trailers for Dunkirk look much more crisp/clearer colors. One might hope for a better analog to digital conversion to Blu Ray or UHD Blu ray - but then again this film will become less impressive a home, compared to the big screen and the massive sound. Sound: Both the sound and the music was way too loud, especially in a premium theater made for Dolby Atmos (which this film is not). I guess that Nolans basic idea is that you are ""in the action"", planes flying over your head, guns blasting etc. I had ringing in my ears leaving the theater, and covered my ears during some of the flight scenes, as did my wife."
"Wayne1138","5","6","14","24 July 2017"," Sorry, but a movie completely and utterly destroyed mainly by terrible sound and score............
","A film I have been dying to see ever since it was announced and early reviews were 'Nolans Best Film!!' 'A Masterpiece!!' Really?? I don' think so. So what went wrong, other than critics, websites and movie mags over praising yet another film?? Well the main reason I hated this film is because of the sound. Yes the sound. I always see blockbusters or films on a grand scale like this in IMAX. I have never watched a film in the format where you couldn't hear what the cast were saying 50% of the time like what happened with Dunkirk. Whether its been Star Trek, Star Wars, Marvel movies or even Nolans Interstellar, I have never had such a bad experience like this with IMAX before. I don't believe it was the fault of IMAX, it was the actual sound done for the film itself that was the huge problem. This didn't help at all with that god awful 'ticking clock' in the film as well. Over the trailer for Dunkirk, there was a ticking of a clock that ran through the trailer. Now that is fine for a trailer but through an ENTIRE movie????? Really???? It eventually stopped 10 minutes before the end where I felt absolute relief, and it is no coincidence that I then started to enjoy the movie in such short space of time. What an horrendous decision to make and it also didn't help that Hans Zimmers score (who is normally excellent with Nolans movies) was also terrible. I have never done it before, but I was close to walking out of the film half way through as I had enough and my head was literally pounding. I know a lot of people complained about the sound in The Dark Knight Rises so although Nolan is a great story teller 80% of the time and has literally nailed what visuals are up on screen, he REALLY needs to work on the sound for his films.<br/><br/>Another reason the film doesn't work is the constant moving backwards and forwards in the story by having the same part of the story told time and time again from different peoples views and situations. This was also a big mistake and didn't help the flow of the film at all.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all bad. This film was visually faultless and I mean faultless. You really felt like you were there in the middle of this war. A so so bunch of actors and characters with Cillian Murphy on top form but unfortunately his character was a coward and for me, also a murderer. The real hero in this film though (even though he is behind a mask for 90% of the film) is Tom Hardy. In what is probably the most incredible realistic aerial battles ever put in a movie and up there on screen, his character is the real hero of the film. This brings me to one of the most beautiful breathtaking shots in a film ever where Hardy's Spitfire is 'gliding' along the beach at Dunkirk after he has run out of fuel. It was an incredible shot.<br/><br/>This however, is not enough to make up for how the rest of the film was handled. If it hadn't been for the sound and the constant backwards and forwards with the story, this would have been rightly a masterpiece and Nolans best film. Alas it is not and for me his masterpiece is still Interstellar.<br/><br/>Quite possibly the most over praised movie since Gravity which was another huge disappointment.<br/><br/>I must admit I only saw the B&W version of Dunkirk last year and I would rather watch that version any day of the week than Nolans.<br/><br/>What a way for a director to utterly destroy what could have been a film that would have ended up in my top 10 of all time. <br/><br/>Going forward Mr Nolan, PLEASE work on the sound in your films as I don't ever want to be put through that ever again!!!"
"trevorj-67694","10","6","14","22 July 2017"," Dunkirk Doesn't Disappoint
","Dunkirk is not a history, at least not in any remotely traditional sense of the genre. The intention of the film is not to educate on the events on that French beach that dreary week, day, and hour. Rather, Nolan used what happened at Dunkirk, a very real part of history, as the foundation for building what is a visceral and ultra-realistic war experience. As only Nolan can do, he turns a smart, if ordinary, concept (a film about Dunkirk) into an ingenious and wholly unique film (an uncomfortable, horrifying, and realistic wartime experience). This is a film that is no fun to watch, as it shouldn't be because war is the worst kind of human evil. Christopher Nolan tries to capture that reality and does so with more gusto than any filmmaker before him. And in that pursuit, his war picture stands alone even among the most insightful war movies. He shakes us to the core, terrifies us, and leaves us traumatized afterward. This was his intention from the start; don't mistake that for bad filmmaking.<br/><br/>Dunkirk works because the history of it, the reality that these sorts of events actually happened to real human beings and aren't just inventions of imagination, immediately gets our attention. While we know deep down that none of these particular characters are real, we are convinced that they certainly could have been and the actions depicted on the screen were likely the same of many hundreds of men on that beach. In a sense, these virtually nameless and unexplored characters serve as the embodiment of all those men – human beings just trying to survive another day. We know nothing of their lives outside that beach, but it doesn't matter. Only survival matters. <br/><br/>The actors turn in solid performances. This is a film designed to do a specific purpose and it is not to showcase the actors. These actors do their part in making the experience come to life. Hans Zimmer turns in another powerful score. While it falls short of his work on Interstellar and Inception, it should rightly earn him some recognition come award season. There is not one single flaw to be found in this movie. As is usually the case with Nolan, he does all the heavy lifting and everyone else does their part to finish the job. While the second, third, and fourth viewing will prove if this is his best work for me, the talk of Dunkirk being Nolan's masterpiece is not unfounded. This is a great film; there is no doubt about that. <br/><br/>It should be said that this is a movie that is very uncomfortable at times. The sound engulfs everything. Occasionally, dialogue is missed because there is so much background noise. However, war is not comfortable so it is natural that a war movie wouldn't be either. It is in these details that Nolan perfects the experience of a war film like no other. If you are looking for a nice evening at the movies, this is not for you. This is an intense, loud, and overall unpleasant movie. Yet, it is beautiful and moving, powerful in its stroke. This is a movie worth watching – not for entertainment but for experience. <br/><br/>From the very first moment, Nolan tries to convince us that what we are watching is not only a true story, but might very well be the actual footage of those fateful days at Dunkirk. And, from the first moment, we believe him. We are engulfed by the deafening sound of planes flying overhead and jolted by the bullets ripping by; we scream in horror as men drown in front us; and we feel hopeless as struggle after struggle continues to leave thousands of men stranded as the enemy closes in. This must be real. No other film experience in my life has so deeply and palpably made me feel as if I am living the same reality as the characters on the screen. I left the theater feeling as if I was leaving Dunkirk myself – just surviving to fight another day."

","There is an engrossing immediacy about Dunkirk, you are thrust into the action and the grip seldom loosens. It is pure action, pure cinema. The problem with this is that there is little plot and little characterisation, so the impressive spectacle does get slightly repetitive at times. This could have easily been a two-and-a-half hour picture, so there was certainly room for greater character development. It wouldn't be excessively negative to say that this was something of a missed opportunity."
"Alexander_Blanchett","9","5","11","7 August 2017"," A revolution of the war genre
","Christopher Nolan never disappoints. He is such an visionary director who is now giving the war genre a revelation with this interconnecting war action drama. Visually the film is more than stunning and satisfies all the needs you have for such a movie. Tremendous in every way: Cinematography, editing and visual effects. The sound is pitch perfect and will sure score at the Oscars. The only little flaw I had with the film is that the screenplay wasn't exactly awesome, it was good, no question, but I missed some deeper looks at the characters and that's the only big thing that differs from ""Saving Private Ryan"". While we had a good look at the characters of Mark Rylance and Fionn Whitehead who both played their roles magnetically. I missed more background of Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy. Don't get me wrong, those performances were as good as they could be with the material they could work with but especially with Hardy's character it surely had improved the film and make it a pure masterpiece. But it is still a fantastic film, a great entry and the filmography of Christopher Nolan and a defying film of its genre. And it is a film that reminds me once again why cinema still overcomes screening because that film delivers its great impact on the silver screen."

","I rarely write reviews about movies. I love movies, I just don't have the time. I think I am pretty entitled to discuss movies as I've seen more than one thousand movies. From Schwarzenegger flicks to Tarantino to Gone with the Wind to obscure Korean, Japanese or European movies. I just love movies.<br/><br/>Enough intro. The reason I decided to write is because a lot of people comment on this movie's lack of character development or historical inaccuracies.

Anyway, I just feel that sometimes people are just complete haters, are bored or are so disgusted with themselves that they need to throw stones at anything that doesn't resonate with their particular tastes.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a masterpiece. It's not meant to develop stories or show guts on a beach or make us feel better with a heroic happy ending. It's a movie about survival. Just that. No one will tell the story of their life when they run for their life, unless you're in a Spielberg movies. Everyone wants to live for another day. Cornered animals are either fighting or trying to escape. At Dunkirk the soldier had no one to fight. The Germans attacked from the sky. Yes, there was no guts flying around, it's PG13, but to be honest, if you enjoy seeing guts on screen, you're probably very niché. I cannot call it art. Let's say some directors like this realism, which I don't mind, but I don't miss either. Finally, there's no heroic happy ending. Dunkirk was in 1940, the beginning of the war. No one knew what they were dealing with and the film shows that.<br/><br/>This became my favorite movie after I saw it in IMAX 70MM. It's an amazing piece of cinema. It kept me engaged, kept everyone around me on the edge of their seat, almost cheering during certain scenes or crying during others. The music just blends with the images. It's just glorious.<br/><br/>Why it's my favorite movie? After more than one thousand movies, this movie stayed with me and I wanted to see it again, one week after.

"garethlloydjones","7","5","11","30 July 2017"," An immersive and authentic mess
","When one of the most acclaimed directors and score composers join forces again you would expect only a masterpiece to come out of it.<br/><br/>But let's ignore the Nolan and Zimmer label for a minute and review the movie as it is.<br/><br/>The movie does an impressive job in immersion with Nolan's decision to uphold authenticity with real aircraft, ships and vehicles and fantastic sound design.<br/><br/>But the problem with this movie was it's lack of depth or scale and was even more diminished with its jumbled mess of a script and scenes.<br/><br/>The movie underwhelms the true force of the Germans and the formidable Luftwaffe in the early stages of the war to say the least, and failed to portray the true powerhouse and fear the soldiers were facing.<br/><br/>The characterisation was extremely poor and it was almost impossible to form any emotional attachment or even sympathise with any of the characters. The few words spoken in the movie could be partly to blame but wasn't the main reason. It was the characters lack of reaction to the harsh situations presented to them that made them less believable. On the other hand, Mark Rylance who played the sailor of the small vessel was the star of the movie and played his part perfectly. Harry Styles performed well despite being his debut and should have been given more of an opportunity to develop his character but this was extremely difficult due the lack of dialogue.<br/><br/>The dogfight scenes were exhilarating to see and became tense at times but this tension was often short lived. The lack of available authentic German aircraft was apparent in the movie which is where CGI could have been implemented.<br/><br/>The soundtrack for the movie was far from Hans Zimmers best and was generic with no memorable melodies but the sound of repetitive ticking and noises. Although the ticking mirrored the lack of time for the allies to evacuate, there was still room for Hans Zimmer to represent the awe and disaster of the situation but he failed to utilise this opportunity.<br/><br/>All in all, from a world class director and composer I expected a lot more."
"kmhowie","7","5","11","29 July 2017"," A lot to like but could have been so much better
","I saw it yesterday and I am sad to say that it did not live up to my expectations. It was a movie that I expected to like and wanted to like but it just came up short.<br/><br/>There was a lot to like but there was much that was superfluous and too many ways that I believe it could have been made better. I believe that more context would have useful. A few lines of introduction as to how the situation developed was not enough. Somehow there should have been some way to convey more vividly what a disaster it would have been had things turned out differently. Only passing mention was made to the decision by Hitler to halt his tanks. The possibility of a reversal of that decision, by all accounts, created a sense of impending doom over those who were aware of the situation. This could have been used for more dramatic effect, of which there was otherwise not much.<br/><br/>Another facet of the story of Dunkirk which I think got extremely short shrift was the assembling of the flotilla of small boats which crossed the Channel for the rescue. To many people this was THE main story of Dunkirk. It almost appeared that the side story about this was inserted so that the acting talents of Mark Rylance could be put to use. It seemed to add nothing to the main story.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were great cinematography but I don't think there would have been lost if there had been fewer of them.<br/><br/>I often feel guilty when I am critical of a movie like this but I don't think that simply making a movie about a serious topic does not always make for a good one."

","What Dunkirk lacks in a complex story, it makes up for in its elegance and sophistication, as well as in its realism and engaging nature. You do not know the characters well by the end of it, but you still feel for them and hope for their survival throughout. The film interlocks three different stories beautifully, and while you know when it switches between them, it's edited very well and is not intrusive. I enjoy non-linear narratives very much, as I did in films like Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>The film does not feature many well-known actors, which helps keep viewers immersed in the film. It does feature Harry Styles, but I couldn't really tell it was him, and he gives a good performance so it doesn't really matter. In fact, I don't believe there were any bad performances in the film.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this one in the theater, it makes the experience even more worthwhile."
"basilisksamuk","9","5","11","29 July 2017"," Once I grasped it was a metaphor about events in Dunkirk
","I initially had reservations about Dunkirk. My first reservation was that the beach looked empty with only handfuls of soldiers visible. You never got the impression that there were 400000 soldiers trapped on the beach. Secondly this must be one of the most bloodless war films ever made and, whilst it's easy for directors to slip into war porn these days, men just falling over when shot is utterly unconvincing.<br/><br/>Despite these misgivings I found the film gripping from beginning to end. The aerial scenes in particular were outstanding. The score and sound design were also outstanding ensuring that tension and was maintained and built upon throughout the film. I was also impressed by the mixing of the three timelines and points of view. Going in it seemed impossible for anyone to weave the three together but it works to perfection.<br/><br/>Ultimately my take on the film is that Nolan has created a film that is a series of metaphors about what happened at Dunkirk and not a depiction of the reality of what happened at Dunkirk. The combination of the cinematography, score and fractured timelines give an impression of the horrors of waiting on the beach to be rescued that a more conventional approach could probably never achieve. Another director could have produced an effects heavy movie which lumbered on forever with saccharine character backstories and a linear chronology and it would not be nearly so effective.<br/><br/>I may be wrong but I think Dunkirk is one giant metaphor.

I had fairly high expectations going into the movie because the reviews were so excellent and they lived up and even exceeded my expectations. It's not a straightforward war film, but it does show many of the brutal elements of war. The sounds, graphics and effects are all top notch and the movie works more like a thriller than a straightforward war film. You actually feel like you are in the setting. The character development I've seen a few complain about it wasn't necessary because the point of the film was to show the realism of what happened at Dunkirk.<br/><br/>I particularly liked the scenes with Mark Rylance who is excellent here playing a civilian who helps injured soldiers. His performance is believable and haunting. I also thought Tom Hardy, who plays a pilot, did a fantastic job showing the escape from Dunkirk from the air.

"tonyf-46656","4","5","11","24 July 2017"," Structurally flawed
","I am a huge military history buff and was very excited to see Dunkirk in Imax format on the first weekend it was available in the U.S. The cinematography of the movie was impressive, but there were several things about how the movie was portrayed which were very disappointing to me. <br/><br/>Asynchronous Timing - The movie tells the story in subplots taking place over a week, another in a day, and another in one hour. This was a creative way of telling the story from several perspectives, but not effective to me, and in many ways a waste of time. Instead of seeing 3-4 scenes shot from different 3-4 different angles, it seemed 75% of the time in the movie would have been better spent telling other story lines - the closing of the pocket around Dunkirk, the Germans decision to eliminate the British with air power vs. infantry, the French people feeling abandoned, the perspective of the civilians, the decisions by leaders on both sides, who gets left behind, etc.<br/><br/>Very little character development - The movie was about the characters doing, not being. Again, this was a stylistic choice by the director, but it left me with the feeling that no character - with the exception of the Mark Rylance role - was very likable. Even Tom Hardy, who was featured flying a Spitfire for much of the film, was behind a mask 99% of the time - I could have done as much acting as he had to do in this role. <br/><br/>Not enough lift - The real Dunkirk was a disaster for the Allies, but it also was a miracle that so many people were saved. The movie addressed this, but not adequately to my reckoning. The tone of the movie was death and despair, and for a brief moment, there were 4-5 merchant boats which appeared and momentary hope. It seems like for all of the grief the audience had endured to that point that suddenly the horizon would be filled with little boats coming to the rescue of the British infantry - which is what I suspect happened in reality.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy's Spitfire - Tom Hardy flew around in a Spitfire for 2/3rd of the movie on low fuel, and eventually had to land it in German- occupied area and be captured. It seems like it would have been just as easy for him to land where his countrymen were instead of becoming a POW, but this isn't my biggest complaint. A Spitfire of this era had only about 16 seconds of ammunition firing time, but Hardy's plane took out more of the enemy than I could count (4-5 fighters and one bomber?). Granted, many of the scenes were repeats of other scenes given the time-bending approach, but Hardy's plane must have shot for 30 minutes or so of theater time. It would have been more effective, for instance, if he had been reduced to ramming the bomber to take it down. I know it is common to take liberties with ammunition in war movies, but this was such an overreach that it became frustrating.<br/><br/>Over-ambitious score - For most of the movie the musical overlay featured unrelenting, screeching violins. No doubt, the intent was to add tension, but this was way overdone. <br/><br/>I am glad films such as Dunkirk are being made, and I will watch it again when it is free on cable, but it seems like with a few changes, it could have been much better. Instead of dealing with the topic in a thoughtful way, a lot of the movie was overproduced to the point of distraction."
"Rendanlovell","8","5","11","23 July 2017"," Another Great Nolan Film.
","If there is one thing that Christopher Nolan does better than any other director working right now it's that he puts butts in seats. Every single movie he has made since 'Batman Begins' has featured people swarming in droves to their nearest theater. I would wager that 90% of people that go see this film will not know anything about the subject matter. Which is sort of what makes him so interesting. He is making gigantic studio blockbusters of whatever he wants. Warner Bros smartly realized that this man packs theaters and makes money so they let him do whatever he feels like doing. Which is a little weird considering Warner Bros DC cinematic universe right now... <br/><br/>Before I get too far into this movie I want to point out the few negatives I have with it. Keep in mind that these things will more than likely not bother anyone else. I also realize that these are nitpicking but regardless, they still took me out of the experience. And I would call this an experience, which is all the more reason that these nitpicks bother me. When something happens in an experience to take you out of it I think it's fair to point at that to say that it ruined a bit of the experience.<br/><br/>And the thing that ruined the most parts of this film was the audio recordings. No, not the sound effects but the microphones that recorded the actor's dialogue. Almost every single time an actor talked there was an audible buzzing sound that would fade in and out each time a character opened their mouth. I'm pretty happy that most of the film didn't need dialogue because this bugged literally every time it happened.<br/><br/>The only other blemish on the film's armor comes due to the color correcting and nonlinear nature of the story. There was a number of scenes where every single cut was a different color temperature. We would see a vibrant blue sky with a bomber flying and the next cut would be a boat that looked gray or orange. Or one cut would be during daytime and the next would be dark. Again, these are small issues but in an experience such as this, they stand out far more than they would in a 'Dark Knight' sort of film.<br/><br/>However, this is easily the best war movie 2017 has to offer. Which is saying a lot considering the vast surplus of war melodramas from this year. Much like Nolans other movies 'Dunkirk' is a sensory masterpiece. Every shot in the film is near perfect. The composition of each frame and the camera movement is so precise for each individual scene. Not only that but the sound editing is absolutely spectacular. <br/><br/>The film is abrasively loud and in your face. From the very first scene the film barrages you with ear piercing sounds that put you right in the middle of this war. Planes rumble overhead, bullet whiz by, and people yell at each other and it's all captured perfectly. In all honesty, if I were to judge this film based on its technical achievements this would receive top marks, especially when costumes, sets, and makeup is factored in.<br/><br/>Because every single thing in this film is so believable that it often transcends being a film and almost feels like a documentary. Nolan's craft has never been better and he deserves endless praise because he directors the crap out of this movie. But Nolan is not only the director here, he is also the writer. Which brings me to the most intriguing aspect of the movie. The structure and story that we get aren't like your everyday war movie.<br/><br/>Sure the story is very simple but it tells it from three different perspectives. Doing this allowed him to cut between the sea, land, and air which brings different dimensions to this battle. We see how each one affects and is affected by each other. This also allows Nolan to cut away from one thing to another the moment it gets dull. He doesn't have to restrict himself to making the air plane scenes interesting all on their own. Instead he just cuts to something interesting when the dog fight is over.<br/><br/>Doing this keeps the pace of the film absolutely relentless. For ninety minutes you are barraged endlessly by this fight. While it may not always work the strengths far outweigh the flaws. The costumes, sets, acting, direction, cinematography, action, and the visual nature of the film all come together to create something that feels so different than everything else out right now. Sure, it may not be your typical summer blockbuster and I'm not sure I could ever watch it again but it's certainly worth keeping out."
"OneMovieLover","7","5","11","22 July 2017"," Good, but overrated
","""Dunkirk"" is not a bad film, but it does not at all deserve the lavish praise that has been bestowed upon it by critics. Its chief problem is that it has no truly strong characters. Now, some people have said that this is a result of the nonlinear narrative, and they're wrong. The problem, rather, is simply inadequate character writing on Nolan's part. The narrative structure is arguably a strength, as it truly does cause us to feel – for a short while – the silliness and arbitrariness of war. The film's lack of strong character development, however, unsurprisingly becomes a more glaring fault as the film unfolds. Its best scenes are mostly in the last third, though the speech sequence at the very end is overly preachy and heavy-handed.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"", ultimately, is an example of how realism to a film's subject does not make that film a masterpiece. Depth is needed; excellent characters are needed. I truly suspect that if you were to show any reasonably good film critic the first 40-50 minutes of this film and not tell them that Christopher Nolan directed it, they would likely see little difference between it and most blockbusters that they are forced to review every summer. Yes, Zimmer's score is strong, and there are moments of excellent camera-work. Nevertheless, the fact that this film is actually being lauded by not only audiences but even a fair number of critics as one of the greatest war films ever made makes me somewhat concerned about the future of film criticism in the United States. What makes ""Dunkirk"" as significant a work of art as ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Paths of Glory"", or ""Apocalypse Now""? Nothing, because it is nowhere near those films artistically and intellectually."

","That's not the greatest war film ever, if you only consider the message, the topic. It remains very classical, American, patriotic and so on. I guess Nolan did not really care about this line, he only used it to support the rest, I mean the astounding, mind blowing show that glues you to your seat. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was a real mile stone in the war film history; I mean there was a before and an after PRIVATE RYAN, concerning the graphic violence, not the rest, of course. This Nolan's movie is the same, it will remain another mile stone in the war film history. You have to see it yourself to perfectly understand what I mean. I don't remember any war feature like this one, technically I mean. And I want to add something else. The editing, the story telling reminds me some dramas and film noirs, showing different characters whose fates finally collide. I have rarely, if not never, seen such schemes in war movies. <br/><br/>This is a must see, for visual reasons, and certainly not ideological. That's why I prefer CROSS OF IRON, which, I admit, was totally different from this one. The purpose was simply not the same. The Peckinpah's film was an anti war feature, the best ever. This one uses the war to show some new technical stuff. Forget the message. You have already seen it thousands times before."
"lotekguy-1","9","5","11","21 July 2017"," Anonymity of principal cast honors anonymous heroes
","The story of this massive evacuation of British and French troops back across the English Channel in 1940 has been depicted several times before, but never so intriguingly or compellingly. Writer/director Christopher Nolan pulled off what seems to be oxymoronic in crafting a powerfully understated presentation of such a famous event. The preceding military action in France was a disaster, but rescuing most of the 400,000 soldiers pinned down by all branches of the German forces allowed England to keep Hitler on the Continent until the rest of the Allies would become fully armed and engaged. <br/><br/>Most war films focus on one or more heroes, played by stars and familiar character actors, with relatively predictable story arcs. The 1958 account of this historic achievement starred John Mills and Richard Attenborough; in 2004, Benedict Cumberbatch and Timothy Dalton headlined. This time, Kenneth Branagh is the biggest ""name"", but his role is marginal. Instead, we switch among several story lines of anonymous soldiers, sailors, pilots and civilians, with few of them even being given names. We also see their fears, moments of cowardice or selfishness along with their heroism. By not knowing who is who (and, typically, who we figure will either save the day, die tragically, or both, based on decades of cinematic convention) we feel the utter randomness of which imperiled character will live or die, and whether it will happen on shore or during evacuation. <br/><br/>British pride over the event comes largely from the way innumerable civilian boat owners, with vessels of all types and sizes, bravely responded to the call to help its over-matched Navy by crossing the channel to carry as many lads back as they could hold... if they survived the threats from enemy U-boats, bombers and fighter jets. For the troops, reaching one of the boats proved to be far from an assurance of safe passage. <br/><br/>Nolan delivers all the sound and fury of being among their ranks, sustaining nearly two hours of the intense fear, chaos and frustrations that the actual figures must have experienced. It's among the closest approximations I can recall of the masterful D-Day landing sequence at the beginning of Saving Private Ryan. We see many fatalities from many causes, but without the explicit display of bloodshed that an R- rated production would have contained. We didn't need it to get the layers of emotional impact in that ordeal from all perspectives. The jumps from one mini-arena to another, and even repeating certain sequences from different character perspectives adds to that sense of no one in position to deduce what action or location will be safest for themselves or their comrades. <br/><br/>The experience is grueling for the audience, and honors the soldiers most by putting us in their actual, not idealized or glorified, boots. This Dunkirk marks quite an achievement for all its creators and cast."

"sddavis63","6","2","3","2 November 2019"," Straightforward And Gritty, But To Me It Missed The Mark Just A Bit
","Director Christopher Nolan offers the viewer a pretty straightforward re-telling of the evacuation of British soldiers from the French port of Dunkirk in May of 1940, as the Germans encircled the town. The story is told from a strictly British perspective. Although we see some German planes involved in battles with RAF fighters as far as I can recall there isn't a single glimpse of a German soldier anywhere. Nolan then tells the story from three perspectives within that British perspective: on the land, on the sea and in the air. The land focuses on the solders awaiting rescue, the sea focuses mostly on the small private boats that made such a huge contribution to the effort (focusing on one boat in particular) and the air focuses on the battle by a small number of RAF pilots to protect their compatriots beneath against German planes. That structure was a bit confusing at first (especially as it was captioned on screen) but the story makes sense and that odd narrative structure is only a brief distraction.<br/><br/>There's not really a main character involved in this. The point seems to have been to portray the breadth of the Dunkirk evacuation at the expense of character depth. There's also no one moment that seems truly central, which means that the movie strikes you in the end of not really having built up to anything (aside from the actual evacuation, which admittedly is the most important thing.) But in some respects that made this movie seem at times less of a drama and more of a docu-drama if that makes any sense. The story-telling was a little bit lacking. I did appreciate that while the heroism of the British soldiers was front and centre, there was no shying away from a few more negative portrayals - shell-shocked soldiers, soldiers who just didn't want to fight anymore, soldiers who wouldn't even help their French allies. In that sense, this had a somewhat gritty feel, as befits a war movie.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie. To me, it just missed the mark a little bit in terms of what I was expecting. (6/10)"

","No doubt, Dunkirk is Nolan's best cinematographic movie of all time. Colour palette and harmony are just amazing. IMAX shots assert it selves. Especially plane scenes are admirable. Also, movie looks so real. Great decor, real places, real bombs,planes, ships... Such a wonderful production. Musics are so intense and fit with visuality. Hans Zimmer of course! On the other hand, story is a bit complicated. Sometimes it feels so empty but sometimes it feels so intense too. I cannot say so much about characters and actors because Dunkirk goes a really different way about these and it doesn't even try to show us backgrounds of characters. Honestly I was waiting a little different things from Nolan on it. Even so, it is a great -real story- war and historical film."

In an effort to maximize profits it presents a fictitious, sanitised, version of what war looks like.<br/><br/>Possibly one of the worst post war films to cover events.<br/><br/>The evacuation of Dunkirk was a pivotal moment in history, when trapped betwen the English Channel, the advancing German Army, and no Navy within reach to enact a rescue, Churchill ordered the Admiralty to commandeer every single available civilian ship within reach to ev acuate 400,000 soldiers - or the Army in it's entirety. 800 vessels took part and ultimately succeeded.<br/><br/>None of these facts are made clear or even hinted at in the film, despite the films much lauded, huge budget.

"GoldenBlunderbuss","8","2","3","1 August 2018"," An enormous spectacle that highlights the desperation of the real-life event
","Three intertwined stories (on land, at sea and in the air) over different time frames are stitched together to form a single overarching tale of instinctive survival.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan indulges his inner Michael Bay for Dunkirk ... well, maybe a bit more restrained than that I guess, but ships sink, airplanes crash and there's more than a few explosions. It's more of an action film than most of his previous work, but his still manages to linger on the personal elements of what would have gone on during Operation Dynamo as comrades, family and friends (on both sides of the Channel) fight for the survival of not just the men on the beach, but of Western Europe.<br/><br/>There's no real lead actor to pinpoint, instead the film jumps back and forth between three stories set over the same fortnight. The action on the beach (on which most the film focuses) takes place over two weeks, the parts on one particular boat (captained by Mark Rylance) is set over two days, and the scenes from Tom Hardy's spitfire cockpit are over the course of a couple of hours. In typical Nolan style, they're stitched together masterfully and it's never confusing to have to jump from one time frame to another - think Memento but without the headache afterwards!<br/><br/>Nolan earned his first Best Director Oscar nomination but as much as it pains to say it, I never thought we would see him finally lift a gold statuette. From its eight nominations, it managed only three in the technical categories and Hans Zimmer's amazing score couldn't compete against Alexandre Desplat's music for The Shape of Water.<br/><br/>Even the inclusion of Harry Styles in a prominent speaking role couldn't hamper the drama or detract from the very serious (and very real) scenario the film drew its inspiration. The only real gripe is that there's a noticeable lack of French characters (and therefore actors) on a French beach, especially when you consider how many French troops must have died fighting off the fast-advancing Nazi army in order to give the British Navy and Air Force enough time to evacuate all 340,000 people.<br/><br/>Best Quote: ""Men my age dictate this war.

I really couldn't wait to see this movie finally and it definitely has some nice elements, like that you don't see the Germans the whole movie except of the last scene, but there were sooooo many unrealistic scenes and sorry in a movie like this I want to have full realism. So what the hell is going on with the ammunition of the Spitfires, they would have been out of ammo right after the first fight and here they fight forever, also how long can this Spitfire glide in the final scene and WHAT THE HELL, why is he landing the Spitfire to then burn it and to be captured when he could have easily bailed above the evacuation zone. And what kind of ship is this, which can still swim even it is filled with holes, water and lots of humans and boy all the flight scenes, in one scene the Heinkels are already even too close to bomb and we still see several minutes flying of the Spitfires until they are in the right position and the Heinkel probably just hovered on the same position. There are sooo many unrealistic and stupid things going on in the movie I really don't get how anyone could give it a positive rating. Also the whole story around the boy who died....are you kidding me? He dies from the fall? I mean of course there are stupid ways how this could happen, but what are the chances and then the newspaper? How did he rescue them when he was dead?

"rblenheim","4","2","3","17 March 2018"," An emperor without clothes, a film hugely overrated
","Of all the films in 2017, the biggest disappointment to me was Christopher Nolan's over-packaged and over-publicized ""Dunkirk"", a film with aspirations of grandeur that ended up delivering a narrative mishmash that completely lacked emotional involvement. <br/><br/>My guess is that the film, displaying choppy editing and confusing transitions, might have been the compromised result of its filmmakers changing their minds while frantically trying to mold it into something cohesive. Watching it, at times I didn't even know where I was supposed to be, and at one point I turned to a friend who had accompanied me and asked, ""why is it night here?"" without realizing until later we had been seemingly in the hold of a ship. Moreover, it seemed an attempt was made to cover the narrative weakness by having actor Kenneth Branaugh stand around and deliver hackneyed lines (written by director Nolan himself) to take the place of dramatic action, scenes that seemed phoned in from another movie. But a more surprising weakness was the failure of the flying scenes to work up much excitement. Why its aviation scenes were so timidly done and so lacking in intensity, even in 70mm, astounds me still. <br/><br/>Finally, when the end credits came up on ""Dunkirk"", due to its need for more 'fleshing out' and clarity of focus, I felt I had experienced merely the outline of a movie instead of a completed one. And a war film that seemed to fail at the very simple things that even average war films used to achieve with ease."

Otherwise, there are a ton of downsides that let it drown like the planes we saw crash in the water. Even the soundtrack was like a broken violin, which was kind of screaming its last days. The action was pretty ok and the characters could have done a better job. I was expecting much more from it. It's just me or we have really lost our honest sense of appreciation for a movie?

The characters look the same, it is very hard to tell them apart, but you wont give a care about them anyways. When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was hyped thinking I'd see how the hundreds of thousands of troops are evacuated. 
Instead I got to see two people constantly hopping from one boat to another, a cliche drama on an old guy's boat, and a plane gliding around for 10 minutes after it ran out of fuel.

"The_Polish_Commoner","5","2","3","1 March 2018"," Disappointment
","I am a complete politics and history buff and eat up documentaries and historical films very willingly, especially those having to do with WWII. Unfortunately this one was quite disappointing. We follow the footsteps of three characters/groups of characters. A young British soldier stuck at Dunkirk, pilots trying to defend the skies above the English channel to allow vessels safe passage, and a father along with his son and son's friend trying to save the soldiers at Dunkirk with the use of their boat. What could have been a phenomenal movie falls short. On the one hand, it is a little boring, with not as much action as one might expect. In my opinion this is caused by the division of the story between three characters as you don't really develop a connection to any of them. Furthermore, there is very little dialogue in the movie, what typically doesn't increase the excitement level. We are humans and human interaction is typically what interests us most. Granted this is WWII and not a time for deep dialogues, but the lack of thereof decreases audience engagement. Finally, and this is the most confusing/annoying part, the scenes are presented as simultaneous events on the one hand, as they are intertwined and the pilot ends up on the father's boat, but the scenes do not take place at the same time. At one point the scenes jump around between broad daylight and the night, which is rather annoying since we don't really know what has taken place first. A final disappointment was the lack of proper presentation of the amount of soldiers stranded at Dunkirk, over 300,000. On the beach at one time we might see 1000 or 2000. So where have the rest gone? Obviously you're not gonna place actors in giant scenes, but make areal shots and add thousands of people stranded on the beach. That actually shows the reality of the situation. If we didn't know what really happened, we might think that the Brits are saving some 2000 of their men. And then there is the question of the civilian fleet, which was (maybe still is) the largest civilian fleet of vessels ever assembled. Unfortunately we do not see the amount of ships (which in reality was over 800). I feel like the movie is just slightly oversimplified. The story isn't could be more concise and a clear time frame like the time of the day or how many days had passed would have been helpful. Also, the evacuation of Dunkirk took a couple of days, with more soldiers being rescued every day. This could have been exemplified by the following of a second soldier's attempt at being rescued."

","A spectacular, important and inspiring . . . flop, I'm afraid.<br/><br/>I wanted to see this movie on the big screen - some movies require that to be given the chance to live up to what they're supposed to be. But this is no Patton and no Great Escape. I'm surprised it is rated as high as it is on this site.<br/><br/>Not only myself, but another, older man whose opinion I respect, agreed that the sound track, dialogue, or NOISE was practically incomprehensible to the American ear. I honestly would have preferred SUBTITLES for this movie. Then I might have understood the dialogue.<br/><br/>This is a problem with many movies in the past 20 years - music and sound effects drown out dialogue. Have you gone out socially lately? Ever notice how loud everything is? The zeitgeist lately is: when in doubt, crank up the volume. Of course, we know that we have become braying donkeys in response.<br/><br/>I'm going to give this movie a second chance. I'll watch it at home where my sound system gives me three options for the sound. Perhaps the BluRay will also give me additional options.<br/><br/>But the option I'm really looking for is subtitles!

"jackjack-2","6","2","3","20 February 2018"," Has its moments but definately not worth an Oscar
","Given all the fluff about the movie, it was disappointing. It has its virtues but not enough to win any awards, It shows only a very small portion of the battle for Dunkirk and it doesn't always get it right. The battle for Dunkirk is seared in my memory. As a boy, I first heard of Dunkirk on the radio news but when I saw the newsreel footage and the photos in Life magazine, it became indelibly impressed in my memory. While a professional military and battle experienced officer stationed in Europe, I spent a weekend in Dunkirk and the surrounding countryside studying the battle. <br/><br/>If anyone wants to really learn about what happened at Dunkirk they should watch the PBS NOVA program ""Great Escape at Dunkirk."" In one hour, a viewer will 
learn far, far more about Dunkirk than depicted in the movie and have a much better understanding.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movies shortchanges the viewers by not taking a few minutes to provide the setting. Inaccurate.y, the film begins with the French and British defending against the German attack only a few hundred yards from the beach when in fact, the German lines were still 20KM from the beach on May 27 which is about when the film begins and a 1,000 KM from the beach when the British and French surrendered on June 4.<br/><br/>The story about the Spitfire crash landing on the beach is incorrect. To begin with, the pilot gliding his plane without fuel and shooting down a German bomber is nonsense. Then he crash lands his plane on the beach and burns the plane and surrenders to the Germans. In fact, a Spitfire did land on the beach but the pilot was not taken prisoner nor was the plane burned. In fact, it was eventually recovered long after the war and restored and it is flying today.<br/><br/>What was bothersome, is that the story starts out by focusing on a Britsih deserter and follows him through the film. That does not do justice to the real heroes of Dunkirk, the soldiers in the rear guard to fought valiantly to hold back the German advance until the rest of the Army escaped, and then surrendered and were put in German prison camps for the remainder of the war.<br/><br/>The ending doesn't tell the story. We find the British Admiral in charge of the evacuation saying he is staying for the French. In fact,123,000 French troops were evacuated. But the story is not clear when Commander Bolton at the end says ""I'm staying. For the French."" But most of the French had already been evacuated so what he probably was referring to over 26,000 French soldiers that were evacuated on the last day.<br/><br/>The story was fuzzy at times, even confusing. That was in part due to poor editing which switched back and forth and scenes often were not in chronological order. Often switching back and forth between night and day and back again. Some like that style but I found it annoying. At times the story was not told well. Apparently, the reason the story focused on the deserter is because the story of how he survived was unique. He survives a shipwreck in the movie the significance of that incident is not clear - until I saw the NOVA version.<br/><br/>A plus for the film was its realism. The scenes were real. The dialog was real. The acting was very good. It did not get maudlin. Nothing romantic. No gore and it could easily have been gory. It is the type of movie I don't mind children watching. But not it is not a history lesson."

"garrvanorden-378-358098","2","2","3","29 January 2018"," Dunkirk, more like Dung-Crap!
","I have no idea why this movie received good reviews. Let me start with the good. This movie looked and sounded great in I-Max, and I saw this movie on $5 Tuesday. That's the end of the good. Now to the bad. This movie had no characters. I felt zero emotional connection to anyone in this movie. I didn't care if anyone lived or died or anything. Mark Rylance's (the BFG) character was the only one who was halfway interesting. He was the only character who had a decent amount of dialogue in the film, who had a clear goal, and who made decisions. The other character that had more than 5 lines in the picture was Kenneth Branagh's. He seemed utterly pointless. It seemed like he was watching the movie, and his purpose was just to say a cheesy lines about ""Home"" every once in a while. Tom Hardy's character was boring and repetitive, only to predictably save the day in the end. Because this movie is so messed up, it is really hard to decide who the main character is, but if I had to decide, it'd be the guy we see 1st. He is very forgettable. He looks and acts almost identical to his friend and almost everyone in the whole movie. He meets his friend while he is taking a dump. This is not a joke. So the main character doesn't poop. He stops and helps his new friend bury a body. And the guy doesn't poop the whole movie. And him and his new friend just try to escape the whole movie. That leads me to my second point: there is no plot. It's just a bunch of explosions. There's more plot in a Transformers movie. 'Poop guy' and 'bury dead body guy' just go from ship to ship trying to live. By the way, the movie is almost over before 'bury dead body guy' says anything. So these guys try to live, Kenneth Branagh stands on a dock and says things that don't matter, Mark Rylance picks up survivors in his boat, and Tom Hardy shoots other planes, while in his plane, over and over and over again, while not being seen or heard. And that's your movie. I kept waiting for the opening action sequence to be over. I kept waiting for it to slow down a little and have some exposition, but it never did. It was like I missed the beginning and just tuned into the climax of a long, humorless, silent picture. That's not to say that a movie can't be action packed and be great. U-571 is an example of a nearly non-stop, action packed, WWII movie, thrill ride. U-571 managed to have memorable and distinct characters with different purposes. U-571 had a plot with a clear goal and twists and turns. If Dunkirk could've just cut out some of the unnecessary bits, like Kenneth Branagh, and had the 1st half hour be set up and character development, then it could've been really good. But as it was, I didn't care about any of it. I kept watching English soldiers die and thinking, ""I don't care. This movie didn't make me care."" As simple as the plot for Dunkirk was, the movie was really confusing. You'd think if you're going for an exciting, action thriller, that a simple linear plot would suffice. This movie jumps all over the timeline without giving any hint that it just made a jump in time. Christopher Nolan does a great job of jumping all over the timeline in his movie Memento. In Memento, he manages to keep things coherent and engaging. Not so here. This is just disappointing. The time jumping is completely unnecessary here. What little dialogue there is in this film is really hard to hear because of thick accents, loud explosions, masks over faces, and the music being really loud in the mix. With a really simple plot that is really hard to follow and characters with zero development or even distinguishing traits, I found myself in a really big struggle to care about what I was watching, even with incredible imagery and sound design. Yet, the whole time, the movie was telling me what I was watching was really exciting with it's music score. And that leads me to my last point: I hated the music. It pains me to say that because I usually love Hans Zimmer, especially under the direction of Christopher Nolan. There is virtually no melody in this score. It's relentless and annoying. I guess I can't blame Zimmer, considering he was just scoring to picture. Imagine watching The Dark Knight, but during the entire movie all you heard was The Joker's theme, non-stop. That's what it's like. The whole soundtrack may as well just be an air raid siren. And it's not just the music. The sound effects, as incredible as they were, were also loud, annoying, and relentless. At times, I found myself covering my ears. I thought, ""Why am I paying money to cover my ears? What I'm covering my ears to is what I paid for."" You know what movie is better than this: all the movies I have seen this year. Valerian and The Mummy were even better. They were at least fun. The best movie I've seen this Summer is War for the Planet of the Apes, but you really need to see all the Apes pictures to get the full enjoyment out of that one. The next best is Spider-Man: Homecoming, but maybe you're not up to date with the Marvel movies. In that case, see Wonder Woman. You don't need to see the other DC movies to enjoy that one. But what ever you do, don't see Dunkirk. I beg of you not to give that garbage your support."
"neil-procter","3","2","3","28 January 2018"," Shameful lack of scope in this age of CGI
","It amazes me that this film has an average review score more than 8. I found it tedious and unnecessarily time-skewed. Christopher Nolan seemed to think it was a good idea to jump between events that were happening at different times. So, for instance, we had night time scenes at Dunkirk while it was daylight 20 miles away in the channel. It was unnecessary and confusing - a chronological telling would have worked far better. More irksome still was that, in supposedly trying to right the myth that the RAF provide no support, Nolan has three Spitfires, three, being the entirety of RAF involvement, and only a handful of German planes too . This is patent rubbish. The biggest gaff of all is that we get no sense whatsoever of the huge numbers of civilian boats that made the trip to rescue soldiers from the beach, some of them returning over and over again. In this age of CGI I was surprised that, when for once the vast scope of something was a vital part of the story, the images showed hardly anything. This was a very poor effort from someone regarded as being one of the top film makers. And that people can review it so highly perhaps illustrates that people don't care, provided there's shooting and explosions. For me it was dull and unedifying."
"jamesgdorrian","2","2","3","28 January 2018"," Turkeys aren't only for Christmas.
","I think there must be a syndrome whereby the impact and quality of a movie (or other artistic creation) can be given something of a critical 'free ride' simply because of the reputations of those associated with its production. To put this another way, were I - with absolutely no artistic talent - to pick up a handful of mud and throw it at a canvas, the resulting mess would certainly qualify as vandalism. If, however, an artist with a significant reputation was to do the same thing, I'm quite certain 'appreciators of art' would soon be queuing up to buy the resulting masterpiece. And so it is with Nolan, whose bleak and soulless take on Dunkirk seems to work best the less you actually know about the evacuation; and certainly the more the viewer reads into the film what he/she believes were Nolan's motivations and messages. Some of the reviews given by critics are deferential to a degree approaching fawning. Bearing in mind that this purports to be the story of a major wartime event, the lack of attention to historical detail is frankly unforgivable, especially considering the movie's huge cost. If you are interested in finding out about what actually happened at Dunkirk, this vague and depressing (on so many levels) take on history should never grace your list of source material. Thank God my 8th Army uncle, who was on the Dunkirk beach until the last day, was not around to see his story so debased."

Lucky I only wasted $5.99 On Demand at home, rather than walking out of the theater, because I would've demanded my money back. <br/><br/>I have no clue how others have rated this movie so high, unless being incredibly bored and falling asleep deserves high ratings.

","The aerial sequences were very well filmed and realistic. I'm afraid that is all the positive comment I have to offer. The beaches laughable by their emptiness. Three hundred thousand saved? The impression was that if they had got three hundred off they would have been lucky. Christopher Nolan seemed fixated by a few spectacular disaster scenes and the rest filled in anyhow - never mind historical inaccuracies or anachronisms which were abundant. And then the plot, such as it was - parts of it corny and unbelievable melodrama. Tricks with the timing? Nothing special, the three scenarios could be view in isolation without worrying about the clock.<br/><br/>The 1958 Leslie Norman movie with John Mills and Richard Attenborough - a tried and well-proved WW2 movie combination - gave a far more realistic and highly believable representation of what actually took place. But being much closer in time to the actual event, Norman needed to be much more careful with so many actual participants in the potential audience, and the advisors had all survived the horrors of that beach. If you have a military or historical interest in Dunkirk, this is the movie to watch.<br/><br/>There is also a very good French film 'Weekend at Zuydcoote (Dunkirk)' directed by Henry Verneul and starring the great Jean Paul Belmondo. It is based on a book by Robert Merle who was actually rescued by the British from the Dunkirk Beaches.<br/><br/>Either of the latter two films recommended but Nolan - Oh dear, you can do so much better."

The visuals were very good hence the reason it got 1 star (also I couldn't give it a 0). Christopher Nolan completely wrecked the story and made the Spitfire pilots look like idiots as they all chose to crash instead of ejecting.) One pilot even managed to shoot down German fighters while gliding as he was out of fuel, he could have ejected over the beach among the British soldiers but chose to land and burn the plane and get captured instead.

"thinkMovies","3","2","3","9 December 2017"," A movie that wears the Emperor's new clothes.
","I marked my review as containing spoilers so let's get the major spoilers out of the way first: This movie has no plot, the editing utilized the concept of sticking random time-segments together, the characters have no motivation and no depth. The brilliant vestments critics assigned to this movie are the Emperor's new clothes. He is wearing nothing.<br/><br/>So, let's cut through to the chase: If you want to see a better movie about Dunkirk, with (apparently) more extras, real characters, real story and an explanation of what it is you are watching and why, then, watch the 1958 Ealing Studios production with Richard Attenborough and John Mills.<br/><br/>I must confess that when I was watching the few hundred people on the beaches, and the single boat coming from England, I was sure I'd see Matthew McConaughy looking for Jessica Chastain --so powerful was the connection to Interstellar created by the maddening, unnerving wall of sound that is the repetitive constant senseless soundtrack which is becoming a Nolan trademark.<br/><br/>Finally, the single boat (OK, there was one scene with a few dozen boats that lasted a few seconds), well, when it makes its way back to England we learn that they came from and returned to Dorset. The Historical list of 750 or so boats does not include a single one from Dorset. The real boats left from Ramsgate, 39 nautical miles from Dunkirk. Dorset is 180 nautical miles from Dunkirk.<br/><br/>Dunkirk was a great victory in defeat, with nearly 400,000 men saved and even in the 1958 English production it was true to life and proportions, where Nolan's 2017 production failed miserably and completely.<br/><br/>I was so looking forward to watching Mr. Nolan's film and I must confess I am now quite upset at young Christopher for wasting my time and making such a mess of history.<br/><br/>PS. At Google, the two more frequently asked questions about Dunkirk are 1) Is the battle of Dunkirk the same as D Day? and 2) Where was the evacuation of Dunkirk? Well! I guess the people who asked these questions are this movie's audience. Sorry! Really!"

"ameliericketts","6","2","3","28 September 2017"," Nolans' Dunkirk, clambers wounded over the dune
","Christopher Nolan directed a different kind of war movie with Dunkirk (2017): it is styled as a slower-paced psychological and emotional approach to the events set in Dunkirk when the English attempted to save as many men as possible as the German army surrounded the Allied Forces.<br/><br/>If anyone remembers Atonement, it is this very same beach that the sisters lover ended up dying upon after contracting pneumonia. Many films have been produced about WWII, with quite a few consisting of the Dunkirk moment. The hopelessness in waiting whilst the Germans picked off ships and planes in the English armies attempt to escape is portrayed exceptionally by Nolan.<br/><br/>Nolan tells the multiple stories at once, in an attempt to relay various versions and possibilities of experiences from men at Dunkirk. Cillian Murphy also has a story-line which appears out of nowhere. At first the viewer does not notice he forces the boys trying to escape the beach and tells them to go back and find another way. Then, we next see him alone, boat overturned and suffering from PTSD. And at this point, it is like 'where did he come from? did we see him before?' This is where the issues begin to present themselves.<br/><br/>Where Nolan's Dunkirk tries to scramble across into the unnecessary is when the multiple story lines have cliffhanger moments which intersect and the viewer is unsure of who is going to survive the latest threat to the main characters lives. The cliffhanger moments are more something out of a Midsummer Murders (which I enjoy on a Saturday afternoon) and really present themselves as out-of-place in the slower- paced psychological trauma that is unfolding. Perhaps Nolan felt the audience would not stay for a non-action war movie and felt the need to plop such moments into the film.<br/><br/>The most awkward part of the  cliffhangers is Tom Hardy's character, Farrier, has his time re-arranged to be able to intersect with the other two story lines of civilian boatmen and boys on the beach. But this is not the oddest part of the Farrier time-line. What is a peculiar move on Nolan's part is having Farrier being the character who really drives and connects the other two stories. Yet, it is this narrative which causes the most confusion.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, whilst it is great to see the trauma and the pressure- cooker situations of war in Dunkirk have been brought to life by Nolan and the actors all superb, with so many story lines occurring at once there is not enough time to flesh out each character. But perhaps that is exactly the point? How many men were able to get to intimately know the personalities of each men they fought with in a rough situation where men died every day? One aspect that must be commended, beyond the actors conveying the emotional and mental turmoil of Dunkirk's escape is the English forces abandoning their French allies for the sake of themselves. This is perhaps something not oft-spoken about and was good to see the injection of this aspect of the war politics into Nolan's movie."
"aceofspades96","7","2","3","9 August 2017"," Elegantly shot, yet lacking character development.
","A rather unfair notion moviegoers have about Christopher Nolan is that every movie he creates must be instant classics. This notion is unfair mainly because no writer on the face of the earth constantly pumps out classic after classic. While I will agree that Nolan has a beautiful resume under his belt(as well as being my favorite filmmaker), he is only human, and is not perfect.<br/><br/>After seeing screen writing paradigms like Memento, Inception, and Interstellar, I fell in love with the characters that Nolan has created. I went into Dunkirk expecting to fall in love with a new set of characters all over again. Dunkirk just didn't deliver any form of character development at all. Unfortunately for Nolan fans, there is no main character for this film. Some actors get more screen time than others, however, the jury is still out on exactly who the story's perspective is told. However, the perspective changes 3 times, and in very rapid succession. We see either a young infantrymen, a trained pilot, or a group of civilians attempting to evacuate Dunkirk. These all sound like excellent ideas for characters, however, we know nothing about these people. Nolan did a fantastic job of making every moment of the movie have some sort of suspense. You were always on the edge of your seat hoping the worst wouldn't happen. However, I feel like the movie did a GROSS disservice to itself by lacking character development. A movie that is written to be this suspenseful should go hand in hand with amazing characters we hope don't die. Except, what we get is a very watered down attempt at suspense, and it really leaves a lot to be desired from the screen writing. For instance, Tom Hardy played a pilot in the Royal Air Force. Seeing him shoot down enemy planes with ease was very satisfying, however, at the end, when we see him captured by German soldiers, we have absolutely no clue why he purposely did that to himself. In fact, we know nothing about the man. All we know is that he is a damn pilot. What's even worse is that Tom Harry's character is a huge plot driver. To make such big plot decisions based off of characters who we know nothing about is very frustrating and overall a very cheap way to write a film.<br/><br/>While the film's plot leaves much to be desired, Nolan absolutely nailed the cinematography and effects. Christopher Nolan is the absolute master of practical effects, and you can really see the difference on the screen. I found myself drooling at some of the shots in this film. Some of the shots in this film last for 15-25 seconds all by themselves. It is no joke when I say that one of the best shots in cinema history is when Tom Hardy is flying, and the camera follows the plane. You can see the entire city of Dunkirk France in the background. This was an absolutely gorgeous shot, as well as many others. The action sequences in the film absolutely blew me away too. Right from the very beginning, the film's action sequences sounded, felt, and looked so close to real, I almost thought I was there myself. <br/><br/>Being a long time fan of Christopher Nolan, I have to say that I am disappointed in this film. Again, I would never have thought that a polished writer like Nolan would ever have a problem with character development. However, this is not the worst Christopher Nolan film to date, and is definitely better than Insomnia(not that that's saying anything)."
"peterp-450-298716","8","2","3","29 July 2017"," I'm sure it'll win prizes. Only ""Film of the year"" would be a bit far fetched.
","""Wars are not won by evacuation."" <br/><br/>I'm sure there are already as many reviews about Christopher Nolan's last movie about the battle of Dunkirk, as there were British soldiers on the beach of Dunkirk waiting for their evacuation. An awful lot. Although it wasn't a battle in the strict sense of the word, but rather a massive logistical operation to get the English army back on British soil. Whether this operation had any influence on the course of the 2nd WO, is something for military strategists and analysts to determine.<br/><br/>In my opinion, there was an incomprehensible blunder made by the German commanders. Fortunately, because sauerkraut isn't really my favorite dish. It's not a chapter in this terrible world war, with heroic battles taking place. A bold choice, but nevertheless, it was a breathtaking spectacle.<br/><br/>To call it ""Film of the Year"" is a bridge too far (you can call that flick a masterpiece). But Nolan succeeded in creating an energetic and exciting film that intertwines three different story lines in a non-chronological way. Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) is the key figure who must save his own skin from the beginning on, so he won't be mowed down by German bullets. It seemed like the only thing he did the whole movie was surviving one life-threatening situation after the other.<br/><br/>Then there's Farrier (Tom Hardy), one of three Spitfire pilots who try to safeguard the crossing of their troops and hunt down fierce German fighter planes and bombers which are trying to sink as many ships as possible. And finally there's Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) who's crossing the canal in a simple yacht together with his sons Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and George (Barry Keoghan) to help with the rescue of soldiers. In this way Nolan incorporates three different chapters, each taking place in another territory. By land, at sea and in the air.<br/><br/>The very first thing you'll notice is the largely wordless acting. Particularly Tommy whose lips seem to be sealed almost throughout the complete movie. It is as if in this war every conversation seems useless and body language speaks volumes. The majority of dialogues are at the expense of pilots and commanders. Unfortunately, the conversation between Spitfire pilots is sometimes unclear and restricted to indistinct mumbling. Partly due to deafening noise effects (and when you are watching this movie in a Slovenian cinema where it's hard to read the subtitles as well, this is a slight disadvantage).<br/><br/>And that brings us to the soundtrack. It's omnipresent and, in my opinion, of decisive importance. Hans Zimmer's music seems to be constantly present and bolsters the entire film. At moments unobtrusive in the background after which it swells out into a climax. Let's say that this is the very first time the musical setting demands my attention and impresses me. The same goes for the deafening noise effects, which sometimes make it seem like you're in the midst of the war. The down diving Stuka's and the deadly cargo they drop on the beach with that terrifying, screaming noise. Sometimes I had the urge to crawl deeper into my chair.<br/><br/>The way everything is portrayed is also phenomenal. The dogfights are in my eyes the highlights in this impressive film. The vast shots of the beach where thousands of Allies are crammed as sardines in a barrel. You can feel the threat of dead. The claustrophobic and precarious situations that'll make you feel as if you're trapped yourself. The despair flows off the screen. Thousands of Allies can, as it were, practically see their safe home but they realize that getting there is an impossible matter.<br/><br/>This is, just like ""Saving Private Ryan"", an epic war story. Only the first one was more brutal and showed the horror of WWII in a terrible way. That's why I still can picture some scenes from this Spielberg spectacle. I'm afraid that won't be the case when it comes to ""Dunkirk"". The fact that it was a defeat that led to a victory afterwards is an indisputably fact. And yet, I had this ""that's-it?"" feeling afterwards. Without a doubt, it was a traumatic experience for the thousands of Allies, but the compulsory cheering moment as apotheosis was a bit too predictable. And I'm still wondering why Farrier made that decision in the end. As reasoned as his previous actions were, so stupid I found this final decision.<br/><br/>Obviously, ""Dunkirk"" will win prizes at the major film festivals, but I'm afraid the main prizes will be awarded to others. I hope they'll release films the next six months that deserve the title ""Film of the Year"".<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc"
"michaelangelo962","1","1","1","16 May 2020"," Did I just watched a different movie?
","Overrated. This was the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life. Nolan was desperate to show the struggle and the meaning of survival during World War. I know that this is a true story and the portrayal could be close to the actual events, but c'mon man, this is a movie and that's the point. Somehow, it has to be engaging. The director should have made something that will make the audience understands what those soldiers are going through at that very moment. Even if it's something that could deviate a bit from the actual events. I don't know. Maybe focus on one or two soldiers then add a little backstory? That way, we could somehow relate to any of them. There is just no character development. I still gave it a chance though because of the 7.9/10 IMDb rating. I gave this movie the benefit of the doubt. Maybe something good will happen in the middle or a mindblowing scene that will captivate me in the end, then there's this scene where all the soldiers are arguing inside a ship/submarine/boat... gunfires have been shot... and that's it.<br/><br/>Plot:
This is a war movie based on true events (WWII) where soldiers are trying to evacuate the town of Dunkirk. They are struggling to find a good ship because the enemies are dropping bombs everywhere like... where the fck are these guys? Fighter jets flying all over the place. It's confusing because there is no distinction between the Germans, the French, the Brit, or the Belgian. I dont't have any idea who's with who. Some scenes are also confusing. There are scenes where a certain part is nighttime and the other half is daytime. Are you in different timezones? Then here comes the rescuers, the fleet comes in and then tada, the soldiers were saved. The moment they reached land, the soldiers were doubting themselves if they were an embarassment to their country (for just standing, diving and struggling) but don't worry, the people from their homeland still recognized them as heroes in the end. Bravo.<br/><br/>I strongly believe that this could have been portrayed better. Good intentions, bad delivery."

","This film begins with a small British patrol being ambushed by the Germans in World War 2 with only one survivor by the name of ""Tommy"" (Fionn Whitehead) able to escape. Fortunately, he manages to link up with the main British Expeditionary Force on the beach near Dunkirk, France. It's then that he realizes the predicament the army is in as they are trapped between the German army on one side and the English Channel on the other with very few ships to transport most of them. Not wanting to be killed or captured, he and another soldier named ""Gibson"" (Aneurin Barnard ) spot a wounded comrade nearby and carry him on a stretcher to a nearby ship where they hope to secure transportation. Unfortunately, after depositing the wounded man they are ordered off the ship-which is then sunk by a German dive bomber. Later they board another British ship only to have it sunk by a German submarine. Meanwhile, three British Spitfires are busy trying to protect other ships from German airplanes while at the same time monitoring their fuel consumption which is rapidly being depleted. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film was nominated for several prestigious awards including an Academy Award for Best Motion Picture. Personally, I was less than impressed as the background noise (used to increase the tension) went on for much too long to the extent that it got quite annoying after awhile. Additionally, the constant switching from one scenario to another made the film seem rather disorganized as well. In short, although this movie has won a great deal of critical and popular acclaim, I was rather disappointed and have rated it accordingly. Below average."

In moments, there are some decent scenes (e.g. just about getting safely behind French lines in one piece), but in the main, it's tedious, lethargic and lacking in punch, whether visually, or plotwise. Mark Rylance's character is likeably stoic, Branagh is OK, but there's just too little sense of urgency, scale, peril or intensity. A few hundred studenty looking types standing in line wistfully waiting for something to happen was the main image I took from this film. If I was the movie company boss, I'd have said ""I'm not releasing this tepid bag of crap. Do it again, or flush it."" It just doesn't work, and unlike the historical event itself, this faux epic failure will not be well remembered. Or indeed remembered at all."

","I wont bother you all with a lot of blather, about Directors, background music, graphics, etc etc... I will suffice it to say, that as most remakes go this one is simply another stinker, same as True Grit was,,,Over-priced and Over-rated!<br/><br/>For those of you who have NOT seen the original 1958 Dunkirk version starring John Mills, then you have missed out! Granted, the explosions are not near as spectacular as in this New over-priced remake, but it simply has a more realistic ""feel"" to it and better acting too! That said, find yourself a copy of the old classic version, then I dare you to tell me Im wrong!"

In the 1958 version they went through gain, loss, pathos, tragedy with good acting/script whilst this one had a masked man farting.
The 1958 film is far, far more superior.<br/><br/>When I watched the recent 1917 film, a friend who was going to see it asked if it was a as bad as this film (clearly it isn't). It says something about a film that is so bad that it is a yardstick by which others are judged.<br/><br/>Avoid."

"maddalollo","5","1","1","20 December 2018"," Complexity for nothing
","Let's begin stating that I love Nolan and all his movies that I've seen so far, so I tried very hard to like this one.
I'm not going to repeat what many other reviews already pointed out, but my critique is that the complicated time-line was not needed if not for adding complexity and reducing clarity in the plot.
In every one of his movies, the use of flashbacks and non linear storytelling is somewhat related to the characters or has the effect of making a plot twist much more powerful, but in this case I think it was used only to mask an otherwise bad narrative."
"billgreencontracting","5","1","1","10 November 2018"," No cohesive flow. Hard to follow
","The movie obviously sets out from the beginning to show that Dunkirk was a mess. I get it but for a movie watcher it is frustrating to not understand for a very long time what the director is trying to accomplish. We must follow A random array of characters from infantryman, to private boat owners, fighter pilots and a couple other characters desparate plight in what must be an middle Day in the evacuation timeline. Scenes are a random collection with no glue to hold them other than the flight from France. An obvious expense was used to create the authenticity which in afraid is rather wasted expenditures. The movie would most likely benefit by using an announcer to help keep us on point. I soent most of my time watching remarking ""Well that sucks"" but not having too much sympathy since the accosted character had no build up to appeciate his dilemma. I do appreciate the interesting perspectives the director obviously tried to show. Men watching other mens actions and demise from their current perspective was a new experience in cinematography. I do not recommend this for prime viewing, rather something to occupy your time on a rainy day or watch while waiting for the wrecker driver to arrive and tow your vehicle to safety."
"gonzaboca15","6","1","1","2 October 2018"," Disappointing
","I'm a huge fan of Nolan movies, but Dunkirk is a boring war movie; it wasn't what I expected. 
While I found photography and directing to be great, the plot was not up to par. 
I mean, it's a world war 2 movie, you expect to see some blood here, intense exchange of gunfire. Not only we didn't see that, we didn't see a single german on screen!"
"nondescriptbox","4","1","1","24 September 2018"," Astonishing!
","The score (and the film) are definitely different and not to some people's taste, but I think that's mainly due to pre-programmed expectations for both film and film scores as defined art forms. <br/><br/>I did feel like I was there, if only as an observer. I also cried, especially in the last half. I lived in the U.K. for almost nine years, so maybe that influenced my feelings, but even so, I was both riveted and moved by the cinematography, the direction, and the score! <br/><br/>Having said that, I did 'notice' the score a couple of times, so I guess that shouldn't happen--nothing should take you out of the film right?<br/><br/>Also (before I went to see it) two friends reported that the movie was 'too loud,' others said the acting wasn't good, they couldn't easily hear the actors speaking, and that there wasn't much of a plot. Again though, I think this could have been the result of having certain pre-formed expectations of mainstream movies in general. <br/><br/>On a side note, I saw a YouTube video by Vox called, 'The sound illusion that makes Dunkirk so intense.' It explains something called the Shepard-Rlisset Glissando,' which is what I heard as the reminiscence of the Rolls Royce engines in the English planes. Wow!<br/><br/>For me, the sound design and the film may be avant garde, and maybe I wouldn't want these styles in every film I see, but this one will definitely make it into my permanent collection!"
"rwassmer-75884","6","1","1","26 August 2018"," Ouch!
","In a word, disappointing. The film shows 300,000+ mostly brutish, selfish and hateful British troops rescued in Biblical fashion by an armada of little boats crewed by saints. Vast numbers of troops left on warships from the mole or ferried to them by the small vessels. On only one day out of 9 were more taken off the beaches as via the harbor. Poor weather actually limited German air interference over several crucial days - every day looked sunny and fair in the film. One personal observation: Not sure why these Tommies were in the service rather than in the cinema as they all looked like Hollywood heartthrobs - right down to a perfect set of choppers on every last one of them. Very artificial and unsympathetic. My rating of 6 is a nod to the superior air combat scenes."

About half way through I thought I had missed bits. By the end I knew I didn't get the treat I expected and like most reviewers I cannot understand how it got rated so highly.

"joeyesthatsme","5","1","1","22 June 2018"," Does NOT live up to the hype
","I remember when Dunkirk came out, there was a lot of hype and rave reviews. Watching it now, a year after release, I'm disappointed. <br/><br/>I'll start with what I liked: the costumes looked authentic, if not a bit too clean considering they are on a beach running for their lives. I thoroughly enjoyed the dogfights, mainly due to the cinematography. <br/><br/>In fact, the dog fights are the only parts of the film that I thought had decent camera work. The rest of the film had shots that felt too cramped, dark or confusing. British officers mentioned there were 400,000 men on the beach but you never see more than a few thousand. Some shots of the British merchant fleet lingered for way too long.<br/><br/>The sound was clearly designed for the IMAX experience, so I couldn't get the full feeling out of my meagre 5.1 system at home, and therefore I won't comment on the sound effects. However the music was straight up horrible. Is anyone else getting tired of Hans Zimmer and his atmospheric beats? They serve the same purpose as those cheap videos you find on Facebook where the music makes something seem to have emotion. If you turn off the music, you are left with an emotionless husk of an advertisement. Well I felt like it was similar in this movie. Way too forced, exaggerated and always in the background. <br/><br/>Finally, the timeline was just plain confusing. Some sequences felt like they were supposed to be happening simultaneously, except one location was in night time and the other in day. Sometimes I felt like the characters were in the middle of the channel when in reality they were a couple of hundred metres from the shoreline. And some of the soldiers that the movie follows look almost exactly the same, further confusing who you're supposed to be looking at.<br/><br/>All in all, some individual scenes had great action, tension and authenticity to it. But these were few and far between. The modern port cranes at Dunkirk, the rows of soldiers in clean uniforms, forced music and overall confusion all served to take me out of the movie."
"jakacbatko","6","1","1","20 June 2018"," Another war movie
","The whole movie is ok to spend a day on a couch. But at the end you still can hear that voice in your head: Is that is? In the very beginning I've noticed how clean the streets of France are. It's a bloody war. War is a mess. And there is not a single paper, rock, or any kind of garbage on the street. So details are definitely off in this movie. Second thing I've notice was that every plane that gets hit starts to leave a trail of smoke. It's like in a American movies where every car is ticking bomb. There is also guy who is in the movie just to say 3 words and nod his head and another guy who has been there only to get hit in the head. Do you really need to expose these people?<br/><br/>I see this movie more like video presentation of the war for school purpose so the kids get the idea what happened during the war, but it's not like documentary or at least movie with a great story. Except if you are a veteran who likes to go back in the good old days when they were young."

"remakesramistake","7","1","1","30 January 2018"," An academic movie for sure but a good movie?
","Christopher Nolan is a fine director. I really like his directing skills and his smart ways to tell a story. ""Interstellar"" and ""inception"" are both two of my favorite movies and I'm also fun of his older films like ""Memento"". So I was really excited when his newest film ""Dunkirk"" came out in the cinemas. The movie had really good commercial releases and is also consisted of a really strong cast. So the results were expected at least for me to be phenomenal. Did that happen? In a way yes but I have to say that I ended up really dissapointed by the film in the end.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong the film is amazing in some parts. In fact its technical aspect is excellent in every form. Nolan manages to create an amazing atmosphere. The viewer is feels like he is witnessing the events of operation Dunkirk at first hand. Hoytema's amazing cinematography is captivating and makes you fell claustrophobic even though most of this movies events are taking place in outer regions. And of course Nolan's genius directing does an excellent job telling us the events from three different aspects of the operation; land, seas and air. But then what is the problem with this movie? Mainly its the story. The movie lacks plot. Sure it tells about the events that took place at the operation but apart from that we don't see something amazing from the part of the characters. The directing feels detached from the story element and gives the feeling of a more docimanteristing aspect. But this movie is not a documentary. And when you are done admiring the technical aspects of the movie and you start emphasizing on the story element things are starting to collapse a little bit. The movie is filled with plot holes (like Tom Hardy's choice in the closure) or with some elements of Nolan's references to previews of his movies that doesn't give justice to this film (like Cillian Murphy's character who is introduced to us standing like Batman in the peak of a sinking ship). Overall, Nolan's movie is an academic movie. It should be teached in film schools as how to make a beautiful film. But it's not a masterpiece and surely not HIS masterpiece. And also is a movie made only for a cinema screen. Seeing this movie anywhere else will make the movie loose it's artistic touch."
"proud_luddite","7","1","1","27 January 2018"," Dunkirk
","Based on a true WW2 story: after the German invasion of France in 1940, thousands of British and Allied soldiers await evacuation to Britain in the northern coastal French town of Dunkirk.<br/><br/>Among war films, ""Dunkirk"" is unique in that it begins during the aftermath of an invasion rather than before it. The focus of ""Dunkirk"" is on rescuing several soldiers - too many for the sea vessels available - and preserve their lives.<br/><br/>The main narrative is broken into smaller stories. While all are intriguing action-wise, the characterization is thin overall. One exception is a story in which a helpful English civilian and ex-sailor (Mark Rylance) takes his own pleasure yacht to Dunkirk along with his young son and his teenage friend. The other stories are good in showing the tension of too many people to be rescued with too few vehicles involved but this tension could have been enhanced.<br/><br/>Writer-director Christopher Nolan has done a superb job in co-ordinating numerous extras and evoking an event that is far from the experience of the average viewer. (Apparently, Dunkirk survivors praised the film's accuracy.) He is greatly aided by his technical team especially those involving visual and sound effects. Some of the film's visuals truly stand out.<br/><br/>Although I don't fully join the almost unanimously high acclaim for this film, I still recommend it - especially on as large a screen as possible."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","1","1","25 January 2018"," Beneath Untold Layers of Tension, an Observant Artist's Touch
","The terror of a quiet solitude, exposed on an endangered French beach and desperately awaiting evacuation at the height of World War II. Abandoning the more experimental themes he toyed with in Inception and Interstellar, Christopher Nolan has set out to make a mostly-straight war picture, shining his spotlight on a major test (and ultimate turning point) for the British armed forces. Told from three entangled perspectives - one each from land, sea and air - we see heroes, victims, cowards and lunatics emerge from what might have otherwise seemed a nondescript group of young men. It's far less bombastic than the standard combat film, with a soft, observant character and distinct lack of extraneous dialog. That reticence, paired with an emphasis on beautifully-composed photography, reminded me more of an art film than an action epic. The battlefield's thick tension is inescapable, though, always drawing us back to the moment, with the frightened skyward eyes and skittish, shell-shocked nature of nearby soldiers proving a constant reminder that arbitrary death could be mere moments away. It's also the rare positive example of a recent tendency toward uneven sound mixes: a barrage of gunfire or sudden, screaming airborne bombing run can pack a mighty punch."

","Director Christopher Nolan delivers another superb film, this time a WWII epic recreating the events at the battle of Dunkirk, France in 1940, as Allied troops are forced to evacuate from invading German forces by fleeing to the beaches and harbor, where they await rescue from various ships both military and civilian, while a group of Allied fighter planes do their valiant best to defend them by air. A compelling and realistic viewing experience from start to finish, with masterful score and cinematography. Though there isn't much emotional involvement with the characters, it is the true story being told that is the attraction here, as this important event in the war is finally given a proper treatment, and is a welcome breath of fresh air given the overly cynical and CGI saturated nature of so many modern films. Would have been at home as much in its own depicted period as it is in ours; a real achievement."

"iansephton","3","1","1","28 December 2017"," Where was everyone?
","The scale of the mass evacuation of the British forces in retreat, surrounded by the overwhelming Nazi forces, and rescued by hundreds of heroic small vessels never built to cross the English Channel should have been an amazing sight to watch unfold in this film. 
Instead, we were shown a number of vignettes which in isolation should have shown microcosms of the personal experiences of those involved in this unique drama. 
I wondered if the grand scale would be addressed by even more impressive CGI than seen to date, or, with the reported £100m budget, would we see hundreds of living extras? 
I would be disappointed on both options.
The original film footage of the evacuation showed hundreds of men along miles of beach being dived bombed by Stukas, shelled by the opposing artillery moving ever closer, and dozens of boats and ships doing their best to avoid being sunk whilst pulling dozens of men from the sea to safety.
Christopher Nolan engages his usual favourite actors (Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy better know in the UK for starring in ""Peaky Blinders"") but the result was disappointing. The storyline was rather comic book in the end with a far fetched conclusion.
This was not the film I expected, but that means a much better film can yet be made of one of military history's most amazing defeats."

","The trailer made me really excited about the movie so I was gutted to find that the trailer gave the impression of a far different film to what actually hit the theaters. Nolan has been lauded by millions yet the only two films of his that live up to their billing in my opinion are Batman Begins and Inception. The Dark Knight left me cold, Interstellar was a real yawn but Dunkirk assumes the mantle of biggest letdown. Nearly every other director knows that you need to feel invested in the characters to be able to empathize with them and so get invested in their story. If I had wanted to watch a documentary on Dunkirk I would have watched the relevant episodes of The World At War. The film keeps you at arms length and never lets you get close to any character and so it doesn't matter to me if they live or die. I would say that Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh's characters were the only ones that I felt for. With Tom Hardy it was the last few minutes of the movie and for Branagh it was his humanity and the horror of what may befall the troops he was desperate to save. I have seen Branagh in two WWII films now, this one and Conspiracy. Dunkirk never gets started but Conspiracy is one of the most gripping and chilling movies I've ever seen; Branagh is so impressive as Reinhard Heydrich. Nolan is overrated in my opinion. He has good ideas but his execution of them mostly leaves me cold."

","I came to this expecting to see a masterpiece,as trumpeted by various critical writings and Kermode on the B.B.C..It's not.It started off well but once the central character,at least from the point of view of the British Army, reaches the beach it goes down hill.There is zero character development which results in myself,for one, having no particular investment in any of the characters.The Army personnel featured are universally a bunch of wasters,which is not the case for the majority who maintained their discipline and espirit de corps(read any of the numerous written works on the subject(or download them to your tablet if holding a real book is too tiring).The R.A.F. sequences are a bit better until the end where the Tom Hardy denoument is laughably bad.You might accept this junk in a comic book(sorry,graphic novel) adaptation but not when you're depicting what a real life piece of equipment can do.Can't say more without a spoiler,but anyone over 40 who knows anything about real aircraft will get my meaning.
 Finally,I would have preferred C.G.I. for the Royal Navy sequences but what we get is a couple of modern R.N. ships bedecked with painted plywood disguises for the superstructure-really laughably bad,although the small boat sequence with Mark Rylance did have some dramatic affect.I could have done without the rather pointless Cillian Murphy character .
In short the film is a computer game with some real people shoehorned in for the Playstation generation..Don't get sucked into spending a fortune to see it.Wait until the DVD comes out,watch it and then give it to the local charity shop.Watch the 1958 telling of the story with John Mills and Richard Attenborough in which you do have empathy for the lads in the platoon and for Bernard Lee,Attenborough and their crew,unless of course black and white films hurt your delicate little eyes..For a more detailed account of the rescue there is an excellent 3 part mini series Docudrama which is really worth seeing."

","When I saw the rating and the rave reviews I thought maybe I was about to watch the next ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Hacksaw Ridge"". No. Just no. This movie lacked action, character development, and a script. It is a very untraditional war movie. Rather than heroic battles and men charging head long into certain death only to find victory waiting for them, ""Dunkirk"" is a story of men hiding, running, and simply trying to get home alive. Perhaps that was the reality, but reality doesn't always make for good cinema. I think a lot of the hype around this movie is because it is untraditional, but that doesn't make it good. It was boring."

"aaronjwindsor-87650","1","1","1","20 December 2017"," How is this 8.2* on IMDB?
","I have been a huge film junkie my entire life, war films being in my top 3 genres. This is the first time however I have felt it necessary to express my opinion on a film, normally a film is either known to be good, or known to be bad. There are a lot that are just ok. But Dunkirk has been highly recommended by a lot of people and as you can see by the rating it has received on here, you would probably think this is going to be something special. Admittedly you can see the huge budget this film had, the picture is also beautiful, but this is where the good points end. <br/><br/>From the very first scene there is no plot to the entire film, the scenes are very quick and one would think this has been clipped and stitched together by a media student with no experience in the film industry. I personally found it hard to relate to any of the characters, so much So, that I can only remember one characters name ""George"" and the only reason being is because his name is said so frequently it becomes irritating. <br/><br/>The film is supposed to be reflecting on what happened in Dunkirk, however the writer and directors seem to have forgotten this. Over 400,000 men on the beach? At no one time do you see more than 50 people tops in one shot on the beach, majority of the time the beaches look more deserted than my local beach does in the winter. Local dog walkers making up a higher number than the cast of Dunkirk. I also got the impression from the actors that even they were bored filming.<br/><br/>Nothing drew me in, the only intense part of the film is the crazy, hyped background music that has been put into every scene foe the 1hour 46 minute film - non stop. It bares no purpose and frankly would have been better without. For around 3 minutes I listened to music leaving me in suspense thinking something big was going to happen, suddenly the music peaked and all that came of it was an enemy plane hitting the water, in an all but average scene. I believe the director has tried too hard to try and make this into a classic, like saving private Ryan. Unfortunately the cast, nor the plot were there to see this through. Majority of the user reviews are between 1-3 stars...<br/><br/>This is a true reflection of what the general public think of this movie, the people who seem to have rated much, much higher. Are film critics, who seem to be basing their reviews on the money spent and the picture. Unfortunatly if the reviewed honestly, I suppose this would be rated around 5* instead of 8."

","In Mrs Miniver the film had a propaganda even jingoistic elements that inhabited its story and characters.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a technical masterpiece but the story lacks an emotional core despite having excellent actors such as Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance. At one point I thought where is Hardy?<br/><br/>The film is set in a nonlinear fashion and unlike Saving Private Ryan, director Christopher Nolan has eschewed blood and gore.<br/><br/>Set in 1940 thousands of Allied soldiers have retreated to Dunkirk waiting to be picked up and sailed back to Britain. We focus on Tommy, a young soldier who has survived a German ambush. He meets another young soldier called Gibson on the beach, who is burying a dead body and says little. They try to make their way onto a ship by acting as stretcher bearers and taking a wounded man aboard a hospital ship. We see these two young men just wanting to survive and each time they meet with some unforeseen event.<br/><br/>Dunkirk shows the evacuation from land, sea, and air. Rylance plays a small boat fisherman who along with his son and another young boy are sailing to Dunkirk to pick up survivors. They have already picked one up along the way who is heavily shell shocked. Yet his story is hampered by an appalling side plot of a young man injured and wanting his old school to know that he did something important.<br/><br/>As the film has little dialogue, Nolan wants to create atmosphere and suspense through its visuals and music. In that sense it only partly succeeds because the film lacks dramatic impact."

The film has a narrative which retakes the same moment in time from different perspectives over and over again. It does not bring the story further and just becomes unnerving and tedious. The director focuses on a handful of men, mostly scared out of their wits, trying to show that men are animals (?) who's main concern is their own survival. Where are all the brave men that escaped the captivity of the German Wehrmacht, who strode on gallantly against overwhelming opposition and the horrible sights they have witnessed?
This was the saving of an army of some 340.000 men and there was just a handful in the film? 
Did RAF and Luftwaffe possess five fighters and two bombers put together? 
Was the movie so hamstrung by its budget it couldn't afford more than a couple extras and no CGI?
And what about that awful music; was it even music or did the director just buy a kids synthesizer at Toys'R'us?
According to this film all the British soldiers were cowards; really? 
No, this is not a war movie, this is not a documentary; it is a mockery of the brave fighting men who was saved to fight on to save Europe from the evil of Adolf Hitler."

I'm sorry but without his brother Jonathan, Christopher Nolan seems to have absolutely no clue about how to write a story.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is just a series of scenes ideas stitched together without any semblance of a plot emerging from the whole thing. In fact, 30 minutes after the beginning, we still don't even know the names of the characters!<br/><br/>The worst is that for an ""event that shaped the world"" nothing really spectacular actually happens. I was expecting a battle and all I got was soldiers trying to flee France on boats while being shot at by planes.

"esthercross","10","7","18","26 July 2017"," I came out of this film with no nails left to bite
","I would prescribe that anyone going to see Dunkirk bring with them 1) a defibrillator 2) strong anti perspirant 3) a stiff drink for afterwards. (Oh and some tissues for the end when Elgar accosts your already tattered emotions!)<br/><br/>Going into this film I was emotionally under-prepared for such a fiercely evocative experience! The film is an immediate sensory explosion and has your heart beating at an alarming rate pretty much within the first 5 minutes. When I came out of the cinema I had bite marks in my knuckle and here's the magic formula for how you put exhilarating and slightly cruel levels of tension on your audience. First off the music has a constant ticking beat which seems to slowly become more frantic as the film progresses. Han Zimmer manages also to interweave an almost mechanical quality into the score which ramps up the tension especially when there is large scale damage. The quality of the ambient sound and shots made me feel scarily involved in the unrelenting Dunkirk conditions. The shots were so wide and dynamic it felt at times like virtual reality. There are three different stories that cleverly interweave as the film progresses; Land, Sea and Air. Land is explored over the course of a week, the sea explored over a day and Air over the course of an hour. As the stories weave together you are often pulled between three different perilous scenarios. I love how Nolan play's with around with time lines in his films and I thought it was a very original concept to have three different time frames in one film.<br/><br/>Dunkirk did an impressive job of capturing the immensity of the damage as we experience ships being torpedoed and sinking from various terrifying angles and perspectives. In amongst these large scale sequences though the film also hones in well on the micro moments. There where some beautiful facial reactions that expressed real depth of emotion without the need of dialogue. I think the film had an interesting presentation because as Christopher Nolan said in an interview he wanted the whole story to be very present tense and there was no focus on backstory. Some people disliked this approach to character presentation but I thought it worked well for the film that everything was happening in the moment. There are some very breathtaking sky shots in this film and when the planes where diving I can say I felt on the cusp of queasy. Definitely catch this film on a huge screen with an all guns blazing sound system as you will feel the bombs and music in your seat! A fantastic film and a very emotional ending (bring tissues or at the very least a porous sleeve)"
"markcbray","10","7","18","24 July 2017"," An Instant Classic
","Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors and he has again delivered with this masterpiece. What I love about the film is that there is very little to it, it allows you to sit back and watch the drama unfold without getting caught up in ""how John is feeling."" It is more about the event than any single soldier, a concept which I love. Some reviews have been critical, saying there is little character development, but in my opinion while it is minimal it isn't needed because the film is just fantastically shot and put together. <br/><br/>The only complaint is I would have liked this to have been longer, maybe added something at the beginning or more dialogue about the unfolding events. However, I'm pretty certain there will be a directors cut when the BluRay is released to address this very minor problem. <br/><br/>The acting is also fantastic. Tom Hardy does an incredible job of making you feel like you're in the cockpit with him. Because of the way this is shot, in many scenes it makes you feel a little like you are actually there. Some have compared this to films like Inglorious or Saving Private Ryan, but for me they are way behind this. For real war film/series favorites I would liken this to the Band of Brothers episode where they follow the medic on the front line.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film enough and it looked amazing in iMAX."

","I am not someone who generally enjoys war movies; I went to this fully expecting it to just be something the boyfriend would enjoy. I was so very, very wrong.<br/><br/>This movie is, essentially, wonderful. I can't praise it enough. Literally the only issue was the strange way the timeline occurs. There are three separate timelines that involve three separate groups of characters and we didn't figure it out until about a quarter of the way into the movie. It actually didn't ruin anything, however. Very rarely does a movie's fault actually add to the experience, but honestly this made it much more intense. At the end, when all the timelines converge, any viewer should see what a brilliant choice Nolan made in using this unique format.<br/><br/>As for everything else, it is perfect in every way. It wasn't overdone, it wasn't underdone. It should go down in history as a staple of perfect cinema. <br/><br/>Even though it isn't a 'buddy' type war movie, you still feel immensely for all the characters. This movie also isn't dialogue heavy, but there are definite character arcs and development that is intensely compelling.<br/><br/>The cg effects blend seamlessly with the practical effects, which is always a relief. There's nothing worse than overdone cg; it ruins the immersion and makes it difficult to suspend disbelief. Speaking of disbelief, every second of this film is absolutely believable because Nolan crafted it so masterfully. He did everyone perfect in every way to make it historically accurate. It is more accurate than a real documentary.<br/><br/>This film was so lovely and intense with the exact amounts of subtlety while still punching you in the face that I ended up in tears for the last half. Dunkirk should win ALL the awards."
"t-viktor212","10","6","15","2 August 2017"," Why this could actually be one of the best war films even after accepting its weaknesses
","Dunkirk is one of the rare cases a film receives a huge critical acclaim and a mixed reaction from the audience. Some reviews arrive to consider the praise for the film being based solely on the name of its director, Christopher Nolan.<br/><br/>The main criticisms that Dunkirk receives is: poor character development, repetitivity of the action, little emotionality.<br/><br/>Dunkirk indeed doesn't really have character development. This is a fact. You get to know something briefly about Mark Rylance's backstory and his son's friend George, but nothing about anyone else. There is a reason for that: Dunkirk relies mostly on its fast pace, which simply does not give enough time to fully develop characters the way, for example, The Thin Red Line did with Stavros, or Saving Private Ryan did with John Miller. I dare to say that's not something the film needed at all. Stopping the story from taking its course so that Harry Styles and Fionn Withehead talk about their backstory and are more identified as characters would have taken away from the whole suspense feel the film expects the audience to receive. We got to love John Miller because of the night-time church moment, or the past reveal scene, or the scene in which he talks to Ryan prior to the final battle. These scenes are also those which make Saving Private Ryan a 2h40m film, with about 1h40m of action.<br/><br/>Repetitivity of action is a criticism I understood while watching the film. As many of the readers might know, this film tells three story lines contemporarily: one that lasts days, on ground, one that lasts less than a day, on the ship called ""Moonstone"" and another that lasts less than an hour, on the spitfires. These storyline become increasingly interconnected through the film, until the final climax. What sometimes happens is that you see the same action from a different perspective ten minutes after you have seen it from another. So, the film's first sequence that involves Spitfires has three of them flying over the sea, and there is a sailor ship in the corner of the shot. 30 minutes later you will realize that the ship was the Moonstone when you see that same thing from the perspective of the people on the ship. There are several of these repetitions. That's why some viewers felt it repetitive: most of the time (expecially the ship scenes and the plane scenes) they saw simply the exact same scenes. Anyone familiar with Nolan must know how he either did complex story lines on a linear plot, but is more known for the non-linearity of Memento, The Prestige and so on. Dunkirk is following this habit in a truly outstanding and clever way.<br/><br/>Dunkirk had no ""Earn this."" scene, or any moving John Williams score. The ending had some emotionality to it, but no other scene in the film. Dunkirk doesn't want you to cry. It wants you to feel the suspense the soldiers felt. Up until the last minute or so, not a moment of relief is left to the audience, and this is conveyed through the fast pace of the film and its very intense Zimmer score. Taken alone, the score is very similar to others he composed, but it does what is needed for the film's intensity.<br/><br/>As for accuracy, I looked up the main things about the Dunkirk evacuation before watching the film. A lot of elements are slightly mentioned or implied. E.g. the french defending the perimeter, or the existence of a second dock for the french, overall the sense of chaos is fully present, and the film delivers it well. There are some minor inaccuracies or simplifications, true, such as the German planes' scheme colour being one that they didn't use until some time later, which apparently was an intentional choice, but all the main details of the Dunkirk evacuation where there, in my view.<br/><br/>When the movie finished, I was relieved through the ending, but it delivered the intensity and climax that no other war movie gave. And Dunkirk did this without showing a single nazi soldier or without true warfare scenes: this is why Dunkirk should be considered one of the best war films made so far."

Is this the new form of whitewashing history, and pandering to the ever growing sensitivities of an overly politically correct entertainment industry? At any rate, aside from this same annoying trend that ruined Captain America and Wonder Woman, there was no emotional depth to the movie whatsoever, both in terms of the characters or action. Worst of all, there was an artificial feigned sense of selflessness among the main characters on several occasions. Movie on the whole just fell flat."

","There was not a second of this film that seemed unnecessary or out of place. I have no idea how Christopher Nolan has managed to create such a seamless film, but in my eyes ""Dunkirk"" is cinematic perfection. In watching ""Dunkirk"", you experience the hopelessness of being one of the hundreds of thousands of British soldiers trapped on the wrong side of the Channel. The cinematography is the best of any Nolan film; the colours are vivid yet muted, and the shots are packed with emotion. This is a phrase tossed around often, but Nolan does a superb job of humanizing war; ""Dunkirk"" is filled with unimaginable acts of heroism, yet there is not a moment that feels detached from reality. In perhaps his greatest triumph, the horror of the Second World War is meaningfully illustrated without the crutches of gore and excessive brutality. Just see this film. I believe every human alive should."

","DESCRIPTION: ""The enemy have driven the British and French armies to the sea. Trapped at Dunkirk, they await their fate. Hoping for deliverance. For a miracle.""<br/><br/>REVIEW: The film unfolds both beautifully brilliant and intensively subjective. Known from Nolan's non-linear story lines, this approach is technically mastered by his vision of the story. The plot is stranded and told with 3 perspectives in 3 different time-frames. This element of storytelling device causes for a comprehensive, full-scale picture of the event. The filmmaker is in that way able to tell the whole evacuation in just under 2 hours runtime (his shortest film since Following (1998)). It is neat and compact. Not overdone and rely on zero exposition; I think he heard the fair share of criticism here.<br/><br/>So, introducing first: The soldiers waiting on the beach by the Mole, which lasts a whole week. While the horrors upon the sea wave a time of one day. The battles in the air and Farrier's plane engine run and roll for one hour. As the story progressed, the sequences synchronize while the story lines intertwine. All that backed up by a blistering and blasting score delivered, once again, by Hans Zimmer.<br/><br/>Fun fact: Zimmer used Nolan's own pocket watch as the ticking time sound heard in the background. It's crazy how the sound intensifies the ticking while the action- driven plot thickens. One more quite notable technical aspect, there is little to no dialogue. The director studied silent-films while prepping for the project. This, of course, means that there is a lack of character development and story insight. Though this may cause some dividedness from viewer to viewer, as getting used to this rarely seen structure. However, one should know that it doesn't matter. It's an experience where you're part of. You're invested in this whole splendid act.<br/><br/>From start to finish, the whole movie is actually one giant action sequence and an epic thrill-ride. And so it begins: The opening of Dunkirk, where soldiers are wandering and walking around a deserted street, papers (that read: ""We Surround You"") sailing through the wind, landing on soldier's helmets. When suddenly enemy fire emerges and one young soldier survived the shootout, only to find himself on the beach with (realistically supposed to be) 400.000 other soldiers looking scared into the sky seeing German planes approaching and ultimately unloading aerial bombs on the beachscape. (I still feel sorry for him not having had the chance to properly take a sh*t, but I bet he probably sh*t himself considering the circumstances he would find himself later in.)<br/><br/>Later down the line we find ourselves in the utterly thrilling target practice sequence where soldiers are trapped in a boat, hoping to float into the water, only to find themselves hostage by unexpected flying bullets hitting the under deck. There occurs a leak and one soldier dies immediately just after a single, innocent peek. Meanwhile, a friendly pilot was shot down out of the sky and now finds himself in a similar situation. He is trapped in his own cockpit, hostage from the heavily flowing water that's filling up inside, only minutes away from drowning, he tries to break out. It's all about building up suspense here (Hitchcock's way of filmmaking).<br/><br/>And, perhaps the most memorable moment in the movie, Tom Hardy saving the lives of thousands of soldiers on the beach. With his plane run out of fuel, he sails through the wind and floats in the air, opening his small cockpit window to hear and receive a roar of applauds by the people on land. In another scene, the rest of the surviving soldiers are hopping on a train at night, and later waking-up to a ""new-world"". Channeling back, Ferrier's plane is slowly descending, comfortably landing onto the watery beachscape. Knowing that he's gonna get captured by the German and held as a prisoner of war, he first burns down his plane, in case the enemy benefits from the technology that would only be added to their already advanced arsenal. The flickering burning flames fill up the frame as soldiers are approaching in the distance. A silent hero is being sacrificed, but ""we shall never surrender"". And just before cutting to black, there is a completely silent shot of that young soldier sitting in a train, wondrously- looking up. The cinema was completely silent. You could only hear that mundane sound of a newspaper. Indicating that life simply goes on.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Christopher Nolan has crafted another brilliant movie. Once again, he showcases his direction and writing skills powerfully as well as artfully. Zimmer's soundtrack is bombastisc. It fits perfectly into the film. The cinematography is beautifully done by Dutch cameraman Hoyte Van Hoytema (DoP, Interstellar) The acting performances also feel pure and real. (Nolan intentionally casted young and inexperienced actors, some roughly just 18 years old. This was done in order to increase a stronger sense of reality).<br/><br/>Personally, I love that the movie doesn't linger on cliché war-porn, forms of perfectly scripted dialogue. It neither suffers from being cheesy or unoriginal. Instead, this is in fact probably the most innovative movie you'll ever seen. It is purely practical and wholly experimental. The director really emptied his tank with this unique take on the war genre. An achievement in modern-day cinema that is an authentic and traditional piece of art.<br/><br/>Dunkirk can arguably be considered as one of the greatest war movies of all time. Definitely in recent memory. Time will tell how well it holds up against films such as Saving Private Ryan. But to say the least, Dunkirk is a magnificent triumph. There's nothing quite like it. It doesn't try to be something else. It is masterfully grounded in it's own perfect picture that it's painting and portraying. This is as close and real as war films get. Realistically, flawlessly executed. That's why it works time and time again.<br/><br/>10/10"

The film isn't about one in particular man it's about community, and how every member is important in his own way. There isn't much talking in the film instead scenes are speaking for themselves, and that is exactly what is special about Dunkirk.

"nolane-75584","3","5","12","31 July 2017"," Good cinematography Horrible script
","I agree with the other reviewers about the cinematography so I won't go into that. I love WWII movies, and historical movies in general, and I was really looking forward to this one as I didn't know all that much about this event. The promos for the movie made me think this was going to be about the evacuation of Dunkirk by the hundreds (thousands?) of civilians. Alas, it ends up being a survival story. Don't get me wrong, the story from the point of view of the GIs is a story that needed to be told. As my 89 year old WWII vet movie companion stated, nobody should forget this event. The movie did a good job of portraying the GIs' struggle to survive.<br/><br/>Here's a question for you, when did this event take place? Yes, we all know it takes place during WWII, but when? Well, you won't learn that from the movie. Nor will you learn about the civilian rescuers. Not how many there were. Not their stories. Not where they came from (all over England or just a particular area?). Not how long this evacuation took. Not how many GIs were rescued. There are a couple of vague references to the civilian program and one line referencing an approximation of how many men were rescued. There wasn't even the usual post-movie paragraph giving the facts of this event. Other than a lot of men died, you won't learn much else about this event.<br/><br/>The movie attempts to follow the GIs on the beach, the ""air"" battle such as it was, and the voyage of ONE civilian boat. At the beginning of the movie there appears on-screen the numbers 1, 2 and 3 - with a time period after each one. No explanation. I sat through the entire movie thinking what the???? After the movie, and after I Googled the event, I'm guessing that those were supposed to let the viewer know the three time-periods during which the 3 separate story lines of the movie take place. But it's just a guess.<br/><br/>If you just want to watch a ""pretty"" movie, this is for you. But beyond that, as a historical movie it's just awful. The movie was confusing, disjointed, convoluted, and lacking any substance whatsoever. And the characters? There weren't any. Nobody to get the viewer involved in the movie. My takeaway from the movie was these men were sitting ducks and a whole lot of them died.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie that is indirectly about Dunkirk but is world's better than this thing, see ""Their Finest"", it's definitely a 10 star movie."
"lukas-meister","9","5","12","30 July 2017"," (Minor Spoilers) I almost wish this movie would be without dialogue, it is an aesthetically incredible film.
","I will start this by saying that Dunkirk is a bit of a different war film for me, because it doesn't focus on having a tight, cohesive narrative and clear protagonists which in most cases increase the emotional impact it has on the viewer. It instead establishes a basic premise: It is WW2, the Allied forces are surrounded by the Nazis and we watch them as they are evacuated near Dunkirk. This premise and so the beginning of the movie also let us know that TIME is the most important aspect of this film, and we are reminded of this fact in nearly every scene by not only the circumstances (a sinking ship, chances are you could die) but also by the brilliant soundtrack which resembles a clock ticking until the very end. Time is of the essence. Time decides if you die or live.<br/><br/>So now that the baseline is established, the viewer is simply thrown in there to see how people deal with this situation which makes the film feel very real and honest. Throughout the film we follow 3 separate, loose plot lines (See, air , land) and watch how they try to survive. It becomes clear that even though these 3 lines tackle the war from very different angles, they cant really escape the war and it affects everyone, whether it may be being in close danger or fearing the danger could be close one day if you don't act now. Everything happening in the immediate foreground is always overshadowed by the key elements of the movie: The lack of time and the need to survive. I guess Nolan described it best when he said its more of a thriller than a war film, because creating tension is the main objective here and the music, acting, directing and cinematography support and emphasize this incredibly well.<br/><br/>Overall i would almost wish for Dunkirk to be without dialogue because aesthetically, visually and musically it is just magnificent. The sound is amazing, the lighting and the effects are gorgeous. Hans Zimmer finds the right timing for every tiny instrument, ,let it be loud and overwhelming or quiet and empathetic. Zimmer controls Dunkirk in his very own way. As the film draws to a close the disruption between loud and silent moments increases, this is superbly supported by the cinematography and directing which change the focus according to the events unfolding. The switching between narrow and wide scoping becomes more rapid. What adds the most to the suspense i would say is that the switching between the 3 plot lines becomes more and more rapid as well, until we finally see that they are not as separate as they were before.<br/><br/>In my opinion the criticism that it doesn't have a story, main character and no emotional impact doesn't really hold up because not only is that not needed in this film, it also isn't the goal of Dunkirk. This film is very observing, from micro to macro and back to micro. Sure, it delves into the psychological impact of war and the violence it creates, but it doesn't linger. It just pants a picture.<br/><br/>As far as negatives go, i think there is some unfounded pathos and stupid dialogue in there that kinda weakens the observing nature of the film, but it certainly is nothing major. The acting is good but nothing special, which it doesn't have to be anyway. I think this could objectively be Nolans best film to date because it doesn't really give you a lot of room for emotional or story related criticism. Instead the scenes are very structured and you can pinpoint to exact moments if you talk about it. After the premise is established, everything happening makes sense. Everything these character do makes sense, nearly everything say say makes sense. The reason why Dunkirk works so well and keeps you on edge might be its short run-time which also makes sense if you look at the artistic decisions behind it. Now i can just thank and congratulate Nolan and everyone involved with Dunkirk for creating such a great movie."

"PotassiumMan","9","5","12","26 July 2017"," Extraordinarily tense war film told through individual stories
","Although touched upon in some films in the past, the British-French evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940 as France neared total collapse at the hands of the Germany Army in WWII has never been given the kind of comprehensive and vivid treatment that Nolan's explosive war film does.<br/><br/>This film fully captures the anxiety, desperation and seeming hopelessness that the British Army faced in its efforts to save its troops in France and prepare to defend their own soil as Hitler's armies defeated the French and overran the European mainland. It does so by giving the audience a close-up of the evacuation from as many vantage points as possible. These include the British troops trying to cross the English Channel (told from both masses and a small group) as well as civilians who used their own vessels to aid a depleted British Navy in rescuing the troops and from the air in which British spitfire pilots fought gallantly to protect British ships and troops from German aircraft and finally from the British high command desperately trying to pull off a miracle.<br/><br/>In the air strike scenes, Nolan makes the screaming sound of a German dive bomber as menacing and tension-inducing as any director has done in recent memory. The tension is amplified to a raw crescendo by Hans Zimmer's brilliantly realized soundtrack. Equally impressive is the sense of dread created in individual troops trying to escape but facing one seemingly fatal catastrophe after another. As far as performances go, this isn't any one actor's film, though everyone is great with exceptional work by Fionn Whitehead, Harry Styles and Mark Rylance. Tom Hardy has a fairly important role though he spends most of the film muzzled by a fighter pilot mask. The film's achievement lies in creating a wide-ranging account of courage, sacrifice and perseverance in the face of almost-certain disaster. It doesn't offer much speechifying or jingoistic sentiments, just the hard-boiled realism of war.<br/><br/>The story of a hardened and weary army trying to escape to defend its own shores might not resonate right away with audiences unfamiliar with the war, but this film is a lot more than just a mere depiction of history. It's also a master class in dramatic spectacle and the recreation of an epic tale of survival in a war that at that moment seemed likely to end very soon. Splendidly realized, it is not to be missed."
"pdmajumder","10","5","12","26 July 2017"," A WWII depiction of verisimilitude
","Has Christopher Nolan struck gold again? Yes he has.<br/><br/>Where do I start with this one? I am putty in the hands of films. They can very easily manipulate me emotionally and linger on in my mind for days and even months. But of late, despite this certain weakness, I wasn't being able to spot films of such caliber that could leave a long-lasting impression on me even though I really have been watching some great movies. But now, finally, that spell has been broken. Dunkirk has taken me on a ride, plunged me into the cold depths of the English Channel, made me scramble for life aboard a sinking ship and pray to dear God for a miracle. It is exactly that, which we witness on screen. With not much of a particularly intricate story to tell, it is simply a raw and immersive visual feast of the horrors of war.<br/><br/>Right from scene 1, you're thrown into action. The film lives and breathes in the moment, just like the characters who're trying to escape fate and have hardly any time on their hands for anything else. There is not a single scene that is wasted and due to its tight run-time, the film feels perfectly measured. Every frame brings with it a sense of uneasiness and an overbearing feeling of a portentous, if not ominous, immediate future. <br/><br/>In classic Nolan style, we see perfectly color-graded shots,frequent angled viewpoints and a non-linear narrative consisting of three separate timelines occurring very close to one another which eventually merge in the end. The cinematography is flawless and the use of real locations and props (including even the planes and boats) only add to the authenticity. Hans Zimmer's background score is haunting and forms an interdependent relationship with the visual proceedings of the film, elevating our experience to the stirring heights of amazement. The crescendo of the tense, shrill sounds of strings with the arrival of an enemy plane or just the tick-tick- tick of a clock, signifying the race against time, laying low in the background of momentarily silent scenes can give anyone the shivers.<br/><br/>The characters we see are not allowed to sit with us and tell us the stories of their past lives. We don't know if some young man left a fiancé at home or grew up with only one parent. No one person receives special focus and our attention is never drawn away from the war. In spite of this, just the spanning theme of agony and fear makes us root for every single one of them, even the ones we see for only a few seconds. We palpitate and draw sharp breaths every time a rescue attempt is thwarted mercilessly by the Germans or someone is fighting for life in a dire situation.<br/><br/>""Survival isn't fair"" is very rightly said by one soldier in the movie. Especially when circumstances are so trying that the basic thread of hope that binds humanity together is being stretched to its limit, one should not be expected to think of anyone but one's own self. However, every now and then, when we see a ray of compassion breaking through the rock solid layer of desperation and the ugliness it can lead to, we're reminded of the power of our hearts. When a mass of civilian boats appear on the horizon to save the soldiers or when a fighter pilot makes sure to destroy an enemy plane even when he's about to fall, we are made to realize that empathy is really all that defines us. No one was born of special mettle but built it up in themselves and let it out even when it was hardest for them to do so. It renews the belief that maybe we too have such potential within us.<br/><br/>While I do think watching the movie in IMAX will make it even more extraordinary than it already is (and I heavily regret not being able to do that), Dunkirk will be marvelous irrespective of the format it's viewed in.<br/><br/>This is a story of something true that definitely took place in the past. People went through living hell and survived. But watching this film, it was jarring to accept this blatant yet almost unbelievable fact. While we may never come close to knowing what it must really have been like to exist even for a second in the reality of that sort of terror, we can try beginning to fathom it by finding out how, by just being a mere spectator of a fictitious recording of the same events, we can be so severely moved. <br/><br/>P.S. If this doesn't win an Oscar, I don't know what will."

","'DUNKIRK' was directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy and Fionn Whithead. ​In May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, Belgian and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.{And I won't count the story recap as spoilers, you will know that if you had an education. }<br/><br/>This movie is a breath of fresh air in a genre were each of its films is fighting for recognition. Dunkirk is a truly intense and thrilling roller-coaster minute one and lasts until minute 120. Featuring excellent performances from the entire cast and Nolan's signature use of effects and sound design, this is a movie that you need to see in cinema's to truly appreciate. Probably enjoyable on a small screen but I 100% believe it benefits from wonders and joys of cinema screens.<br/><br/>This movie is retelling the event of Dunkirk. And as far as I am aware, it does it really accurately. We follow the battle from land, air and sea, and the way Nolan interconnects all the stories is brilliant. None of them are connected at first but they slowly begin to join together as the film progresses. The ending is truly perfect and I can't praise Nolan enough for his endings.<br/><br/>This may take a while. Mark Rylance was fantastic as Mr Dawson and did a great job a commanding the movie to his will. Tom Hardy is probably one of the best actors working today and does a phenomenal job as Farrier. Conveying emotion purely through your eyes is very, very, very impressive. Fionn Whithead was great as Tommy and it is amazing that he rarely ever spoke for the entire film. Harry Styles was good in the movie. A sentence I never thought I'd have to say and never will again. Cillian Murphy was great in his small role and gave a powerful performance as a man traumatised by the war. Keneth Braghan was great in his more minor role but still managed to make a commanding performance. I am doubly impressed by the acting in this movie due to the fact that it is mostly visual and not-dialogue heavy so the actors had to utilise their face the most instead of their voice. I imagine that is very difficult in today's film climate so I will congratulate every actor in the movie, including the ones whom I didn't mention.<br/><br/>As much as the performances were great, the characters were not. The split between liking and disliking this movie is based around the point of either the characters sucked so it was bad or it's a film about the conflict, not the characters, so it is good. I agree with the latter's sentiment more but I do agree that if that was the intention, don't follow anyone. Don't even bother giving characters a name. If we are expected to follow specific characters, the audience expects the writer and director to make us care for these characters. Again I do agree with the idea of it is about the battle but I wont be a blind fanboy and disregard any flaws with this film. I am not biased.<br/><br/>This is 2017's technical masterpiece, I think. The effects used are phenomenal and I give bonus points due to a lot of it being practical. If that is actually true then that is exceptional. If there was CGI used, it wasn't very obvious or noticeable. Cinematography and editing are both top notch but that has become Nolan standard now. If the sound design for this movie doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination, I will lose my mind. I generally don't care about an aspect like this of a film but when it is extraordinary, you can guarantee I'll pick up on it. Sound design has always been a positive in Nolan's films and I think this may be his best yet. Truly exceptional work.<br/><br/>This movie starts with the evacuation of Dunkirk and ends with the evacuation of Dunkirk. There is no in between and it is a film about Dunkirk. Please see this film in cinema's if you can but if not, see it anyway. It is an exceptional war movie which I really deserves its acclaim. Say what you want about Nolan, the man is a great director. I'll rate the film 9 HOMEs out of 10!"
"cormacjohnkelly","9","5","12","25 July 2017"," One of the finest WW2 films that wasn't a war film
","Enough has been said already of the brilliance of this film and of Nolan's direction, so this will be short. This is a thrilling and harrowing look at the Dunkirk evacuation, and the victory it should be recognised as, not as a shameful retreat. Nolan focuses on the event itself rather than on the characters, so the little dialogue and the ordinary characters are not missteps. This is an unselfish and balanced look through different perspectives at the event. It was in no way excessive or gratuitously violent, but extremely intense throughout, capturing the desperation and the fear. This was a jarring, real and incredibly important film that told a spectacular story of human triumph."
"shailendra-singh435","8","5","12","23 July 2017"," People say this movie lack characters and story depth, well it doesn't need one.
","A lot of good movies have come in war genre and it is difficult to generate something new without risking much. But Dunkirk is NOT a risk taken, it is all original and pristine. This is a war movie without too much blood, explosions, and dynamic camera movement. there is no emotional melodrama but the psychological terror that one feel with almost every scene. This movie is something new, a different perspective on the situations of war, you don't need to know the backstories, you don't need to think about the person but you need to think about the situation, experience it. It's the fear, it's the unforeseen and instant enemy that anything can happen anytime. It's when in 3 seconds you feel for relieved soldiers eating bread to trapped underwater in the darkness. You experience it all in the shoes of the soldiers. You are the character, if Nolan had made it like his typical thriller then it would not have been this better, it is intentional and he succeeded in it. ""Is he a coward? Mr. Dawson- ""No, he is shell shocked."" you will never understand what he was into, and you don't need to, you just have to know it. What you see and what you hear is complementary and extraordinarily captivating. The best dog fighting scenes in a movie ever. Film direction and cinematography is wonderful and engaging, but the best part of the movie is its original score by Hans Zimmer. He really nailed it. Next time we will hear a lot about Dunkirk in the 2018 Oscars."
"The-Sarkologist","9","5","12","22 July 2017"," Visually Stunning
","Well, Nolan has certainly left his mark on modern cinema, and in a way what he seems to have done is merged independent cinema with that of the big blockbuster. The reason that I mention this is because at times this film actually felt as if it was more of an art house production that anything else, particularly when the hero, who doesn't seem to have a name, emerges onto the beach to see lines and lines of soldiers standing there waiting to be picked up, and then looking for a way in which to cut to the front of the lines. The other thing is that the dialogue is quite minimal – it seems as if he is simply letting the visuals tell us the story than anything else.<br/><br/>To say that this film has been heavily promoted is an understatement – it's as if the producers and the film company are going out of their way to make this film the film of 2017, and are probably also angling for an academy award, but then again most serious film makers have that as a goal, even though it tends to be much more political that actually having any real merit for creative, artistic, and acting ability. Yet this film is incredible in the way that it just drags you into the action and the desperation that the British troops must have felt while standing on that beach with the Germans closing in on them.<br/><br/>I'm sure we all know about Dunkirk, and if you don't then all I can say is 'Google it'. However, the film is constructed through three intervening time lines. At first it seems a little confusing, particularly since in one part it seems to be day, but they then cut to another scene and it is night. However it then clicked that at the beginning of the film, when he is introducing the three stories – that of the soldier's on the beach, the boats crossing the channel, and the two planes flying over, that the times are different. This is one of Nolan's specialities, that he is able to merge three different times into a single thread, and then have them all come together. At first we see things that appear to be disconnected but as the film progresses it suddenly all starts to make sense.<br/><br/>In a way what we have here is a memorial to the battle, or more so the evacuation, that helped Britian and the allies win the war, even though it was only in its initial stages. The evacuation of three-hundred thousand troops, while under fire, using only small boats, is something to be remembered. The thing is that the Russians attempted a similar thing at Kerch when the Germans invaded the Crimea, and they failed, but then I guess the Germans had learned from Dunkirk by that time. In a way it is about how a whole nation came together to work together to fight off a common enemy.<br/><br/>There are a couple of things to note though, because despite all of this we are still confronted with the selfishness of some of the soldiers, who are attempting to spare their own lives, and in doing so we note that innocent people die. However, despite these lone wolves, for want of a better word, the operation was still a success. The other thing that Nolan draws out is the feeling of hopelessness and betrayal that the soldier's felt – they had lost the battle and it seemed like the war, however when they finally arrived home they came home to a heroes welcome. It was in fact quite a moving part of the film. However, it seemed that despite everything, I was a little surprised to find that there were so few planes in the air – I thought maybe there would be much, much more over Dunkirk at the time, but then again that was a minor issue with an otherwise outstanding film."

","Dunkirk is a masterfully shot film with brilliant stunts and superb acting. The only possible aspect lacking in the film was the characters and their development, however this film didn't choose to focus mainly on the characters but rather to focus on the events that they went through. The dogfights and ship scenes fully immersed the audience into the action. Throughout the film, Christopher Nolan, decided to intersperse the three perspectives to then be able to link all of the events together. The inclusion of each perspective including 'The Mole', 'The Sea' and 'The Air' added to the suspense as we can see how the struggles through one section may affect the other perspectives.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan, once again, produced an outstanding film, that details the events of Dunkirk. 9/10"

Zimmer's frantic tension racketing score and Hoytema's expansive lens (perfect for Imax enjoyment) working alongside Nolan and his committed cast that is spearheaded by Fionn Whitehead's young solider Tommy, Tom Hardy's dogged pilot Farrier, Mark Rylance's everyday seaman turned hero Mr. Dawson, Cillian Murphy's shell-shocked and nameless survivor and yep One Direction's Harry Style's Alex, Dunkirk is an all round production that will likely partake in an abundance of technical end of year awards and hopefully past-due awards recognition for Nolan himself.<br/><br/>A master of his art for so long now, Dunkirk feels like the final undeniable piece of Nolan's filmography puzzle and for anyone that has felt in the past that Nolan is undeserving of the praise he has so far received, good luck arguing against it now after sitting through this impeccably designed and executed thrill-ride that achieves its goal of not delieveing a history lesson but an utterly captivating encapsulation of the Dunkirk event.<br/><br/>Final Say – <br/><br/>While it has some minor flaws and foibles (what film doesn't?), Dunkirk is clearly the work of a master director that acts as groundbreaking cinema that should be sought out by any who have even a passing interest in film.<br/><br/>A white-knuckle examination of an unbelievable true life event, that's filled with spectacle but most importantly an understated yet touching and thought- provoking power, Dunkirk is easily one of the years must-see film's and a likely all time classic of the war genre.<br/><br/>5 pieces of bread out of 5"
"MrDHWong","10","5","12","20 July 2017"," A near perfect look into the mindset of a soldier in the midst of wartime chaos
","Dunkirk is a war film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, The Prestige). Based on the real-life Dunkirk evacuation of World War II, the film further proves that Nolan is one of the best living directors and cements his legacy as a brilliant, unique filmmaker.<br/><br/>In 1940, over 400,000 allied British and French troops stationed on the beaches of Dunkirk in France find themselves surrounded by German troops. With the enemy closing in fast, the allied troops desperately try to find ways to escape across the English Channel to the safety of the British mainland.<br/><br/>Despite its limited dialogue, the film offers a near perfect look into the mindset of a soldier in the midst of the wartime chaos. Not since Saving Private Ryan has a film so effectively pulled this off. The unnaturally loud and piercing sound of bullets and gunfire evoke feelings of fear and panic in the viewer, giving off the impression that they too are on the battlefield. The audience is given real sense of a race against time (time being a recurring theme in several Christopher Nolan's films) thanks in part to Hans Zimmer's fantastic, yet, minimalist score. There's not a single moment in this film that does not elicit suspense or tension in the viewer. Christopher Nolan's creative use of cinematography perfectly showcases the desperation of the soldiers in their need to escape. Overall, I consider Dunkirk not only among the director's all time best films, but one of the best war films period. <br/><br/>I rate it a very high 9.5/10"

Harry Styles, best debut ever, you will love him here, he can act. All the cast were superb, I mean everyone. Michael Caine cameo is also there, just his voice. <br/><br/>The film does not have so much dialogues, but the story is told so well through cameras, sound, and actors' movement, which just increases the intensity. Its more of a survival film then war action like Saving Private Ryan (no comparison), but the action again is phenomenal. The film is also just under 2 hours, but because of pace, and uneasy yet amazing OST by Han Zimmer (his new top work), this will be the slow but amazing almost 2 hour film."

"MOscarbradley","10","7","19","24 July 2017"," Quite possibly Nolan's masterpiece
","Only days after its cinema opening it has already become fashionable to knock Christopher Nolan's magnificent ""Dunkirk"" as if Nolan's past success was tantamount to some kind of blot in his present copybook or did the films naysayers simply expect more? I admit a bit of CGI might have helped the films scale; there seemed to me a paucity of both men and boats but for once scale isn't the raison d'etre for Nolan's film. Clocking in at under two hours and eschewing stars in favour of a handful of decent actors Nolan homes in, not on the epic, but on the small.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film titles tell us that we are actually seeing three different time-spans running concurrently; a week at the Mole, (Dunkirk itself), a day on the sea and an hour in the air and thanks to some brilliant editing we experience events on the beaches, in one small pleasure cruiser and in an air battle simultaneously. This is no ""The Longest Day"" but something altogether more intimate. If the action sequences are on a relatively small scale for a war picture of this size, the suspense and the fear they generate are epic and Nolan ensures that every dogfight and burning vessel looks damn real. Here is a war film that has a ring of truth to it and I found it deeply moving.<br/><br/>The cast may seem large but by using talented players who can actually act, the characters he concentrates on come vividly to life. Newcomer Fionn Whitehead is excellent as the young soldier we are first introduced to at the beginning of the film and follow through to the very end while Mark Rylance has no trouble stealing every scene he's in as the civilian determined to make it to the beaches and back again. If Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy seem more like guest stars, they too create credible characters with whom we can identify while technically the film cannot be faulted; this is a film that can safely expect a slew of Oscars next year. It's also the film most likely to pick up the coveted Best Picture prize. Nolan has finally proved he is a lot more than the sum of his parts."
"iyergokul_9","5","7","19","23 July 2017"," Review from a Nolan fan. Dunkirk is an experimental waste.
","Dunkirk is a rather strange film. You may ask, is it a war film? Or is it a rescue tale based on a true story? Whatever the answer may be, Dunkirk fails to assert a response. The story falls flat and is covered by incomplete counter perspectives. There is no character development, the film lacks an overall essence of a war-torn environment. Now this may be a deliberate move, as the film progresses it sets a criterion to not represent an emotional war drama but to realize a genuine feel of a scenario of soldiers trapped, rescue undertakings and aerial assaults. Albeit the result is a hot mess with a non-linear but deranged narrative progression that takes the film nowhere.<br/><br/>There isn't a titular character in Dunkirk. The film revolves around a conceivably three different viewpoints; The Mole, The Seas and The Air as depicted as. The Mole, stocked with allied soldiers from England, France and Belgium. Or as the movie explains it to us as. There is less to no introduction to any of the characters. We get stuck with a certain teen who is an English soldier trying to flee the German invasions. That's literally it, there is no one else other than Fionn Whitehead that the movie even tries to explore into, and the one we get to watch isn't as impressive either. He has very little dialogue, a fairly major involvement into the situation yet cast aside when required to. Oh and did I mention the French and the Belgians were included too? Too bad because the French involvement is minute and the Belgian almost non-existent. The next we move into the seas, where a band of three men, one too old for war and two youngsters head on a voyage to the place the target of the German forces, Dunkirk. ""You're weekend sailors not the bloody navy."" is as accurate a quote that the movie has managed to come to its assigned category. If I were to sympathize with a character it has to be Cillian Murphy who was harshly bereaved of his talents as a leading soldier to some jet fighter pilot who was cheaply stripped of his duties to mix in with the so indeed weekend sailors. And if he was to be the second-in to another main actor assigned to the aerial duties, which also brings us to The Air, Tom Hardy; then its another major setback as the bloody main guy assigned to save the grace of the soldiers, has less than ten minutes in his entire screen time.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer is the legendary figure once again working with Christopher Nolan behind Dunkirk, assigned to create the music, and he does again so masterfully. Zimmer's cold and monotonous ""ticking"" soundtrack is constant for the entire 1 hour 46 minutes the movie runs for. His score is nothing less than perfection, with suitable chords that sync with the scenes of unrest and horror portrayed throughout the film. With all that's told, the one fact I want to be bring up is that the background music is remembered or brought up because of two factors; Either the story line and plot adjust so well the score that it creates an unforgettable piece of art (something that the duo of Nolan and Zimmer have done so often in the past.) and gives us something to remember for a lifetime. On the other hand its the only piece of saving grace in the entire film. Dunkirk resorts to the latter, but I will also add that it conjures up very little that it results to the outstanding piece of music is the only thing that is noted for in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Picture this. A war drama based on historical events of monumental status with the brains of a certain Christopher Nolan behind it. A sane man would have all rights to believe Dunkirk to be a tour de force of nature, but instead we get an experimental wastage that lingers around only with the use of an incessant soundtrack and some beautifully captured cinematography. Dunkirk is alas a non-visceral realization but an exempt from a supposed War Drama."

Also in (contrarian) hindsight, I would say wait and watch this on your small screen. Of course, with headphones that is.<br/><br/>So many scenes herein stressed a sense of claustrophobia. Shot in dogfight cockpit battles, or caught up in the hell of water-bound hulls....even aboard the mighty Minnow, er I mean, Moonstone...that's tight quarters.

For folks like that of any age, well you've already seen this film. For others, perhaps wait on renting after this film gets its Oscar nomination but before it fails to win Best Picture?? Also a fun fact, apparently the Germans were the enemy.

","In my opinion Christopher Nolan did it again with Dunkirk, this movie was realistic as hell. This movie is about the evacuation of 400.000 men during world war II and when I am saying that this movie it's about this event, it's about that, because this movie doesn't have specific characters to relate to or care about. All the characters in this movie are just soldiers trying to survive to this situation.<br/><br/>Like I said in previous reviews, I'm a big fan of war films. And most of them are really good because they tell the story about soldiers trying to survive to horrible situations. Dunkirk is about this event in history, and just that.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a film with realistic characters and people with families going into the war zone well Dunkirk will like you disappoint you because you are not going to get that.<br/><br/>Well, let's move out to the filmmaking. This movie is recorded so well that when you are watching the movie makes you have this sense of discovery to how they make this. Nolan directed and wrote this movie, and you can see it. The direction and how the script works out it's beautiful, this is easily one of the best scripts of the entire year, and this movie doesn't have too much dialogue, which makes it even more powerful when we look back to the story. The way Nolan directed this film makes you be terrified by how the Germans are trying to kill this people. This movie it's not so violent, there is a lot of scenes were some people die, but you just listen the screams and the bombs exploiting around this people.<br/><br/>This movie has a presence of fear and suspense during the entire run time, and this feel it's created thanks to the great sound editing and the incredible score composed by Hans Zimmer, this is the greatest score that I have listened in any war film ever.<br/><br/>So guys, Dunkirk was even better that I expected. Nolan has made my favorite film of 2017 this far."
"igmusapa","8","4","9","28 July 2017"," Amazing film - almost
","As a cinematic experience, especially when viewed at an IMAX, Dunkirk is an astonishing achievement. Story, acting, tension, atmosphere, soundtrack, cinematography, it's all brilliant and I thoroughly recommend it.<br/><br/>However, two caveats: there were 350,000 British and French soldiers in and around Dunkirk in May/June 1940, there were masses of abandoned vehicles and equipment, dozens of wrecked ships, destroyed buildings, continuous raids by the Luftwaffe. After watching this film you will wonder where they were all hiding. Christopher Nolan seems to have concentrated on the individual more than the masses; no bad thing except visually. Dunkirk looks empty.<br/><br/>Also, as is being pointed out in the Goofs section, there are innumerable factual errors where modern buildings and trains, road signs etc. are visible or used. Nolan's wish to film in the real location rather than in front of a green screen is laudable, but there has been no attempt, either physically or digitally, to make the surroundings look like they did in 1940. For once there is a case for the use of MORE CGI in a film.<br/><br/>These anachronisms do detract from the overall brilliance of the film, and by quite a lot. Rather like a Shakespeare play performed in modern dress, the sense of time and place is missing. This is the Dunkirk evacuation set in 2017, not in 1940. A shame, but it's still worth seeing."
"ironhorse_iv","8","4","9","26 July 2017"," No need to evacuate the theater, when watching this film. For the most part, Dunkirk was somewhat interesting and honest depiction of war. It was watchable
","Set during the Second World War, the film directed by Christopher Nolan portrays the Dunkirk evacuation, through three perspectives—the land, sea, and air. Each one of them, contain little dialogue, in order to create suspense solely through visuals by cinematographer, Hoyte Van Hoytema. For the most part, the film somewhat does a good job. However, maybe, the film could had spill a little more exposition, on the land part, as I really did get, who these fictional characters, were and why they were there. I felt that, the main three characters, Alex (Harry Styles) & Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) & Gibson (Aneurin Barnard) at the beach, were, a bit, disappointing. Yes, I know, that Nolan didn't want tell the backstory of these characters, only to focus on them, surviving, but it's hard to invest, the time, rooting for these guys to survive, if we know, barely anything, about them. Because of that, those sequences were really hard to watch, as the only thing, we see, as an audience member; is them, cowardly finding ways to escape by hiding, or lying to their superior. That's hardly heroic. Thank Goodness, for the sea and air sequences, because the land parts, was a bit, too cynical for my taste. At least, we got to know, a little more good things about those fictional characters on the boat, than the three nearly unlikeable soldiers, at the beaches. Plus, it was lot more suspenseful, rather than the repetitive cycle of the soldiers entering a ship, only for minutes, later, it to sink. The tension between the shell-shocked unnamed trooper, played by Cillian Murphy and Peter (Tom Glynn Carney) the son of the captain of the civil boat, Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), whom sailing to rescue British soldiers from the surrounded city of Dunkirk on the boat was a lot better. It made for an interesting watch, with both actors, giving it, all. Don't get me wrong, the actors playing soldiers in the beaches, weren't bad; it's just that the boat characters at least, had more to work with. Also, despite, getting little information on who the two RAF pilots, Farrier (Tom Hardy) & Collins (Jack Lowden) were in the air sequence; I still found myself, rooting for them, even if the acting is limited, because of the intense dogfights. At least, they were fighting, instead of cowardly around. Those aerial shots, really did make it seem like two planes were really going at it. I just wish, the movie would use more visuals sights and sounds. I was really disappointing by the lack of large epic music by composer, Hans Zimmer in this film. Yes, I know, Nolan was really, trying to fight against, the system, not using cheap tactics like having emotional driven music and flashy or gory effects to get the audience to feel more, but I found, most of the film to be, somewhat dry and emotionless. Maybe, it's just me, use to the Hollywood formula, but I kinda like to be, move; not bored. Parts of the film was somewhat boring. It's just doesn't seem emotional. Don't get me wrong, the action scenes were filmed, wonderfully on locations with the German Army & Air Forces, being mostly seen as an invisible tour de force of nature, and I love that Nolan and his crew didn't use, much or any CGI, in favor, for more practical, traditional special effects. I also, dig, how, Nolan use, three different styles of camera shots for each sequence, with crane & steady cam for the land, hand-held for the sea, and a mixed of both, for the air. However, there were a few others things, I didn't like, about this film. One is the non-linear narrative. It was somewhat jarring. Yes, I know that Nolan use this same tactic in better films like 2000's 'Memento' & 2010's 'Inception'. However, the gimmick with 'time', but really, come off, confusing, here, when watching it. A good example is, how it became night for the land sequence, and yet, in the sea parts, it was still day in some scenes. It wasn't until later, after, I got out of the theater, I figure out, that the film was covering different periods of time: one beginning on land and covering one week, one on the sea and covering one day, and one in the air covering one hour. Maybe, editor, Lee Smith, could had interwoven it, a lot better, or better yet, give texts on what the time and date, is. It was really hard to follow. The other thing, I dislike about this film is, the fact, that, all of the characters were made up. There was hardly any characters based on, actual real people that went through those events. 1958's 'Dunkirk' film, has more real-life characters, than this movie, does, and that's highly dramatization. I just wish, Nolan, when writing this, use more of historian Joshua Levine's 2011 book, 'Forgotten Voices of Dunkirk', which is a collection of firsthand accounts that are both humorous and tragic, a lot better. Overall: Christopher Nolan's first history movie is bold, visceral, and powerful, with many moving sequences -- though some of his filmmaking choices was a little too challenging to follow. While, most of these tactics didn't work for this film. I still, 'Dunkirk' was a good movie that still highly recommended. Just not the experience, I was hoping for."
"alindsay-al","6","4","9","24 July 2017"," An above average suspenseful war film
","With any Christopher Nolan film I had huge anticipation for Dunkirk and I have now seen it and I thought it was alright but definitely a disappointment. The premise of the film sees 400,000 men stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk, they look for escape by land, air and sea. The lead performer in this film is a new actor called fionn Whitehead and I found his performance to be really bland. He is a character with very few lines and he just comes across as a very boring person with nothing special to make you care about him anymore then anybody else in this film. The supporting cast is full of great actors, mark rylance plays a civilian who has a boat to go rescue survivors and he gives the best performance in this film. His character has depth to him as he goes beyond what Is necessary to try and save people even though it isn't his job and he sells this role with a great performance. Cillian Murphy is really good in this film, his altercations with rylance is the best character development in the film. Tom hardy plays a pilot in this film and even though he is mostly just in the cockpit he gives an intense performance that is good for what is required. Kenneth branagh is in this film as a captain of the military and he gives a good emotional performance in the role. The story in the film is pretty simple and it does work well seeing these different people trying to survive this dangerous situation. However, this film lacks any real humanity to the majority of the characters, I don't remember anybody's name in this film or if there is anything unique to them that I should have care about. The script has very little amounts of dialogue in it but it has some pretty decent dramatic dialogue especially between rylance and Murphy. But there isn't really enough dialogue to give it more compliments and no humour at all which isn't big negative for this film but was noticeable. The style of the film is absolutely breathtaking, the visuals are incredible especially when it comes to the fighter pilots where the action is breathtaking and visually stunning. Overall there are certain aspects of this film that are really good but I don't think it really is a must see film."
"narendrarastogi","7","4","9","24 July 2017"," A technical masterpiece, Empty at emotional core
","Dunkirk and Saving private Ryan both movies are based in WWll but there is a huge difference. On one hand Saving private Ryan relies on human emotions and depth, Dunkirk relies on visuals and effects. Which is definitely a bad thing for a war drama where film lacks the emotional depth which should be generated after watching a war movie ( like in Schindler's list, SPR). <br/><br/>Dunkirk, almost as War for the Planet of the Apes, plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the background score and effects in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted. The sound of planes passing above, the gunfire, and the explosions all contribute to a compelling thriller like situation, almost similar to Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>The cinematography is great. The effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting, authenticity, WWII vehicles are on spot. The best part about movie was the minimal use of CGI, which are the dominating part of action in the movies these days.<br/><br/>While the characters in this film aren't that interesting, Harry Styles, is excellent at his debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given.  The only character in the movie which I cared for was Mark Rylance's. <br/><br/>The concept of three parts coming together, the beach, the sea, and the air is an interesting idea.<br/><br/>I should love this film. Historical drama? Compelling story? WWII setting? One of my favorite director ? Amazing cinematography? Mind blowing sound? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection. <br/><br/>If I reviewed this based on technical achievement.. it's a 5 star rated movie. But it lacks the emotional depth and it had nothing extra ordinary to take home. I simply can not put this in the list with Saving private Ryan and Schindler's list.<br/><br/>At the risk of sounding like a person.. trying to take a different stand, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star movie? Definitely and Unfortunately, no."
"TheBigTuna21","7","4","9","24 July 2017"," A film that leaves you wanting more, but not in the good way
","Christopher Nolan's' Dunkirk was a not-your-typical war epic with masterful cinematography,technical display, and score that, to all its best efforts, fell flat. The film was based on true events of the evacuation of 300,000 British soldiers from Dunkirk beach during the height of World War II. The film sets itself apart from other war films, deciding to focus on group survival instead of specific characters, bouncing from different perspectives between ground, sea, and air. Each of these mini plots take place along different time lines, giving away new pieces of information as the story unfolds, and eventually meeting up at the end for the climax of the film. Even with all these elements, it still felt as if things were missing from the story. The absence of a main protagonist made it difficult to connect on an emotional level with the characters. There were great, subtle performances by the characters that were given screen time in excess than 5 minutes, but not enough to truly resonate with the audience. The score, as wonderful as it was, played out with the intense build up of a ticking clock that always seemed to be leading to some grandiose action sequence that never came. It's an unfortunate misstep that leaves you with a feeling of wanting more, not in the sense that you wish it didn't end, but that you were robbed of the few pieces of a puzzle that would have led to an exceptional film."
"mikeinator24","7","4","9","23 July 2017"," The film that almost saved 2017 Cinema
","Listen, Christopher Nolan is a very talented director; most of his movies are good, some are rather great, but only one film he's made has really felt that it had a bow wrapped around it, and that was ""The Dark Knight"". Dunkirk fell the shortest of this achievement, while still being immaculately beautiful and a tremendous technical accomplishment.<br/><br/>This is the biggest film shot on IMAX and 70mm, both, to ever be released. Dunkirk told a painstakingly true story of World War II, in a new way, with very little dialogue (and when there was any it was very plot heavy), little personality in characters, and contained feeble amount of emotional moments.<br/><br/>Dunkirk just wasn't what I want out of any film. I appreciate going against conventions, many of my favorite directors and film are know to do that. But still, I seek a more emotional connection than this repetitive, near documentary style war film. It was kinda boring. Character, ethos, and anticipation are what mostly keeps me interested in a film. And for those things to be established, characters usually need to speak about something other than the plot.<br/><br/>The cinematography while containing some stunning, and beautiful shots, was in all not overly brilliant. I was a big fan of the close ups, the ultra wides that just look beautiful on large format film!, and a few others scattered throughout. I've seen better dog fights. I served it's purpose. The color grading was amazing however! And the sound was stellar, honestly some of the best gunshot and bomb sounds effects I have ever heard. For all of these things is why this film gets a 7 instead of a 6.<br/><br/>But where it counts, in the story, this film just does not fulfill my desires, nor my expectations for Nolan. Like Interstellar, there is still an empty hole in this film, something isn't quite tightly wound. It was a great undertaking of a film, and a new technical frontier for what is possible with large format, still when you compare this to another true story like Titanic, I can surely imagine that there could have been a more emotionally involved way of telling Dunkirk. When side by side, this is one of my least favorite Nolan films, ie. the Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, The Prestige, Batman Begins, Momento, heck I'm still debating it over Dark Knight Rises."

"mollystroll","3","3","6","7 May 2018"," A horrible mess of a movie - but beautifully shot
","I gave this movie 2 stars for the photography - it is a beautifully shot film.<br/><br/>I gave it one additional star for the first few minutes of what could and should have been an epic movie about an epic historical event that took place during some desperate, difficult and heroic days in World War 2.<br/><br/>The entire British Expeditionary Force and French -- some 400,000 men - were surrounded by about 800,000 soldiers of the German Wehrmacht and pinned against the sea at Dunkerque. The trapped Allied forces were hammered on a constant daily basis by air and by heavy artillery. The fighting on the front lines was often desperate and bloody. It is estimated that some 60,000 Brit and French troops were killed or wounded during the nine days of fighting around Dunquerque, as well as over 1,000 civilians. <br/><br/>The small boat navy that came into action from 27 May-4 June to evacuate the trapped armies was able to rescue 338,226 men, including 139,997 French, Polish, and Belgian troops. Left behind were 35,000 to 40,.000 mostly French troops who held the perimeter until the last moment and then surrendered.<br/><br/>It was a miraculous escape - beyond even the most optimistic of hopes. Churchill, for example hoped to get 30,000 back to Britain. The small-boat navy did ten times that number.<br/><br/>None of that is shown or even hinted at by this movie.<br/><br/>Instead we endlessly see a few hundred perfectly queued lines of Brits calmly standing in line in plain view on open beaches waiting to board ships that haven't arrived. Really. Never mind that in actuality those orderly lines would have been murdered by air attack and artillery bombardment.<br/><br/>There is no hint of the desperate fighting that took place on the perimeter. There is no sense of how dangerous it was for the small-boats when they approached the beach to take on soldiers. Of the approximately 865 vessels that participated in the evacuation, 243 were sunk - most by artillery fire or air attack. That's almost one third. <br/><br/>The drama, the danger, the desperation, the fury and horror of war, and also the heroics - all of these elements are missing from this beautifully photographed film.<br/><br/>If one wishes to see a more accurate depiction of what The Battle of Dunkerque was probably like, see the combat segments around the town of Arnhem in the film ""A Bridge Too Far"" or the beach landing scene of ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>THAT's what Dunkerque would have been like - just standing up out of cover beach would have been certain suicide.<br/><br/>Instead ""Dunkirk"" offers a non-violent experience, perhaps ""a meditation"" on war without actually portraying warfare. One of the most intense battles of World War Two reduced to a few gunshots, a couple of explosions, and an aerial dogfight shown 3 (or was it 4?) times from different viewpoints that made no sense. I guess the beautiful photography from the different perspectives was impossible to give up. <br/><br/>Even Kenneth Brannaugh is wasted - spending his time on screen on a pier urging soldiers onto the maybe 20 boats portrayed in the movie. You would think an Admiral might have other issues to deal with?<br/><br/>It is difficult to understand what the intent here was. They didn't make a war movie; nor did they make an attempt to tell the story of Dunkerque.<br/><br/>It's a mess - but it is a beautifully photographed mess."

"gary-444","7","3","6","8 September 2017"," Great spectacle- underwritten story
","I am an enthusiastic amateur historian with a particular interest in World War Two. When I heard this film was being made I was both excited, and apprehensive. I was thrilled that one of the great military evacuations of history was coming to the screen, but worried about how the sheer scope of covering an exodus of around a third of a million troops, with the successful ending known, would be tackled.<br/><br/>Early reviews praised the spectacle, but criticised the narrative.<br/><br/>It is a very good looking film with plenty of panoramic sweeps giving it an epic feel. Director Christopher Nolan has produced a film with an authentic, defiant, heroic , tinge. Understandably, Nolan eschews trying to tell the whole story. There is no Goering, Rundstedt, Hitler, Churchill or Gort. Instead the story is told in three micro stories on the sea, land and air. This has advantages, and disadvantages.<br/><br/>There is an intensity and visceral energy to the aerial dogfights, the plight of foot soldiers desperately trying to leave the beaches, only to find themselves torpedoed, and back on the beaches again, and hose manning the flotillas of small boats. However, those stories are vignettes, and not enough time is given to develop an emotional connection with the protagonists. The absence of input from the respective national and military leaders also fails to join the dots of individual heroism and tragedy.<br/><br/>Thus the early praise and criticism is both justified. This is a fine looking film, spectacular, and compelling in its presentation. But the narrative, and characterisation, is weak, making it fall short as one of the great war films."
"kluseba","6","3","6","23 August 2017"," Interesting approach but hard to sit through
","Dunkirk was a disappointment and is easily Christopher Nolan's weakest movie to date. There were many issues I had with that movie: confusing overlapping story lines, exchangeable characters without any depth, mostly faceless acting performances, a constantly numbing, overtly dramatic and repetitive soundtrack and lots of headache-inducing shaky camera passages, even in parts of the movie when nobody is getting attacked. Those who call this movie one of the greatest war movies of all times clearly haven't watched many films of that kind. Over the past twenty years, films such as Saving Private Ryan, The Pianist, Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War, My Way and Battle for Incheon: Operation Chromite all had intriguing characters, gripping tension, memorable scenes, moving soundtracks and spectacular special effects. Before you voice your opinion about Dunkirk or any of its reviews, you should be familiar with movies like these.<br/><br/>However, there were still a few elements that I liked about Dunkirk that made the movie entertaining and overall slightly above average. First of all, the storytelling is an interesting experiment, as it follows the Dunkirk evacuation from three perspectives: land, sea and air. The land perspective is the most gripping one and follows the epic odyssey of a young British Private. The sea perspective has its strengths when a tragic accident happens on the boat of a courageous civilian who wants to support the Royal Navy but the characters could have been a little bit more fleshed out. The air perspective is the weakest one in my book despite an epic finale because the fight sequences always exactly look the same and it's at times hard to follow what happened to whose plane. A strong element of the movie is its historic accuracy despite a few fictionalized characters here and there. The settings look authentic and especially the uniforms and planes look realistic. It must also be added that stories about the war shall not be forgotten as history tends to repeat itself and as it's important to honour those who fought for the freedom of the future generations.<br/><br/>In the end, Dunkirk has its merits and doesn't go the easy way with heroic characters, stunning special effects and traditional plots. However, the numerous overlapping plots are at times confusing, the characters are mostly redundant and the omnipresent score doesn't add to the movie as it was intended by the makers. If you are interested in the Second World War and have watched numerous war movies already, you might be interested in giving Dunkirk a shot as well. However, if you are less familiar with war movies, you might easily get bored with this film and should watch the movies I have mentioned in my introduction first."

","IT CONTAINS SPOILERS <br/><br/>Dunkirk : between fear, stress and will to survive <br/><br/>The battle of Dunkirk took place during World war II in 1940, when Great Britain tried to evacuate the British troops of the French beaches on Churchill's order. The movie is not really about the war itself but about the soldiers trying to survive the bombings and trying to come back to their country, it is also about the civilians and their patriotism. The tension is very well showed and felt through terrible yet beautiful images and powerful soundtrack amplifying the emotion and letting us worrying for the different characters. Christopher Nolan chose to use different time sets, different stories angles but managed to join them in the end. However, even though it is based on a real story, the storytelling is based on an English point of view, forgetting the Allies (mostly French but also Belgian) that stayed in Dunkirk to support the British troops evacuation. It is not a biopic, nor a historic documentary; it is just about war on the background of the Dynamo Operation. Still, the movie is very surprising because it's very different from any war movie. The movie starts with a very calm and heavy sound where you can feel the emptiness of the streets of Dunkirk broken by the sound of bullet noises and witness the first reflex of the soldiers: flee. That is what it is all about, running away. We understand that we'll follow these soldiers through their escape; it's a survival movie on a background of war. Flee and survive describe best this movie. The movie is very intense and well conducted as we are waiting for a miracle to save the soldiers, we can feel the different feelings they go through, team spirit, fear, egoism, hope, will to survive, but also will to protect the country and defend it. We can see that there are a lot of soldiers on the beach yet; we follow the escape of only three of them. We become attached to them, waiting for the miracle that is going to get them out of this perilous situation. Very few dialogues, lots of silences, and heavy sounds that explain some of the traumas caused by the war (surety, paranoia). Something that is also very different from any war movie is the absences of gore images, what is hard to watch is the time that is going very slowly. It feels like the nightmare is never ending, and shows exactly the horror of the war. To conclude, this movie shows the different states that a soldier/human goes through when his life is in danger: team spirit, fear, egoism, patriotism, hope, despair everything in a very well managed story that is actually three different one ending up in a big one."

","Wow, all the hype about this movie. And as history buff (mostly WW1) I couldn't wait for Dunkirk. However, I kept waiting for the epic bit that makes the film memorable or classic. It never came. Not only was Dunkirk not an epic, it wasn't entirely historical either.<br/><br/>Missing were the French army defending the city which enabled the other some 330,000 to evacuate. Missing were epic radio speeches from Churchill. This, in my opinion, would have sent chills down the spines of audiences. Churchill was a masterful speaker with a command of the English language never before or since seen. And missing were the fleets of boats - yes there were maybe 50-75 boats of all sorts, but if you're going to use an airplane CGI scene, it's not a stretch to use CGI to show the armada of boats going back and forth, the ports of England to the beaches of Dunkirk. <br/><br/>Other goofs I noticed were a scene where it seemed obvious that this was the filmmakers water line of demarcation. In other words, you can see lots of boats to the right of the camera but zero boats to the camera's left. Very obvious though I'm not looking for miscues, I just want to be entertained in the way the Longest Day entertained. When the tiny ships did arrive there should have been hundreds of soldiers wading into the waters towards the little boats...nothing in the film but a single soldier going where - to swim to England?<br/><br/>Also missing and very noticeable were soldiers firing their rifles at the Luftwaffe. All those armed soldiers on the beach and nobody firing a single shot at attacking Luftwaffe dive bombers (in the film)? Doesn't seem believable that an armed soldier would just stand and watch an enemy fighter come down on him and his comrades.<br/><br/>Dunkirk was a lot more than queues waiting to be rescued. The French army (mostly French and some British) fought ferociously to keep the Germans away from the beaches. The city was mostly reduced to ruins. <br/><br/>In the end, some 330,000 soldiers were evacuated, of which roughly 35- 40% were French. Most of the French went back to fight the Battle of France while some 3000 stayed in England to become the Free French Forces. That was lost on the filmmakers. <br/><br/>This was the opportunity to make the next Longest Day film. It missed badly though it is still an okay film - very watchable. But never in the course of human events on film has so much been lost by so few - in Hollywood."
"achyutaghosh","8","3","6","29 July 2017"," Dunkirk movie review- Stylish (no pun intended)
","To this day, people do not know why Adolf Hitler allowed the Dunkirk evacuation to happen. He has the entire British army pinned on a beach. He had them surrounded, and the Luftwaffe had air superiority in the sky. The U-boats made life hell in the seas, and the British were considering a conditional surrender at that point. But he stopped his advance, he let the British army escape, and the rest we know is history.<br/><br/>""We shall go on to the end. We shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender."" - Winston Churchill, after the Dunkirk evacuation<br/><br/>History notwithstanding, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is not a war movie in the traditional sense. There are no sweeping armies, grand strategy at play, rousing speeches, intense drama or fierce combat. Instead, it establishes 3 interlinked perspectives, one each an exposition of the 3 essential asks of a soldier at war- resolve, courage and the will to survive.<br/><br/>Mark Rylance leads the first theme, where he demonstrates impeccable resolve against the odds to do his bit in the civilian action in the evacuation. Tom Hardy is the courageous Spitfire pilot who selflessly tries to offer protection from the skies, even at the cost of his own freedom. Harry Styles leads a group of soldiers who are, well, just trying to survive. All the three threads play across different periods, in different theaters (land, sea, air) but all converge to one fateful moment.<br/><br/>A good war movie is one that makes you hate war itself. Unlike traditional war epics which tries to do that by establishing good and evil sides, Dunkirk tries to achieve that by focusing on realism- the harrowing experience of the combatants. Dunkirk eschews dialogue in favor of visuals- George c scott's opening salvo in Patton might be longer than the entire script of Dunkirk. But Nolan's signature take is all encompassing here- an ominous score by Hans Zimmer engulfs the senses, wide 360-degree shots highlight expanse and impact, IMAX shooting tech makes you feel as if you are a part of the movie, and a mix of stalwarts and fresh faced actors bring in both innocence and class. In a way Dunkirk plays like an atmospheric horror movie. At the same time, the central theme that Nolan has explored in his Batman trilogy is touched upon here too- how do humans react in times of chaos.<br/><br/>Is Dunkirk the best film of the year so far? Maybe for die-hard Nolan fans who like his ""different"" take on the war movie genre. But somehow it did not click for me the way I thought it would. Maybe because the movie ended just when it was getting engrossing. Maybe it was a bit too economical- run time, script, settings. Maybe because in India we just cannot experience IMAX tech in all its glory. Maybe because I prefer traditional war epics with dialogues and punch lines.<br/><br/>Maybe because 19 years on, I am still not over Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Let that assessment take anything away from the immersive cinematic experience that Dunkirk is. Just don't look at it as a war movie."

","This movie is an audiovisual masterpiece, and I am not one to throw the term ""masterpiece"" around loosely. The cinematography is flat out excellent, as is to be expected from Christopher Nolan. His skills are unmatched when it comes to playing with one's perspective. There's one angle in the film where you see a soldier climbing up the bow of a ship, and the camera sticks with the ship in such a way that it isn't until the last moment that you realize that the ship is in fact capsizing at the very same moment this man was hoping this ship would be his salvation. A single camera trick did so much more to convey the terror and hopelessness of war than a million war movies. It's this kind of camera-work that I simply do not see any other director performing and certainly not to this degree.<br/><br/>The audio is equally stellar. Most sounds that you take for granted in a war film: bullets firing, bombs exploding, planes flying and the like stand out in spades here. They all have such a weight to them that each individual example of them stands out in a way that is normally impossible, given the desensitivity to war that we have after scores of Michael Bay atrocities. The sheer brilliance of the cinematography and sound design drastically limits how low my rating can realistically be.<br/><br/>But despite those positive points, my rating is indeed lower than most people's. There's a disconnect between this film and myself, and it is this: it can be the most visually pleasing film on the planet. It can have unrivaled sound design, breathtaking action and peerless cinematography. If the movie (especially one marketed as a war-time drama) fails to make me care about what's on the screen, then it's not a ten-star film. And this movie did very little to make me care.<br/><br/>The first time a plane flew over head with a deafening roar and dropped bombs on thousands of desperate and defenseless men who want nothing more than to just go home, it was powerful. The first time our battered and bruised heroes (or at least the closest thing this film has to heroes) think they are on the brink of finally getting a break, only for a surprise attack to dash their hopes, it was devastating. The problem is once you have adjusted to the brilliance of the direction, and slightly different versions of the same events occur (bombing attack, plane dogfighting, submarine attack, sinking ships, etc.) a second, third and fourth time, it begins to feel empty. <br/><br/>The problem is simple. The film focuses so much on telling so many different stories that it doesn't take enough time to give us a reason to care about any of these characters. What is their story, who are they, what is their defining attribute, beyond the fact that they're on the good side, why should we want them to survive, what is their freaking name? When someone in this film comes so close to escape, only to meet an unfortunate end, my thought eventually became: ""well that's a shame, but it'd probably impact me more if I knew anything about this dude. He could be a terrible person. Maybe he left his wife and kids. Maybe he runs a dogfighting ring. What if he doesn't even use his turn signal when he drives? Wait, did they even have turn signals back then? How much longer is this movie? 40 minutes? Crap.""<br/><br/>Defenders of this movie will say that it doesn't focus on individuals in order to focus on the real main character: the war. They'll say that the point of this movie is simply to tell the true story of this harrowing historical event, and that's a valid defense. But the problem is: do you know what you get when you just tell the story of a historical event verbatim, without taking the liberty to add the character and drama necessary to make it fun and relatable? You get a textbook. A documentary. And the problem is that it was marketed as a movie. If it was marketed as a documentary, it would be one of the greatest of all time. As a movie, it's one of the longest hour and 46 minutes I've spent in a theater. If it wasn't for the visual and audio fidelity, this film would be more at home at midnight on the History Channel than in a movie theater, and there's nothing wrong with that. I like history documentaries. I just wish I knew that's what I was spending $12 to see. <br/><br/>Traditions exist for a reason, and traditional filmmaking dictates that films have characters. Characters that grow. Characters you understand to some degree. Characters with motivations and backstories that make you want to go on a journey with them. Instead, this film is just a series of events. A series of unfortunate events to boot. And if that's what you want to see, I'd instead just recommend the Series of Unfortunate Events book and Netflix series. At least those have interesting characters (maximum sass).<br/><br/>Despite all my bellyaching, I do recommend you see this film, particularly in the theater. For one, outside a theater, it loses about the one thing it actually has going for it: the excellent audio experience. But also, because I am in a very strong minority so just from a statistical odds perspective, you'll probably like it. This review exists for two reasons: one, to get expectations in line. Do not expect a traditional movie here. This is a collection of oft- repetitive occurrences held together by excellent direction, nothing more or less. But it's extremely well made. And two, so some of the more pretentious defenders of the movie can see that someone can get the point of the film and still not particularly like it. Opinions, man."
"marshalllarsen","7","3","6","23 July 2017"," A visual masterpiece, but lacks humanity.
","Dunkirk was a great movie, and a great war movie, but I don't think it was one of The Great War Movies.  The cinematography and the action were incredible, but it didn't have the emotional heft of something like Saving Private Ryan, The Hurt Locker, or Apocalypse Now. <br/><br/>Dunkirk was fast paced and incredible tense, but the quick editing robbed the film of any moments to breathe and for characters to interact or form.  That isn't to say that the editing was bad.  On the contrary, it was a fresh take on a traditional WWII setting.  But I never knew any of the characters.  I didn't care what happened to them.  I felt like I was watching pieces in a bombastic game of chess instead of a real human struggle.  Besides mild stress and pure awe at some of the set-piece moments, I didn't feel much of anything. Overall, I'd say the movie is a masterpiece in the sense of what can be put on film, and I'd absolutely recommend that you see it in IMAX.  It's a visual treat!  But I do not think it has the staying power of other, more human war films."
"trinaboice","Null","3","6","22 July 2017"," Immersive experience
","Grade: A-<br/><br/>Rating: PG-13, 107 minutes<br/><br/>In a Nutshell: I write marketing reports for movie theaters and have felt terrible for Dunkirk the past few months, because their trailers almost always elicited ZERO response from the audiences. Well, audiences are speaking VERY loudly now. They LOVE Christopher Nolan's newest film, Dunkirk, based on the true WWII story.<br/><br/>If you can see it in 70mm on an IMAX, do it. Christopher Nolan went to great lengths to make sure that his movie was as accurate as possible. The details are impressive. With thousands of Extras on the beach, this film is epic.<br/><br/>The director's goal was to create an immersive experience. That it is.<br/><br/>Uplifting theme: ""Hope is a weapon. Survival is victory."" Human resolve<br/><br/>Things I liked: With real planes, real locations, and hundreds of Extras. Everything looked and FELT real. Technically, it is awe-inspiring. Do I smell an Oscar? The sound track is explosive and riveting, filled with intensity almost the entire time. I really liked the trailer tag line: ""When 400 soldiers couldn't get home, home came for them."" Teenage girls and fans of One Direction will be thrilled to watch Harry Styles as Alex. I love Oscar winner Mark Rylance in everything he does. I especially loved him in Bridge of Spies DVD and thought he was adorable in The BFG (Theatrical Version). SPOILER: I LOVED what Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) did for Cillian Murphy's character at the end. I would hope that my 4 sons would have that kind of character and compassion. That small moment was extremely touching for me. I know a water scene is good when it makes me hold my breath. Rather than focus on big battle movements, the film takes it to a personal level and shows you how war affects the individual.<br/><br/>Things I didn't like: You don't really get to know any of the characters and develop a strong connection. The film's action reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, yet that film carried so much more weight and emotional pull on my heart because of the character development. It's my all-time favorite war movie. You're not given any backstories in this film, however, and there are no quiet scenes where characters talk about their lives. Because of everyone's thick accents, you can't understand everything that's said. I probably missed a good 20% of the dialogue. I thought it was interesting that Tom Hardy would want a role like this. He played Farrier, a pilot whose face was completely covered almost the entire time. My 17 year old son, surprisingly, said he thought the movie was a little slow. The film runs almost in real time. SPOILER: We see only a few small boats coming to the rescue, but in reality, the number was closer to 700. I wish I could have seen a map to better understand where everything was located. Here's one:<br/><br/>Interesting lines: ""He's shell-shocked George. He's not himself. He may never be himself again."" – Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) ""Well done."" – old, blind British man ""All we did was survive."" – Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) ""That's enough."" – old guy ""There's no hiding from this, son."" – Mr. Dawson ""What do you see?"" – Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy) ""Hope."" - Commander Bolton (Oscar nominated Kenneth Branagh)<br/><br/>Tips for parents: This war movie is intense with MANY moments of life or death. Despite the high body count, it isn't super bloody and gory like Saving Private Ryan. There was a surprising lack of profanity. I thought I heard an F-bomb, but because the accents were so thick, I can't honestly say that's what the word was. Want to learn more about this part of history in World War II?

","Dunkirk is just over 150 kilometers from where I live. After watching the movie I would surely one day go visit the place, after all it is where the history was re-written by the brave attempts of hundreds of small boat owners to save 300,000 men trapped by enemies. Coming back to the movie, it is a visual and audio feast limited by character development and compelling script. Though far from qualities of the longest day or saving private Ryan, this is still a very watchable movie to be must seen at theaters at big screens. I wish Christopher Nolan has put some more focus on the character development and elaborate story telling, after all he had some of the best contemporary actors and second WW as background."
"anubindtiwari-310-820214","7","3","6","21 July 2017"," A visual feast and amazing film.
","This is a Nolan film and like every other Nolan film it is different and unique in its own way for other Nolan films and all the other films as a matter of fact. First of all let me make this clear – This is a survival story and not a War film. Story is rather simple but the story-telling is extraordinary. Movie starts with a solider running away from the enemy towards last defense line of British & French army on the beach of Dunkirk and the story basically revolves around him. The film also tells the story of the efforts of the British Navy & the RAF is the evacuation Operation Dynamo over the period of one week. The film has three time-line and it is parallel in nature, covering contribution of all the all three Army-Land, Navy-Water & RAF- Air. As I said earlier the story is simple but the way it is resented is amazing, the non-linear structure is the USP of the film and it is the only thing that binds the audience. Although people knew how the movie was going to end, the faith of the characters is something that we want to see. The premise of the film was completed in first 20 minutes of the film and from there the movie really takes you on a thrill ride. There are characters are associated with each time-line and just like the premise setup the character development is also completed within 20 minutes, this is something that only an experienced director can do who knows the story he is telling. Each character have got very less on screen time, mainly because there are so many characters but each of them are defined perfectly and have their unique identity and have proved their valor in their own way the film which was very important when you are telling the story is brave soldiers fighting a lost battle. All the cast members have done a tremendous job, I knew about Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Kenneth Branagh but Harry Style & Fionn Whitehead amazed me. The visuals are literally feast for eyes and the wide angle shots of the sea and the dogfight are incredible. There are only a few directors who can pull-of such a scene. Apart from the aerial shots there are also some scenes like the drowning of the anti-mining vessel and the scenes where the solders are drowning in the merchant ship. BGM is one Hans Zimmer's best; the scores were perfectly in sync with what was going on in the screen. The high and low notes with the rise of the thrill were perfect, music could not have been any better. The script was excellent, there are very few dialogues but that was not required as the BSM and the stunning visuals were enough to fill in the silence. All in all the movie was great not the best Nolan film but still a great film watch it for the visual and the BGM and also if you are history buff or you like War films. Do not watch if you are expecting long action sequences or something grand like Inception or Interstellar.<br/><br/>IMDb Rating: 9/10, My Rating: 7.5/10"
"joelfooramos","10","6","16","2 August 2017"," Dunkirk (one of Nolan's best)
","Dunkirk directed by Christopher Nolan starring Tom Hardy, amongst other stars tell the real event during World War II and how 400,000 soldiers were able to escape. After watching this movie I can easily say this is one of the best of the year, hands down. From the opening sequence to the final sequence, the movie doesn't stop at giving you a single breath of air. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic and beautiful. Every shot in this movie feels completely on-point, not a single take was misplaced. In my opinion, this is Nolan's best directed film to date. To my understanding there was no use of CGI, every battle sequence was practical effect. The air sequence where Tom Hardy's character is in is absolutely breath-taking. The film doesn't have much dialogue, it rests on the amazing score by Hans Zimmer and boy, what a score he pulled off. This is a film that is about the event rather than the characters and that's where the movie for some might not work. In previous war films such as Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge, you get to know the characters or get behind them-rooting for them. In Dunkirk, you don't get that. You don't get that one scene where you get to dig in inside a character and root for them. As I said, this film is about the event of Dunkirk. So, if you go into this film expecting great characters you're gonna leave disappointed. But if you don't go with those expectations then Dunkirk is a perfect film. For my final grade, I'm gonna give Dunkirk 10/10"
"bjcarl14","9","6","16","2 August 2017"," Misunderstood Masterpiece
","Christopher Nolan has up to this point never made a bad movie. Some of them aren't great(Insomnia), but none of them are reprehensible atrocities. The people who hated or didn't like Dunkirk wanted to see something moving and character driven like Saving Private Ryan or any of the other great WW2 movies out there. Nolan chose to make the audience a character in this film rather than have the audience follow around a solitary character in which we place our empathy. To the haters of this film: I understand, but I certainly don't agree. In my opinion, this film should FINALLY get Nolan a well deserved Oscar nomination for Best Director, and depending on the competition that remains to be seen, he might very well deserve to win in that category."
"donuts_69","9","6","16","24 July 2017"," Steals pure cinema back from the grave dug by Marvel/DC
","World War II movies are a genre that until very recently, with 2016's Hacksaw Ridge, had found its way to the back shelves of big budget productions. Since the last re-imagining of the segment back in the late 90's (Thin Red Line/Private Ryan) the ultra-intense and graphically violent content has worn most epic war stories into tired reheats that have lacked the inspiration that rekindled audience interest with those earlier releases. There has been no shortage of stories to tell, but with the explosion of the super-hero movie and re-booting of classic franchises, many major studios have let the War movie fall by the wayside.<br/><br/>On its surface, the story of Dunkirk from an Allied perspective would seem to be a difficult sell to said production companies. More evacuation zone than battleground, neither bloody defeat nor heroic victory and a technical aspect that would guarantee a difficult shoot – it's no wonder someone like Chris Nolan had to be behind the camera to get this one off the ground.<br/><br/>The film itself drops the viewer straight into the thick of it. We have all seen our share of WW2 movies, we don't need to establish who the heroes and villains are – this is a simple survival story told in a way not seen before. This is not about finding one specific protagonist and their struggle to escape the beach at Dunkirk, this is an all-encompassing vision that rather focuses on the duty of those involved. Organising the Evacuation of Dunkirk required steadfast dedication from all involved in the face of impending doom. The outcome of the European campaign would be determined by this events success/failure.<br/><br/>There are 3 perspectives used for building the story – Land, Sea and Air. A typical but original Nolan twist involving time-lines across the 3 aspects allow for key scenes to be viewed from each perspective at slightly different times during the film. The movie shines through its pure film making rather than relying on a strong leading performance or stand out battle sequences. In saying that though, the performances on screen are exceptional just the same. Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh take nuance to lofty levels and provide moments that stay with you long after they play out on screen. The subtlety of stout British earnestness (read: Keep Calm & Carry On) is the hero here and represented to perfection, especially in Hardy's case given he wears his flight mask/goggles for the entire movie and barely has a dozen lines of dialogue. These are three men going to heroic lengths in order to do what they all knew needed to happen for the greater good. Where other movies show soldiers smothering grenades or running a gauntlet of gunfire to take ground, here again the viewer is treated with enough intelligence to know what each mans' actions mean in the bigger picture.<br/><br/>The scarcity of dialogue from the film is not restricted to Hardy and where some may find the lack of conversation in the movie a bit distracting or crippling towards development between characters that may take the story onto more familiar ground, this is where the film real strength comes through. By allowing various elements (Weather, Colour, Sound and actions of the characters) the spaces of silence allow the viewer to interpret the unfolding drama in their own way, thus creating a far more powerful build in tension and emotion. Of course the cinematic elements of the production are delivered to the highest possible standard, Zimmers score soars, Van Hoytema utilizes cutting edge IMAX technology to bring new levels of detail and scope to screen (I saw this in 4K IMAX Laser @ Melb) while Nolans' direction and writing is as clean and concise as ever.<br/><br/>With over 70% of the film shot in full IMAX scope, this is cinema at its finest. I was completely won over by the Aerial dogfights and amazing sound design of the classic Spitfire warplanes. The number of extras stacked up in columns on the beach or the practical set pieces where entire Destroyers are sunk. Take your pick of any of these or scores of other memorable moments from what will surely develop into a future classic for the WW2 film canon."

","I saw Dunkirk 4 days ago, but I really wanted to sit on the experience and not review it until I fully understood what Christopher Nolan was going for. This isn't your typical war movie, neither it terms of structure or execution. But it is how you'd expect Christopher Nolan to tackle a war epic; with a non-linear structure, tightly written and directed scenes, and one heck of a mind-blowing score from Hans Zimmer. It's far from the easiest film to dissect, but the experience is undeniably moving.<br/><br/>Being a massive Christopher Nolan fan, I came into Dunkirk with high expectations and a ton of curiosity of how Nolan would treat a true story. This is the first film of is that attempts to take real-life events and present his own depiction. Unsurprisingly, the thing I love most about Dunkirk is Nolan's direction. Quite often war films look at the big picture (rightfully so), covering events from each side and telling in-depth stories about politics and survival. There's nothing wrong with those approaches, but the fact that Nolan takes a massive-scale approach to Dunkirk visually, when in reality the film is just about soldiers trying to survive on one particular beach, makes it all the more impressive. When you get past the fact that there's little dialogue and character development, there's plenty to love about Dunkirk.<br/><br/>Nolan's films all have those defining visual moments, as he often loves to have his non-linear structure be used to its full effect and use the multiple story angles to create a few epic moments. Think Inception, when the ""dream is collapsing"" and there's 3 different layers of dreams all coalescing at the same time. Dunkirk uses that same approach for pretty much the entire movie, The Mole (beach), The Sea, and The Air. The editing can be frustrating the first time around, as it was for me, especially when you really just want to learn more about each of these characters if they expect us to care at all. Jumping viewpoints turns out to be exactly the way this film should be structured. In reality, none of these soldiers would have time to tell each other their respected backgrounds or life stories, they're just trying to survive. I thought Nolan handled this beautifully.<br/><br/>Complementing the rapid editing is yet another terrific Hans Zimmer score. Nolan said in an interview that he gave Zimmer a recording of a ticking clock to give him an idea as to how he wanted the tone of the score to feel. Well, Zimmer took that to heart as that ticking clock is literally heard throughout the film. I love all of the Zimmer-Nolan collaborations, and Dunkirk is no exception. In fact, Zimmer's score could almost be considered more of an impactful character than the real characters themselves. There aren't many composers that can match the intensity that Nolan wants behind and in front of the camera, but Zimmer definitely does.<br/><br/>From Tom Hardy's almost dialogue-less performance, to the breathtaking cinematography from Hoyte van Hoytema, and the incredible work done by Hans Zimmer, Dunkirk is a film which sees Christopher Nolan at the top of his craft. It's the shortest film of his since 'Following' but it may very well be his most emotionally effective film, and that's without developing any characters. Every year I'm hoping to see movies that change the way cinema is made and viewed, Nolan is one of the few directors that constantly break new ground in Hollywood. As much as Dunkirk isn't what I thought it would be, I can't ask for anything more than for him to reinvent the genre.<br/><br/>+Score<br/><br/>+Non-linear structure<br/><br/>+Mind-blowingly gorgeous visuals<br/><br/>+The best air-force sequences ever from a war film<br/><br/>10/10"
"brankovranjkovic","10","6","16","24 July 2017"," Dunkirk: Met a Genuine Dunkirk Veteran at my Screening!
","Before we talk about the film let me tell you about the cinema visit. At my screening were a group of elderly men from the Royal British Legion, who were setting up a table in the cinema foyer. Displayed were a framed set of medals, a small black n white photo of a young soldier and sat to one side a very old man in a smart grey suit... You're already ahead of me, the photo and the old man were the same person. <br/><br/>I must have seemed curious enough to prompt a 'carer' to speak to me ""Do you want to meet a genuine Dunkirk veteran?"" Though not sure what to say I agreed, assuming that a hand-shake would suffice. But NO! The old boy was still bright as a button, his hand-shake was frail, his hand thin, bony, and gnarly. The veteran was about to see the film but I was still able to ask a few questions. <br/><br/>""How old were you in the photo?"". The answer was 20. ""How old are you now?"" The answer was 99. ""Was the evacuation with small boats and dinghies exaggerated?"" The reply ""No, I was actually evacuated in a rowing boat"". The veteran received a very well deserved standing ovation when the film ended. >> I just wanted to share that with you. Now back to the film review! <br/><br/>This is an epic WW2 suspense thriller written and directed by Christopher Nolan. This is based on a pivotal wartime historical event, a survival story about the evacuation of 400,000 soldiers who were essentially 'sitting ducks' on the Dunkirk beaches.<br/><br/>This film is all about the experience from three different perspectives, not the characters or their egos. If you want to see a film concerning character development then re-watch your 'Saving Private Ryan' DVD. <br/><br/>What was particularly clever were the three interwoven plots very clearly depicting the situation through three parallel timelines. 1-The story in the Air (duration= 1 hour) Tom Hardy is featured as a Spitfire pilot. 2-The story in the Water (duration= 1 day) Mark Rylance is featured as a civilian boat captain. 3-The story on Land (duration= 1 week) Kenneth Branagh is a British Office co-ordinating the evacuation efforts and troops on the beach. <br/><br/>The vast crowds of soldiers could have been any young men. It could have been me and you, and makes you wonder what you would have done. How you may have felt and reacted? <br/><br/>Though there must have been some GCI, it was very difficult to identify! There was hardly any dialogue, but I'm convinced that this is how frightened individuals in hopeless situations would behave. This is a visually stunning, immersive, very large scale epic which left me emotionally exhausted. This film must be seen on the largest pin sharp screen available. I saw it on a standard screen at my local Cineworld and immediately re-booked to see again in 70mm IMAX. <br/><br/>Very highly recommended."

I also think this movie was barely PG13, ranging closer to PG, which a serious war movie should be rated R, in my opinion. I honestly don't know how this movie is getting 8's, 9's, and 10's---it just isn't that great. Without giving anything away, you basically only connect with one character, and you still learn nothing about him.<br/><br/>What this movie needed: <br/><br/>-Character development -Tighter plot -In sync, instead of out of sync storytelling -And women who helped in the war effort<br/><br/>If you see this movie, sit close to the screen (IMAX does make the flight scenes awesome), and bring food; no use you being hungry and bored."

","I am not who normally worships at the feet of Cristopher Nolan, and I had my doubts when I heard he was making a war epic about one the most critical moments of WW2. In reality Dunkirk was a humiliating defeat for the British armed forces and Nolan really only scratches the surface of what happened. For once we are spared the mass use of CGI instead we see the story through the eyes of three individuals involved in this epic battle. A soldier stuck on the beach,the captain of one of small boats and an RAF pilot. Nolan cleverly moves from each character to character until there paths cross in one way or another. The action is relentless from start to finish and the Spitfire Luftwaffe dog fights are simply breathtaking. Hans Zimmers superb score adds to what is a visual feast. By the end if your British there will be a lump in your throat maybe a tear in your eye. Was Dunkirk a humiliating defeat? Well the history books may have us believe that but By the end of this movie it felt like a glorious victory!"

"karanrajbaruah","10","7","20","25 July 2017"," A masterpiece of our generation.
","War is not something we should celebrate. It brings out the worst in humans. Dunkirk shows us a small part of war where humans were pushed to the absolute maximum and it was something which changed people for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>When watching a war movie, most of us have a ""expectation"" of how a movie should be. We expect lots of shooting, lots of man to man combat and lots of gore. But with Dunkirk this is different.<br/><br/>This movie is such a masterpiece in a way it tells the story of war very differently. It looks to tell the feelings of a person less by dialogues and more by pure emotion. The way the movie is set up, there is nothing but pure tension all throughout the 100 or so minutes of its play time.<br/><br/>Also, a special kudos for the brilliant score for this movie. I'd go as far as saying that 50% of the movie was really carried by the score. Some of the scores that start slow and rise slowly to its full tempo and volume really add to the whole mood of the film. This is arguably one of the best scores Hans Zimmer has done till date.<br/><br/>Not only the score, but the sound of Spitfires and explosions at various points of the film feel different than most movies of the past. The muffled sounds of explosion in different scenes really hit hard.<br/><br/>This movie is really best enjoyed on the big screen.

I'm still buzzing about this film in my head over an hour after the film.<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to watch this in a motion activated seat. The film matched with motion activated seats is absolutely superb. It's almost like these seats were made for this film. The amount of action goes well with these seats and if the opportunity arrives to see this film in these types of seats, do it!<br/><br/>I will be seeing this film again, for the second time, in motion activated seats. That's how much I loved this film. <br/><br/>A breathtaking war film and a masterpiece of cinematography. Please watch this film, you will not regret! The hype is real folks."
"HalJorda","10","7","20","19 July 2017"," Oscar Worthy Period.
","At this point, Nolan can make a Smurfs movie, and people are gonna still buy tickets and watch it. I'm not really into war movies, but I have seen war movies before like Saving Private Ryan and Hurt Locker. But no other movie in the world packs this much intensity. You know nothing about a character, you have no reason to like him, but you would still want him to survive. That's Nolan's magic. Previously Nolan set a benchmark for the Superhero movies, Mind benders, Sci-fi and now for War movies. Nolan and Zimmer worked in tandem to deliver a masterpiece that will set a standard for future war movies. This is probably the best cinematic experience I have ever experienced since Avatar. You will cry you will laugh, and you will awe every shot by Nolan. I hope Nolan and Zimmer will win Golden Globes and Oscar for this movie. I don't think anyone even deserves it more than these two do for this year."

","THIS is how you do practical filmmaking and still make it feel innovative in a digital age of media while making your film seem comparable to classics like Saving Private Ryan and FullMetal Jacket. Basically everything in Dunkirk is analogue, practical and it doesn't need to depend on overblown-CGI trickery whatsoever. Chris Nolan has given us a war movie that feels like it came from the mind of Stanley Kubrick; the scale, larger-than-life direction and impeccable cinematography all makes this film feel like it's the creative offspring of the great-late Kubrick himself.<br/><br/>Chris Nolan has made another masterpiece for the ages and easily one of the best films of the 21st Centry just like he seamlessly achieved with Memento, Insomnia, The Prestige, The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar and finally Dunkirk (as of this writing).<br/><br/>Dunkirk tackles one of the most overlooked events of the Second World War (at least in cinema) and even in the first fifteen minutes of the movie it's instantaneously better and FAR more respectable than films like Pear Harbour. With Dunkirk, Nolan NEVER disrespects the tensions of the war and the horror it brought about, and there isn't a moment where he tries glorifying the terror. This is a war film without physical grit but PLENTY of psychological dilemmas that actually perfectly fits this kind of war-movie. Sometimes it's the emotion that's more impacting than seeing the entrails of characters going all over the place like in Saving Private Ryan (that film is still fantastic); the paranoia amongst the British and French soldiers in this film is its own form of horror. You start to wonder how the hell did the Allied forced win against the Nazis in the end? Well we did; and the events of Dunkirk changed the modern world forever.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Chris Nolan's work, please see this movie, be it on IMAX-70mm, regular 70mm or 35mm or digital; just see it at the movies regardless of the format. It's an ABSOLUTE MUST-SEE!"

","It has finally happened. A WWII movie for kids with the attention span of a lightning bolt, who couldn't care less for historical accuracy nor want to get emotionally involved in anything. A series of dizzying and nauseating POV shots strung together coupled with loud, bombastic music. No plot, no characters, no arc, no sense of purpose whatsoever. Not much in the way of dialogue, and most of it mumbled and inaudible due to the loud music. War as a video game experience? Here it is.<br/><br/>Besides slightly nihilistic Nolan's take on the Dunkirk disaster stroke me as contradictory. 400,000 soldiers were stranded in Europe's longest sand beach, along with 500 tanks and thousands of vehicles and heavy weaponry. They were eventually evacuated by 933 ships, including 39 destroyers, suffering 68,000 casualties. The RAF flew almost 3,000 sorties and lost a whopping 106 planes. The Luftwaffe dropped 45,000 bombs on the city and harbour. I see two mutually exclusive ways of portraying this gargantuan military undertaking: full-on IMAX to capture the big picture or small-scale POV story to capture the human drama. For the former you would use long shots of panoramic vistas and intensive CGI to recreate the colossal numbers I just cited above. For the latter you would go gritty, hand-held camera, following a couple of soldiers through the whole ordeal.<br/><br/>Nolan tried to have his cake and eat it too and did both - and failed at both. Refusing to use CGI, he hired 1,000 extras, managed to get hold of 3 Spitfires, an old Heinkel bomber, a couple of Me109s and Stukas and one destroyer. The massive flotilla of smaller vessels is depicted by something around 20-30 yachts and cruise ships. So much for the gargantuan aspect of the operation. As for the POV action, we follow a pilot, an amateur crew in a leisure craft and a couple of soldiers stranded at the beach. None has any back story and in fact, I can't even remember their names. So there's little if any character development and you fail to connect with them in any meaningful way that would involve emotionally investing in their plight.<br/><br/>The factual mistakes in this movie are so many and so great that I won't even bother listing them here. Besides, Nolan has clearly jumped into the post-truth bandwagon so this is inconsequential. As many reviewers have pointed out ""this is not a documentary"" - Trump himself would endorse such a poignant rebuttal. Unfortunately once an actor or director has ventured into the world of superhero franchises, all possibility of objective and fair evaluation of their performance is lost. Forever. Fanatical praise and absolute contempt for constructive criticism will abound. Which is another hallmark of millennial thinking."

","In screen writing, a shot is an image captured by the camera. A scene is a meaningful dramatic movement within the story. A sequence is a collection of scenes with a unified dramatic purpose, usually between 10 to 20 minutes long. Millennials like their shots and scenes fast like the commercials that show images for a couple hundred milliseconds maximum, and Christopher Nolan made this movie just for them. There is no classic character or story development; it seems to be just a collection of quick scenes cut and mingled from what should be different sequences. I doubt there is a proper sequence in it. Nolan described it as ""his most experimental film,"" and that truly is what this movie is, but I give it a 7 for technical work."
"frederikbarndorff","9","5","13","26 July 2017"," This is what filmmaking is about
","I think most movie fans were excited for this film. I know i was very excited, but then again Christopher Nolan is absolutely one of my favorite directors. Right up there with Scoresese and Spielberg. So naturally ""Dunkirk"" was one of my most anticipated movies of the year.<br/><br/>I have rarely seen a film this thrilling and intense. ""Dunkirk"" never gives you a moment to relax. It puts you right in the middle of the action and it works. ""Dunkirk"" is filmmaking at It's finest. Instead of CGI Nolan uses real destroyers and real spitfires. This makes for one of the most realistic war films you will find and this without all the gore and flying limbs you're used to in war films. The score by Hans Zimmer is one of the most important aspects of the film it get's your heart pumping during the non-stop action and in that respect is one of, If not the best film scores of the year. As for the performances those are great as well although we don't really learn that much about the characters. The different characters in the film don't have big emotional arcs. Perhaps some will consider this a big flaw, but for this film it works. In that way It's more realistic. In a situation this intense you wouldn't have the time to tell about the wife waiting for you at home. A scene like that is left out and i never for a second I missed it. Dunkirk is a brilliant movie and one of the best of the year. Nolan once again delivers a great film. A great experience. If you can, i recommend you go see it in IMAX for the best experience.

"SamwiseG","10","5","13","26 July 2017"," Wonderful movie, and very poignant if you understand WW2
","This is the best, and most thought provoking war movie I have seen for a long time....yes Saving private Ryan was great, but it still couldn't extract itself from that 'America won the War' attitude that underlies most Hollywood produced movies. This film however shows a real understanding of what it was like to be at the sharp end of WW2, when the UK as an island nation were stretched far too thinly trying to defend itself and its allies. The acting performances are understated, but excellent at the same time...none are likely to get Academy nominations, but each played their part in portraying the full gambit of emotions that were taking place during that particular low point of the hostilities. I sat in a cinema with many teenagers surrounding me, and found myself hoping that they understood what was being shown to them and that they appreciated the sacrifices that were made on their behalf. Having scanned many of the other reviews it is interesting that many detractors seem to prefer that Hollywood approach to WW2, and appear to have no comprehension of the reality of the early 1940's ..... this is a sad fact, and whilst its not great to dwell on the past it is important to understand it. Well done Christopher Nolan and all the cast - definitely a must see movie."

"rgkarim","9","5","13","22 July 2017"," Dunkirk, Dun Realism Right
","War, huh, yeah, what is it good for? Entertaining movies, that is what it is good for. Hollywood has numerous examples of wars from the various historical times in our human legacy. Many of these installments focus on a hero who saved the war, or a band of brothers that bravely faced the odds to hold the line. In most cases though, you can bet there will be violence, explosions, and often graphic portrayals of the hell contained in our squabbles. I finish my weekend reviews with Dunkirk, which is the latest installment in the Christopher Nolan library. Can the Dark Knight director work his magic in war? Or does it fizzle out like a dud bomb. Robbie K here to give his opinions. Let's get started. <br/><br/>LIKES:<br/><br/>Layered Story: Many war movies are the linear tales of the hero who will win the battle. Dunkirk diverts from this main path and instead presents its plot from three viewpoints that overlap at various times. A cryptic opening doesn't do much to explain this, but eventually the plots coincide and your mind is blown by the presentation. This element, though confusing at times, adds that unique flare to the movie that keeps your interest piqued as you connect the journeys of those involved. In addition, the multiple viewpoints give you a more complete picture of the war, further bringing the history to life in a manner Hollywood special effects is famous for. <br/><br/>Realism: We know the doctoring editing and story writers can make to score big bucks in the box office. These moments often lead to overdramatic, eye-rolling moments that war dramas can be. Dunkirk again shines in the unique department in terms of crafting the story to be realistic in many details. You'll be pulled into the war in this film, grounded in the nightmares that plague the battlefields and the internal struggle that all involved face. I felt plagued with the emotional guilt in the choices made in this film, while also concerned with the consequences that could follow those choices. The film's focus on the people and not the battle works on so many levels, and makes you interested in the characters more so than the special effects. Nice choice again Noland!<br/><br/>The Cinematography: Dunkirk doesn't have a lot of lines, award winning dialogue, or even one- liners that we as humans like. Instead it is the cinematography and editing that bring Dunkirk to life and make it shine in the theater's dark halls. While the special effects are certainly impressive (though not that showy), it's really the camera work that brings the mood out in the form of hope seeking faces that are suffering through the onslaught dealt to them. Throw in the powerful musical score and mix in the little line delivery and you get that recipe for emotional bombardment that brings respect, empathy, and pride of the sacrifices made by troops long ago. <br/><br/>Short run time: Such a dynamic, sounds like it would take foreverfortunately Nolan's direction kept the movie under 2 hours and brought quality out in that short time. This is an example of good directing and editing, and proof that you can have a quality film in a short time limit. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>Missing that Hollywood Story: Realism is good, but I certainly missed having a flared-up story to grip onto. Dunkirk is a quality movie, but it isn't as much fun as I have had with other war movies. It lacks some of the big, bang excitement made famous in other war movies, and the realistic psychological approach can drag at times. The result is not the action-packed survival I had hoped for, but I can always rewatch Hacksaw Ridge for that. And while I enjoyed the layered story approach, I again think it was confusing at times to piece things together without a central story, plot, or goal (outside of survival/rescue) to hook onto. <br/><br/>The placement of certain scenes: My buddy and I agreed that there were points to this movie that were difficult to follow. Much of this came from the odd placement of clips in the movie and the rapid transitions between these various stories with little guidance. Things do get better when the lines start to come together, but there are still scenes that still stay confusing at points until the end of the movie. In addition, the pacing of the stories was uneven at times, with a couple of stories rapidly concluding (so you think), only to reappear after a prolonged gap. Not the biggest weakness, but things could have been a little better oriented for me. <br/><br/>Depressing: We know war sucks, and this movie's portrayal of the loss of hope amplifies those feelings. There are so many elements of depression in this movie that you may feel a little down following the opening. I felt a little tired during this movie, especially during the drawn-out moments that were more depressing and less stressing. <br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Dunkirk is certainly one of the more artistic and clever portrayals of war, dropping Hollywood flare for realism. Nolan's impressive directing opens up new worlds of war theater and keeps things fresh with the impressive displays of heroism. Yet all the good the cinematography and directing is I missed the Hollywood flare that cinemas bring. Without that story/entertainment value to it Dunkirk has some confusing presentations and dragged out moments that can weigh heavy on you. Still, this movie has plenty to qualify a visit to the theater, and one of the better movies of the summer. Not the epic wartime thriller, but certainly one of the more realistic, war dramas I have ever seen. <br/><br/>My scores:<br/><br/>Action/Drama/History: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0"
"arghaoc","10","5","13","22 July 2017"," Best of Nolan. Best of the year, maybe even the decade!
","I still don't believe that Christopher Nolan actually pulled off this project using no blood or gore. Telling a story from three different perspectives: land, air, and water, the movie has no particular character arc but an overwhelming piece of storytelling with a minimal amount of dialogue. That said, Dunkirk is THE most immersive war film made to date, and that makes it the movie of the year, probably of the decade and Nolan's best work. When I initially heard that he's making a movie on an actual story related World War II, and given the fact that every one of his work plays with a non-linear timeline, I wondered how he's gonna do it with this topic. But there he was, making all of us scratch our heads with the three different timelines. Chris is a Master of visual storytelling, which is a result of a witty screenplay, extravagant cinematography, and practical visual effects, supported by a heart-pounding musical score by Hans Zimmer. And as always, it needs several re-watches. Plus, I'm looking forward to seeing him grab his first Oscar next year. For Director and Screenplay!"

"dagurlh","10","5","13","21 July 2017"," A love letter to Christopher Nolan
","Dear Christopher Nolan. Every time i think you cannot top your last work you surprise me and bring something new. something fresh and original. Dunkirk is no exception. Its style and historical accuracy is on its own enough to give this movie praise but how it's executed that's what stands out the most. The movie fits together so perfectly and it all feels so natural to watch. There are no stages in this movie. Like the movie starts of with one stage where nothing is happening just to introduce the characters or a build up of how the Dunkirk disaster came to happen. No Christopher Nolan throws us right into the middle of it as it is happening and we get to see our characters and get to know them as everything is happening. The entire movie feels like one fluent motion. And the use of music in this movie is portioned and only used when needed. No pointless background music, just music to tell the story properly. <br/><br/>You feel the emotions of the Characters and the terror they are faced with. And the cruel side of humanity (The Nazi's and the poor frank who the British soldiers wanted to sacrifice to lift up the boat) And we see the good side of humanity The people who came to the rescue of the trapped soldiers and the brave men who fought and fell. Just so we can stand free"
"tye1138","9","5","13","20 July 2017"," Why hasn't anyone else made a movie like this?
","There has never been anything like this made in the history of cinema. War movies can't really depict war because they always feel obligated to tell stories. Nolan threw the whole story thing out the window. It's literally one big action scene that lasts 1 hour and 40 some odd minutes. It's a brilliant idea because it really gives you the essence of war; it's relentless and it simply doesn't stop. Even the great war films like 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Patton', have quiet moments in between the battles, but not Dunkirk. Quiet is a brief dialog scene where the actors try to figure out how the F to survive the next 10 seconds. Then the filmmakers tear down all the walls and watch as the characters try to survive the next few moments. To say it's intense is an understatement, your eyes are pegged to the screen, your senses are on high alert. You are in the spitfire as it attacks the German plane. You're in the ship as it's torpedoed and floods in real time. You're on the beach as it's bombed and peoples bodies fly into the sky. It's the best 3rd act to a war movie that I've ever seen, only... there aren't a 1st and 2nd act.<br/><br/>So this is where I was SLIGHTLY disappointed. The movie focuses on the ""action"" and doesn't let the audience soak it in. It also doesn't give you any emotional attachment to the characters or even the situation, you never ""feel"" for anyone. Thus, it left me not really caring what I saw on screen. Like a video game, it just fed me constant stimulus until it was over, but I felt there could have been some moments to draw the audience into the people, rather then JUST the event as a whole. Even though some people didn't like Interstellar, (Nolan's last movie) I loved it because I could relate to the characters and there was an emotional thread I could cling onto. Even ten minutes of character development spread throughout the movie, would have been really good, but as I sit here writing this, having just seen it, I feel a lack of emotion that was very much present after watching Interstellar.<br/><br/>With that said, what I saw was pretty damn awesome and technically it was so well made, I feel like the bar has been risen 3 levels. This maybe the last ""great"" war film ever made. We may never see anything like this again because NOBODY will spend the time and effort it takes to get it all in camera, the right way. It worked so well in 70mm, it looked fantastic, it sounded awesome. The music was spot on and honestly slightly unmemorable because the movie moved so fast, it was hard to focus on any single thing. I was very much impressed with everything I saw and frankly, I think everyone should stop what they're doing and see Dunkirk in 70mm IMAX if they can find a theater near them. It's an experience that may never come around again and once it's gone from the theaters, your chance is over. Like so many great movies, this is one to be seen in the theater, the small screen will never do it justice.<br/><br/>Score grade: A Score percentage 95%"
"cwcaza96","10","5","13","20 July 2017"," A must see film, Dunkirk is a breath of fresh air....
","From start to finish Dunkirk is a masterpiece. Never in my life have I been on edge from start to finish in a film. Dunkirk just does that...<br/><br/>Set in WW2 the Brits are undermined against the Germans. In ally territory backed up against the wall, Dunkirk shows the grimiest times of war and the urge to survive. The film is set in between 3 stories, land, air and sea. With a majority of the film focusing on Tommy, a young army soldier who is trying to leave Dunkirk and come back to Britain. Another character who is prominent (the air) is ""Farrier"" a pilot from the Royal Air Force, who is part of a 3 man team to help support the soldiers trapped on Dunkirk. Whilst Mr Dawson is a prominent character of the ""sea"" story line. Right from the start Dunkirk excels, in story telling, setting up the scene, cinematography and soundtrack. The sound of bullets, bombs, and shells going over the place is one truly best experienced in a theater. The story telling is top notch, by showcasing early what each story there is an how far apart they are from real time events. You will need to be vary though, as certain scenes jump from present to past, but it's quite easy to understand when this happens. <br/><br/>The movie also emphasizes a lot on ""survival"", these characters that are present in Dunkirk, always are in a life threatening situation and can never catch a break. Nolan truly immersed himself in this world, as does the audience, the film is created so well you actually feel like you're apart of the war. Dunkirk most importantly stays true to the content, the constant fear of war and the enemy approaching is exhilarating and tense. An example is there is a scene where Tommy and some soldiers he is with a trapped in a boat, only to be shot at by an unknown enemy, thus sinking the boat and letting water in. The soldiers must either risk going out of the boat at top and being shot or trying to break free from the boat, whilst water is flowing in.<br/><br/>What makes this film a stand out is how little dialogue there is, and it's not a bad thing. The little dialogue on further emphasizes how realistic this war is. As soldiers didn't casually talk about seeing the horrors, most of them were suffering from PSTD or just remained quiet as they needed to survive.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is an extraordinary achievement for Nolan, it's one of his finest films to date. I would recommend this film to anyone, as it is a must see in theater. Overall I would give this film a 10/10 on this site, but if I could would give it a 9.5, as that's what's considered a masterpiece for me. In my opinion I would also say it's Nolan's best film since Inception."
"cruxiaer-vance","10","6","17","29 July 2017"," Dare I say it? Better than SPR
","Most war movie follows a protagonist or a few ""hero"" characters which is the norm for Hollywood action movies.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Dunkirk had little to no action. It is about the soldier, the human emotion and the morality.<br/><br/>Some complained about the movie having too little dialogue to tell the story but I disagree. The use of sparing dialogue is used to further strengthen the display of human emotion when under extreme stress and threat.<br/><br/>For a historical war film such as this, I suspect Nolan didn't even care about telling the history side of the story too much because he'd expect you have already read a little on the subject.<br/><br/>This is a very different take, refreshing and intimate, than other ""hero"" war films. The fact that Nolan achieved a war film with no hero characters, minimal dialogue and hardly any action is amazing. To people who complain about those, you simply have no sense in cinematic values or you find it hard to comprehend the story of what Nolan is trying to convey.<br/><br/>The story is not Dunkirk, the story is the people at Dunkirk."
"livnstrong","10","6","17","25 July 2017"," As complete as a movie can be
","Riveting, moving, revealing, and inspiring. This is as close to a masterpiece as it gets. Even aspects such as the sound and editing are exceptional. Nolan, the crew and cast really do the history and memory of Dunkirk justice. You can tell that this was a labor of love and respect for Nolan. But he gets strong support from everyone who made this movie."
"RforFilm","10","6","17","24 July 2017"," One part suspenseful and two parts engaging, Dunkirk is the loudest silent movie I've seen (it's also incredible)
","History has proved that war is Hell. Soldiers that have been there and back will reveal that they were in constant fear that any moment could be their last. There was no such thing as a safe haven. The moment they would retreat to their tents and shut their eyes for the evening would be treasured as they were never sure if they would ever wake up. Sure, having their hands on a gun or even knife might give them some reassurance, but the cloud of death is felt by everyone, with the acceptance that they're okay with sacrifice. <br/><br/>There are too many war movie to name, but how many of them deal with the actual fear that came with it? Even I'm hard pressed to fully name one. I think it has to do with the ideology that's similar to how the American government wants the public to see its military; fearless. Vulnerability seems to be seen as more of a sign of weakness then humanity, especially in film. It's always about trying to be the hero. It's all about showing that your have to stand and face the enemy. What if I were to say it's okay to run? Dunkirk let's you know that it's alright to dream of home within hopelessness.<br/><br/>The film opens with some history exposition informing the audience that it's 1940 and very early into WWII. We are then introduced to three different stories that seemingly blend together as the film progresses. First on the land is about a young British private Tommy (played by Fionn Whitehead) who (along with the rest of the troops) is being pushed closer and closer to the ocean. He joins with fellow private Gibson (played by Aneurin Barnard) and later Alex (played by Harry Styles) as they simply hope to catch a boat that will take them home.<br/><br/>The second story on the water is about an older mariner Mr. Dawson (played by Mark Rylance) as he and his son Peter join with several sailors in transporting their ships to Dunkirk to help with the troop rescue. They later pickup a shell-shocked soldier (played by Cillian Murphy) and deal with him wanting to turn the boat around.<br/><br/>The last story in the air, centers around three spitfire pilots on the English Channel to provide support from the Nazi attacks. Though one of the pilots Farrier (played by Tom Hardy) gas gauge breaks, he continues to fight as long as he can.<br/><br/>If film has been about immersing audiences into new worlds, then Dunkirk will transport you to the terror of WWII. Right from the opening scene (which I will not DARE spoil), I found myself flinching to gunshots and explosions, as if I was in a VR experience. Director Christopher Nolan again extends his belief that cinema should be an experience and Dunkirk is an incredible suspenseful war movie that gave me an idea of what fear I would have felt had I been in the military. <br/><br/>It's been said that real veterans of the Dunkirk event felt like they had returned. I can say that this movie looks and sounds incredible. For such a story that shot in a wide scope, you ironically feel that claustrophobia that each of the men in France felt when they thought they were going to die. Sometimes its right on the beach and sometimes it's on the sailboat in the little rooms where that may have been the only safe place. I saw this in IMAX, and I can say that it amplifies the sound to a level that added the number of times I jumped from my seat. <br/><br/>Will Dunkirk receive a best picture nomination? It's tough to tell, but I'm sure it's already guaranteed all of the technical awards from effects to sound to especially score by the great Hans Zimmer. The music, like the movie, all feel like a ticking time bomb that will eventually go off, yet you never see the timer. <br/><br/>If I had any issue is that the movie does feel a little long even with it's hour and forty minute running time. A lot of that has to do with that you listen to very little dialogue and all the focus is the reaction of the characters. This makes for what has to be the loudest silent movie I've seen.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten Dunkirk flags out of ten. Watching Dunkirk on the big screen will feel like a historical roller coaster, so if sound volume doesn't bother you, spring for the IMAX screening if you can. While I can't say this is Nolan's best work, Dunkirk justifies his claim that we need cinema for movies like these."
"david-fernandez","10","6","17","21 July 2017"," A very special war movie indeed
","Beautifully shot and crafted the desperation of being on the losing end of a full military retreat. Out of hopelessness comes salvation. The multiple different story threads intertwine and are often partially repeated from different perspectives, the big acts of heroism from individuals and the little people combined is quite uplifting and moving to watch. The movie almost reminds me (in mood and design) of those 1960s, 1970s and 1980s movies .. Waterloo, Battle of Britain, Barry Lyndon .. sort of slightly detached. A must see for war history lovers and investigators of the human condition when under bleak, mortal threat."
"julia-00157","9","6","17","21 July 2017"," Heart pounding, heart breaking war thriller
","Can I start off with a question? Why do we go see movies? To escape, to learn something, or to feel something. Dunkirk perfectly captures all three and, like the movie, this review will come to you in three parts.<br/><br/>One, to escape. Watching this movie was a truly immersive experience. When the planes darted around I felt dizzy. When the soldiers gasped for air as their boat went under I could feel their anxiety and tried to reach out myself, and swim for the surface. When a bomb blew up I felt I was in danger. The suspense built throughout this movie reached levels only a true master can dream of. I don't know what made me feel this way, and maybe I'm not supposed to know. Maybe the intent wasn't for the audience to go searching for the origin, but something about this movie made me care deeply about every single character. Maybe because most of the men were just baby- faced little boys, whether they were top billing or an extra with less than a second of screen time, I wanted to rescue them. Which precisely encapsulates the history of the mission. Dunkirk was a rescue mission. They tried to save every young man stuck on that beach that day. And I could feel that. I felt in with the characters, like I knew them and was in the same boat. I wanted to survive just as much as them, but we wanted to survive together. <br/><br/>Two, to learn something. Dunkirk is obviously based on the evacuation of Dunkirk in World War Two. We talked briefly abut this in history class but not to any large extent. As a result, I was walking into the theater knowing little about what happened except the basics. Now, Nolan's characters are all fictional, but they are drawn from the real people that made the story. The movie is fast paces and taking place along a short stretch of time. The characters are always on edge and doing something, so there is little room for exposition about their own lives. However, there is some scattered throughout, perfectly placed so that you can have that, without ever feeling forced. <br/><br/>Three, to feel something. As I stated earlier, this movie forges a deep understanding and protective relationship with every single character. I feel like they are my babies and I want to make sure they are okay. The ending, which I won't spoil, is perfection itself. Capturing what must have been felt after Dunkirk was evacuated: relief, exhaustion, and victory. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie there is a constant, underlying ticking noise. A clock, which they are up against. The rounds of a revolver, pointed at their heads. A fighter plane getting ready to fire, swirling above them, squealing. <br/><br/>Obviously, this is One Direction's Harry Styles's acting debut. And yes, he can act. He's got a lot to learn, sure. But he's got raw talent you can see in this movie and I expect we will see many times in the near future. <br/><br/>All across the board, performances are spectacular. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and this chain would be unbreakable. Each actor providing a step up for their partner in a scene as they build each other up. A little note I have is that most of the soldiers looked very similar. Dark hair, big eyes, and a stiff face. I assume this was a very conscious choice for the director to make. <br/><br/>Dunkirk has three simultaneous and interspersed story lines. This works well for making sure you don't lose interest, but it depends deeply on your ability to recognize the actors. This goes back to all the soldiers looking the same. There was a part that I found to be an unnecessary tear-jerking attempt, but that's not to say it at all spoiled my enjoyment of the movie. <br/><br/>I'm not going to go into Nolan because we all know he's proved himself as someone who can do this. However, I will say, though I am not a huge fan and haven't seen everything he's made, this is unlike anything I've seen his name attached to. It all felt so real, a stark contrast to the inception approach that nothing is. <br/><br/>And last but not least, it's just really pretty. The wides and close ups and deep emotion each shot brings, whether you're conscious of it or not. <br/><br/>You will find your heart beating and breaking from the opening credits to the end."
"zch-crstnsn","8","7","21","18 July 2017"," A love letter to the UK
","Nolan is a master of his craft. He really flexes his thematic muscles on every project. Amazing imagery and always has an impressive nack for telling a story. Stunning cinematography and A+ acting, easily one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. The more I recount it tho the more I am sure it was a love letter to the UK, which is a pretty charming sentiment. It seemed like a showcase of Brit grit in the face of overwhelming odds. Honestly at some points I felt I was watching a visual representation of a history textbook. Not really what I was hoping for but immensely entertaining. A very vague plot if one at all, just a series of truly jaw dropping events and character reaction. But maybe that's the point? Colorful examples of bravery and cowardice in the face of monumental situations; with unfortunately predictable reactions. But what are we to expect from a director who has mastered the alternative mind-bending fiction which has won our hearts for years? A director who's toes are just barely wet in the ocean of nonfiction narrative? He dives full confidence into the alien realm and newcomer Nolan scores an 8/10. A noble mark for my favorite filmmaker, credited with creating some of the best fiction ever written and displayed."
"gurdeeppandher","10","4","10","31 August 2017"," A great movie
","I watched Dunkirk in Whitehorse, Yukon. As soon as the movie opened its first scene, it took me to the pages of history. World War II created lots of stories and this one was one of the epic ones. Dunkirk presented in a wonderful way. The whole story-line, cast, and movie- making is great. The cast present the heroism, emotionalism, suffering, joy, and everything is a professional way."
"templar77099","9","4","10","7 August 2017"," The clock's ticking
","Dunkirk is without a doubt my favourite cinema experience of the year so far. I mean, thats not that hard to achieve since in 2017 the only films I've watched in the theatre were John Wick 2, Ghost in the Shell, Spider Homecoming, the more recent Transformers (bleh, bleh, bleh) and Despicable Me 3 (yeah, I did). The rest of it were at home. And although John Wick and Spidey were very good flicks, they weren't as gripping and intense as Nolan's Dunkirk. You know you're in for a ride from very first shot. In two minutes it's already kicking the fan. When we reach the beach and see what many have to do in order to survive comes the sudden realisation of the hopeleness and the miracle that needs to happen to bring all of those soldiers back home. The three separate timelines were just perfect to brilliantly tell this story. The mesh so well and make the film fell fluid and dynamic, always moving, interconnecting events and characters, almost like chapters of a book. We don't get to know much of the characters but I believe that what we're given is enough to figure out ourselves some of the backstory and motivations of the characters. The collective is what's a stake here. We might be confused when trying to identify who's who, specially on the big setpieces, but that just adds to viscerality and intensity Dunkirk excels in delivering. Both the photography and soundtrack are amazing. One friend of mine jokingly told me a few das ago that the music just wouldn't stop and became ad eternum. I didn't know what make of this, but believe that if it was well executed, Nolan could do whatever he wanted. Spoiler - it was. The OST makes for the lack of dialogue - yes, this is almost a silent film - and elevates the action and the stakes. It fits like a glove into the overall tone of Dunkirk. Actingwise is very solid - shoutout to Styles who really held his ground and turned a surprisingly convincing performance. Hardy is brief but gets the hang of it. The rest of the cast is quite good, with many of the actors being unknown, another factor that contributes to establish the collective over the individual.<br/><br/>Got to give it to Nolan."
"shalaw-fatah","9","4","10","6 August 2017"," Brilliant and unique
","I've always expected the best thrillers from Christopher Nolan, but this kind of movie, no. He proved to be a great director. 1. No central character, no firm story-line, yet the movie is attracting you well. 2.The background music is amazing, weird and haunting. 3. The imagery is just perfect. 4. Although it's a war movie, no heroism, CGI or gore is shown. 5. It's no thriller by any rate. 6. The brilliance of this movie is that it works against the current. The vast majority of movies attract audiences through appealing characters, interesting story lines, quotes or twists, but this movie works against all these and yet you can feel the most real and human experience. 7. How the plot is depicted, the closest in terms of storyline development is Boyhood [2014], in terms of imagery is Titanic, and in terms of music I'd say Under the Skin."

"sanjidparvez","6","4","10","29 July 2017"," Enemy: flat & one dimensional characters, Winner: cinematography
","As for the 'critical praise' goes, I understand Nolan tried to capture here a macro point of view of the historic event/evacuation story of Dunkirk but it turned out another disappointment (after Interstellar)! Thing is most of the epic & classic war movies comes with an individual or a set of characters, backed up by a rich screenplay that eventually made us started to care for them while we witnessed the horror of war to gradually unfold with a graceful touch of heart or humanity at some point in the story. In Nolan's Dunkirk, the single character development was minor issue with mere importance, as I guess he was more interested to depict the event as a ""character"" itself that's facing a struggle to survive in one of the most awfully cornered situations in the history of world wars for an allied force. Most of the ""major characters"" were either desperately trying to escape or determined to follow the course of their duties without much portraying emotional aspects of their convictions. Frustrating part is, after all these years it was a great opportunity (missed!) for a film maker like Nolan to really make a remarkably true epic war movie based on such an intriguing war event like Dunkirk...started from the point of Nazi war plan to skillfully corner the Brit & French allied force and their historic rescues at the end! I understand that not every war movie needs to be character driven with great cast like PATTON, BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or SCHINDLER'S LIST and there was even war film made in such approach where they remarkably portrayed an horrifying event of war without much focusing a set of characters i.e. COME AND SEE (one of the best war movies ever made, IMO) but Dunkirk sadly failed to left any sort of moving impression on me as a viewer.<br/><br/>Though the presence was there but directly (with characters) there wasn't much portrayal of German enemy side in Dunkirk. The irony is actually the 'real enemy' were flat & one dimensional characters and the only real winner in this movie was cinematography, stunning!"
"skeen-69248","7","4","10","28 July 2017"," Dunkirk - True warfare
","I left Dunkirk feeling an unusual sense of sadness. There is, at least for me, a tendency to become very desensitised to war films after you watch so many and yet Dunkirk has knocked me out of the park with it's magnificent beach-bound atmosphere. Every bullet is real and threatening, the sound of metal on metal as they hit various materials is a shock without fail. A plane flying overhead is a death machine swooping down to take you away. Dunkirk is a portrait of fear and goodness me is it hard to look away.<br/><br/>See this on a big screen with the best sound near you, relax as best you can and let Nolan's masterpiece take you back in time to a moment of mankind's brutality that should never be forgotten."
"barryrd","9","4","10","27 July 2017"," Tense and riveting work of film-making
","Dunkirk is a tense, riveting piece of film-making. The action moves from beach to sea to sky with the story showing how the event was played out among all involved in this historic event. I felt like I was inside the Spitfire as it raced across the sky, or drowning inside a boat as it was bombed and burned. The scene looking across the English Channel was dark and cold and the waters rough. While there was great heroism, the viewer also sees the worst as men suffering from shock come face to face with critical choices. The cast was made up of many fine performers but I found Mark Rylance was best as he portrayed the quiet heroism of Mr. Dawson, who along with his two sons, volunteered his small craft for the evacuation. The movie seems to point out that people like him were the backbone of the massive evacuation effort. A vivid movie spectacular, this movie made me feel like I was right there in the water, on the beach or in the air. A truly great movie!"
"RNMorton","8","4","10","27 July 2017"," Great action sequences
","Sometimes historical stories are best described by telling the tale from the perspective of a few individuals instead of trying to give the big picture. The Longest Day and any Michener work is an example. I think that approach works, with some slight reservations, in this one. The focus is on Rylance as the stoic (as it were) small boat captain pitching in; a couple of ordinary soldiers trying just to get out of the trap; and a Hurricane pilot protecting the retreat with developing petrol issues. As you might expect, some of their paths criss cross, which in some ways makes this a little pat, like some Spielberg concoction. It also seemed a little played out and long on time although it wasn't. But the cinematography and the action, particularly the fighter action, is just stupendous and trumps those concerns. Worth a look."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","8","4","10","26 July 2017"," The most absorbing technical marvel since Gravity
","Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is making headlines as the best war movie in years, and arguably Nolan's best film. The former I can understand and I don't agree with the latter, but that's not really important. I think most people will agree that Christopher Nolan's gripping direction as well as the film's cinematography, sound, and special effects all amount to one of the most impressive technical marvels in years. Dunkirk takes the war genre to a new level, similar to the way Saving Private Ryan did about twenty years ago, with absorbing action scenes that create an authentic war feel. Saving Private Ryan is not the best analogy to this movie though. To me, the best comparison is Gravity (2013), - both gripping stories about survival under insurmountable odds that keeps the audience invested with its technical wizardry.<br/><br/>Dunkirk follows three stories at different times during the ill-fated battle. One story follows a British air force pilot played by Tom Hardy in what are the best dog fight scenes scenes in years. Hardy is once again covered by a mask, but it makes no difference. The second story is about a British infantryman trying to get off the beaches of Dunkirk at any cost. The third story is about a group of civilians (one played by Mark Rylance) who assist with the rescue effort in their ordinary boat. The chronological narrative tricks will remind Nolan fans of his first film, Memento, but it's no where near as complicated. Eventually the stories intersect. The one element uniting all of these stories is the struggle for survival. While some characters are paralyzed with fear, others manage to stay brave and fight the good fight. You barely see the Nazis, and the violence is never graphic, but you feel the horror of war through the sound of the bombs, the sound of the bullets hitting metal near the soldiers, and the sheer desperation in the eyes of the soldiers.<br/><br/>The technical features of the film have deservedly received the most acclaim, but the cast's performances are all commendable. Hans Zimmer's score is also his best in years. The music will get your heart pumping.<br/><br/>Of all the praises I have heaped on this film, I do have some reservations. I am not sure how well this film will hold up on a small screen. Without the big screen to take in the picture, and the speaker system of a movie theater, I don't know how gripping the movie will be. It may be just fine, but I think the film will lose something on DVD. The lack of a traditional story and developed characters may harm the film's repeat value.<br/><br/>Still, if you're going to see one action spectacle this summer, see Dunkirk in IMAX. You must see this movie on the biggest screen you can. The sounds and the sights will make you feel like you are really there."
"deadman_walkin01","8","4","10","25 July 2017"," Dunkirk is an experience. Nolan a master at work.
","Pros: A masterpiece of cinema. Directing, editing, cinematography, music, acting. Every ingredient in this film put into it was of the highest quality and as such, it sucked you into the film. This is the work of a man at the peak of his ability, creating art in ways that are becoming harder to find in modern cinema. Like Spielberg, he has managed to find an army of artists that now appear to follow him film to film helping him realise his masterpieces and in that respect this film is an experience to your senses for the 100 minutes you are watching it.<br/><br/>Cons: The story. Simple, no characters I could relate to, in fact most of them felt very expendable throughout the whole film. Considering the lengths Nolan went to convey the huge sense of scale of the war taking place around these people, I felt that the story moving throughout it was quite plain, were it not for the music creating an ever present sense of tension, I would probably have not been held by the story at all. Maybe he was trying to show how truly low in value human life is during a time of war, or trying to present the stories as more of a collective of the soldiers on the beach all being humans etc but I just could not get immersed into it as deeply as many of his other stories he has told sadly. <br/><br/>Fantastic war film. Definitely sits well in Nolan's work."
"lionel-simo","9","4","10","25 July 2017"," Another Nolan masterpiece!
","The wait is finally over. I've never been this excited to watch a movie in years. And it sure was worth the wait. Watched it last night and it was better than I expected.<br/><br/>The story of Dunkirk is well known. During the early stages of World War II, Allied soldiers from Britain, Belgium and France are surrounded by the German Army on the beaches of Dunkirk, around 400,000 soldiers were evacuated.<br/><br/>There isn't a lot of dialogue in this film and there isn't a central character to develop. It is telling the story of the battle rather than a person's story during the battle, and I like that.<br/><br/>This movie is a MASTER of keeping your attention to the screen, probably y thanks to the magical musician H.Zimmer. He proved again that he's the best. He provides the perfect mood for a war epic. <br/><br/>This is the movie that everybody must see. So what are you wanting for ?"
"jeff1970-126-879174","6","4","10","23 July 2017"," Some good some bad
","**May contain spoilers** First off, this movie is nowhere near a 10/10. The lack of character depth/development alone bars it from approaching that. In fact, the only character you every really care about is Farrier (Tom Hardy's character). He seems to be the only character that that is still taking the fight to the enemy while everyone else is just ""surviving"". Some of the other characters die but you just don't really care. You can't distinguish them from any other soldier/sailor you see.<br/><br/>Next, though I admire Nolan for trying something different with the three different setting/different timed ride, it just didn't work for me. He definitely tried to bring it together toward the end of the film but for the majority of the film you were just trying check off a list in your head that the sea scene was in this order compared to the air scene compared to the Mole scene. Again, good idea but it maybe was just a little too cute for its own good.<br/><br/>Last, the visuals and music were outstanding. The scene of Farrier's plane coasting toward the end of the movie was just fantastic as well as most of the battle scenes. <br/><br/>In closing, I think this movie needed much more character development, dialogue (I can only remember one line from the movie ""You can almost see it"") and perhaps a reason to actually cheer for all of these poor souls left stranded on the beach at Dunkirk. Worth seeing but not an all-time great."
"Hegario","7","4","10","20 July 2017"," Should get the Oscar for filmography but nothing more.
","As someone who knows my military history I have to say that I felt ambivalent regarding the film. Nolan knows how to direct a film that looks good but in terms of a personal story I've always found his films lacking in a way.<br/><br/>The film has plenty of stuff that is great. Such as the fact that the aerial combat scenes were excellent and the fact that they actually sank a real ship made this a very good looking film visually but I can't get over a few things.<br/><br/>The non-linear way of telling the story made some characters out of place. Cillian Murphys character for example felt like his story was cut from the film. First the small boat picked him up, after that they showed him leading a group of men on a row boat but all of a sudden he is back and extremely shellshocked aboard the small boat again. I guess his story will be explained more in the directors cut.<br/><br/>The fact that Tom Hardys character had to shoot one more Stuka even though he had run out of fuel ages ago was just pure stupidity especially how they had shown in earlier air combat scenes with multiple Spitfire crosshair shots how hard it is to hit a target in the air.<br/><br/>The French participation was sort of overlooked even though they showed French soldiers. The opening scene shows French soldiers looking at the Brits bitterly because they knew the BEF was evacuating while the BEF soldiers on the other hand have the look of defeated men. Where was the mention of the valiant defenders of Lille who tied down 7 German divisions to buy time so the Brits could evacuate? Naturally they had to mention the Americans at the end even though their joining the war was a year and a half away.<br/><br/>This is the shortest Nolan film and in a way it shows. Nolan has never been a good director of human drama and the shortness of the film just shows it even more."
"asda-man","10","5","14","20 August 2017"," How many times can Chris outdo himself?
","Life can deal you such cruel hands. I am the biggest Christopher Nolan fan so I've been excitedly awaiting Dunkirk ever since it was announced three years ago. I've been avoiding every trailer and every clip in fear of needless spoilers and have been savouring every review since its release. Now, almost one month after its release I have finally been able to see it! If it was any old film then I would've seen it on the day of its release, however this is a Christopher Nolan movie which means that it has to be seen on the biggest screen possible to get the full effect.<br/><br/>So I took a trip up to London to catch Dunkirk on the BFI Imax, the biggest screen in England and I can safely say that it was worth the wait. Dunkirk is quite possibly the greatest cinema experience I have ever had, or at least the best since Interstellar which created similar immersive intensity in Imax. But even without the gargantuan screen and crystal clear sound, Christopher Nolan has created not just the greatest war film ever but one of the greatest films of any genre. It is truly a one of a kind film, breaking all kinds of war movie conventions and doing things that have never been attempted in any film before it. Extraordinarily, Nolan has outdone himself once again.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is the equivalent of a cinematic pressure-cooker. From the moment the film begins, it's put on high heat and it barely lets up for its entire 100 minute running time. The opening scene is sensational. We watch as a tragically young soldier picks up a leaflet depicting how British troops are surrounded by Germans. There's an instant atmosphere of dread and panic which only intensifies when the first bullet explodes out of nowhere. We're used to guns firing all the time in films. This is the first time the sound of a bullet has sent shivers up my spine. The noise is so loud and so sharp that I found myself jolting in my seat and for the first time in a war film, feeling the same sense of fear the soldiers on screen are feeling.<br/><br/>The weight of the situation really hits hard. The idea that these people could die at any moment feels Earth-shatteringly real. This is largely down to Christopher Nolan's directing which tries to squeeze as much realness as possible out of everything. Long takes are used as well as very few visual effects. The images feel so real that you almost forget that you're watching something that was staged. There's a moment near the beginning when a German plane flies over the troops and the roar of the engine matched with the fear in the soldier's faces and the over-powering dreadful score make it one of the most terrifying scenes I have ever seen on film. When the bombs hit, it's utterly devastating but filmed in the most beautiful way, largely in one shot which makes it feel all the more real.<br/><br/>The main focus is on a story which presents a week of soldiers trying to survive on Dunkirk but there is also a more talky story which sees Mark Rylance taking his boat out to pick up some troops as well as an almost dialogue-free story where Tom Hardy (face-covered again) has tries shooting down enemy planes. It could have been messy but in the hands of Nolan these stories are expertly weaved and executed to perfection.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly many audiences haven't quite taken to the film. Average moviegoers expecting an ordinary film with characters you can root for are going to be disappointed. Dunkirk is pure cinema and is something that cannot be described or put into words, it's something you simply have to experience. It's the reason why I love films and why I go to the cinema, to be taken on a journey. This is why I'm a fan of directors like David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick whose works consistently provide an immersive escapism into another world. Dunkirk is exactly this. It's a film which sweeps you along with it and completely immerses you in the event.<br/><br/>Whatever you look for in a film though, you can't deny the technical mastery of Dunkirk. I mean no hyperbole when I say that Dunkirk features some of the most spectacular images I have ever seen in a film. Planes sweeping over oceans, thousands upon thousands of soldiers lining up on a dark beach, ships sinking and engulfing people in water. These are some of the most breath-taking and indelible visuals I have ever come across. However, there are also quieter moments which haunt my mind. An older soldier throwing himself into the ocean and a heart-breaking final montage which ends each story on a spine-tingling powerful note are just as spectacular as the monumental set-pieces.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer also deserves a mention for providing yet again another remarkable score. Music always plays a big part in Nolan films, but in Dunkirk the music almost becomes another character. It's often dark and brooding but also serves to ratchet up the tension with a constant ticking which adds to the overall intensity. At times of relief though, it's uplifting and gave me perhaps the biggest chills I've ever had whilst watching a movie.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is more than just a film, it's a work of art. I can't think of a more intense movie experience than this. by the time the film ended I felt shaken and adjusting to reality outside of the cinema was difficult. This is the first war film to actually drop you in the middle of the war. It's definitely worth going to see on Imax for the full experience, but it's just as unmissable on your TV at home. Hopefully the Academy will now finally recognise Nolan for the incredible talent that he is after Interstellar was cruelly snubbed. Dunkirk is truly extraordinary."

"asifahsankhan","8","5","14","26 July 2017"," Dunkirk is an unrelenting Cinema triumph! (unmissable!)
","Watching Dunkirk at an IMAX Cinema is reluctant to be an unforgettable experience (for me it was, surely). Filled with unrelenting tension. From start to finish there isn't a minute's respite. With each gun battle, torpedo attack, aerial bombing and explosion, there's end-to-end action which is in equal parts gripping, thrilling and stunning. Expect your heart to hammer for the entire 107 minutes. I didn't hear a cough, sniff, barely an intake of breath from my fellow captivated cinema-goers. Nolan's Dunkirk will suck you in and spit you back out - in the best way. <br/><br/>As a Briton, this was seriously important, valuing the details. The magnificent history of Britain has tales to fill almost every book in the world and this powerful document of an era, the World War II and one of Britain's greatest military expenditure (which was actually a retreat by all means), told in stark terms by the Dark Knight director, a Brit-phenomenon himself, Christopher Nolan was more than overwhelming and satisfying. How the evacuation of Dunkirk in May 1940 turned out: how nearly 400,000 mainly British (which means mostly English but don't forget our Scottish brothers) troops escaped from the beach and harbour of a northern French port while being bombarded by the Nazis<br/><br/>Surely, my main expectation with war movies is the terrifying gore (thanks Spielberg). Blood, organs spilling everywhere, limbs blown off; all an accurate depiction of war but just so awful to watch. There's hardly a drop of visible blood spilled in Dunkirk but it is still one of the most brutal and powerful war films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg might have owned the Normandy beach landings while Clint Eastwood owns Iwo Jima, and now, Nolan has authored the definitive cinematic version of Dunkirk. Unlike those other battles, however, this last was not a conventional victory, but more of a salvaged retreat, as the German offensive forced a massive evacuation of English troops early in World War II. <br/><br/>And unlike those other two directors, Nolan is only nominally interested in the human side of the story as he puts his stamp on the heroic rescue operation, offering a bravura virtual-eyewitness account from multiple perspectives — one that fragments and then craftily interweaves events as seen from land, sea and air. Coming from Nolan, the film retains the same legendary scale but it's blended with a more intimate and structurally fascinating project like his earlier works Memento and Following. <br/><br/>Anyone who ever saw Memento knows Nolan is a fan of playing with time and structure, incorporating a pulsating suspense factor even without spelling anything out for the audience. Again, like a true master of cinema, he lets it all come together in sometimes surprising but enormously effective and even emotional ways. With sparse dialogue and an emphasis on three separate angles on the Dunkirk operation, Nolan creates three smaller elements that lead to a much bigger picture.<br/><br/>No action movie is complete without an epic score and Christopher Nolan has once again teamed up with the infamous Hans Zimmer following the success of their collaboration for The Dark Knight Rises. Given the lack of dialogue, the score is the ""leading character in the film."" The soundtrack is the star of the film. <br/><br/>With that, the film divulges into three interlocking chapters but is told from three different perspectives. There's 'The Mole, One Week', taking place on the harbour wall from which thousands were rescued and where we see a commander (Kenneth Branagh) trying to make sense of the disaster. There's 'The Sea, One Day', where we see civilian sailor Mark Rylance set off from the English south coast. And there's 'The Air, One Hour', in which RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) engages in dogfights with the Luftwaffe. There are other characters – young troops on the beach played Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles; a disturbed soldier (Cillian Murphy) rescued from the hull of a sinking warship. Yet as much as these familiar faces give us something to grab onto, this is a war film without heroes or a straightforward story. The event is the story. If that means some of the film feels chilly, a little distant, it's at the expense of easy sympathy and simplistic drama.<br/><br/>Sir. Churchill called Dunkirk a 'miracle'. The newspapers tagged it a 'triumph'. Nolan resists any punch-the-air celebration. Hans Zimmer's score scrapes away at you throughout, piling unease on unease before flirting with Elgar's war remembrance anthem 'Nimrod' and backing off, as if embarrassed. <br/><br/>Questions are posed about the British government: a survivor asks a RAF pilot back home, 'Where the hell were you?'. The older generation owes a debt to the young: 'That old bloke wouldn't even look us in the eye,' observes one soldier. We hear Sir. Churchill's 'We shall fight on the beaches' speech, but the words come from the mouth of a dazed soldier, not the PM. There's no glory here, just survival. It's a sombre tribute that makes a distant war feel uncomfortably present.<br/><br/>What was so brilliant about this war movie, as opposed to other blockbuster war movies, was the lack of any cheesy back story. There was no handsome soldier trying to get home to his childhood sweetheart, no lieutenant attempting to rescue a long-lost brother, no young boys crying for their mums, no romance - just a lot of actual war. The film was all the more real and heartbreaking for it.<br/><br/>Never mind that Britain if stood alone at that precise point during the war, this film is like the Brexit version of British identity in a nutshell: proudly isolated, independent, not European, and strongest everywhere in the world.<br/><br/>Go watch this in an IMAX Cinema if you can. This is a 2017 must- watch. A must see if you're English. A must see if you're Scottish. A must see if you're British."

","I'm not one of the biggest fans of Nolan, although I do like Memento (9/10) and loved TDK (10/10). I saw them both in theaters in 2000 and 2008, respectively. They have been my two favorites of his movies and I really do appreciate his artistry and talent in these movies. I'm just pointing this out to say I'm not a Nolanite who loves everything he does. For example, I wasn't a big fan of Interstellar, and I found Inception to only be good for a one time watch. Batman Begins was good, but although I liked TDKR, I found it flawed and a little overrated.<br/><br/>However, here comes Dunkirk. I went into this with low to no expectations, and I recommend doing the same. While I heard rave reviews, I thought, ""Oh no, here go the critics again with their overrated reviews..."" since I also read some negative reviews from audience reviewers claiming it was ""only good, not great"". So, I really had lowered my expectations, leaning toward the audience reviews. <br/><br/>Wow, this movie is awesome is all I can say. It is a visual masterpiece and in recent years, I have rarely been immersed in a movie the way I was with this. From the opening clip, it grips you immediately, and it rarely lets up. <br/><br/>This is the real deal. Within the first 20-30 minutes I already loved it. I had to just hope it didn't slow up or weaken by the end because I already thought it was a masterpiece. At one point about halfway through, a thought ran through my head ""Nolan is a genius"".<br/><br/>I don't know, maybe I'm just starving for a great summer movie, but I don't agree with any negative reviews of this film. it's almost perfect. The 90 minute edit down was much needed and I appreciate it as I have been asking Nolan to do that for years. I found Inception and TDKR could've been much better with better editing, shaving off at least a half hour if not more. Here, he does it so the whole movie is tight.<br/><br/>Some people have (and it's easy to), complained about the lack of character development or script, but it doesn't matter because the battle is the script. It could have used a little bit more character development, and that's where my 1 point deduction comes off. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a good movie that is ""an immersive experience"" that will grip you and barely let up, then I highly recommend Dunkirk. It's the best movie I've seen this year and one of the best war movies I've seen. This is one of the very few movies that I've seen in recent memory that I could say is worth the cost of a movie ticket. <br/><br/>It made me want to immediately see it again. That's when you know it's good. This is what summer movies and blockbusters are all about. <br/><br/>9/10"
"mukool-hastak","10","5","14","22 July 2017"," Just go watch it ! Nolan has returned to form !
","No need to elaborate more on that ! This movie is basically marketing itself. I'll just say that it's just simply a no-nonsense war movie. No clever expositional dialogue, no beautiful protagonists, no elaborate plot. Just 400,000 Allied soldiers surrounded by Nazi forces on the shore of the French town of Dunkirk, trying to escape. By any means means necessary; and all the brutal realities of war that accompany it. Just a gritty narrative played out onto the screen masterfully, supported by a bone-chilling score from Hans Zimmer. Will keep you hooked till the very end.<br/><br/>Yes, there are 3 different perspectives, yes their timelines are intertwined and jumbled a bit. But, that's the 'Nolan' touch which makes it even more watchable.<br/><br/>Just go watch it !"
"Equalizer16","10","5","14","21 July 2017"," Nolan Does it again
","Christopher Nolan's new cinematic war thriller literally takes your breath away, as the masterclass director returns in an intense powerful experience.<br/><br/>On the beaches of Dunkirk, the British soldiers wait to return to England, but ambushed by German attacks, must fight for survival to get home. In a triptych storyline, we see the events on land for one soldier Tommy played by (Finn Whitehead), in the sea, arriving support their troops Mr Dawson (Mark Rylance), and in air in a British cockpit with Farrier (Tom Hardy) This is a grand event for my relationship with cinema, as Dunkirk had the privilege to be my first IMAX experience, for which the journey is so worth it. With Nolan's 65mm format, Dunkirk is not a film its an experience or better yet it is happening. In such a massive screen at the BFI IMAX, it becomes a powerfully immersive experience that places you right in the middle of Dunkirk, surrounded by the booming sound of the guns and bombs. So many moments you will find yourself holding your breath, the 1hr 47 mins run time is an fierce gripping venture.<br/><br/>The magnificence of Christopher Nolan always surprises, as my favourite director, Dunkirk has been a very anticipated feature for me and so many and finally with its release Nolan has amazed as always. Carrying the spectacle of Intersteller (2014) but down to a Belgim, Nolan proves how really gripping, smart, and cinematic film can be. I know that an IMAX experience asks a lot, with the journey to London and higher price, but when a film like this comes along it is very worth your while.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is not just a cinematic presentation but also a remembrance to all the soldiers at Dunkirk, emitting a spectacular tone of British pride, Nolan demonstrates his passion and respect for the event, which through certain moments brings out a sensational joy to the heart. With a lack of a script, Nolan resembles silent cinema, and this is where the film is strong, with marvellous beautiful sequences of silence or just sound and no speech creates the real cinema of the film.<br/><br/>Hoyte van Hoytema's clutching cinematography is fantastic, from the tense silence at the beach, to the sinking ships, and the rather wonderful landscape shots above Hotema's only drags us further into the film. With a classic Nolanesc feel to way of the camera, we o have a documentary feel to film adding that extra authenticity. The most mesmerising shot war films since Saving Private Ryan (1998).<br/><br/>The real technical talent is Hans Zimmer's astonishing score. So many times Zimmer's collaboration with Nolan has given birth to many brilliant tunes, and Dunkirk brings the best one yet. From the tension building sound of the ticking, to the unsettling but absorbing groans of the sea, and ships, Zimmer creates pure war poetry and indeed horror.<br/><br/>As for the ensemble cast, Nolan places all members exactly where they should, especially Kenneth Branagh's pier commander is exactly perfect for the film. Tom Hardy showing off his eye acting talents with his plane mask on, experience gained from his role as Bane no less. But a well done is deserved to Finn Whitehead in his debut film with a real perspective of the disaster.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan proves once again why he is the greatest director of all time, in an explosive cinematic experience. Inception and the Dark Knight will always be his masterpieces, but Dunkirk is a wonderful piece of work. I do strongly recommend an IMAX viewing if possible, or just a cinema experience. 10/10"
"davelacy","10","5","14","20 July 2017"," Dunkirk is Christopher Nolan's greatest film
","It came across that Nolan wanted to put viewers in the same shoes as the soldiers and what many of them would have experienced. So it is exactly that, an experience that you get taken through with multiple perspectives rather than just a quick, simple paint by numbers, narrow perspective story like many films give you.<br/><br/>With the way it's shot and the sound is designed, there is an ever present and intense atmosphere of danger. You don't know where the Germans are or what they have on the way. All you do know is its got to be really bad because hundreds of thousands of British and French are trapped on a beach, trying to find any way they can to escape and survive. They can see England across the water with no where else to go and no way of getting over the channel. <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan often focuses on how the audience engages with the films he makes on a deep psychological level. He's not just about being historically accurate or on the other end of the spectrum throwing explosion after explosion at you. Hes more focused on the ways he can make you feel immersed and relate to the situations. The feeling of drowning, of being trapped in a small space and the fear of the unknown. Right now, I don't think you could possibly get closer to the feeling of how it may have been for the soldiers in Dunkirk when it actually happened."
"MovieGuy_abc123","10","5","14","20 July 2017"," Staggeringly superb, Nolan is unrivalled.
","Nolan has become somewhat of a cinematic genius over the past decade. His ability to see things from a completely different angle and deliver such powerful cinema is unrivalled. ""Dunkirk"" is the next level. No film matches its level of power, emotion, tension, atmosphere or storytelling. <br/><br/>Opting to veer away from the stomach-wrenching brutality of the films only competitor, Saving Private Ryan, ""Dunkirk"" looks to focus more on the story behind the violence. Nolan achieves this with such ease. This gripping tale of struggle, togetherness and bravery is as beautifully written as it is acted. <br/><br/>I cannot fault this work of art."

"ferguson-6","9","6","18","19 July 2017"," Masterpiece triptych
","Greetings again from the darkness. Even for us frequent movie-goers, a truly great film is a rare and emotional experience. Leave it to Christopher Nolan, one of the finest film makers working today, to deliver a World War II masterpiece centered on a remarkable and historic evacuation, rather than one of the epic battles that more directly led to an Allied victory. The result is a spectacular, stunning and relentlessly intense assault on our eyes, ears and emotions  it's a horrific thing of artistic beauty.<br/><br/>Mr. Nolan chooses a triptych approach to tell the May/June 1940 Dunkirk story from three distinctly different perspectives: The Mole, The Sea, and The Air. The Mole (term for protective sea walls) is the ""by land"" segment, and it shows nearly 400,000 soldiers lined up on the beach – nervously waiting to be either rescued or massacred. The Sea puts us not on the deck of the Navy destroyers, but rather alongside the citizen volunteers who answered the call to ferry men off the beach with own pleasure vessels. The Air plops us inside the Spitfire cockpits of two Royal Air Force pilots battling low fuel as they attempt to protect their fellow soldiers below. This 3-part film harmony expertly captures the disorientation of war by shuffling between the three segments, and varying the timelines and sequence of each.<br/><br/>This all happened pretty early in the war, as Winston Churchill had only become Prime Minister a few weeks prior. It should be noted that Mr. Nolan purposefully avoids the usual war room blustery (we see neither Churchill nor Hitler, and there is no mention of the infamous Halt Order) and allows the action to tell the story. Instead, his focus on the (very) young men being sent to battle makes a clear political statement on the absurdity of war. One of ""The Sea"" volunteers (an excellent Mark Rylance) delivers the message when he states it's the old men running the war, so he can't be expected to just sit back as young sons are sent to fight and die.<br/><br/>Despite the epic look, feel and sound of the film and the massive scale of the event, this film is surprisingly at its best in the small moments of heroism and the dogged determination of individuals to survive. Minimal dialogue allows the horrors of war to take center screen. Danger and death are at every turn – bombings, torpedoes, drowning, gunfire, and most any imaginable peril is ever-present. We witness PTSD (shell-shock) in the form of Cillian Murphy's shivering rescued soldier, and are reminded that every young man present will be either dead or scarred for life. No one escapes war unscathed.<br/><br/>The opening sequence finds young Fionn Whitehead and his squad being targeted with gunfire as German leaflets fall from the sky. The leaflets are maps outlining the hopelessness as German forces have them surrounded. The film is meticulously researched and historically based, though the few characters we get to know are fictionalized accounts. The practical effects throughout are breath-taking and much of it was filmed on location at the Dunkirk beach. There will likely be some complaints regarding the scarcity of female characters and those of color, but the technical aspects of the film are beyond reproach – although the French might have preferred their military receive a bit more attention. Hans Zimmer's score is unique and searing as it perfectly captures the intensity of the film. His use of a ticking watch only perpetuates the constant feeling of running out of time. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema and Editor Lee Smith prove why they are among the best at their profession.<br/><br/>Given the spectacle of the action (if possible, see it in IMAX or 70mm), it's remarkable how we still manage to get to know some of the characters. From The Mole segment, Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard and Harry Styles represent the young soldiers, while Kenneth Branagh and James D'Arcy play officers. Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden are piloting the Spitfires, while Mark Rylance, Barry Keoghan, Tom Glynn-Carney, and Cillian Murphy are aboard the rescue yacht. Nolan regular and good luck charm Michael Caine can be recognized as the voice on Air Force radio. There is a 1958 film with the same title, and it stars John Mills and Richard Attenborough. The connection (other than the Dunkirk title) is Sir Attenborough's grandson Will appears in this current film.<br/><br/>The horrors and impact of World War II continue to be an abundant garden – ripe for the picking when it comes to movies. Over the past 70 years there have been numerous approaches to telling part of the story that redefined the world: Judgment at Nuremberg (legal aftermath), Casablanca (romance), I Was a Male War Bride (comedy), Tora! Tora! Tora! and From Here to Eternity (Pearl Harbor), Shoah (documentary), Schindler's List and Son of Saul (holocaust), Downfall (Hitler), The Great Escape (entertainment), Patton (bio), The Pianist (personal), Saving Private Ryan (Normandy), Das Boot (U-boat), The Thin Red Line (Guadalcanal), and Letter From Iwo Jima (two opposing perspectives). Each of these, and many others, have their place in War movie history, and now Christopher Nolan's film belongs among the best."

","Surprising is how many people claim that this movie has good visuals or even transports well the conditions of battle - imo everything just looks wrong, most of the ships and the architecture of the houses at the beach looks way too modern to be authentic to the times around 1940. That such movies are still possible to make without zillions of dollars proof such fine movies like The Book Thief or The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. <br/><br/>Also, where are the tanks, artillery, trucks, and other equipment etc. of the allies!? Everything just looks underachieving, bad, cheap. Compare Saving Private Ryan - you see that this movie is almost a joke, without all those extras standing around I would say it is a movie made by some students of movie-making or one of those projects of those guys who ""reenact"" battles. Alone the landing and fighting on Omaha Beach in Spielberg's epic war movie beat easy a thousand times everything of Dunkirk's boredom. <br/><br/>This movie is everything but epic, and this movie is for certain no example for good movie making, maybe good enough for the fanboys of over-praised Mr. Nolan. For me, Dunkirk is a total fail regarding entertainment, suspense or in telling the ""true"" story of Dunkirk. Also all the techniques like cam, setting etc. are at most just mediocre. Where all the money for producing this movie was spent, I can't imagine, but maybe Karl Lagerfeld or some other fashion designer did the job himself to make all the uniforms with his very own hands. A movie like Enemy at the Gates must have cost at least a billion dollars, of such dimension is the difference in the quality of the production of both movies. <br/><br/>Mr. Nolan did a very good job with Inception, but war movies ain't his business for sure - compared with the mentioned movies and other good to ueber-good movies about WW II Dunkirk is a true work of a dilettante.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan got a rating of 8 from me, compared I can give Dunkirk only a 1. Zero I would give if I only could."
"richard-1787","7","3","7","8 September 2017"," The technique in this movie is astounding. The story, and the history, not so much.
","The most astounding thing in this movie, for me, was the cinematography. It is eye-poppingly riveting, and often very beautiful. From the early scene where we suddenly see the beaches of Dunkirk spread out before us against the brilliant blue of the sea, through many following scenes, the color and the framing of many of the scenes is truly remarkable. The cameraman clearly has a painter's eye.<br/><br/>The action photography is also often remarkable. The filming of the dogfights, with constantly tilting cameras, gave you some idea of what it must have been like to be in those fighter planes.<br/><br/>The various stories - on the pier, in the skies, on the small British pleasure yacht, on the sinking trawler, etc. - were sometimes juxtaposed to great effect, each one heightening the effect of the preceding one.<br/><br/>The music - and use of sound - in the movie was also dead on, heightening the tension over and over.<br/><br/>In short, this movie held me glued to my seat almost from the get-go.<br/><br/>But that did not keep me from seeing the problems.<br/><br/>The first is a matter of taste. Once the tension starts, it almost never lets up. I realize that for some viewers that's a plus. I could have used some variation.<br/><br/>There is, for all intents and purposes, no real acting in this movie, and certainly no character development. An occasional break in the tension to develop the characters to some extent would have made the movie more interesting to me.<br/><br/>My big issue, though, is the way this movie treats history. From the first scene on the beach, where we see the British soldiers lined up waiting to board a ship to evacuate them back to England, this movie is designed to praise the courage and calmness of the British soldier, as well as the heroism of the British civilian who sailed small boats across the Channel to save them. 300,000+ of them, in fact.<br/><br/>What the movie simply ignores is that while Britain evacuated virtually all of its troops from Dunkirk, they did so at the expense of the French, tens of thousands of whom were left on the beaches to be captured by the Germans and spend four years rotting in POW camps in Germany. At the very end, Kenneth Branaugh's character says that he will stay ""to wait for the French,"" but in fact the British did not. Once they got their own troops out, they stopped the mission.<br/><br/>There were also certain situations that were set up just to milk the audience's emotions, such as the blinding and subsequent death of the young man on the yacht. That, to me, was manipulative.<br/><br/>Overall, however, there is much that is impressive in this movie. It is slick, but impressively so. There's no real depth to it - you know nothing about the characters and don't have any feelings for them - and it doesn't raise any real issues to think about. The most moving moment, by far, is moving only because someone else wrote it: Churchill's great speech about how the British will go on fighting. It makes you realize that nothing else in the movie has that sort of verbal power. If you want this story treated with depth, try Mrs. Miniver. That's manipulative as well, but with far more humanity.<br/><br/>I can't imagine watching this on a TV. It needs a big screen with vibrant color and a great sound system. But if you want to be riveted to your seat for two hours in a movie theater, you could do far worse."

If you already know something of the history of Dunkirk, you will take away nothing new and this adds only a modicum of depth to the story from a narrative standpoint."

","Going into Dunkirk, I thought the movie would be the modern Saving Private Ryan due to the rave reviews it had been receiving. However I was pleasantly surprised by the cinematic experience created by Christopher Nolan. The movie, through Nolan's now trademark convoluted timelines, tends to disregard the complexities that particular war movies may create and focuses more on the raw emotions of the actors that tied together with the harrowing visuals makes Dunkirk one to watch in 2017. Also who would have though Harry Styles could actually act. Overall the film is terrific, though those who are more intrigued by dialogue driven movies may not enjoy it as others as the dialogue in this movie is kept to a minimum"

","I'm a big fan of Nolan.

This is unlike the other second world war films, it avoids all the violence and gory. Instead of that its focused on the emotions of the characters. This is a brave approach for a war film and the end result was spectacular.<br/><br/>The cinematography was epic. The aerial shots of spitfires was mindblowingly good. This practical effect is a statement of Nolans brave and amazing visions. The following shots of soldiers put the audience in their shoes. The fear and uncertainty could be felt pouring out of the screen due the amazing work of Hoytema.<br/><br/>And then there was Hans Zimmer. His intense soundtrack just added another layer to the emotions shown on screen. The buildup of an intense sequence or the statement of epicness by the compositions of Zimmer is pivotal to this film.<br/><br/>The acting were great from every single actors, even the 1D guy surprised me!! The fear of the soldiers the honor of the Dawsons and the bravery of the pilots, everything were spectacularly acted by all the actors.<br/><br/>The massive production in the end gave us a war film to remember.

","One of the most important retreats in WW 2 is recreated with the movie Dunkirk. What worked: Big cast, lots of extras, big budgets makes for a believable film. The dialog, characters portrayals are believable. Excellent portrayal of the order and discipline of the British military. A retreating army was not in panic and the a calm orderly public which with pleasure craft saved an army. What did not work: Dunkirk has many macro scenes and characters which creates a plethora of too much information. The viewer is overwhelmed. What makes Dunkirk's filming style confusing is the story flips back and forth from different character and events in time sequences. I am usually good at following complex story lines but Dunkirk had me lost in a few parts. Dunkirk had the potential to be a epic movie, but fizzles out because of poor editing. Six out of ten stars. Could have been like a epic 70's war movie."
"justinwfirestone","8","3","7","7 August 2017"," Intense, taut, and Rylance
","How could Christopher Nolan, a lover of twisted timelines and bender of perceived realities, make a WWII movie interesting? With the evacuation of Dunkirk, he's chosen what would appear to be a straightforward, linear plot. Get from the city to the coast, get from the coast to a boat, and get from the boat to the other side of the English Channel to enjoy the vista that is (are) the White Cliffs of Dover.<br/><br/>His creative touch, and what makes the movie an entertaining thrill, is to follow three interwoven timelines: (i) if by land; (ii) if by sea; and (iii) if by Spitfire. The characters are disposable, much like people in war, yet Mark Rylance proves again his mettle as one of the most under-appreciated actors of our time, and Harry Styles perfunctorily portrays the human version of a turd without too much distraction. Would David Bowie have found a role had he lived long enough? Sting is surely still available, and Phil Collins could always use more screen time.<br/><br/>Dunkirk reminds us that war is hell, some humans are good people, and ultimately nothing really matters unless you get your story printed in the newspapers. What good is the spectacle if no one sees it? That's why movies have advertising budgets, after all.<br/><br/>As for the Hans Zimmer score, which makes overuse of Shepard tones in order to imbue intensity, it's fine. It's bombastic and detracting, and the movie could have done entirely without music without affecting the intensity, urgency, or sense of desperation.<br/><br/>Much like Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan wants you to know he's a great filmmaker, and you can feel it oozing from the screen. Perhaps they could stand to use a little more Rylance in their lives."

","I couldn't agree more with the bulk of these reviews--great movie but lacking emotional grab. I just wanted to add that a recent release is an excellent ""bookend"" to this work: ""Their Finest"" is about Dunkirk, too, but with overwhelming emotional engagement (it's a romance above all else). A marvelous movie about Dunkirk, from the perspective of the British department of propaganda burdened with producing short movies promoting the war. Subtle humor throughout, as well."

I do kinda wish there were different setting instead of the beach and ocean. It felt all repetitive. Only some clips were filmed in a city. and I had wished at the start there was more to it at the front line. other then that the movie grabbed me. it was emotional but not enough to bring a tear to my eye but close.

"rogerdarlington","Null","3","7","5 August 2017"," A masterclass in movie-making
","The last time we saw Dunkirk in a film was in Joe Wright's ""Atonement"" which featured a staggering five and a half minute Steadicam shot of a hell on earth beach scene. Now, thanks to the supreme talents of British director Christopher Nolan, we have an entire film devoted to the miracle of May/June 1940 that enabled some 340,000 British and French soldiers to be rescued by the British Navy and a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 small boats.<br/><br/>Nolan is what film studies call an auteur, someone who stamps an individual style on every work that he produces. In fact, Nolan is a most unusual auteur because his films are commercially successful (most notably his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy). But he often makes his viewers work hard because frequently he likes to use a non-linear narrative (most dramatically in ""Memento"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"").<br/><br/>In this sense, ""Dunkirk"" - which he wrote, produced and directed - is classic Nolan in that there are three story lines: one largely set on land and covering a week, another located mainly at sea and occupying one day, and the third taking place in the air and filling just one hour. The three narratives intersect and finally converge temporally at the end of the film. It is as well for the viewer to know this before seeing the work for the first time and it means that a complete understanding of the time-lines probably requires more than one viewing.<br/><br/>The unusual narrative structure is not the only distinctive feature of ""Dunkirk"". Visually and aurally it is a striking film and I viewed it in IMAX which was a stunning experience. Whether it is the vast expanse of the beach with thousands of soldiers lined up or the claustrophobic bowels of a crammed ship or a close-up of a pilot in his Spitfire fighter aircraft, whether it the whine of bullets or the explosion of bombs or the howl of a Stuka dive-bomber, this is a work which is almost overwhelming. When one factors in the astonishing soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, the movie becomes a heart-pounding experience.<br/><br/>There is a roster of familiar talented actors - notably - Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy (although we barely see his face) - but Nolan deliberately cast young, newcomers to the screen in many of the soldier roles. In many ways, this is a minimalist movie: a simple plot (if complicated time-lines), comparatively little dialogue, very few women characters, no German faces at all - just an unrelenting focus from the opening scene to the closing minutes on that strip of sand and the tens of thousands on it. The end sequences teeter on the edge of jingoism, but overall this is a masterclass in movie-making."
"pyrocitor","6","3","7","30 July 2017"," More Styles than substance
","It's hard to walk into Dunkirk not expecting a masterpiece. After all, it's a gritty, Important, True Story by THE Christopher Nolan, bound to not only redefine the war genre, but obviously say meaningful things about Brexit.* Right? <br/><br/>Sadly, halfway through the ensuing Lord of the Rings length (only two hours? Really? Could've fooled me) deluge of water, fire, yelling, bullets, airplanes, ticking, and the incessant air-raid siren that is Hans Zimmer, it hit me: sheepishly, ashamedly, I was bored - bored! - by Dunkirk. Nolan's objective - I idly ruminated, unfazed by the dreary din of explosions and frowning - is commendable: a war movie that captures the immersive, sensory immediacy of war - disorienting, chaotic, overwhelming, and traumatizing. Unfortunately, his result, more PTSD flashback than film, is such an emotionally hollow sensory overload that the mayhem slides right off. And, evocative or not, this a problem - because war may be many things, but it shouldn't be boring. <br/><br/>Dunkirk's poster calls it an 'event,' and, fittingly, it's more sequence of events than congealing narrative. His characteristic time-toying editing endeavours to graft synchronicity between the Churchillian three prongs of battle (land, air, and sea), and their ensuing subplots. It's a fun conceit, but rendered a bit redundant without a concrete plot or clearly defined, or even discernible characters to anchor to. Instead, we are barraged by furious bursts of combat and sullen pauses in between, which increasingly blur into a nigh-incomprehensible muddle. There are some exceptional set pieces - soldiers frantically stranded under a flaming ocean, or a panorama of rescue vessels creeping over a horizon - but these are the exception rather than the rule in a film chiefly inundated by war tropes already done to death (pardon the fun) - just louder. In the face of such monolithic stimuli, it's a curious experience that a film so noisy and fast-paced can simultaneously feel so plodding and dull. <br/><br/>You can't fault Nolan for attempting such visceral sensory immersion. Still, it leaves one grumbling for the good ol' days when newfangled cinematic trickery existed to support rather than supplant character building and emotionally-driven storytelling. With an overly lyrical title card downplaying the crucial historical scope of the conflict (had the beach been lost, the ENTIRE British army would have been wiped out, drastically affecting the war's outcome), Nolan's nearly wordless humans become tantamount to props - they move in formation, strike poses, and are blown away, with shockingly little emotional impact. Each time a supposedly crucial character met their end, my brain remarked ""Oh no - not...that guy!"" with almost comical saltiness. Nolan is far from immune from cheese, too, and his preciously few sentimental moments are dropped in with the subtlety of a wanton torpedo (amidst such otherwise staunch realism, Tom Hardy's gas-free Spitfire takedown of all assailing Nazi forces is as much of a middle finger to the laws of physics as... Batman out-swimming an atomic bomb's fallout. Hmm). Paint a war as stirringly as you like, but when you don't care about the participants, it's about as engaging and affecting as drifting off during a high school history lecture. <br/><br/>It's a shame, as the film looks and sounds exquisite, being virtually peerless in conjuring the sheer affective maelstrom of a combat scene. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is simply stunning, sweeping from the intimate, claustrophobic sludge of a wayward vessel full of bodies living and dead, to judiciously nodding to Riefenstahl in his long shot aerial panoramas, studying the milling geographic formations of humans on the beach like a neo-cubist ant farm. Similarly, Richard King's sound editing is startlingly visceral, with each crackle of gunfire or seismic explosion piercing with terrifying verisimilitude. With such sparse dialogue, silent film comparisons would be apt, were it not for Hans Zimmer's nails-on-a- chalkboard musical score - an incessant drone of consistently escalating crescendo (music nerds, envision Penderecki's Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima for two hours) so torturous in its intensity it recalls POW interrogation techniques; an almost tacky vying for fight-or-fight adrenal overload. <br/><br/>Nolan's cast are given such short shrift that, even as they do their best with their fleeting coughs of characterization, we're given so little time to let their performances breathe it's a struggle to give much of a sh*t. Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles are the worst affected - each show beleaguered dregs of earnest affability amidst their frowns, but, ensconced by a mass of equally bland nameless grunts, they're ultimately interchangeably expendable long before indiscernibly caked in mud. The quietly heroic Mark Rylance and credibly shellshocked Cillian Murphy cough up terse sparks of a (gasp!) emotionally resonant subplot, but just when gossamer strands of brittle chemistry start to form, whoosh - we're whisked off to the next vague, disorienting firefight. Kenneth Branagh speaks his two trailer stinger lines with customary nobility, though Nolan is either a hysterically brazen troll or distressingly oblivious to again(!) subject a marble-mouthed Tom Hardy to a voice distorting full-face mask. Don't call him Deutschland's Reckoning.<br/><br/>It's a struggle to think of any film as sensorially bludgeoning as Dunkirk - and if all you're after is a cinematic kick to the head, you may find it to be somewhat of a masterpiece. Then again, those seeking a heart-pounding adrenal jolt could just as easily hit up a theme park roller-coaster - sadly, Dunkirk has about as much story to tell, and isn't much more memorable. But surely it's the summer's best war movie? Honestly, Wonder Woman might take the prize (yep - shots fired). Nolan wants to leave us with Churchill's proud words in our ringing ears (thanks, Hans...), but instead, we venture to the Bard: ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" <br/><br/>*I doubt there's any intentional subtext. But it's dour, vaguely conservative, and feebly nationalistic, so you decide. <br/><br/>-6.5/10"

","A different kind of war film. Very little dialogue or character development, it just places you in the middle of the action, in several different locations, in the air, on the Dunkirk beach and on one of the many boats that sailed over there to pick up the 400,000 stranded British soldiers. There was no real 'feel' of there being that many small boats, though it must have been an armada. It's a very sonic film, the subwoofers are really put to test, thundering along in scenes where, it's not really needed. Still, an entertaining, and ultimately, quite moving 1 hr and 46 minutes.

"thompson12001","7","3","7","24 July 2017"," What Could Have Been
","On a technical level Dunkirk is one of the most impressive movies ever made but the ridiculous lack of dialogue makes the movie very unbelievable. Similar to ""Thin Red Line"" in this truly is an art house film unabashedly demonstrating both Malick's and Nolan's auteur, both of them say to hell with actually depicting a realistic war movie. <br/><br/>The editing, cinematography and score all make the movie very intense but as a viewer I couldn't buy the fact that the characters are being fired on in incredibly tense situations and no one is yelling or cursing. I've never witnessed a silent street brawl and I imagine people being dive bombed and fired at during ww2 are going to be yelling more so than someone being punched. The first scene sets the tone and had me skeptical from the getgo. <br/><br/>Nolan says this isn't a war film but that won't stop the ridiculous comparisons to the other great war movies in the film pantheon. I feel this movie was Nolan indulging himself going the silent film route while all the while knowing the studio was going to market this film into relevancy. The high emotional point of the film when English civilians sail to Dunkirk to rescue her majesty's army fell flat since there was no emotional connection to any character in the movie. <br/><br/>A good war flick builds on a camaraderie amongst the characters, this is an important part of any military unit or high intense team sports; in professional sports teams with good chemistry are generally successful for the long term. Dunkirk is a story of escape and retreat but even with that premise some dialogue between the characters to build relationships and depth would've helped. ""Platoon"" effectively demonstrated how devastating a lack of camaraderie is to a military unit, summarizing the issues of the overall US campaign in the Vietnam war through the microcosm of an army platoon on an academy award winning level. For the sake of capricious artistry and box office success Nolan forebears any dialogue and expected foul language during dire situations making this film conveniently rated PG-13. <br/><br/>Despite my complaints I was entertained throughout ""Dunkirk"" and I appreciate the lack of irrelevant love story awkwardly interjected into so many current action movies. But the lack of dialogue between characters is a major flaw and it has to be noted. The critics will have you believe this a best picture nominee but the movie is not sound. Strong movie yes, but lacking a critical component which is the human element in war films that preceded it like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and "" Das Boot""."

","Christopher Nolan, Hans Zimmer, Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh & Cillian Murphy. What else does one need? A 1hr 47min (Nolan's shortest feature film after Following) epic filled with lots of breathtaking moments. It's only the second time that Nolan touches the Non-linear story telling & he does the magic again. Last time was back in 2000 when he gave us Memento. Dunkirk isn't a war Movie. It's more than that. It a story about survival & perseverance. Direction & storytelling at it's peak. There was nothing much Nolan could have done since the history has already been written and it cannot be changed. But what he did with the History of Dunkirk is truly amazing. One will not see any Nazi in the whole movie but still feel their presence. Screen time & dialogues of Hardy & Murphy are not much that one would have hoped for but still they did justice to what they got. Without Zimmer this soon to be a classic would have been impossible. That ""Tick, Tick, Tick,, Tick"" tone set the intense atmosphere, just like he did with Time (Inception) & Docking Theme (Interstellar). Nolan is incomplete without Zimmer."

","A war with no blood is no war. PG-13 makes this look like a cleaned documentary. The characters are rarely questionable in their decisions, even with their lives at risk in every moment: too much heroism and very little moral misery. The film is closer to propaganda than to the real thing. <br/><br/>Besides the obvious disappointment with characters and heroism, I've loved the cinematography, the storytelling, the pace and the oppressive atmosphere created by Nolan. It really makes you feel the clock ticking. Hans Zimmer job with the soundtrack is kind of an environmental sound design rather than actual music. It works, but is far from the thing he gave us in Interstellar.<br/><br/>In short, this is a remarkable film, but not the thing I expected from Nolan. Really enjoyable in terms of immersion but failing in key things like characters and moral decisions"
"Lewis_Heather787","8","3","7","23 July 2017"," A different kind of war film!
","The anticipation for this film was pretty high before going into it, come on its Christopher Nolan directing and writing a war film, who wouldn't be excited for this. Not only directing a true story but Warner bros releasing the film in mid summer takes some guts, however did the film live up to all the hype.<br/><br/>I am pleased to say that this a new type of film for the genre of war, and what a breath of fresh air it is, however it still keeps the same traits that majority of war films have. Nolan has some how made a 12A rated war film that still has the tension and fear as any other 18 or R rated war film. He has really pushed the boat out on the sale and scope of this film as well as telling a really emotional heavy film at heart. The directing in this film is some of Nolan's best to date, the huge wide panning shots of the beach are stunning, especially with the hundreds of extras used, its works perfectly. The flip side of these wide shots are the extremely tight shots in the boats and in the cockpits of the aircraft, a fantastic contrast. His directing perfectly portrays a sense of claustrophobia which is incredibly tense and power especially with the boats sinking after torpedo strikes. The directing in a nut shell is sublime.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has written a film that doesn't have much dialogue or main characters, whilst in most films this would seem as a negative in Dunkirk it is a huge positive. By not having lots of dialogue and lots of scenes without any it amplifies the situation to a new level because the audience is forced to focus on the situation rather that specific characters. It is the first war film I can remember that doesn't focus on a main lead actor with lots of dialogue, and works so well. Instead of being like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or another film on those lines, you don't see an actor playing a solider you just see a solider. There is none of the pretentious inspirational speeches, its showing the grim reality of the situation that everyone finds themselves in and you don't need dialogue to understand what they are feeling. Finally the jumps in time and the method that the story is told works incredibly well and makes us the audience work to keep up and understand without being spoon fed information left right centre, what is going on. Multiple scenes shown through different perspectives throughout the film is really interesting way to tell a story and not conventional for a summer blockbuster, challenging the audience brilliant. <br/><br/>The writing links directly into the casting of this film, and what a brilliantly job they did with casting this film. The reason for not having many big name actors in the film is perfectly, because as mentioned earlier you as the audience are not seeing an actor, your seeing a solider. The casting of the ""unknown"" actors in the film plays as an advantage and they all give brilliant performances that are extremely realistic. The portrayals in the film made by well know actors whether that be Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance , Cillian Murphy or Tom Hardy are all still extremely good, but the fact that there roles a smaller makes you forget about who they are at times during the film. <br/><br/>The editing and score of this film are sublime to say the least, the editing in the spitfire dog fights is impeccable. The fast pace to the editing makes for a really intense ride for the audience and is really compelling, obviously coupled together with the amazing Hans Zimmer score which is out of this world. Whenever there is action in the film the editing and the score work perfectly in harmony and elevate the scenes no end, the tension in the film cause of this is nail biting. <br/><br/>All in all this film is really good however I would say that for Nolan its definitely not his best film that's not to say that its not any good. 85% out of 100 are really interesting take on the war genre that has no gore or overall bloody violence which is really refreshing and worked really well in the context. The directing, writing, acting, editing and score are all at the top of there game, this film was made to be watched on the big screen for the spectacle."
"Serge_Zehnder","8","3","7","20 July 2017"," The Thin Line of Survival
","400'000 British soldiers trapped on a beach in France, and only one way out. The premise is simple, stripped down and could've have turned into an exploitive, melodramatic war-movie, but instead shows us with great skill the bitter truths of battle.<br/><br/>It does take some nerve to conceive and execute a high-profile movie for the summer season, that owes so much more to the films of Terrence Malick, Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky than the world of franchises that we are exposed to of late.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan sticks, literally, to his guns when it comes to taking his commercial clout into the uncharted waters and sands of Dunkirk beach. By refusing to stay with conventional narratives or a single point-of-view he immerses the viewer into a level of emotional turmoil that makes us willing participants and helpless observers at the same time.<br/><br/>Nolan's latest endeavor speaks volumes of his directorial talents, and he puts his often unnamed characters into the impossible world of cruel choices. Tom Hardy, Harry Styles, Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance and Cilian Murphy are familiar faces (Hardy once again spends most of his screen-time behind a mask), but they are merely spokes in the wheel of war, where up means life and down certain death.<br/><br/>The battle and the evacuation of Dunkirk are considered to be some of the Second World War's most disastrous moments for the Allied Forces. Nolan uses the event as a catalyst to show how noble, savage, contradictory and hopeful people remain in the face of death.<br/><br/>Aided and it seems sometimes guided by cameraman Hoyt van Hoytema, production designer Nathan Crowley, editor Lee Smith and composer Hans Zimmer at his most avant- guard, we experience Nolan on top of his game, and during certain sequences as brilliant as never before. And even though certain scenes fall somewhat short and may hinder the general momentum of the film, the overall impression remains strong.<br/><br/>Not least because Nolan leaves us to our own devices. Like the aforementioned filmmakers, who strove to confront and move the audience without merely pandering to their most obvious desires.<br/><br/>After almost twenty years of filmmaking it is fair to say that Nolan belongs into the highest echelons of modern directors. That his choice of material continually eludes easy categorization will add not only to his reputation but to his growth as a storyteller."

"sujanfaster","9","5","15","26 July 2017"," Nolan Dictates. Zimmer Orchestrates.
","When Christopher Nolan makes movies, the bars are always set high. Dunkirk might have a simple plot about survival, but its about how Nolan delivers rather than what he delivers. Dunkirk is based on the rescue of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and other allied soldiers from the French seaport of Dunkirk during the World War 2. However the characters in the movie are not directly correlated to any of the survivors.<br/><br/>Dunkirk could easily pass off as another world war based movie and join the ranks. But what makes Dunkirk standout is a simple story with no subplots (however Nolan has made sure to test our intelligence yet again with the screenplay) with some outstanding cinematography with a breath taking background music score by maestro, Zimmer. Watching Dunkirk in IMAX will almost make you feel like one was in Dunkirk experiencing the horror. The lead characters in the movie barely speak and Nolan lets the situation and surroundings does the talking. The movie looks like it focuses on the lead character played by the newbie Fionn Whitehead but, as the movie goes on other characters become fairly important. There are many main characters in the movie, but Tom Hardy with barely any face expression to portray makes a big impact yet again. Veterans Mark Rylance and Kenneth Branagh have quite interesting roles. Harry Style's acting debut doesn't showcase much of his acting talent but he has done his job.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a very intense and emotional movie. Its almost like a War Musical with Hans Zimmer's brilliant music and sound effects. Watch Dunkirk movie for the cinematic brilliance that is and not for the weekend entertainment."
"roblesar99","10","5","15","22 July 2017"," Nolan's Latest is His Greatest
","Viewed in IMAX 70MM.<br/><br/>Dunkirk arrives with a bang, further solidifying writer-director Christopher Nolan as one of the best filmmakers working today. Nolan presents the tense World War II thriller as a triptych, detailing the evacuation of Dunkirk from the perspectives of land, sea, and air. Perhaps the film's most astounding achievement is that we never see the Germans. The film's focus remains entirely on the evacuating Allied soldiers and those sent to support their efforts. By never showing the Germans on screen, Nolan presents them as a looming specter over the Allied forces, an invisible presence that can surprise them at every turn. This only adds another level of tension to a film that manages to sustain a taut, uneasy atmosphere for nearly its entire runtime. Nolan's main concern lies with answering the question of whether or not these soldiers will manage to escape. As such, we never once are transported to a war room to watch military leaders quarrel about what the next move should be. Instead, we follow three distinct groups: soldiers that include newcomer Fionn Whitehead's Tommy, a couple of RAF pilots led by Tom Hardy's Farrier, and a small boat crew led by Mark Rylance's Mr. Dawson.<br/><br/>I got the opportunity to see Dunkirk in IMAX 70mm and I only wish more people could as well. The enormous screen and earth-rattling sound place you right in the center of the action to potent effect. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema again teams up with Nolan after previously collaborating on Interstellar to awe-inspiring results. Around 90% of the film makes full usage of the towering screen, with only a few sequences presented in a more traditional letterboxed style. Nolan and Hoytema use the larger frame to their advantage, crafting spell- binding shots at every junction, whether it be a close-up shot of a pilot's face or the sweeping image of thousands of soldiers waiting on a beach. Dunkirk demands to be seen on the largest screen possible.<br/><br/>The film also marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and composer Hans Zimmer. The explosive, ever-present score from Zimmer serves as the model accompaniment for the film, the stirring urgency of the music matched effortlessly with the harrowing images of war and escape. Another Oscar nomination for Zimmer would not be a surprise. But the way that the score mixes with the sounds of the battlefield is an achievement in its own right. Explosions boom and gunshots ring, fighter planes and bullets whizzing by. But through all the chaos, all the madness, Zimmer's score serves as a ticking stopwatch, counting down the minutes as the palpable threat from the Germans grows.<br/><br/>Despite the relative simplicity of its storyline, Dunkirk is perhaps Nolan's most experimental feature. His three stages of war all unfold over various time frames, which are interwoven by Lee Smith's masterful editing, creating a non-linear narrative that astounds with both its sweeping scope and intimate, poignant emotional beats. The sparse use of dialogue also stands out. Nolan revels in visual storytelling, employing dialogue only when necessary, with the soldiers communicating their fears through their actions rather than through conversation. Admittedly, the characters that populate the world of Dunkirk are not the most developed, but they are all defined by their desire to make it back home. They are all tethered by this longing, and we can feel their mutual trepidation and hope as they struggle to find a way out of Dunkirk.<br/><br/>Unconventionally, the majority of the soldiers of Nolan's film are not heroic figures, especially those on land. The event that Nolan uses as the basis for his film is historic not because it marked a major victory for Allied forces, but because the British suffered an ignominious rout. As such, some of these men are terrified for their lives, while others, knowing very well that any moment could be their last, subsist solely on their love of country. Every actor across the board, from established British stars like Kenneth Branagh to newcomers like Whitehead expertly bring their characters to life. Whitehead and Harry Styles both deliver great performances as two inexperienced soldiers determined to survive. Meanwhile, in the air, Hardy simply dominates the screen, his steely gaze working wonders as a substitute for conventional dialogue. The film's best performance belongs to the magnificently understated Rylance, who delivers a heroic performance as a sailor who navigates his yacht towards Dunkirk to save lives, despite the danger that awaits.<br/><br/>This danger manifests itself in a manifold of ways. A soldier stranded at sea remarks that he is the lone survivor of a U-boat attack. Farrier and his fellow pilots engage German fighters over the Channel. In a haunting opening sequence, Tommy runs desperately through the streets of Dunkirk, evading enemy fire. The film's action sequences benefit from Nolan's skillful direction, and the aerial dogfights, in particular, stand out amongst the rest. Hoytema's camera captures the proceedings with such precision that it puts the action in most Hollywood blockbusters to shame. While his camera hardly ever lingers on the carnage of war, Hoytema knows when to draw out the tension, creating sequences that left me breathless.<br/><br/>With his latest, Nolan delivers another masterpiece that might just be his best film yet. It works as a demonstration of bravery, a celebration of courage, and an acknowledgment of fear in the face of adversity. While not my favorite Nolan flick , Dunkirk delivers a cinematic experience unlike anything I've ever seen. The way Nolan so adeptly sustains the tension throughout is simply mesmerizing and a testament to his directorial prowess. Packed with stunning IMAX camera-work from Hoytema, some of Zimmer's best work to date, a talented cast giving it their all, and an underlying message that underscores the need for hope, Dunkirk is a rousing spectacle from a director at the top of his game, and the best film of 2017 thus far.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10 (Masterpiece)"

This movie directed by the spectacular Christopher Nolan brings the infamous evacuation of the French town during World War II to the big screen, and OH MAN does it deliver. The film is told from three different perspectives, The Mole (Land), The Sea, and The Air. Each perspective is successful in telling their respective story during the evacuation.<br/><br/>The Mole - is told from the perspective of Tommy, a young private in the British Army, who is trying to get out of Dunkirk alive and well. He is played by newcomer Fionn Whitehead, who brings a sense of fear and bravery to the role. He plays the role very very well for a newcomer, and I would assume has a bright future in the industry. Of course, he is joined by Harry Styles, and while I was annoyed by his casting at first, he actually fits in with the rest of the cast and I looked at him as Alex, and not Harry Styles in a war film. This perspective is where most of the danger looms, and Nolan delivers the intensity and fear that many soldiers were feeling on that beach.<br/><br/>The Sea - is told from a British civilian named Mr. Dawson, and his son Peter. They feel they are doing the right thing by sailing to Dunkirk to aid the soldiers still trapped on the beach. Mr. Dawson is played incredibly by Mark Rylance, who I can easily see another Oscar nomination ready for him due to this film. They are also joined by Cillian Murphy, who portrays a shell shocked soldier who's boat was destroyed by a German sub. He plays the role incredibly.<br/><br/>The Air - Tom Hardy is the star of this perspective, playing the hero in one of the British war planes keeping the Germans at bay while the British and French get as many of their men off the beach as they can. We're all so used to seeing Hardy playing the villain but its nice to finally cheer the man on as he defends the British with all hes got. Very intense dogfighting scenes from here. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a masterpiece of the war genre. Expertly crafted by Nolan, he excels in creating a sense of urgency and fear in every scene. This films soundtrack is outstanding, as well as its cinematography, and acting. The movie does not have much dialogue, but it doesn't matter as the scenery speaks for itself. I see many Oscar nominations for this movie in 2018, and for good reason. See it as soon as you can, you will not regret it. <br/><br/>10/10"
"vibhutius","10","5","15","21 July 2017"," A new benchmark
","Spoiler Alert only for those who skipped history classes in school.<br/><br/>""The miracle of Dunkirk"" was the biggest cliffhanger of the bloodiest war in history. Allied troops exceeding 300,000 were frantically rescued from looming obliteration as the enemy approached them from three sides with sea on the fourth.<br/><br/>However, Dunkirk (2017) is not just another epic on warfare history. It is a psychological thriller on its own. Speaking of outcomes, where most movies bring up victory or defeat, it hits the most profound of all human instincts. It screams ""survival"".<br/><br/>Nolan has splendidly interleaved three stories on different timelines into a linear array of nerve- racking tension and bite-the-back-of-your-hand stunning visuals. With one of the most realistic sound designs ever put on any movie, the movie immerses the viewer deep into heart-pounding intensity ranging from claustrophobic spaces inside sinking ships, deafening shell explosions on the beach spraying sand and blood, and most significantly the defiant engine roar of the Spitfire fighter engaging in battle with Messerschmitt's in eye-watering (due to not blinking) dogfight sequences.<br/><br/>Contrary to the norm, the movie doesn't focus considerably on the characters. Weirdly, this this turns out as one of the movie's greatest assets as the director explores the tension concerning survival as an individual and as a group against death and monstrosity. The theme circles around every helpless soldier's desire to see home again, to be able to defend it and most importantly be able to muster courage to look into the eyes of their own countrymen.<br/><br/>Performances have been noteworthy but they have contributed to the plot rather than outshining it. Full marks to immaculate directorship.<br/><br/>Throughout the run-time faces of the adversaries aren't shown at all; particularizing that death is more fearful when it comes slow and unseen.<br/><br/>Dunkirk (2017) is a masterpiece on every technical perspective and is the most mature work of Nolan till date. It will keep haunting the viewer many hours after viewing.<br/><br/>Watching it in IMAX format is much more rewarding and has been the greatest cinematic experience of my life.<br/><br/>(5/5)"

","This is one of the most compelling and exiting """"""""""""""""""""""war films"""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ever. people are complaining about it being a dissapointing film because they thought it would be like hacksaw ridge or saving private ryan. this on the other hand this isnt a war film its a survival film."
"barbagvido","10","4","11","31 August 2017"," And I thought Split was the most intense film of the year...
","Dunkirk is the 10th movie of one of the best directors of the generation, Christopher Nolan. That alone was a reason to get hyped about it. It's about a real life event in WW2, the Dunkirk evacuation. No character backgrounds, no specific interactions, just that event alone from three perspectives, the dock (one week), the sea (one day) and the air (one hour). And they are all shown in parallel.<br/><br/>There is barely a character with at least some background, but still, Nolan somehow manages to create such intensity and anxiety, you will spend 100 minutes at the edge of your seat, barely breathing. One of the concern about a film was its PG-13 rating, but it doesn't even need it. It doesn't take only blood and gore to express the horrors of war. It can help, yes, but Nolan didn't need it. The performances were very good too. I was a bit skeptical about the casting of Harry Styles, but he gave one of the best performances in the movie. And there is also one more thing that helped build the anxiety, and that's Hans Zimmer's score. Of course, I expected no less from Hans Zimmer, but once again, he surprises with the always present clock-ticking noise that increases the sense of urgency. And when all that anxiety is over, it gives us some beautiful moments for the very end.<br/><br/>With no blood and no character development, this incredibly shot film will keep you on the edge. Definitely worth a watch. My favorite movie of the year so far."

","Dunkirk. It was raining so there was no golf and what do two elderly chaps and a vibrant youth do? They go to the movies!<br/><br/>Dunkirk goes alright too.<br/><br/>WWII actually started well before the Americans got involved and this is the story of a bit of the bit before they did. In fact there are no Americans in the movie so there is an absence of rock-jawed selfless heroism. Rather, there is stoicism from men and boys in cardigans and cheery nurses who serve tea to survivors. <br/><br/>The Germans are still very cross about the way they were dealt with after WWI. They are very well led and as a result they have cornered some 400,000 British, French and Belgians at Dunkirk. The French are fighting a rearguard action to keep the Germans at bay. It's going badly. They are surrounded on a beach at Dunkirk. There are a lot of them. About 400,000 troops. On a beach. Being bombed. And if they DO get off the beach they are bombed and torpedoed. So things are bleak. Churchill has said that they can evacuate, maybe, 30,000.<br/><br/>The movie is about the evacuation and it really happened.<br/><br/>Life on the beach is uncertain. They are being bombed and machine gunned and JU87's are largely unchallenged and if that's what they actually sounded like I now have a small idea of why they were so terrifying and I was watching a movie and not being bombed. There are a few RAF fighters in the air but a lot are held back because it seems likely that they will be needed later. In any case they don't have much fuel and can only stay for a little while before they have to fly home. They have some successes, but there are costs. <br/><br/>One soldier who has had enough of being on the beach strips off and walks into the water and attempts to swim home. There was a special poignancy about this.<br/><br/>Ships are sent to rescue the isolated troops and there is only one jetty (called 'the Mole') so evacuation is slow. It also means that the ships are all in one place and are pretty easy to bomb. Or torpedoed.<br/><br/>The Royal Navy decides to commandeer anything that can float and is able to get close enough to a beach to be clambered aboard by the troops on the beach. There are fishing boats, leisure cruisers and yachts all manned by the sort of people who you would imagine might own this sort of boat. About 700 of these small craft take part, and the movie is really about them. It was all I could do not to stand and cheer when they appear out of the mist. I have actually been to a place on the Thames where some of them departed<br/><br/>The soldiers and their unlikely rescuers are bombed and torpedoed and shot. Everyone tries very hard not to be the subject of a telegram or a glowing article in a local paper. There are cups of tea and these are strangely reassuring.<br/><br/>There are submarines too, but their presence is known only by the results.<br/><br/>The overall effect is the first 20 Minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' going for about 90 minutes. There is no chest-beating heroism. No bravado. No speeches from the dying. Sometimes people just do whatever they can to simply survive. Sometimes they are selfless with an almost understated courage and do things that are unexpected. <br/><br/>But mostly it's about 700 little boats manned by normal people, men and boys in cardigans, sailing across the English Channel and back to save people <br/><br/>About 340,000 British, French and Belgian troops were rescued, mainly by little private boats. This is a very good result. However it does mean that 1 in 10 were killed or captured"

","DUNKIRK - a mini-review 8 out of 10 Albert stars This movie is extremely gripping and powerful. I enjoyed it, despite the loss of life it depicts. The film tells the basic story of the Brits in Dunkirk, who were trapped by the Nazis in France. They came under steady aerial bombardment. For more basics and background, see IMDb.com I saw it in IMAX, which I understand is THE way to go with this high visual impact film. Before writing this mini review, I decided to let my thoughts ""marinate."" Now they are ready to serve: If you are thinking of seeing it, here are some things to consider: * It is violent. So is war, right? If you don't tolerate violence -- even if in historical context -- don't see it. The violence is not extreme, by the way. Someone I was with spent 3/4 of the movie looking away from the screen. * It is loud, extremely so. * The aerial combat scenes were filmed with authentic period planes, and some are intentionally crashed to make the movie. The dogfight scenes are intense and amazing. Some questions I had are these: 1. Why was no historical background given? It is bewildering to wonder how the Brits could have been stranded in such a predicament. In later discussions, people have told me that Hitler hesitated to attack because he felt the Brits were fellow Aryans. 2. How could British intelligence have been so bad that they did not know the Nazi Panzer tank divisions would advance rapidly and trap their soldiers? 3. Why were they sent into harm's way without air support, heavy artillery, tanks, etc.? I also feel that the Nazis, although the Lear villains, were also human beings, Why not understand their individual psychologies, doubts, and deaths? War is a form of murder. Let's get to know at least ONE example of who we are so happy to be murdering. So that's it for minor objections and questions. A superb film!"
"tavm","6","4","11","2 August 2017"," Dunkirk managed to keep me up during its runtime but not enough for me to completely understand it
","After seeing this on IMAX with my movie-theatre working friend and reading many comments on Facebook of which many of them expressed confusion of what was going on in the movie, I have to admit I had the same feeling while watching it with my just-mentioned friend. I also fell asleep at parts of the film though the loud sound effects kept me from staying asleep during most of it. In summary, there were some exciting scenes but I didn't get the characterizations that were depicted as clearly as I would have liked. So that's a partial recommendation for Dunkirk."

","Hi. If you are reading this please, note that i actually watched the entire movie, and i don't usually come here to vote badly for a movie, but this one deserves this review more than ever. I went for this film, expecting a great movie rated at least an 8. I got out of the cinema wondering if this was truly a movie from the same director of works like Batman, Origin and Interestellar, and not some kind of joke. This movies lacks in explaning basically everything, if you don't know about what happened in Dunkirk you will still not know anything about it. None of the characters leave you with the feeling of emotional compelling, they are left empty like if they didn't care at all. In summary this movie is empty, vain, useless, it does not make you imagine or think nor does it teach you anything new, it's a dull movie. I felt like an insult. Not only it did not attend my expectations but it also went downhill, and it's probably one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my entire life. It's slow paced, boring, tedious, and it feels like an unnecessary work. I felt bad watching this movie and left the cinema with a feeling of emptiness and boredon."
"archanavr","8","4","11","28 July 2017"," A visual master piece
","Nolan is famous for his non linear way of story telling. Dunkirk also is a big example. Different characters different timings all making sense only in the end. But one thing that stands out in Dunkirk is its technical aspects. May it be the shots or the sound or even the actors, everything has got that Nolan touch. But when compared to Interstellar or even in Dark Knight rises, we have seen so many WOW moments. Dunkirk comparatively have less moments like that. But i have to say the shots are like real WOW. Talking about the story, Nolan succeeded in showing us the real aspects of war like hunger and human emotions but still it lacks a strong base, at times we are confused and at times we are heartbroken. I can only rate the movie 8 because my mind was always full of the scenes from Platoon and Casualties of war and trust me Dunkirk is nothing like that.It surely proves the capability of Nolan on making a good visual effects movie but not that great storyline.A good movie should make us question ourselves about how and why this and that happened, Dunkirk doesn't make us think so. I can only say this is a good movie but not that great."

"mb1456","9","4","11","26 July 2017"," Beautiful Movie on the Dunkirk Evacuation
","At first, I thought Dunkirk was yet another war movie based on World War II. After I watched the movie, I learnt it's the story of the Dunkirk evacuation(captured beautifully)..about many heroes who saved the lives of those near them. And the heroes of that evacuation were not just the army, navy or the air force but innocent civilians too. What I especially liked is how the tragedy or horrors of war is effectively portrayed without the need for explicit violent scenes or display of blood. It was also quite a marvel to see the confrontation scenes between the Allied Spitfire planes and that of the enemy Heinkels. The performances were equally very good, the direction & cinematography were excellent and the music was apt too. There were big actors in the cast like Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy etc but you don't feel the weight of their stardom here as they & other actors were like tiny cogs who did their bit to move a beautiful wheel around. The best thing about the movie is the movie itself. Maybe there were a few cinematic liberties taken but it doesn't matter. It is a part of history that's important to know and I'm glad Christopher Nolan and his team brought that to the screen. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>P.S. Saw this movie thrice in theatre already and still find it an inspiration."
"mgumsley","10","4","11","26 July 2017"," Survival! Survival! Survival!
","We all knew that Dunkirk was going to be a huge, sprawling epic, in every sense of the word - something that is the lifeblood of the modern cinema. I also sensed we were going to see an ensemble cast showing the audience small, but important pieces of the action at Dunkirk. And that is precisely what Dunkirk is all about. However, one factor looms larger than all the hopes for character development and structure within the basic storyline of the mass evacuation of allied soldiers from Dunkirk in the face of resistance from the German Army. That factor is the need for survival, survival of the huge amount of men trapped on a beach in Dunkirk. I suspect that the survival instinct at its most basic is something that modern man rarely experiences, so we are at the mercy of the Director, Christopher Nolan, who has to make us feel it. I think he succeeds rather well. He has to impress upon us the huge dangers these men felt for every minute of what definitely must have felt like a 24 hour day. What does survival require? Animal instincts surely come to the fore, we saw that in the instance of Cillian Murphy's war shocked soldier, whose cowardice threatens the lives of those around him, in the opportunism of the two young soldiers who cheat their way back onto the ship that potentially offered them the chance of freedom, only to see it bombed to nothing by the Lutwaffe. The technical aspects of the film are excellent. The attention to detail, the prevailing atmosphere of surreal unreality, the stark visual battle sequences, are all excellent. I was totally immersed in this film, as I am sure others are when they see it. Outside the cinema, groups of people stood discussing it. My scriptwriting tutor used to call it ""instant success"". This film is an instant success, and I feel it could become a cinema classic. Mary Gumsley"
"paragrai44","9","4","11","26 July 2017"," An Intense Drama ""DUN"" brilliantly by Mr. Nolan.
","I'll keep the review as short as possible. First of all WELL DUN Mr. Nolan. Thank You for the epic display of camera work and smoothest cinematography after a long time. If you're expecting a war-war like movie experience, you will be disappointed just like my few colleagues felt. The CGI experience and the camera work ( taken from the plane point of view) were really eye catching. The intensity was amazing and was the back ground score by Mr.Zimmer (the clock ticking) made it reach to a next level of experience. The silence which is due to fear or grief was so well displayed that one can actually feel the intensity that every soldier would have felt to go home. Less of dialogues and more of a punch and crunch situations during the evacuation was captured, blended and picturized that one could start tapping their feet. The movie displayed the nature of a human being of finding the best possible way to survive even though you have to let your own people bleed. With being selfish nature shown, the strongest character of a human being of being patient and ready to take the routes available to save as many lives was shown. The back and forth picturization of the story from different angel was the icing on the cake.Though i was so glued watching the movie, may be the story could have kept a bit long would have been best. what i feel go for it but not considering the actual war thing in your mind, rather go with a mindset of a more intense rescue mission displayed and brilliant work behind the cameras and the long distance shorts taken. for me for the direction and cinematography , the DUNKIRK should be the clear WINNER."
"robertscody","9","4","11","25 July 2017"," Overall, an awe inspiring and unique war story that doesn't focus on the grit.
","The Good: It gives a great sense of suspension with the constant and random air, land, and sea attacks hitting you hard with the impression of being surrounded. I recommend seeing it in theaters for the audio quality of sound that the air raids give off; it really strikes the fear into you when you hear the sirens of Stukas coming for you. I had some doubts of having Harry Styles being in a war film, but, I realized his presence adds to the environment making his fans wonder if he is going to get killed or not. The historical immersion is is prominent with to date uniforms and weapons. You'll hear constant references to the units such as Grenadiers or Highlanders which to me is a definite bonus to my immersion with the story. The characters portrayed may not be real ,however the stories that are told are a combination of facts condensed (like Band Of Brothers or The Pacific). The story telling is unique as it sets up a time line from each character's perspective to culminate into the big picture. The focus is not on the usual grit and gore, its about telling the story of what happened. The approach is also unique in the aspect that they talk as little as possible. This helps the movie by making it more of an experience, visually seeing what is going on and sometimes guessing what the characters are doing. <br/><br/>The Bad:It's a British based film, there are going to be parts where some Americans do not understand the lingo or slang such as ""lorries"" or ""petrol"" and some people might not understand the geography like when one of the pilots asks about Calais. You do not get a grip much on who is who. The pilots are always masked and the minimalist approach on talking slightly holds it back. You just see this or that guy, not Alex or Tommy.<br/><br/>Overall,I think it is a step above the trash of heroic blood and guts war movies. It makes it's stand on the struggles of the many rather than the few. Go see it in theaters it is worth the ticket."

The whole movie was practically one scene being played over and over again<br/><br/>However, my biggest gripe about this movie is the fact that I could not understand 1/2 of what the actors were saying because of their British accents.

"dtphoenix","10","4","11","23 July 2017"," Dunkirk - Chillingly Real
","I rarely write reviews, but had to after seeing this movie. Unlike so many other 'historical' movies there are no fictitious characters, love stories or drawn out introductions - the movies characters (whose names you barely know) simply lead you through the terrifying events as they took place.<br/><br/>Not since the 1970 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' has there been such a good movie at showing an event in such historic accuracy without having to resort to other gimmicks. The special effects, the music and the events themselves kept me enthralled with chills often crawling up my spine.<br/><br/>The young British soldier who so clearly just wants out, but who is also clearly no coward - carries you from the beach almost to the safely of a hospital ship (where you find yourself surprised to see female Red Cross nurses and workers) which sinks, then to another ship (this time a larger war ship) which also sinks with him now in a closed compartment that floods, back on the beach, finally in the oil filled water again to be mercifully rescued by one of the small boats from the fleet of civilian ships who arrive to help.<br/><br/>I had long ago read of the massive fleet of fishing boats, pleasure yachts, cargo boats, ferries (basically anything that would float) that finally carried out the rescue of more than 300,000 men, but until you see them arrive from the perspective of the waiting and condemned men the story does not have the same meaning. They were salvation, not just for those men on the beach, but also for their country that needed their army to fight on.<br/><br/>And I had always wondered where was their air cover? The movie reveals that many of their planes were held back, but that those sent over played a valiant role in making it possible for the small boat flotilla to carryout their rescue. With pilots willing to stay until it was too late to turn back, trying to stop at least one last bomber or fighter from hitting their targets.<br/><br/>If you are looking for love stories or detailed character stories this movie is probably not for you. But if you are looking for a honest, accurate and chilling look at what really happened and you enjoy being carried through a movie by the action and music then this is the movie for you and I encourage you to see it."
"mertkece","10","4","11","23 July 2017"," Nolan's Masterpiece
","To call Dunkirk an epic is both an understatement and a disservice. Never does the constant tension or sheer scale of Nolan's vision hinder the intimacy between the viewer and the film, creating a personal experience rarely found in films of this scope. Dunkirk retells the famous Dunkirk Evacuation from three unique perspectives, through the eyes of those on land, air and sea. Due in part to Nolan's ambitious approach to storytelling — as well as his attention to detail in all aspects of the film-making process — Dunkirk stands as Nolan's most accomplished film yet.<br/><br/>In contrast to previous works, Nolan opts to keep the core story of Dunkirk simple and faithful. Where he applies his ambitious ideas is in the films structure. Dunkirk follows three separate view points within their own unique timelines. These are the fighter planes in the air, the civilian boats at sea and the men trapped on the beaches, set over one hour, one day and one week respectively. While on paper this may sound like Nolan over intellectualising this simple premise, upon viewing, these timelines seamlessly converge at the climax of the film — something that is a spectacle in itself to witness. This structure, however, serves a greater narrative purpose. It allows the viewer to see the same events from a new perspective later in the film. By allowing the viewer to witness these moments from different view points, it allows for a greater understanding of how the various characters are being affected by what is happening. An example of this can be seen when Tom Hardy watches his fellow pilot making an emergency sea landing only to shift to the perspective of the civilian boats tracking this dog fight from below, unsure of whether the pilot has survived and is in need of rescue.<br/><br/>In deep contrast to this bold, complex structure is the movie's sparse dialogue. Very often, Dunkirk is akin to war films of the silent era. Instead of leaning heavily on dialogue to both progress the story and give insight into the characters, Nolan chooses to convey plot points visually. The visual story telling on display here is impressive. You learn to care about these characters not through what you are told about them but through what you see them do. It is how they choose to act in situations which teaches what kind of person they are. It is what you see them experience which makes you care for their survival. It is amazing how moving Dunkirk is in spite of Nolan choosing to have several characters instead of one focal. It emphasises the reality that Dunkirk was the culmination of the actions of many.<br/><br/>This visual storytelling is bolstered by the outstanding ensemble cast. You have newcomers Fionn Whitehead, Harry Styles and Tom Glynn-Carney matching the performances of the established cast members like Tom Hardy and Mark Rylance. A lot of the film relies on the expressions you see painted on these characters faces as the film unfolds. When you see terror in their expression you feel their fear. When you see hope light up a man's face, you feel it yourself. A particular scene that really emphasised this is when Tom Hardy is trying to decide what his next move will be. All you need to know is in the eyes. As the viewer watches Hardy's eyes, they know everything that is racing through his characters mind without a single word being uttered. This is a great example of how Nolan uses expression to invoke empathy, instead of resorting to contrived backstory. Nolan also utilises expression to more creatively depict unfolding events. There is a scene where instead of simply showing an enemy plane suddenly flying towards the beach, the camera remains fixed on Kenneth Branagh's expression as it changes from relief to terror. This shot paired with the sound of an aircraft engine approaching makes for a far more effective way of conveying impending peril. Filming the moment like this instead of simply showing the enemy plane humanises this moment since you witness how the situation affects those on the beach directly. <br/><br/>Nolan does not rely only on sight, instead utilising other senses to immerse the viewer, most significantly through his use of sound. This comes in the form of excellent sound design along side audio cues to further illustrate unfolding events. You feel the sound impact on your body every time bullets are fired and bombs are dropped. The sound feels so real that you never feel at ease with what you are hearing, with the hundredth bullet being just as shocking as the first. In contrast, there are moments of undisturbed silence just waiting to be shattered by another bullet. It is disparities like these which maintain the films unbroken sense of suspense, even when fighting appears to have momentarily ceased.<br/><br/>There is still so much that could be said about this film from its great use of practical effects over CGI to the breathtaking dogfight scenes. It is very difficult to criticise any aspect of Dunkirk. At 106 minutes, the film feels the perfect length. Not a single frame is wasted in telling the story. Viewers are left on the edge of their seat from the first frame to the last. Dunkirk perfectly conveys the trauma of war without ever glorifying it, instead telling a very human story about courage and unity, triumphing against impending doom. The directors decision to break the conventional storytelling structure of films creates a more authentic realisation of Dunkirk whilst maintaining a strong emotional connection. Dunkirk constantly reminds us that actions speak louder than words. Every aspect of this movie comes together so perfectly that Dunkirk is not only one of the greatest war films of all time but one of the greatest films of modern cinema.<br/><br/>This is Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus."
"Thekeybaldemasterrises","10","4","11","23 July 2017"," A jarring spectacle about human survival. Nolan delivers once again. IMAX viewers beware
","If you're a fan of Christopher Nolan what more do you need to know? The man is a great director and he knows how to shoot a movie. Dunkirk is definitely one of his most experimental films in years and I just loved it. He crafted a different kind of war movie that doesn't so much focus on the combat aspect or gore of war, but rather the fear and isolation one feels in these awful situations. It's claustrophobic, it's uncomfortable and the use of IMAX cameras immerse you into the film unlike anything I've seen in years. That can be a huge factor in deciding whether or not you see the movie especially in IMAX. One of my fellow viewers was disturbed by the sound effects alone that she couldn't get through the whole thing. She was freaked out by how loud and real the gunfire sounded. It will make you feel anxious and unsafe so you have to know what your limits are watching war films. There's not even any blood and gore it's just loud, suspenseful, and non stop claustrophobic scenes the entire movie. Everything is done as practical and real as it can possibly be, and I never thought it looked fake. From the scenes involving water or dog fights it was all very authentic. We have many other films that show how brutal the combat was in WW2 like Saving Private Ryan, but that wasn't the point here. You don't focus on specific characters as this is a story about survival and just humanity in the darkest of times. There's actually little to no dialogue as the movie is carried by it's spectacle and Hanz Zimmer's music which is outstanding once again. One thing I appreciated about the film was showing how these men on the beach were all young and inexperienced. It's brutally honest about how the mentality was every man for himself. Reviews are saying it's odd for Nolan to portray soldiers from his country in such a negative way, but I've talked to many friends who have WW2 vets in their families and they said that's completely accurate especially in a movie like this. Dunkirk was one of the biggest miracles in Britain's military history and some say it was a game changer in the war for we never would have helped them conquer the evil if Britain had surrendered. Everything used here was effective and for that, it's so far my favorite movie of 2017."
"ahsanahd","6","4","11","22 July 2017"," A Failed Experiment
","This latest Christopher Nolan film is about the evacuation of soldiers stuck at Dunkirk in second world war. Usually Nolan films contain deep and complicated story structures but this time he is telling you a straight story about survival. As an audience, what you expect from a war film in modern era since we have seen so many great war based films before is a certain level of freshness in story or in it's presentation. As a clever auteur that he is, Nolan knows that he is responsible for this. So what he tried to do here is that he made a war movie and immerse the audience in this experience.But the verdict is, it still fails bring something new. The non linear presentation is the major drawback for the lack of focus which results in the failure of such an immersive experience. Its shame that the whole film feels repetitive and unfocused since the opening scenes with less dialogue and more action was promising. Film starts its decline with a side story in a boat with a stranded soldier and the boat owners. And then it never recovers.<br/><br/>Recommended watch instead of Dunkirk: Son of Saul"
"fredschaefer-406-623204","9","4","11","22 July 2017"," Nolan most stunning piece of work yet.
","I am a great fan of war movies, from BRIDGE ON THE RIVE KWAI to THE DIRTY DOZEN to PATTON to APOCALYPSE NOW to FULL METAL JACKET; they rate high on my list of all time favorites. Now, I can add one more to the list, Christopher Nolan's DUNKIRK. It is a modern epic that tells a story of heroism and sacrifice 75 in the past that puts the viewer on an intimate level with the participants, making one truly feel as if we are right there on the beach, on the sea, and in the air.<br/><br/>More than that, DUNKIRK is a truly marvelous piece of film making; it is pure cinema, where music, sound effects, staging, cinematography and acting (wordless in many scenes) all come together to make a near perfect whole. It is storytelling basic and simple, there is no contrived plot or melodrama, for none is necessary, history has given Nolan all he needed and he makes the most of it, and then some. The story unfolds in a non linear fashion, as we follow three separate groups of characters: soldiers on the beach, desperate to escape the approaching Germans and get back to England; a small boat captain, his son, and a teen age friend who take off from a port in Britain to help rescue the stranded soldiers: and a pair of fighter pilots high in the sky over them all, whose job it is to hold back the German bombers from strafing the beaches with machine gun fire and sinking the naval destroyers attempting to evacuate the British army. One story takes place over a week, another over a day, while another over a single hour, as the movie cuts back and forth between each one. When I first read about this ""non linear"" storytelling, I was a little apprehensive, thinking that Nolan was trying something artsy when just plain straight forward would do just as well. My fears were utterly groundless, as all three stories come together at the end; I should have trusted in Nolan all along, for his directing master's touch pulls it off.<br/><br/>I must also commend Nolan for trusting the audience to know something about history before they go to the theater; there is only one bit of dialogue that can be described as exposition. We do not get a recount of the German blitz or the collapse of the French and Belgium armies that resulted in the British being forced to retreat until its back was against the English Channel, neither Hitler nor Churchill appear, their name hardly mentioned. In the first scene, we are thrown right into the action when we meet a squad of retreating soldiers, from their beaten manner, we don't have to see the battle they have just been through. We know it has been horrible from their body language alone.<br/><br/>The acting, by Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Fionn Whitehead, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, and Harry Styles is exceptional, as they have to do most of it not with the delivery of dialogue, but with facial expressions, especially the eyes, through which they express their fear and worry. A couple of performances are nearly wordless, especially in the case of Aneurin Bernard as Gibson; ultimately we learn the heart breaking reason why he does not speak. Also unforgettable is Barry Keoghan, as George, the boy who goes along with Rylance's small boat captain because he wants to do something memorable.<br/><br/>The real star of the movie is Hans Zimmer's musical score, which perfectly punctuates the action on the screen. Nolan himself wrote the screenplay, a masterpiece of building tension until it becomes nearly unbearable. He throws his characters into one desperate situation after another, as they struggle to survive; more than that, Nolan truly captures the terror of a world where death is all around and can claim anyone at any moment, a place where carnage is a constant. Where a torpedo can send a destroyer filled with rescued soldiers drinking warm tea to the bottom; where a lone survivor sits atop the hull of sunken ship in the middle of the Channel; where infantry men hiding inside the hull of a beached boat suddenly become the victims of German target practice; where a malfunctioning fuel gauge decides who will live and who will die and who will fight another day.<br/><br/>Lately, discussions of history seem to be nothing more than an argument over racism, oppression and misogyny. DUNKIRK reminds us that the freedom to have such arguments was purchased by the sacrifice and heroism of ordinary people, determined to persevere against great odds and do the right thing no matter what the obstacle in their way. Thank you, Christopher Nolan, for making DUNKIRK, and reminding us all."
"colewaters","10","4","11","22 July 2017"," Dunkirk IMAX
","Dunkirk is by far the best movie of the year so far. If you are going to see Dunkirk you have to see it in IMAX. The acting was fantastic especially by Harry Styles as Alex. This is one of those films that when you watch it you know you are with them. Christopher Nolan did it once again with another great film. Every second of the film was shot perfectly as every camera was put on the object like the cockpit had a camera on it. Dunkirk was a brutal battle and this movie proves that it was brutal.<br/><br/>Parents yes this movie is rated PG-13, but it was rated that problem just because Harry Styles is in it because if he was not in it it would be R. This movie was extremely intense the whole time so if you don't want your kids to see it and they want to tell them when they get older because they would love it. Dunkirk is by far a great film that needs to be seen, but really in IMAX.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy it.<br/><br/>My score 10/10"
"vuc2010","1","4","11","21 July 2017"," Nolan fails and Hans Zimmer shines.
","Yesterday I was in cinema to watch the movie. I have a feeling that Nolan should make a fictional war story movie not the history evacuation that we know the outcome. First i was skeptical about movie theme and now I can confirm that evacuation is a little bit boring. Yet in movie not good explained how that situation was helpless and why everybody wanted to run home! That said that is the first thing I didn't like about the movie. Since we now know outcome from the beginning of movie, Nolan fails to make characters in the movie important. He didn't build the characters at all, since there is no much dialogue between them, you actually don't care about them if they will die or stay alive there is no real emotion through all the movie. I was feeling like watching the documentary movie. I will call this movie emotionless. Its so strange for the director of all previous movies to make such a flop. If there wasn't Hans Zimmer score this movie will be absolute garbage. Try to watch it at home and turn the speakers off you will probably die from boredom. I Carnot say anything about acting since there is no real acting in this movie. Only music score from Hans Zimmer and using no CGI effects in this movie are good thing. Everything else is bad..And I hate when I have to say for Nolans movie to be bad..but that's just it is!"
"jumbadajinkya","9","4","11","21 July 2017"," great movie about an event
","Great movie and that's it. There is a lack of overall story in this movie, there is no real focus on one character or location. This movie is about an event and that fact doesn't change from beginning to end. The directing is absolutely amazing and the fact that there was no visible human enemy i.e. Germans on the screen, makes this movie a great deal. Nolan took a risk and it paid off."
"hristogbalabanov","10","4","11","21 July 2017"," Epic experience.
","It's different from most modern day movies. The dialog is minimal and spoken only if truly necessary, instead the movie uses visuals, proper and good one and not excessive, to tell the story. <br/><br/>The sound is spot on. You really feel everything from small gunshots to bombs to the roar of aircraft engines. And just the sheer way it is put together is genius, constantly cutting between the ordinary soldiers trying to survive, the air force trying to do their best, the commanders trying to make due with what little they have to the civilians trying to do their duty. <br/><br/>Also, I like that there is minimal exposition and from the very start of the movie, the action starts and is constant. Not for one moment can you turn away, not for one moment is there a boring scene. <br/><br/>I am not going to pretend i am some hard as stone macho man, but I bloody cried (a little, but still) when the civilian boats made it to Dunkirk and everyone started cheering, both on and off screen (yes, the theater actually cheered and cried at the same time). <br/><br/>I would definitely watch it again...and probably again...and maybe again."

","Saw this movie on 70 mm film on Wednesday. We don't have IMAX where I live unfortunately. But nonetheless it was still a majestic experience. This is without a doubt the greatest cinematic experience I've had. The scope was big and the sound was deafening without losing clarity(they have one of the best sound-systems in that cinema in my country). I wasn't really prepared for this movie. It's unlike any other Nolan film before or even war movie. No grand speeches, no politics, no flag-waving, no propaganda. Just survival, nothing more, nothing less. It's all about the experience. You're in there with the anonymous soldiers. You don't have time to have heartfelt conversations while you're being torpedoed, bombed and shot at. It's all about the terrifying, unrelenting suspense that never lets go. This is Cinema at it's finest. Go see it on the biggest and loudest cinema available!"
"kari-lh","10","4","11","21 July 2017"," Dunkirk was exactly what I had anticipated it to be, and then some
","To put it into simple terms, Dunkirk is the best cinematic experience I've had in years.<br/><br/>Once the credits started rolling, I was lost for words. So strong had the impact of this film been upon me. I was clearly not the only one, as the whole theater was silent. It was as if we were all soldiers returning home from an hour and three quarters of war experience.<br/><br/>From the moment when the first bullet is fired, we're are completely submerged into the narrative. The story focuses on three narratives in three different settings, that all tie together in the events at Dunkirk 76 years ago. The inter-cutting between these different narratives is brilliantly done, where all the stories serve as a companion to one another, despite being fundamentally different. Alhtough a story structure like this is not common in cinema, I believe it works perfectly for the atmosphere Nolan wanted to create.<br/><br/>The craftsmanship in this film is absolutely stunning. Every aspect of this film is masterfully crafted, and flows with each other to create the perfect harmony. That's because the film isn't trying to show off how great certain aspects are. It's all about creating the experience of watching it. That is also the reason why the narrative isn't in a traditional war epic format. That's because this film doesn't take you on a journey so to speak, as it provides you with the experience of war. It is a very tense experience that leaves you with no real breaks to settle down. That's because you constantly feel like you are one of the soldiers depicted on screen. I feel inclined to add that this film may not be a good experience for people who have experienced combat, or have been severely affected by it. This is also not a film you should see if you have a history with drowning. Luckily I've not been affected by either, but I can still imagine how it must have felt like. That's how real the experience of watching this film really is.<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend seeing this film in theaters. That is mostly because of how amazing the sound design is. As I said before, no single aspect takes over another, but the sound design is undeniably a crucial part of creating the atmosphere. The experience is therefore best if watched with good surround sound being blasted all around you, while your eyes are stuck to the big screen.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this story is that it doesn't really pick a side. The film only shows you one side, but moral questions regarding the men you are fighting are left out. The film also doesn't talk about the horrors of war. It simply shows you what it was like. This ties into the fact that this story isn't a journey. It is an intense experience.<br/><br/>The atmosphere this film offers is so intense that you can feel the salty breeze from the sea, mixed in with the horrible smell of dead corpses. Throughout the entire film, you feel like you are there with the soldiers. We care for them, we fear for them, and we emphasize for them. That's simply because we are one of them. Or at least that's what it feels like.<br/><br/>In the end we are all like the silent spitfire gliding through the air, as we admire the bravery of the people depicted on screen. So strong is the will to help those in need, that men and women alike risked their lives to save the soldiers trapped at Dunkirk. It is about the power of people to sacrifice in order to save, even when faced with a great adversary. This message, combined with the extraordinary experience, is what makes Dunkirk a true masterpiece."

","Reviews on here seem to love this film or hate it. Some of the criticisms seem churlish (it didn't talk about this or that aspect of the battle - well it isn't a documentary); others have perhaps some merit (the characters are pretty thin - but theyre thick enough I think). But I LOVE this film. I thought it was visually stunning, some of the action scenes (various ship sinkings in particular) are truly terrifying, the soundtrack was compelling and helped pace the story, and while there was not much dialogue, that was part of the point, and the structure of the storys intertwining is technically fantastic. I think the characterless ness of the main characters was to make them more of an everyman, rather than anyone in particular. It allows you to become emersed in the rollercoaster without having to keep track of complex characters arcs. And whilst some see that as a weakness, I see that as a strength. The point is to try and make this a visceral experience of the desperation and fear, and helplessness of those involved. And it does that extremely well."

","I don't know the story of Dunkirk previous to this movie. That being said, seeing the numbers displayed filled my head with a Normandy like experience. Not so apparently as there seems to be not nearly close to hundreds of thousands of soldiers, more like a thousand at most. Where are the planes and other war machines in all this chaos? There are several planes that pop in and out, for all the talk of destroyers and impending doom there's almost nothing ever actually happening. The characters are about as bland as one could ever imagine. Understandably I don't expect these characters to be joyous and full of life, but they are so dull it's like watching paint dry for almost two hours. It's incredible that such a high budget was used for this movie. I can see how movies get expensive but this film does not evoke a big budget experience in the slightest. As a big Nolan fan this is a giant disappointment. Watch a classic like Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket. Skip this one. It's garbage."
"charbelelaro","10","2","4","2 April 2019"," I loved every minute of Dunkirk
","Being the last day of the year, I thought I should review my absolute favourite film of 2017. Dunkirk directed by Christopher Nolan, was a movie which blew me away. I had to see it more than once in cinemas, due to how stunning it was visually. The beach, the ocean and the sky all looked incredible, with the help of little to no CGI, but just purely amazing cinematography. The reason as to why I love this film so much is because of how different and unconventional it is. Dunkirk represents war in the most realistic way. It shows you that in moments of horror, you don't always get to know the soldiers around you and their back story. This film deliberately throws the audience into the climax from the beginning. I loved how Christopher Nolan was able to tell such a simple story in a really complex way. This is shown with his play on time, which made the film all the more riveting. The score by Hans Zimmer added so much, and worked really well with the sounds of war. At times I was unable to seperate the two. Everything from the vulnerable performances to the runtime was perfect. I loved every minute of Dunkirk. The ending left me with goosebumps. So therefore I give it a 10. I've noticed I've mostly been reviewing movies I love, so in between my Star Wars series I will be sharing my thoughts on some films I hate with a passion... Look forward to that."

"tomsview","9","2","4","7 May 2018"," Capturing the spirit
","For a teenager today, Dunkirk must seem even more distant than the Boer War did to my generation growing up just after WW2. For some, Christopher Nolan's film may be the most they will know about the event.<br/><br/>But it's enough in some ways because even if it doesn't show everything that happened, maybe it goes as close as a film could to letting you know how it felt.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" focuses on a number of characters who are inside the event, living it minute by minute. <br/><br/>Tommy, the soldier at the centre of the story, seems at first glance to be the antithesis of the Dunkirk legend. Maybe he fits a New Millennium sensibility rather than a 1940's one, more like a contestant on ""Survivor"". He does show initiative, but a soldier who throws away his weapon then ""helps"" wounded to the rear risked a court martial in every army from the Roman Legions on. The lines of stoic soldiers waiting patiently on the beach, the enduring image of the evacuation, seem almost like a backdrop as Tommy and his mate run through them.<br/><br/>The man who embodies the spirit to the full is Dawson, the civilian captain of the Moonstone. He is the sort of man who wins wars; the bloke who sticks to the task when others buckle under pressure; ""There's no hiding from this thing son,"" he says to an officer whose nerve has cracked, all the while steering his little boat towards Dunkirk.<br/><br/>The scenes of aerial combat look so real it makes all other depictions pale in comparison. Peter Jackson once planned to do a remake of ""The Dam Busters"", but possibly Christopher Nolan would add another dimension to the retelling.
The brilliant special effects serve the story. Much of the panorama of Dunkirk is glimpsed almost incidentally from the cockpit of fighter planes or by men struggling in the water.<br/><br/>There are surprises for anyone who thinks they know the story or have seen documentaries or other recreations of the event; it's very different to the crowded Dunkirk of ""Atonement"".<br/><br/>An unsettling score helps heighten the tension in a film that has you holding your breath in scene after scene. <br/><br/>This is a film that demands more than one viewing."
"atlasmb","9","2","4","27 April 2018"," A Great War Story
","This is the story of a battle. It is not about the men in that battle. It is also about all battles.<br/><br/>Some have criticized ""Dunkirk"" because of its lack of character development. Other films have done a good job of following (developing) characters as they negotiate scenes of war. But this film chooses to focus almost exclusively on the chaos of war. Still, it is not without characters, and director Nolan has chosen to focus on a handful of individuals to explain the ways that fortunes can change amid chaos. <br/><br/>He also uses a non-linear timeline. For some, Dunkirk stretched over interminable weeks. For others, their stories were encompassed by one harrowing day. Still others joined the fray only for hours. But all of them were subject to the drama of a countdown, whether it was due to small windows of opportunity, the unpredictable weather, or logistics.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's music certainly drives the drama and helps accentuate the timelines that are at play. The soundtrack has a driving cadence overlaid by sounds that are like screaming sirens. <br/><br/>The action is poetic. With minimal dialogue, we witness the transformative nature of war, the impossible choices, the drive for survival, the inhumanity that war requires. At times, the action is moving; at other times, it is overwhelming.<br/><br/>Despite what some have written about this film, it is very true to the reality of Dunkirk. For example, the cranes that stand above the city actually were there. <br/><br/>Seeing this film drove me to read about the precursors to this action. And to explore the stories of those who actually were there on that final day. Finally, it led me to better appreciate the great significance of that day in the history of the world."

","Recently I have watched a watched this film. I really liked it because of its great plot and camera work. 3-line story is very brave idea. And the director made it perfect.
The image of the evidence that happened then, feelings of soldiers that wanted to be evacuated to safe Britain across the English Channel were done awesome! The location was chosen well: a bay in the North of France, windy and cloudy seascape with funnels from aviabombs. Using real british and german plane fighters and bombers let the viewer fell real war action and enjoy the georgeous picture of a plane battle. The clock sound during all the movie, which pushes the atmosphere and doesn't let you fell relaxed, you always think that something dangerous can happen: explosion, shooting of the enemy or ""Spitfire"" which with the roar of the engine will fly by its head.
So I really recommend you to watch this mill as soon as you can, Christopher Nolan made his work great."
"luiginastro","9","2","4","3 April 2018"," Nolan's interesting take on the war genre
","To sum up this movie one only needs five words: it's a war movie. Yeah, that's it. A movie about an important operation, which saved more than 330,000 soldiers from the beaches of Dunkerque, where they were surrounded by the German.<br/><br/>From a technical point of view, the quality is impeccable. After all, it's a Nolan movie, so high quality was pretty much guaranteed. The movie is full of visually stunning shots (first one that comes to mind is one at the beach, at the beginning of the film, in which we can see the soldiers and where the frame is interrupted by two pillars or whatever they were; but also all the breathtaking aerial shots). I can't even begin to imagine how hard the production of the movie must have been, which I'd describe as colossal. A few ""action sequences"" (I don't how else to call them) are truly incredible to watch. <br/><br/>The structure of the plot: this is what makes this war movie unique. It follows three different perspectives (land, sea and air) with overlapping time-periods, which create a non-linear narrative. Usually a war movie follows the actions of a certain group of people throughout its entirety. This is where the only problem I had with the movie arise; I didn't have much time to empathize with any of the characters. I know it's only my problem, because caring for a certain character or characters wasn't the point, but I don't know. I guess I'm used to empathize with at least one of the characters when I watch a movie. But fine, I understand Nolan's choice and I respect it. It's not about the characters and their emotions and personalities whereas it's about their will to survive.<br/><br/>The cast: nothing much to say here. Acting is not the focus of the movie, but what little acting we saw was yet again impeccable. We have a few important and famous names, such as Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy, and they all did a very good job. We also have a good variety of new names approaching the silver screen for the first time, such as Fionn Whitehead (who's only 20!) who was extremely good in his role and Harry Styles. A highly criticized choice, but in the end, he was decent. More than decent, actually. A new career may have started. <br/><br/>A special mention goes to the astonishing original soundtrack, composed by Nolan's longtime partner in crime, Hans Zimmer. He WILL win the Oscar. Period. It'd be a crime if he didn't. As I've said, he has collaborated with Nolan in many of his movies, for more than a decade now, and every time he outdoes himself. His score accompanies the movie for its entire length and it adds even more tension and anxiety than the incredible images we see on the screen. Just sublime. <br/><br/>Overall, this isn't the best war movie ever made; or even the best Christopher Nolan has ever made. By saying this, I don't want to sound incoherent because I really, really liked the film. The only and simple explanation is that I've appreciated more his other works. Watch it if you haven't already."

","If you're expecting to watch this movie and grow to care and attach yourself to the major cast leaders, you're going to be in for somewhat of a disappointment. This is not a film about and individual, or indeed a number of individuals (as many people have pointed out, but for the wrong reasons). To achieve this would have been to focus on persons rather than the events. This is a movie that takes in the entirety of what happened without sub plots or the romanticies of just a few soles for you to attach yourselves. If you need this in a film - as by reading some peoples reviews a lot of you do (and I'm not saying that if that's what you like then you're wrong), then your watching the wrong movie.<br/><br/>The people here who define a good movie only by whether they liked it would appear to be the very same people who would perhaps tell you a band is rubbish because they don't like the music. I was like that myself when I was twelve, but most people grow up and realise that what defines something as well made is not based on your own individual taste. You should be able to watch or listen to something, not like it, but realise that it is well made, thought provoking and something that others may find impressive. It's really quite amusing to read some of the comments on here from one or two star reviewers. A quick read will find you comments like - Music rubbish - Boring - It's disjointed (referring to the way the story is retold from several timelines) - required better CGI - Acting poor - Not factual - Why were there no Americans - Unromantic - Poor plot! Seriously people, if you don't find it to your taste, there's no issue, but come on, get a grip on some of the comments.<br/><br/>If you want a new Private Ryan, don't watch it, if you want a love story, don't watch it, if you think the real events at Dunkirk lacked PLOT, don't watch it. If you want to see a pretty reasonable facsimile of a major event in history (according to survivors of the real event who went to the opening of the movie), be captivated, impressed and on edge, then this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>If you don't like it, that's fine, but please, don't give one star to something that clearly elevates an entire genre of movies."

","Countless movies have been made about the two World Wars, and each of these has been told from a specific perspective. Many of these movies (especially those featuring prominently established actors) were made to entertain rather than to convey a message. Chris Nolan's Dunkirk had a different purpose to it - one that was very successfully realized by the director, the crew and the cast of this film. That purpose was to convey the reality of the near-hopeless situation on the beaches of Dunkirk, and the indomitable will of the British people that succeeded in turning a would-be defeat into a victory of spirit. Three Cheers to Mr. Nolan and everyone who contributed their efforts to creating this tribute to the Heart of a Nation! And to those who couldn't see this film for the masterpiece that it is ...

Watching IMAX is the best choice, it was made for the IMAX, no movie can compare to the experience that this movie goes through. Despite not having so many dialogues, the film manages to live up to the feelings of those soldiers, both the fear and the relief of seeing the civilian boats.

","We're living in the Micheal Bay generation. If it doesn't explode it boring. Don't let the negative voices fool you. Dunkirk is a great movie - in it's own way. It's about war. It's not about winning a war, but about surviving it. It's about desperation, loss and shame. This is not a movie to watch for spectacular battles, epic adventures or heroic tales. It's movie that captures the mental horrors of war. You need a certain degree of empathy to enjoy it, it's powerful even though there's barely any blood being spilled.
A lot of people watched it with false expectations and were disappointed. It's not a movie for the masses, even though it might have been promoted as such. If you see it for what it is, it's an incredibly good movie movie."
"jelkuba","7","2","4","9 February 2018"," Nolan's magic
","When I was about to watch this movie, I was looking forward to bloody action with dead bodies, deafening explosions and shouting survivors. I got absolutely different war movie, but it was almost perfect.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of this film plays with your emotions, you feel yourself being one of the soldiers, whether in the sieged city or on some of the ships. The plot is dark, almost depressing, enhancing the horrors of the war. Every detail is taken seriously. However, someone might not like as expected something else.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, when you go to the theatre to see a war movie, you expect fully action bloodshed, as seen in Saving Private Ryan (1998) or Enemy at the Gates (2001). Not only Christopher Nolan could picture these sufferings, but also shown the war of psychical state of each individual. This is marvelous.<br/><br/>You can open your mouth in awe during the Stuka attacks or sinking the transport ships, but the bigger part of you is frightened about the lifes of the sailors and soldiers aboard and be honest, not every movie can do this with you. Even the effects are glorious, like the smoke, the explosions, the models of historic combat planes etc., the movie targets to emotions and this combination is perfect.<br/><br/>Now you maybe ask, why I rate the movie 7/10 and not more. Firstly, when you think deeper, Nolan forgot one important thing about the besieged city. The thing is, that the city is besieged. According to me, the factor of claustrophobia and non-existing escape route is forgotten as the movie is focused primarily on emotions. This is where I see lack of logic. The movie should tell the spectator more about the actual situation of the main characters.<br/><br/>Next flaws are just my personal attitude, but someone could prove it right. Who the hell gave a role in a war movie to Harry Styles? I know - it's maybe not my cup of tea, but many people around me say the same things. A pop band singer takes a role in a war movie. He doesn't look like a man, actually. Even the role is small, it's like a black dot on a clear white sheet. It simply doesn't suit me.<br/><br/>And now, the thing I hate most about the film - Tom Hardy. He is an excellent actor with great image and talent, no doubt about it. But I think that naming him as a main role is just marketing affair. You can say, he had a decent screen time, but how? 98% of his time on screen we could see him sitting in the cockpit of Spitfire, with glasses and mask on, murmuring some empty phrases. This is not how I see the main role. He should have been given a better role, this is honestly wasting good material.<br/><br/>After all, Dunkirk is Nolan's masterpiece, one of many. If you want to see a war movie pictured in a different way, go ahead. If you like psychological dramas full of emotions pictured in a different way, go ahead. The perfection of this film is only disrupted by wrong casting. 7/10"
"tzeni-13","10","2","4","5 February 2018"," Brilliant.
","I just want to say this: the moment Jordan died on that ship I felt most devastated, there was a deep feeling of injustice when that happened. Later on, we see a bigger ship being bombed and dozens of men jumping on the sea, drowning and being burned to death. As I was still thinking of Jordan's dead body being left behind I realized that all these other men were also Jordans, they were all men who deserved better and a chance to live, to go home. This movie is trying to show this exactly, that men are not meant be heroes in times of war, but to survive, because that is who we are, humans with instincts. Nolan wants to show the absolute truth about war through bombs and chaos and death and fear but most importantly he shows us the truth of our nature. Heroism is not part of it. War is and so is death. So, we make a choice between war and peace, death and life. There's nothing in between. 
Also, by focusing on three different perspectives all at once and not having main characters, he sacrifices emotional focus for the sake of reality through a grander picture of the situation. We see all the soldiers trying to survive, not just one or two and that was the most brilliant decision a director could make for an anti-war movie. It's not only about showing the facts and events of that moment in history and portray the sacrifice and devastation of troops and ships but also to show what it also means. It means that thousands of people died there and hundreds of others tried desperately to go home. They were many and this movie depicts their story and not only 'his' story. By lacking an emotional focus, the whole movie becomes the emotional focus, not just one character whom we just hope he lives by the end of the movie. We need everyone to live. 
Another scene that got my attention was the moment when the other soldiers demanded that Jordan left the boat so that everyone else could survive. That scene shows the variety and unpredictability of the human character. At times of war or generally times of pressure, people show their true faces and that was the moment for these soldiers. One of them refused categorically to sacrifice Jordan whereas the rest of them would not hear of it. They were led by fear only and fear was led by war. 
This movie succeeds to show multiple aspects and points of view of a historical moment of war while simultaneously using colors and cinematography to contrast chaos with life. Nolan shares deeper views on war through the reality and psychology of the characters and deprives no soldier of the right to be noticed and appreciated. This movie is worth watching more than once, but most importantly being understood in a deeper level as regards humanity as a collective in times of war."

Christopher Nolan has done everything a history buff could want other than a few little goofs that are very hard to find. The opening seen and the climactic seen are easily the best for me and the Han Zimmer's sound track is superb, I still listen to it on Spotify. The timeline may be a little confusing for those who lack a certain general intelligence but I believe most had no struggle. I love how the script never refers to the enemy as the Germans or the Nazis, Hitler's name is never mentioned either. The use of this is because that Nolan wants to show that the main problem is that time is running out, which if listened to closely in the sound track, there is a clock ticking and gets quicker throughout the film.

","I rarely see a more overrated director than Nolan. He is one of the few with James Cameron able to get incredible budgets on the most unlikely movies but while Cameron make fun movies, Nolan just me make depressing ones that at the end make very little sense.
His Batman trilogy was depressing. Tim Burton was fired from Batman because it was too dark (but ironically fun). Nolan did the same but forgot the fun.
Inception and Interstellar were spectacular movies that really made not sense at all. Critics praised them as masterpieces when out of the visuals aside there were nothing really interesting or important to say.
Back to Dunkirk; well there is not real point in it. The movie just tells the story of two soldiers (a third one appears after the first half) trying to get out of the beach. There is no emotion; just a lot of failed attempts to escape.
There are no explanations of what really happened; why 400K soldiers were left in the beach; why allied soldiers reject the French ones. In fact soldiers are mostly showed as cowards trying to run away and save themselves.
On the other hands; officials are shown elegantly dressed and apparently not affected at all for the events surrounding them. 
There is also a boat captain with his son and a help who are only trying to be patriotic but seem to know more about war than any other military around. 
The movie has continuity errors all over (like Cillian Murphy appearing in two different timelines). It is also very hard to believe that Germans send four or five planes to attack 400K defenseless men (for what could had been the hardest hit on allied forces) and allies only send three (with little gas) to save the 400 thousand men there.<br/><br/>It is even harder to accept that when civil boats arrived; Germans basically stop attacking and 300 thousand men were able to be saved in few minutes.<br/><br/>In brief; the movie is insulting to soldiers that fought and die over there and are only painted as cowards when officers are shown as valiant heroes when basically their mistakes cost the lives of so many. Is also insulting to the public because it gives little information about the events and try to create happy ending of that carnage.<br/><br/>Please avoid the movie and alert others about the piece of crap this is."

"fjbathgate","9","2","4","1 January 2018"," Dunkirk does have flaws but it is NOT ""Overrated""
","Dunkirk is easily one of the best War films ever made. Extremely tense, great acting, fantastic cinematography, massive attention to detail, REAL Spitfires and Warships (even if the warships are post-war), Realistic aerial scenes (except for one moment - which I will come on to later) and a very chilling and terrifying soundtrack. <br/><br/>However, despite this, the very high 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and that it is the highest grossing World War II film of all time, the film has been slammed with many negative reviews written by people who don't seem to have basic knowledge of film or history. While everyone is entitled to their opinion, at least give films a chance and watch with an open mind before reviewing them. In this review I am mainly going to explain why this film is not ""overrated"".<br/><br/>First of all, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is NOT a remake of the 1958 film and it is certainly not trying to copy Saving Private Ryan. Dunkirk is actually one of the first original and unique World War II film we've had since Saving Private Ryan, Nolan made it clear that he wanted to avoid trying to make his film similar to Saving Private Ryan, unlike the vast majority of World War II films we've had. Now Saving Private Ryan is a great film in it's own regard, but because it captured the brutality of War effectively does not mean that every war film should copy it. Most war films try to remake Saving Private Ryan's battle-scenes and even lifts some of it's scenes and techniques turning many of Saving Private Ryan's iconic moments into cliches. Most films have done this to such a degree that most people expect all War films to be 'another' Saving Private Ryan and compare all new war films to it as such. Dunkirk is one of the few films that takes a different path and breaks away from this formula. What's wrong with that?<br/><br/>One of the main areas of criticism that this film receives is the supposedly ""empty beach"". Yes the film does show only a few thousand soldiers on screen but that is because not all 400,000 soldiers were on the beach at the same time - some were still in the town, some had already been evacuated and others were helping the French to defend the rearguard. The beach at Dunkirk stretched for 16 miles and soldiers would have been spread all across the beach. Most of the soldiers were at the mole - and the mole in the film looks pretty packed to me. The film would never had shown all of the soldiers on the beach at once, the film was showing the evacuation from a certain perspective. If you were one of those soldiers at Dunkirk you would never have seen all 400,000 soldiers on the beach. This is backed up by real photographs of the evacuation - some photos show only a few hundred soldiers and very little equipment, most of the photos that you find are actually further away from the mole. Many of the chaotic photos are actually from the 1958 film and not the real evacuation itself, which may cause some confusion. Just because the film shows fewer soldiers than you may expect doesn't make the film terrible. Look at Saving Private Ryan for instance. Over 43,000 US soldiers participated in the Omaha beach landings yet the opening scene only shows a few thousand, that's because it was showing the Assault from a certain perspective and from a specific sector of the beach. Nearly every war film I see shows fewer soldiers than the actual number, this is due to budget reasons and for the reason I just mentioned<br/><br/>Another area which seems to gather criticism is the 'lack of character development'. While I can understand why some people found it hard to connect with the characters, the fact is you weren't really meant to. Christopher Nolan deliberately did this as he wanted to show the evacuation by events and visual detail rather than from an eyewitness account. Think about it as well, most soldiers would not have time to introduce themselves and many were not in the mood for chatting - they were trying to evacuate and survive after all. The film was also not trying to give a certain character any specialities and it was not trying to single out a 'hero'. The film was trying to portray them as ordinary soldiers - because that was what they were. The majority of British at Dunkirk were young, and mostly unknown men who were brought into war to do their bit. This is what I believe the film was trying to give us.<br/><br/>The other area where the film seems to be getting hate is the 'lack of action'. One of the most important events of the evacuation was the French army defending the rearguard while the evacuation took place. While it does show the French defence at the beginning their role was down-played in this film which is one of the few complaints I had. I felt could have been explored in more detail. Without their courage and sacrifice the evacuation would not have been the success it was. However, the focus of the film was about the British Soldiers on the beaches waiting for evacuation, the role of the 'little ships' and the RAF's brave attempts to hold the Luftwaffe at bay while the Evacuation took place. With the exception of the French Rearguard and the RAF air-battles, there was not much fighting at Dunkirk. Most of the British soldiers had to face Air attacks, U-Boat attacks and boredom as they waited. War is not always about combat and explosions happening every 30 seconds, there were some boring parts as-well. I even saw one reviewer who panned the film because there were no German soldiers shown. This is actually one of the most effective parts of the film. The fact that you don't see the Germans makes the film even more tense and frightening as most soldiers wouldn't have seen their enemy until they started shooting, you would have had no idea where they would be. The lack of Germans shown gives the impression of the Germans being a dangerous and terrifying opponent. This is also a common film technique, sometimes it is scarier when you don't see the danger - as was the case with Jaws.<br/><br/>Finally the last main complaint that everyone seems to have is the 'lack of realism' and 'historical accuracy'. Let's be clear the film was not meant to be a documentary and I don't mind films which fictionalise historical events as long as it honours the real event and Dunkirk certainly gets this right. One user complained that there were ""not enough boat or planes and that CGI should have been used."" Another even complained that the destroyer was not period. The destroyer was defiantly post-war, however it was modified it to look like a WWII British Destroyer. The fact that they used a real destroyer makes the film even more realistic, don't you think? Also not all planes and ships were at Dunkirk at once so of course you don't see a lot of them, keep in mind that they used over 60 Boats in the film, the most ever used in a film production. The fact that they used real Spitfires as well is one of the greatest things about this film. The planes behaved realistically and the cockpit scenes gave an accurate reflection of what it was like flying a Spitfire in 1940 and how difficult it was to fight in it, with the constant headshake and the draining fuel being taken into account. Yes the Spitfires did fire their guns in this film much longer than they did in real life, but this happens in every war film so this only a minor fault. While the dogfights did seem a little slower than actual dogfights this was because they were using real vintage aircraft and throwing them in such manoeuvres could risk damaging the aircraft or evens stalling them. I much rather see some real aircraft flying in a realistic manner than seeing lots of CGI ones performing physics-defining manoeuvres that even modern day jets would struggle to achieve (Don't get me started on Red Tails - they have Bf-109s and P-51s doing flipping backlips in mid air!). Now here comes the most 'hollywood' moment of the film, where Tom Hardy's Spitfire runs out of fuel and manages to turn around and shoot down a Ju-87 Stuka while losing very little altitude. Now I have read accounts of Spitfires managing to glide their aircraft for 15 minutes without fuel and the Spitfire was certainly not flying for more than 15 minutes - also remember the fact that they used real planes so they would have been forced to glide them at the same altitude for safety reasons. However, the fact that Tom Hardy shot down the bomber while out of fuel is certainly over-the-top and did ruin the flight sequences to a certain degree. However, this was the only ridiculous moment on the film, so I can live with it. Most War films are guilty of having Hollywood moments, Saving Private Ryan is no exception - so you can't pan Dunkirk for one silly moment while letting other War films off with it.<br/><br/>Dunkirk does have its flaws, but it is still an excellent film overall and it is definitely one of my favourite films of all time. If you are expecting Dunkirk to be another Saving Private Ryan, with big battles and lot's of patriotic music then you will be disappointing. So I advise watching this film with an open mind and forget Saving Private Ryan for once and treat films as their own. If you are into British history then you will enjoy this film. Most people who have criticised this film have done so mainly because they misunderstood the film, were expecting more action or simply hate it. Regardless, it is not Overrated and it deserves all the critical praise and box office success that it got and I hope it receives some Oscars.<br/><br/>One more thing - some of the guests to the films premier were actual Dunkirk Veterans, although they pointed out some errors they stated that overall it was an 'accurate depiction' of the Evacuation, a few of them were even brought to tears by the film. The fact that you have a 90+ year old veteran praising this film says it all."

","I can't see how this is sitting on a 8+ rating on IMDB. It's a 6 at best, and I give it a three - for the wasted opportunity here that it could have been.<br/><br/>The story of the evacuation of soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk is so gripping, and so important it's hard to imagine you could mess it up - just tell the story on the big screen. And yet...they somehow fail to do that.<br/><br/>The story is seen through the eyes of just a few characters, and this robs a powerful tale of any scope or scale. It's just basically a one day quick rescue, with a single air battle and a couple of ships. Also there are barely any soliders on the beaches? <br/><br/>This is so sad and such a huge waste of money. A boring and pointless waste of what should have been an amazing movie. You won't see this getting any oscars any time soon. Very expensive, and very easy to pass on. Go watch something else."

With a good will, you maybe count 5.000 soldiers standing around + a few boats and a few machines in the air. In reality, over 300 k were rescued and almost 100 k got still captured by the Germans... <br/><br/>Well, I will make it short: the movie is boring and is in the range of war movies at most a mediocre one (in my opinion it is a weak one). Another so-called blockbuster of Hollywood with a mysteriously high rating on IMDb and highly rated by the so-called pro critics (how much of the 100 million dollars was spent into the pockets of those guys and gals calling themselves ""critics"" I can only assume). Since some time the ratings, especially for big productions, look all fake (8+ is now standard). IMDb should do sth against that bot rates or every new production will have a higher rating as Apocalypse Now, 2001 or whatever great classic. <br/><br/>Anyway, this Dunkirk will be forgotten fast - compared with movies like Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates, The Downfall, Das Boot, Steiner - The Iron Cross, Letters From Iwo Jima and others, this movie is a waste of time to watch. Even fake rates won't change that."

It's just a beach evacuation in some war.<br/><br/>A lot of reviews complain about the lack of character development, but for me that's one of the most thought provoking aspects of the film. It was about the reality of war, not a story about characters in a war. The same ""story"" was happening to everyone, and reflects the emotional detachment of accepting the senseless death of a best friend in the same way as someone you've never met. And treating someone you've never met as a friend.<br/><br/>But while I like to have my thoughts provoked, I don't like to be forced to try and understand what the hell is going on. It jumps around all over the place, in a very disjointed manner.<br/><br/>This isn't helped by the flawed plot mechanisms which just leave you thinking that doesn't make sense, that wouldn't have happened, that's just silly and unrealistic. I always wonder why the actors or film crew didn't point these out during filming?<br/><br/>So in conclusion, it's an average film about a war complete with the plot holes associated with average films.

","On September 1, 1939, a white lightning struck the Polish sky, and a group of demons who claimed to be ""excellent races"" began their atrocities. They created death and panic at an alarming rate, and greedily enjoyed this sinful feast made of blood and tears. The flames of war spread to more than half of Europe, and the originally peaceful and peaceful land was all included in the evil territory by them.<br/><br/>This tragedy called ""World War II"" was the darkest period in human history. It's hard to look back, but it can't be forgotten. Those cruel facts still look shocking today. The good and evil in human nature are exposed under the scouring of blood. There are too many aspects of World War II that are worth exploring and thinking, and the clues are hidden in the smoke that spans more than half of the earth.<br/><br/>In the early days of World War II, the German Fascist blitz was invincible and invincible, and no one could stop it wherever it went. From Poland all the way north, swept through Norway and Denmark, turned west, swept through Belgium and Luxembourg, and rushed into France. The Anglo-French forces jointly guarded the last line of defense in the European continent, but the balance of victory was still dumped on Germany. Within days of the battle, the Anglo-French coalition was in desperation. 400,000 people were trapped in Dunkirk in northern France, with a trace of hope for survival, eager for God's assistance and mercy.<br/><br/>Dunkirk, retreat soon. This was a frustrating escape, but it was also the first potential turning point in World War II. The film honestly retells this history, selfishness, ruthlessness, lies, discrimination, nowhere to escape. So many sins filled the story, but no character can really make people hate.<br/><br/>Frightened by the explosion, he missed the pilot who killed George. Does he hate it? Hateful, hateful that he killed an innocent life, but how could he hate him when he flew to death and flew through the rain of bullets? The French who pretended to be an Englishman and wanted to escape on a British cruise ship, could he hate it? Hateful, hateful. He defrauded the trust of others at a critical moment, but how could he not be grateful if he opened the escape hatch for the soldiers of the whole ship and extended his helping hand again and again? Do they hate the young soldiers who want to occupy the Dutch merchant ships and return home? Hateful, hateful to abandon others at a juncture and ignore them, selfishness. But war is destined to be accompanied by death. Someone can return to the motherland, and some people want to die. Who is not greedy for life and death? Think of it this way, their behavior is also worthy of compassion and forgiveness.<br/><br/>The cruise ship with the national flag sailed into the port again and again, sailed again and again, and sank again and again. Hope to ignite time and time again, and to be destroyed again and again. At the end of the line of sight, at the sea level, is the motherland, not the broad English Channel, which has become an insurmountable obstacle. Those men who are in their prime are helpless like children, waiting for the judgment of fate in desperation.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the Germans suspended the attack at this time. Fortunately, the civilian ships requisitioned by the government arrived in time. Fortunately, fortunately, most soldiers can return to their homeland, Dunkirk has not turned into a hell on earth.<br/><br/>When the two feet set foot on the land of the motherland, there was no expected joy or luck for the rest of the life. Traveling with confidence, but forced to retreat by powerful enemies, even if they survived? Not a loser yet. Near the dock, many residents prepared bread and beer to treat these young people who fought for the country. As the train left the station, the crowds along the road stopped and waved to express their respect and gratitude. The atmosphere is joyful, but should the heart be sour? The more friendly the people, the more guilty the soldiers feel?<br/><br/>Everyone knows the history behind. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, the Pacific battlefield ignited smoke, the world anti-fascist alliance was established, the British and French coalition forces landed in Normandy, and reopened the battlefield in Western Europe. Germany was backed by enemies and defeated again and again. The victorious balance has quietly changed its tilted direction. And the group of surviving young people when Dunkirk retreated was also a powerful force in the counterattack of World War II.<br/><br/>It is not only lucky to survive, but also a mission. The sourness and guilt at the beginning were transformed into the courage and power to charge, and the motherland behind him was a belief that he did not regret."

","This movie needs to be watched at least twice.<br/><br/>The first time I watched it I went in with expectations high knowing it was another Nolan creation with him being my favourite director. He couldn't seem to put a foot wrong. But you do yourself a bit of a disservice if you go in to Dunkirk expecting to see something like Interstellar, Inception or The Prestige. If you do this movie can be easily misunderstood as slow, boring, no action. However it is definitely not. It all depends on your expectations coming into it.<br/><br/>This is also Nolans first movie based on a historical event. Which means it is very much a stand alone work from his previous. But like all great Nolan films he plays around with time, and in this you see three stories told on three different speeds all converging in one event.<br/><br/>It took me right until the end before I realised this was happening. Hence watching it a second time. Watching it twice gives you the chance to see the little clues and perspectives that start to overlap that can be missed on one viewing.<br/><br/>What's interesting about this movie is the lack of character development despite the movie still remaining very interesting. There is very little background info on who any of these soldiers or civilians are. There is also no antagonist full present in one character. The villain is found in the German army but not in one person
The enemy is faceless and only appears out of the silence in the form of a very quick nose dive or bustling torpedo. Which seems much more accurate with many of the soldiers probably never really meeting their enemy face to face.<br/><br/>Although these characters are fictional, the story is very real and authentic. The beach setting and plane especially.<br/><br/>This movie is awesome and I'm glad I gave it another go."

","Nolan has conjured a remarkable comedy film in the style of Monty Python mixed with Dad's Army etc. A homage not so much to 1940's Britain and the Dunkirk evacuation as to British absurd and satirical comedies of the 1950's through 70's.<br/><br/>I think that the writing needed improvement as the actual number of times that I laughed was only the once but I did grin and chuckle a few times.<br/><br/>Water is wet. Planes fly in the sky. Ships float until they fill with water. Oil is black and slick. Beaches have sand. Bullets hurt people. Little ships have a shallower draft and can float in shallower water than larger heavier ships with greater displacement.<br/><br/>Also, Spitfires have extremely large magazines for ammunition. And the glide characteristics of a glider instead of a front heavy pison engined powered aircraft.<br/><br/>I do agree with Kenneth Branagh's naval officer characters estimation that it's all ""frustrating"".<br/><br/>Although I would add that it is intermittently funny too.<br/><br/>""drop his load"" was a good evaluation of an imminent aerial attack. Except that it was a straffing run. It was also one of the funnier lines. Very Python. Taking the mock of British reserve and British slang simultaneously.<br/><br/>'Dunkirks' sound design and musical score were oddly reminiscent of horror films or possibly the sci fi/horror sub-genre in examples like 'Sunshine' by another British director Danny Boyle.<br/><br/>Practical special effects were astonishingly lacking in impact. Literally impact. Apart from small arms fire, nothing heavier like bombs and shells actually impacted in a torturous moment of kinetic energy. They just blew up where and when they were preset to. Very unsporting of the almost incognito German attackers.<br/><br/>Editing. I think that there must be a multitude of 'Dunkirks' on the editors floor. So many cuts.<br/><br/>I rate a 3/10 because I suspect that Nolan arranged to have as much original material as possible on screen in the films, particularly 'the little ships' of the ""miracle of Dunkirk"".<br/><br/>Beyond the overworked editing and a certain amount of mirthful, posh ""I say"" accents being proffered sometimes I can't think of any other facet of the film that I would gauge meriting more stars or a recommendation for anyone to watch unless you are a fan of mid twentieth century British parody/satirical/absurdist comedy."

","Faced with imminent annihilation, over 400,000 troops are stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk facing bombardment from superior Nazi air and land power. Christoper Nolan manages to condense into the next 95 minutes the grimness of the situation, and the sheer determination of the ordinary soldiers; how they deal with fear, learn to trust and co-operatate with others from many different nations - as the logistical nightmare that is repatriating them gradually is taking shape. We take the perspective of three individuals as they try to survive and get home and really do get a sense of the existential threat they each face; some more bravely than others. The events are historical fact, but the performances from Fionn Whitehead, Barry Keoghan are superb and perfectly plausible. A great supporting cast with Tom Hardy, Sir Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance amongst many all contributed to the authenticity of this expertly photographed (frequently using much more intimate POV-style coverage) production from Oscar nominated Hoyte Van Hoytema. The paucity of script also helped convince of the atrocity of their situation - definitely a case of less being more."

The way the focus of the film is on a strict level of duty over selfish survival is captured expertly through the eyes of 3 individuals from air, land and sea. The shift in focus retells the same scene from each vantage point and due to this, it feels like a well rounded movie. You really feel for the people involved and see their story.
I had no idea of what these personnel went through but the filmography really serves the story well and you should feel a lot of empathy for the characters you are watching, and this is accomplished.
It's a little known part of WWII been brought thoughtfully to mind. The only reason I have not given it a 10 is due to the acting of Kenneth Branagh.

The 3 different story lines (air, water and land) made the film a lot different then any other war film you can watch. This was Nolan's way of putting you into the war. It did work really well."
"jvrijsbergen-567-870815","6","0","0","21 October 2019"," Impressive but not realistic and overdramatic
","The movie Itself has perfect special effects and the story lines are good. However consistency in weather conditions is not good ( one shot the beaches are smooth and the next shot big waves are hitting the beach). Also the visual of one spitfire landing on the water shot from the air and from the boat are not coherent. The overdramatic landing in the end of the spitfire in the beach with the soldiers waving is not adding to the feeling of looking at a historic epos. It feels like looking at Independence Day. More of these moments, to many to my feeling, have been added to a story which is good that it is been told to a broader audience."

","DISCLAIMER: If you suffer from any form of anxiety, panic attacks or PTSD, then take caution when watching this film.<br/><br/>I feel a bit shell-shocked after watching this, so if one of Nolan's aims was to ensure the audience felt like a shell-shocked soldier then he was successful.<br/><br/>The Hans Zimmer score was so intense, so anxiety-inducing, that at times I found it incredibly distracting. It felt like probably the most developed ""character"" in the whole film. Because character development was mostly thrown out the door in 'Dunkirk'. The opening scenes gave me more anxiety than the opening of Saving Private Ryan - and this was achieved without any gore.<br/><br/>The film depicts events from three different perspectives. Personally, I wish the film had focused mainly on the everyday fishing boats off to rescue the lads - Mark Rylance's performance was the best and I felt really invested in his boat's story.<br/><br/>I love Spitfires and the fighter aces of WWII. They're one of my favourite topics to read about and explore. I found the dog fight aerial scenes underwhelming in 'Dunkirk' though. I actually found them somewhat unrealistic, where I had actually anticipated them to be the most authentic depictions in film yet. If you want to see a better example of this; check out 'Battle of Britain'.<br/><br/>Why go to so much effort in creating authenticity in a war film, only to just throw it away at times? Some scenes felt contrived. Events weren't always chronological which made it feel disjointed. Emphasis was put on 400,000 soldiers needing to be evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk. Yet, here I was watching 3 blokes sitting around on the most deserted stretch of beach I've ever seen.<br/><br/>In a film with limited dialogue, it actually managed to include ""filler"" dialogue. The Kenneth Branagh scenes in particular came across as if Nolan was trying to educate an assumed dumb American audience on this part of the war.<br/><br/>I felt more invested in the film right towards the end. Perhaps by then, I'd got accustomed to the jarring Hans Zimmer score, or maybe it was the three perspectives coming together that made the film feel more 'whole'. In a film that was my most anticipated of the year, I'm left feeling a little disappointed and underwhelmed - it was an alright movie but could've been so much more."

","As an ardent fan of Christopher Nolan films, I have to say this movie was definitely not one of the better films. It was a great cinematic experience and, in fact, the film is adrenaline-rushing at some points, but sometimes some scenes tend to be overlong and static. I guess the director wanted to take a different path this time making a movie that, as a matter of fact, isn't standard for him. There were unknown actors, and the idea of them portraying ""tiny"" soldiers is actually a well-thought concept, which is actually what war is. The bigger and more important names in Hollywood represented more important characters, which is also an interesting concept. While I was sitting in the cinema, it felt, undoubtedly, as if there's an actual war in progress, so sound editing and cinematography are brought to a tee. Especially the scenes with Fighter planes. However, as stated before, there wasn't really a story inside this movie, just many characters and their psychological profiles, which is why it felt boring at times. Maybe there was an idea or a deeper message that many didn't quite understand, which is why this movie is rated this way.<br/><br/>DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers"
"paulclaassen","6","0","0","17 June 2018"," Well made, but I was still disappointed.
","Hailed by critics as one of the best war films ever made, I must admit I once again disagree with them, as seems to be the norm. At times the characters are just too darn quiet, so much so that I wanted to urge them to just say something or make a sound or anything! Other times the music made it more interesting that what it really was. It was not very exciting nor very interesting. It wasn't suspenseful. Also, more often than not I got a sense of deja vu. It felt the action was going in repeat mode. It is essentially three stories: A small rescue yacht on its way to Dunkirk. Rescue aircraft on their way to Dunkirk. And soldiers at Dunkirk waiting to evacuate. None of the characters had very significant roles, in my opinion at least. I thought Mr Dawson (Mark Rylance) was the most distinct character of all, and seemed the most sensible, as well.<br/><br/>Having said that, though, there can be no denying the film is very well made."

","As you know, this movie is made by Christopher Nolan is the director with such films as Memento, the dark night and interstellar, and so on. The story of the film takes in World War II And about the evacuation of British and France and Belgium soldier troops from Dunkirk, which is in France. In this historic operation more than eight hundred British Army military boats And at least thirty-five thousand British and French soldiers who were besieged by the German army were saved. The film's performance on the imdb reference site is approximately thirty-nine hundred thousand voters From the past year to the present, the score of eight has received an acceptable score of ten. Nolan's look at the issue of Dunkirk, which could be called an historic event It has both a general view and a partial view. The principle of the event is undeniable. And the existence and tragedy of the incident can be examined from existing documents. 
It's important to have a great director and how to do it. 
There is a divorce between viewers, The first group of viewers who expected differently and changed their opinion after viewing the film and the second group of viewers think film is complete and enough to be effective.
The opinion of both groups are correct and their differences are in the look and feel of directing like Nolan.
A large part of the movie is the soldier's story trying to escape the pier
Where he is caught up with the rest of the soldiers and the other part of the events shows the film in general.
These two parts are well integrated, and this can be Nolan's tribute to its geographic history.
In terms of technique, the film story has distinct differences according to the director's choice, the use of the iMax camera is part of the hard work and what's coming out of the camera is quite acceptable the camcorder is difficult to capture in terms of size and volume and given that we have different images like the pier, the plane during flight and even underwater represents the decision to make a specific film in terms of imaging however, the film can be considered an acceptable work.
Although the nature of the film does not have a good relationship with the dialogues In general, the whole film can be construed in terms of nationalist sentiment in the category of proud and victorious films in a particular geography.
We will be waiting for the next films of Nolan with great interest
Thank you for your attention to the cinema puzzle program and the hope of success for all art fans."

","Well, I've finally seen ""Dunkirk"". Like most my first impression was one of awe. I was particularly impressed with the dog fight scene.In most movies the planes get a bead on the enemy plane and blast it out of the sky. This showed that it is not that easy. The plane is bobbing around like a cork and you have the enemy plane doing his maneuvers so most times a hit may even be impossible. Then later started to think there was something missing from the movie In my search to find out more about this conflict I came across this documentary, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcX8NvJPOFc. It was while watching this that it came to me what was missing in the movie. It was reality. The opening scenes of the young Brit soldiers walking through the French village stands out. The buildings were pristine, not one brick out of place, no rubble and just flyers floating down. It's a known fact that at this time France was going through hell and a lot of towns and villages were hit. The other thing that I picked up in this doco was the troops on shore were being attacked by waves of 50 to 100 German Stukas. In the movie you only see 2 or 3. The thing Nolan seemed to be proud of was that most of his FX were practical and he did not rely on CGI. While this is indeed an achievement in itself I feel there were parts where CGI wouldn't have gone amiss. It was admitted that they use cardboard cutouts to enhance the number of soldiers waiting on the sure.Photo Shopping was used and massive printers. The easy answer, and cheaper, option would have been to use matts. This is a method whereby images are painted on a glass plate and placed in front of the camera.
As far a performances where concerned I did not see anything that really stood out."

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Absolutely no ""extras"", which is a disappointment, but the picture and sound are great, the subwoofer had our viewing room rumbling with the battle action.<br/><br/>I glanced and some of the ""user"" reviews and it seems many are disappointed because this movie isn't what they expected. Instead of a comprehensive treatment of the whole Dunkirk events the movie focuses on a few particular elements. A fighter pilot attempting to protect ships from German bombers. A small band of soldiers trying to escape back to England. A pleasure boat owner as part of a civilian group volunteering to help retrieve stranded soldiers. In that effort Christopher Nolan, who both wrote and directed, succeeds well.<br/><br/>The Miracle of Dunkirk is important historically because is was early in the war, 1940, and on the order of 400,000 troops were vulnerable. If they were lost then Britain surely would not have been able to succeed later. The effort saved on the order of 338,000 troops when it was all done."

By the way, where is Dunkirk? The director could not even show us a map of where Dunkirk was and the position of the enemy. The rest of the film just shows the enemy attacking the British and the French. The director shows this by going back and forth in time, which makes it difficult to learn the history.

First of all, Dunkirk looks amazing, great cinematography, but so do heaps of other films that come out today. Everything else left me slightly deflated. Especially the corny music.
Seriously I thought you would need a slightly more original approach, if you wanted to belt out another WWII Movie in 2017. For some strange reason I was expecting something I hadn't seen a so many times before. I was hoping for the unbearable pain of waiting on the beach. Instead you get you run of the mill war stories complete with the heroic spitfire pilot, the patriotic old guy, the noble admiral, the good hearted rookie. You get the dive bomber attack, you get the running out of fuel problem, you get the 'oh-my-god-I-m-sinking-and-this-hatch-is-stuck' cliffhanger, you get the sinking ships, emergency landings, getting saved in the nick of time.

"lavatch","Null","0","0","27 December 2017"," ""Wars Are Not Won By Evacuations""
","One of the realizations of Winston Churchill noted in this film is that ""wars are not won by evacuations."" The evacuation of Dunkirk in response to the overwhelming German invasion of northern Europe in May, 1940, led to the successful evacuation of more than 330,000 allied soldiers. As indicated at the start of the film, the traditional way of looking at Dunkirk was as a ""miracle.""<br/><br/>As a war film, the conceptual approach to the Dunkirk evacuation is apparent in the three-pronged visual choices of (a) land, (b) air, and (c) sea. The film proceeds to alternate scenes in the these three spheres to demonstrate the evacuation as it unfolds through courageous British figure pilots, civilian pilots of small ships, and the combined forces of the allied navy and army on the land.<br/><br/>This film experience falls short of expectations as a historical film. There is no attempt to place the narrative in context of what actually happened at Dunkirk. Beyond the heroic evacuation effort, the true miracle was that the German armed forces did not press the matter to thwart the escape. It would have been easy to concentrate German army and air forces to prevent the evacuation. That did not occur because of one of the biggest blunders of World War II in the poor judgment of Adolf Hitler, who hesitated at this moment and, against the advice of his generals, allowed the successful evacuation to occur.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" is clearly intended as a ""feel good"" patriotic film. The harrowing experience of this unique situation is dramatically evoked as the film abruptly shifts from the ""mole"" (the beach redoubt) to the sea (the mad dash to Dover) to the air (the handful of German fighter pilots strafing the shore and the ships.) In the closing credits, the film is dedicated to ""all those whose lives were impacted by the events at Dunkirk."" But the filmmakers do not seem to realize that virtually everyone alive on the planet today falls in that category, due to the stupidity of Hitler."

","I cannot extol this version of what indeed has been viewed historically as the Miracle of Dunkirk. Considering the actual events of war as it spread through Belgium and the machine waging it this evacuation was indeed something special.
What unfolded here was the pathetic self preservation shown by the 'INDOMITABLE' spirited Tommie. I saw no examples of senior NCO's or Officer class organizing squads of those TRAINED riflemen shooting en mass at approaching Stukas. Had these men not heroically made their way from the battle areas where they gallantly held back the German advance. Or were they indeed just cowardly self preserving individuals? No. At the same time as we watch these zombie likes a few miles back up the tracks.
A few miles back the French and many British units were SACRIFICING THEMSELVES to defend this evacuation. The small number of British did such a stalwart job Germans EXECUTED WITH NO MERCY many surrendering troops. This did not go unnoted for the future. 'They WILL REAP THE WHIRLWIND'. And they did through Bomber Harris.
No Nolan showed a bowed and abject army which as did those at Singapore accept the order for every man for himself. Now the advancing German was perhaps a greater fear than the advancing Japanese later but both created forgotten surrendered armies. I suppose those who did manage to survive surrender at Dunkirk were despised opposed to our Nolan view of the celebration of self preserving cowards?.
Yes the non linear story was confusing to a degree. The vignettes a little hard to follow and the authenticity when noticed confusing. No serviceman from the end of the war will surly heap praise on this storytelling. Twenty or so heroes hiding in small boat under fire. No retaliation by them. 
Of some note was a certain Sir Kenneth ' More' Brannagh. More was harbor master in the longest day movie.
The beach at Dunkirk should have had MORE bodies represented than the landings shown by Spielberg In Saving Private Ryan. Yet no attempt to show the scale. Remember the scales when the cameras panned the allied lines in movie WATERLOO.
Music upsetting at times. The RAF were given pride of place and I did not mind that representation. I did enjoy the suggestion that the final plane and pilot continued as a guard over the beach almost miraculously GLIDING under the expertise of brave pilot until it could remain in the air no longer. Gave some satisfaction that they would be counted in the days to come. This was my only appreciative moment of the overall story. I am ex army but see all services as complimentary.

It's definitely not this grand epic that it's been made out to be, it feels more like it wants to be an art-house film but found itself lumbered with a mega-budget to try and use up."

","I was really excited to see this movie, being a big fan of history and all. I was disappointed however when I noticed that the film had a grave issue with pacing. It was as if the director was too excited about the movie he was making and slapped a series of events together.<br/><br/>There are also several different stories going on at once, this just adds to everything being a sloppy mess and lead me to leaving the theater wanting more. While indeed visually pleasing, this one was an overall let-down for me."

"nicholasdoonan","6","0","0","19 December 2017"," A movie you only watch once.
","Okay so i was sceptical about watching this movie and have put off watching it for quite some time but, as it is Christopher Nolan and the IMDb ratings seem to show above average on it, i thought i'd give it a chance seen as i loved all his previous movies. <br/><br/>Boy was i disappointed. .<br/><br/>I don't quite know where Nolan was planning to go with this movie or what it was even for but it is completely out of sync with all his other creations. I wanted to actually turn off the movie half way through it but my liking for Nolan kept me watching until it's pitiful and yet quite anticipated ending. <br/><br/>So the movie starts off with soldiers walking through the streets. Looking at the mess left behind from the still engaging warfare of the french. Then we cut to a young lad, separated from his group, avoiding gunfire, running away to stay alive. It's fast paced and it looks like a great start. THEN... <br/><br/>The young lad ends up at the beach where all the soldiers are waiting to be picked up and taken back home to England. A lot of long staring goes on and a very dramatic run by two soldiers taking an injured soldier to one of the boats prevails, but what was the dramatic music for? We then cut to our only 2 fighter pilots, protecting the skies. They seem to have a good friendship but we don't see any of it materialise until the end where one goes ''come on 
Farrier''. It is hard at this point to actually get on board with any of the characters, whether to like them or dislike them. The majority of the movie is spent watching a young lad trying to get on a board to get back home but keeps meeting obstacles on his way. Eventually, in particular fashion at the end, boats arrive and everyone safely returns home after what felt like eternity. <br/><br/>Conclusion?<br/><br/>I watched this movie purely because it was by Christopher Nolan. If it hadn't been, i wouldn't recommend this to anyone or even watched it myself. It's a movie you would only watch once and this suprises me. I expected so much better from such a great director. It was sloppy, messy and rushed and more importantly... it was just absolutely dull all the way through. <br/><br/>Cillian Murphy had a great part but felt watered down. I really struggled to get on board with anything that was going on.<br/><br/>I wanted to really enjoy this movie, i really did. but i struggled to actually get into anything that was going on. There was no character depth or explanation behind anything that was going on. <br/><br/>*SPOILER HERE....but it's not major so don't worry.*
What was the deal with the young lad that died? Why did he mean so much to the old man and his son? Why was the dramatic music used so much for when ziltch was happening? I mean, literally, dramatic music getting faster and faster and then cuts to silence and nothing? <br/><br/>This movie started off quite promising. Walking the streets in the aftermath of battle, avoiding gunfire and then 3 minutes later, nothing. I feel like it was going to go back and explain why certain things was happening but it never did. I honestly don't understand this movie at all. The majority of the movie felt like a filler. The spitfire scenes were tedious and boring, despite the fact they were probably the only best scenes from the movie. This movie is a ''watch once, never again'' type movie. It had absolutely nothing make you want to come back. You can't like any of the characters because of the character depth being missing and it just felt messy.<br/><br/>I'm genuinely dissapointed that this movie wasn't as good or enjoyable."

","Dunkirk has no substance.
Even if many movies do well with little dialogue, this one couldn't escape unharmed. The large cast and unfocused narrative left little screen time to develop characters, as a result of that approach, the viewer can't connect with any of the many soldiers and civilians shown in this film, so their deaths end up being as shallow as their personalities. It crossed my mind that this could be an issue, taking into account the movie is only 1h 46min long. I was right.
Besides that, all technical aspects of the film are top-notch. Direction, photography, soundtrack, and whatever the rest may be are incredible and really add up to the tension, its only redeeming feature."

"davidbarnby","6","0","0","18 December 2017"," Amazing Action Sequences but...
","Now before we begin I must state that as a combat veteran I hold war movies to a higher degree of scrutiny than most other movie categories. This is primarily because I know the distinct differences between the reality of war and a fictional world. So I will be reviewing based off my own personal experiences as well as a general movie viewer.<br/><br/>The action in Dunkirk was a pure delight to view as most scenes were accurate to real life. It was amazing to see a bomb go off and flames not shoot out all dramatically. Usually movies tend to go the unrealistic and flashy way of flames and fireballs, rather than the accurate version where dirt and debris get kicked up in a storm of shrapnel and death. This added element of realism left me with being immersed in with the battle scenes. <br/><br/>There was also a particular scene I utterly enjoyed where the sounds of troops were drowned out by the roaring engines of planes. This left me smiling as It was a moment few directors latch onto the realism that maybe, just maybe, a giant roaring plane would drown out the noises of the battlefield, which was true to life and reflected how devoted the director was to creating the semblance of a real battle.<br/><br/>Now aside from the actual battle scenes I must comment on the movies score. The score stood out and was quite overbearing. Just when I was immersed into the movie the score would be significantly louder than the events transpiring upon the screen. This happened so often that I got more than a little annoyed. It reminded me of the thumping and beating that happened in Jumanji when the board was calling upon people...except it was at terrible moments and constant throughout.<br/><br/>The main dilemma that significantly dropped my score of Dunkirk was the characters. There was never a moment where I connected with a character and so their life had no significance. Even the portrayal of the few characters there were left me with a bitter taste as I wasn't invested or caring whether they lived or died. It can be bust summed up as white guy #1, white guy #2, and white guy #3. All characters felt like disposable extras, which were copied and pasted from a generic mold of plain and boring people. To elaborate, in Saving Private Ryan you got to hear the backstories of individuals, their jokes and teasing between each other and as that movie progressed each loss was heartfelt. In Dunkirk when someone dies you barely bat an eyelash of concern.<br/><br/>Overall, this movies action was second to none and was riveting and thrilling. Yet, the lack of character development and the overbearing score left me unattached and oftentimes more than a little annoyed. I wanted to see the characters open up and tell their stories. Instead we got emotionless zombies without empathy attempting to survive every obstacle thrown their way. Due to all the aforementioned reasons I rate Dunkirk a solid 6/10. Signing off."

 I had to fight the urge to turn it off every time that ridiculous refrain started scratching its nails across the chalkboard. I only hung in there because the movie was pretty interesting...that and I love WWII movies. I hope the composer, Hans Zimmer stops working after this. Maybe he was just pissed because he's German?

"wallacewery","2","0","0","16 December 2017"," Just... bad
","So, I had great expectations for this movie, but God knows I am disappointed... <br/><br/>First of all, I nearly quit watching after five minutes when I realized the movie had been filmed in nowadays Dunkirk and that absolutely NOTHING had been done to make the city look authentic (the way it was at the time). No, Nolan wanted us to appreciate WW2 british uniforms in a 60s-70s environment... Also, I nearly cryed when I saw that ""british destroyer"", which actaully is a french post-war one. Nolan says he wanted it to look real, which is why he went for a non-authentic but real ship, rather then for CGI. Well, I guess we all make mistakes, right? What would you have thought if they had used an ABRAMS tank instead of an M4A3E8 Sherman in Fury? Sorry, but it's the same thing. <br/><br/>About acting now, the soldiers didn't look frightened, they look bored. The only actor who kind of did his job properly was that guy from ""In Time"" (forgot his name). The rest of them just looked like they were waiting for the movie to end, just like me. <br/><br/>Let's talk about the german forces now. I actually did appreciate those aerial battles, although the germans are, as usual, depicted as inferior to the allies... <br/><br/>I will conclude by saying that ""Dunkirk"" fails to tell the tale of waht was a turning point in WW2."
"Wirxaw","3","0","0","16 December 2017"," I can't believe this was Nolan.
","As a huge fan of Nolan, of his movies, his personality, his approach to cinematography, I can't believe I'm writing this review as it is. I've read a lot of other reviews, I knew that something might be ""weird"", but what I've seen is beyond any hope.<br/><br/>First of all, I think Nolan has tripped over his own ego. Now, I love parallel cinematography. When it is established in a rich movie, when you care about the characters and the plot - yes, watching Inception is a breathtaking thrill, watching Dark Knight is a constant surge of action and Interstellar is just a heartstopper with tears for the cast. This is all good and reasonable. However, when the movie is shot like a... I'm sorry, this is the only thing that comes to mind: Empire at War cinematic mode, where the game camera closes to a random character and shifts every 5 seconds, giving you some cinematic feel to what's going on - it doesn't work. So much in fact that the only movie I can compare Dunkirk to in terms of ""nothingness"" - is Gravity, and this movie I hate with passion. It's almost like a scene that is cut from 10 angles, forcing the screen to flicker while you watch a simple action. The movie doesn't revolve around stages of the evacuation, it doesn't have beginning, all the steps and the outcome. Everything happens in less than a day, as far as I'm supposed to believe, really fairy-tale like. And this whole tiny action is shot from multiple irrelevant angles. With the shots changing so frequently that you not only have issues following through, but you also couldn't care less about what's going on. What was supposed to be ""bloody war"" turned out into a bigger video game than Hobbit.<br/><br/>Secondly - characters. Oh, I've read about that, I knew they would be lacking and I've tried to embrace that desperate perspective that they are all ""meaningless"" in a war. But it doesn't happen. See, if you establish a character, you either follow through or you dispose of him. Yet the four major characters that we are supposed to follow - are absolutely god-protected invulnerable heroes... without a speck of interest in them. In fact, the most developed character in this movie, the one with the most lines, most acting and most care - is the owner of one of the civilian boats that go on to the rescue. Him I quite enjoyed, and if at least half of the cast were built likewise - this movie wouldn't be such a disaster, pun intended. He had an origin story, where he appeared from, he had various impacts on the plot, lots of character interactions, his moral and spirit was established, his skills and precision. But that doesn't apply to everyone.<br/><br/>So, who are these characters? It begins with a bunch of... someone, who clearly is absolutely clueless about the situation, with the main character's key objective is to relieve himself. Yes, that natural call is apparently very important to capture on camera, because it will be repeated later at least once(unsuccessfully, apparently) and for the rest of the movie he, I suppose, will be walking with a pantload of compost. But why do I say clueless? Because we have no idea, ""absolutely"" no idea who are they or where do they come from. We just see that they are seemingly dressed as soldiers, yet they walk around like it's Fallout 4... no, wait, I take it back. Fallout 4 is much more suspenseful. So, when the random gunfire occurs, it just ""takes away"" all the faceless ""whowasthatagain""s with zero blood or anything remotely reminiscent of gunfire animation, people just DROP DEAD like it's a B-rated 1950 with 0 special effects. Now, I confess, I wasn't shot in real life. But I'm pretty sure they weren't head\heartshot by snipers, and a gut or shoulder shot doesn't just force you drop dead. Realism is not a goal of Dunkirk, it seems. Anyway, the protagonist survives, finds a french trench... I mean, a french barricade, introduces himself as ""English"" and that's about it, he enters the next zone - the beach. All in all, this whole scene is so terrible that I remember the gruesomeness, the intensity and the grotesque of Downfall. A child there could navigate the streets better than these... ""whoweretheyagain""s.<br/><br/>This same character later... kind of befriends someone, they try to sneak onto a ship by carrying a wounded person, whom they found to be still alive, yet forgotten. This goes on for some time, and in the end, the ship just gets blown up, and the second major character, the Admiral or somezit, just has to accept that the ship will sink with all the wounded. This immediately brings a serious question to mind - ""why the hell did they even try to save the wounded""? It was mentioned that a single wounded person takes space of seven men. So grouping them on a boat that might just get blown up randomly - isn't a very reasonable, much less humane option. Anyway, some time around that, we are introduced to the third key character - Tom Hardy. He is flying with a couple of planes, one of which will just fall and sink without any explanation, moving on, the other will also fall and sink, but with some explanation which suggests that these ""brilliant spitfires"" apparently had the build quality of a toy plane. Tom Hardy, in turn, will shoot like a stormtrooper for the most part of his half an hour flight, a lot of attention will be centered on how he hopelessly fails to save ""anyone"". But, yes, in the end he manages to finally shoot that Heinkel when it's a clear frontal shot. Hell, he shoots just like me in first-person shooters! I was desperately hoping for some cliched, yet heroic sacrifice of him ramming something, but... no. Instead he flies to Dunkirk on what apparently is long-ended fuel(very reminiscent of Gravity's oxygen scene, even if he is shown to switch to a reserve tank). His floating along Dunkirk beach with his rotor STOPPED is... I don't know. It's like Nolan can now direct Ridley Scott movies, Star Wars and Transformers. All the franchises killed by inconceivable stupidity. I'm no expert, but a cartoon shot from Looney Tunes or Madagascar 2 comes to mind that, when the rotor damn stops - the plane falls down. It's not a kite, it's a huge metal contraption that weights quite a bit. So, instead of properly falling down, like every other plane in the movie, he, against all the rules of aerodynamics, not just glides along the beach, but also manages to fly up and shoot some incoming Messer or something. Not sure I was supposed to care about that. How did he end up? You don't want to know, trust me.<br/><br/>In the end, I'd like to mention music. Again, I've read good and bad stuff about it, but I knew that, technically, there are two types of scores: a Hans Zimmer score and ... not a Hans Zimmer score. What I heard was jawdropping. Throughout the whole movie there wasn't a single memorable tune. That ""evergrowing"" motiff, that ""heart\run imitating"" motiff and, of course, the clocks ticking. Wow. I can understand when a b-rated composer just tries to fill the movie with cheap suspense, but for Hans Zimmer to go down this road of ""nothingness""... I guess Nolan straight ordered the good Zimmer to do as blank of a soundtrack as he could, because this is what the movie needed...and very much deserved. But for Zimmer's professional track, it has to be a very embarrassing flop.<br/><br/>Dunkirk was said to be a 2-hour long action from start to an end. Yet it started as a doozy and ended as a melodrama. With shots throughout having about as much action as that fence-climbing scene from Taken 3. Ouch. And for anyone wondering, I watched it with DTS sound on a 24-bit chip with 24-bit Sony headphones on an extremely crisp amoled screen. So, no, I didn't miss any sound effect. I heard 3D sound with all the depth that it had. I was also not distracted by screen size or color reproduction, it was an HDR experience that may have made a ""few"" scenes worth something, but, ultimately, did not point out any brilliant cinematography. Maybe I needed to watch it in 4K home cinema or some IMAX, but the former is a bit out of my budget for movie entertainment, while for the latter, the reviews say that the whole thing is too loud to properly enjoy. What I do know is that the previous Nolan movies were masterpieces that did not require ANYTHING to be fully enjoyable. Much like watching Wonder Woman made me want to re-watch The First Avenger, so, after Dunkirk, I feel like I need to revisit the better days of Nolan, when movies were packed with action, cinematography, special effects and a soundtrack to remember.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that this flop would be just that - a flop. Everyone makes mistakes by either trying something new or trying something new while horrendously convoluting what they always do. Nolan used to be the CDPR of movie industry. If he learns from this experience, I'll forget Dunkirk ever existed. But if he doesn't, he'll probably become another Ridley Scott. An old director with zero inspiration that keeps shooting the only things he knows how to shoot and whose movies are overrated AF."
"yasiru1991","9","0","0","16 December 2017"," Not Masterpiece But a truly Satisfactory.
","When you hear the name Christopher Nolan , what comes of recent memory for me is Interstellar. So obviously we expect more or the same entertainment from his latest movie which is Dunkirk. I might honestly say that Dunkirk is good but never in the league of Interstellar for me. It did not lived up to the expectations an spectators was looking for after watching Interstellar. That is the reason most people commented that its is horrible , tedious etc But if you take the film Dunkirk as a standalone film its good. I like the Story line and most importantly the fact that Nolan did not make any character the Perfect Savior or Super Hero in the movie. It really helped to pour out even the smallest of different emotions minor characters as well. And Most importantly highlights the fact that in war everyone is important and everyone is a hero in some context. I like that.<br/><br/>Next most Important factor which attracted me to this film and give me a 9/10 is this. Some films have done this past really well but Dunkirk also will rank in my mind as one of the best who could give this feeling in a very touchy way. It is like this. Nolan enters our minds to his film straight away to the middle of the chaos. Its war, bullets, death, sorrow ,fear from the 1st minute. So in a nonstop way , we a cramped with fear and death right to the end Then the soldiers get into train and come to a station with the bright sun shining over their heads. What they can see from their windows is a beautiful and peaceful valley with innocent people enjoying their ordinary life and routine without fear. This is a killer feeling for me. Because you do not understand the value of your ordinary, boring life style unless you are made to experience a thing like in Dunkirk. These soldiers may have surely felt how precious and lucky to have lived an ordinary life as these people without fear and death right at their noses every second. <br/><br/>This is a very special feeling for me and most people do not realize the value of their own boring lifestyle. Nolan has managed to insert this feeling really well with his plot and hence i will go with 9. But actually its 8.5 kinda film."

","Another movie about the Second World War and another one with the same subject, after more than 20 others were done on exactly the same subject, the best being probably ""Dunkirk"" (1958), directed by Leslie Norman, with John Mills, Richard Attenborough and many others. I also enjoy the war films, don't get me wrong, but too much has been done, only I have seen a few thousands, from 1961 until 2017, made by Americans, Russians, Germans, French, Japanese, Italian, English, Yugoslavs, Hungarians, Romanians, Bulgarians, Poles, etc. This new Dunkirk is well done, realistic and spectacular, but useless in a world in preparation for a third world war... We got many other more actual and interesting subjects which nobody has the guts to approach... Back to this film: all the actors are OK, the direction and the cinematography OK, the special effects also. A personal point, everything we see on the screen seems too clean, it looks too much as a movie, if you know what I mean, the reality of those days was certainly quite different, much more misery, chaos, slaughter, etc. I would have wanted to see at least one soldier in a shattered uniform, broken into many pieces, the ships and the boats look like new ones, fresh painted, the streets and the buildings in the first 5 minutes the same...

","There are countless stories of courage and bravery that made their way out of World War II, but perhaps none more famous or as inspirational (at least to us British) as the story, or miracle, of the Dunkirk evacuation. Following the six-week long Battle of France, Allied forces found themselves holed up on the beaches of Dunkirk and surrounded by German forces. Over the course of eight days, over 300,000 troops were rescued by a hastily assembled civilian navy of fishing boats, yachts and lifeboats called into action from Britain. Although Churchill was quick to remind the people that ""wars are not won by evacuations,"" the incident became a symbol of British stiff-upper lipped stoicism and a powerful propaganda tool.
Many movies have covered the event, from 1942's Mrs. Miniver to 2007's Atonement, as well as Leslie Norman's underrated 1958 film Dunkirk. But none have managed to capture the sheer horror of the situation these troops found themselves in as Christopher Nolan's latest, which is an out-and-out masterpiece of technical wizardry and raw, grinding sound design. Long a passion project for the director, Dunkirk drops you into the thick of the action from the get-go with the welcome assumption that audiences will enter the film with at least some prior knowledge, and doesn't let up until the very end of its relatively short 106 minute running-time with the constant ticking of what feels like an ever-present clock. Nolan is determined to put you through the wringer, and does so by placing you up close and personal with the men on land, at sea, and in the air.
The closest person we have to a leading character is Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), a young and resourceful grunt who stumbles onto the beach after evading the Germans. He quickly plots his escape by attempting to board a boat carrying a wounded soldier, and later teaming up with a young soldier played by Harry Styles (who is absolutely fine) as they try desperately to survive the growing carnage. At sea, proud mariner Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) sets sail from Britain to rescue ""our boys"" and do his part in the war. Picking up a shell-shocked soldier played by Cillian Murphy on the way, Dawson must navigate oil-soaked waters with burning ships all around and avoid the German planes screaming in the sky. Battling the Luftwaffe in the air are Spitfire pilots Farrier (Tom Hardy) and Collins (Jack Lowden), the former having to carry out his duty without the aid of his fuel gauge.
These stories do not take place chronologically, a gimmick now something of a Nolan trademark. While this works wonders in a film like Memento, it adds an unnecessary layer of confusion to the unfolding narrative in Dunkirk, occasionally removing you from the action as you try and establish where we are in the story. With Nolan's decision to do away with any backstory to the characters - who are still fully realised and wonderfully performed - there's also a lack of emotional investment. Yet it could be argued that this approach only adds to the fog of war and the terrifying randomness of combat, and this is the most thrilling depiction of battle since 1998's Saving Private Ryan, only without the spatter and gore. Nolan also avoids flag-waving patriotism and finger-pointing, something that Spielberg's Oscar-winner failed to do. Although it's not the complete masterpiece many of us hoped for (although I suspect the majority will disagree), Dunkirk is one of Nolan's most accomplished and dazzling pieces of work. It may not move you, but it will leave you in awe."

Except going into something like that you don't expect anything amazing, you know they aren't spending a lot on it and you're happy with just a few puffs of smoke and someone chucking fireworks around. They're just doing the best they can and it's at least interesting to watch for half an hour.<br/><br/>That's this film in a nutshell except with $100M chucked at it and it is honestly puzzling where that money possibly went. There's no dramatic shots of hundreds of thousands of soldiers cowering on the beach amongst all the abandoned vehicles and equipment whilst coming under hellish fire and no epic shots of hundreds of ships lining up to desperately get them off the beach. No, what we get is 2% of that scene without any CGI to fill in the gaps. A small group of soldiers on a pristine beach with a few boats and planes chucked in and about as much action, drama and suspense as a kid's school play.<br/><br/>Not only does this totally fail to capture the horror of Dunkirk or properly portray the story but it is just a complete mystery how something that looks this amateur possibly cost $100M to make. For reference here: Saving Private Ryan cost $70M and was made almost 20 years ago when special effects were far more basic, Black Hawk Down cost $92M in 2001, Hacksaw Ridge only $40M in 2016 and the Siege of Jadotville I can't even find information for (probably because it was so low budget). All of these films not only made for dramatic visual spectacles and incredible stories (even if some took many liberties on the truth) but they also truly showed how horrific war is. Dunkirk just makes it look like a day at the beach with a little minor peril thrown in. Even the short Dunkirk scene in Atonement ($30M) created far more gripping and spectacular visuals of the evacuations and that's not even really a war film. I've seen BBC war documentaries with far better re-enactments than Dunkirk. Even if you adjust for inflation since 1998 for Saving Private Ryan the budget only comes out barely higher than for Dunkirk and they achieved so, so much more for it... not to mention paying fortunes to the big names in it.<br/><br/>Honestly what Dunkirk reminded me of most was one of the propaganda films they're trying to make in Their Finest on a shoestring budget by filming boats in paddling pools from clever angles. Except without the cleverness. Apparently lots of the shots were based on photos of the actual event showing troops lining up on the beaches... but it's like they didn't realise those photos showed only a small section of the beach and there was a lot more stuff going on out of frame. They also apparently never saw any of the photos showing the masses of abandoned tanks, vehicles and weapons because the beach is beautifully empty. I don't know... perhaps the local council only gave them permission to shoot for a couple hours and didn't want to be clearing away props for days. Certainly not what you'd expect for something with a budget that eclipses pretty much every war film before it. Really the only explanation is that 90% of the budget went on overhyping the hell out of this film and suckering people into sitting through it...<br/><br/>
Pile on top of this the poor direction choices, lack of characterisation, dialogue and pretty much anything else of any substance and the mystery becomes less about the finances and more about why anyone would think this is a good film."

"carlos37andre","9","0","0","13 December 2017"," Who said that a movie always need a main character and a backstory for him?
","That's really my only question for those who doesn't like the movie. Seriously guys, who said that? Where is written this ""cinema rule""? <br/><br/>Look, I'm saying this, because the only main issue that I hear people saying is that ""the movie doesn't develop any main character, any backstory for no one, etc etc etc"". Well, about this, the only thing I had to say is: The movie is about the war.<br/><br/>And, OMG, he is so well built on that, to the first second of the movie to the final one's, you're in the war, in a dirty, dense and sad war, when everyone's goal is to go home. And that is it, the movie is quite short (and this is a good thing), and straight to the point, the main goal is to pass this image and he succeeds.<br/><br/>In my opnion, this whole ""no one knows any one in the war"" thing was amazing! Becausa this is problably the sad true, on this situations you will not have a ""hey, where you from? Do you have family?"" moments, around the campfire and stuff, so people die alone, people die besides other people that they dont even know the name, and this is it. Trully this was one of the things that I most love about the movie, it is simplistic in a way, while it does something that amost any war movie did in the whole movie history.<br/><br/>Well, but this leave me on the thing that I find the most ""weird"" down there, still on this whole ""no history characters"" thing, problably the only moment that the movie tries to do something like this, it kind of floops. See, it isn't ""bad"", ""awful"" or anything like that, but (with out spoilers) in the middle of the film we see one especific character passing through a really tough moment, and I had two thoughts about that: (1) Only that only thing was strong enogh to do all this with the guy? (2) They try to build a emotional background, and a history connect with a newspaper that really dont get me, ""hero at Dunkirk"", ooh, come on, why? I know, I'm not complain about this especific thing on the history, in the majority of the movie it will work, but just doesn't fit here, that was not the type of movie that they were building.<br/><br/>But just this little thing doens't take out all the great thing that the movie has. Of course, we need to talk about the cinematography, the stunts and extra work, it's great, amazing, beautifull, in fact, I dont have words to describe this part of the movie, is simply mind blowing, I never saw anything like that. Paraphrasing one of my favorite movie critics (Chris Stuckman) ""this is simply what movie was invented for"", that is the best way to describe what this movie does.<br/><br/>In short, Dunkirk is a beautiful movie, that break some walls and run of the cliches out there, in a great and sad history, that at the same time shows the best and the worst of the humankind.<br/><br/>9,5/10"

","I love movies, all genres, and I don't deliberately knock a movie just for the sake of it. But this was a bore-fest. How could any director take a pivotal moment in the Second World War, a truly dramatic, heroic, incredible rescue of 300,000 trapped men, and serve it up in this sleep-inducing monotonous style? From the first moments the soundtrack grates on your ears...imagine being in a huge thousand car traffic jam and all the other motorists are honking their horns at the same time and you put your fingers in your ears to try and block out the sound but it seeps through anyway...that's what this soundtrack is like. Now I recognize that some of the scenes are technically well filmed, but there was a lack of dramatic build up of tension, it was filmed like some kind of long dream sequence. Really,it was more like a cure for insomnia. I really expected this to be a great movie, especially after reading the first reviews, but it was a turkey and left me cold. Where was the fleet of little boats and ships that was at the centre of this event? Conspicuous by their absence. My honest advice is wait for it to appear on DVD...and then...don't rent it!!!"

"senor_spielbergo123","Null","0","0","11 December 2017"," A survival thriller set in WWII
","Although the time frame on the Dunkirk beach is a week (not sure if this is historically accurate), Nolan found a clever way to convey the sense of urgency and time pressure by mixing it with different time spans of 1 hour (Spitfires in air) and 1 day (ships on sea). Let's get one thing out of the way right up front: The camera-work (including IMAX scenes) is just marvelous. <br/><br/>Whereas war movie classics such as Saving Private Ryan shined by the character arcs and the writing, Dunkirk is a totally different beast. You could say this is a war movie where the complete 1st act is missing as it starts right at the battle. A more conventional movie for example would have shown the protagonists being introduced in boot camp (Full Metal Jacket) or when they enrolled to go to war (Gallipoli). By this unconventional choice Nolan dodges a lot of war movie clichés (which is refreshing to any viewer who has seen it all a hundred times before), but also trades off a lot of potential depth the movie could have had.<br/><br/>It felt a bit anonymous, but maybe that just emphasizes how unimportant individual lives in these wars are. On the other hand, if it had let's say flashback backstory scenes cut in, this would only have slowed down the incredible pace and tension. As it is, the movie has maximum effectiveness in what it tried to do: Become a survival movie set in WWII. Sure, I don't know anything about the soldier we're following on his way to the beach (I'm not even sure his name gets mentioned), but boy, was I sitting on the edge of my seat as he tries to survive throughout the movie.<br/><br/>And this is where Hans Zimmer comes in. The score ramps up this tension. I like to compare this movie to a Wagner opera: You're really on edge the whole time. This is not a lazy couch movie. Of the whole run-time there was maybe half an hour in total where my heart was not racing. The sound design was something that I criticized in Interstellar, because it overcasts the dialogue. But given that most of characters speak less words in Dunkirk than I wrote in this review so far, this is not a concern here. (Acting is fine, however, by the way.)<br/><br/>Much like Nolan's earlier work I can see how it is a polarizing movie to audiences, but without a doubt it is something special. I prefer this any day to the average Marvel popcorn entertainment movie. Ironically, Marvel characters might be more fleshed out, but in a Marvel movie you never fear for anyone's life. It is like a James Bond movie, to give another example: you know exactly that despite all the insane action his life is not at risk. But in this movie, despite knowing that 300,000 soldiers survived, you feel like everything's on stake. <br/><br/>High praise to the technical capabilities of everyone involved in achieving this."

","This isn't how war movies are usually made, and I can see why people have slight dislike towards it. Film tells about the event, not about the people caught in it, so they are treated more like tools for storytelling instead of as characters. Personally I have no problem with this, since there are enough character-driven films about war and I'm glad to see something different. I also think this suits Nolan just fine, because I've always seen him as a filmmaker more engineer-minded instead of as a storyteller. Visually this is indeed a spectacular film, composed with almost exclusively perfect shots. Film's structure with it's three interfering POV's could be seen as an easy gimmick to make film more memorable. For now it's the best movie of summer 2017."

","I even do not know why I rated this movie with 2 stars instead of 1. Maybe because of the effort put in with an apparent faith for the picture itself as the cast shows and as this is a war genre movie.<br/><br/>Yet, what did we learn, what did we sense after all? Let me help you with that. Now, we only see heroic British people who are called as ""home"" by Kenneth Branagh which is supposed to be an emotional statement I guess. But it is not. It only reminds me Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge which is another patriotic approach over cinema. There is no ""Thin Red Line"" or ""Paths of Glory"" before us, not at all. It is only another warning for the rising of nationalism around the world. Make a choice now, which was more effective about a nation's heroic display, U.K or U.S.A?<br/><br/>By the way, who felt sorry for George anyway? I know we are supposed to, but, you know, Nolan was kind of saying ""you know these things happen, feel sorry, pity, empathize with, go on, what else do you expect? I demonstrated, you should interrelate yourself with it."" But poor Chris, does he think it is only about demonstration, I wonder. No way to get in touch with any of these characters here.

"KamSinghOfficial","10","5","16","24 July 2017"," Best War Movie Since Apocalypse Now
","Out of all the war movies made every year, there was one that is considered the greatest. That is Apocalypse Now. Now there is finally a film which can compare to that in terms of total intensity, direction, cinematography, story, war scenes, and suspense. This is tied for the best war movie of all time with Apocalypse now.<br/><br/>It is straight up, one of the most tense films you will ever see. The first second of the film, it puts you in the middle of the war on the beaches of Dunkirk where over 300 000 soldiers are waiting to be rescued. You don't need character development in this film as it is not meant to show individual characters. It is meant to show the evacuation of Dunkirk itself, therefore you don't need characters to be developed in this film. The way Christopher Nolan tells this story is only a way in which he could pull it off. There is three narratives or three different stories going on that ultimately end up merging together. The first narrative is about the soldiers on the beach. The second narrative is about the normal people who took their boats and risked their lives to go to Dunkirk and save soldiers trapped at sea. The third narrative is in the air and shows the intense dogfights which occurred in the air. <br/><br/>In this film, you will not look away as it keeps you in suspense all the way through out. If you look away, you will surely miss something. This is the most intense film i have ever seen and it deserves the debate to be called the best war film of all time. It is the best film in the year 2017 and i would be surprised if it gets snubbed in the Oscars."

The movie in general is quite good and the acting is very convincing, however, the movie is very tense and you can barely take a break to breath. Also, the movie has only one theme and doesn't have many events nor ups and downs, it's all one theme for the whole movie. It felt to me like it was one big prolonged shot of just one scene(Although it is obviously not).

"slicedbread117","10","4","12","1 September 2017"," Mesmerizing to the Mind, Chilling to the Bone
","Christopher Nolan. The master visionary whose prestigious reputation alone creates enormous excitement for any film his name is attached to, a distinction that few, if any directors have. Films such as The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar, to name a few, are held at the height of standard for the film industry, and now, Nolan can add another to his mountain of masterpieces; Dunkirk.<br/><br/>To put into simple terms, this is Nolan's film, through and through. As the director and sole writer, he crafts his vision of the historic events that transpired at Dunkirk into an absolute spectacle. Nolan's name is the definition of cinematography, and with his dedication to practicality and shooting with film over digital, Dunkirk marks itself as one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen. The scale and authenticity creates an enthralling atmosphere, one that didn't allow my eyes to leave the screen. Few directors can write a film largely devoid of dialogue and still draw you in with its visual display alone, but lo and behold, Dunkirk does just that.<br/><br/>Dunkirk's narrative is thematically entrenched, with Nolan's writing largely focused on the greater, larger story of survival in a time of desperation. As stated, there's hardly any dialogue, you barely get to know the character's names, yet you feel emotionally ensnared throughout the 106 min run time. The flawless movement and pacing between three major settings (The Mole, The Air and The Sea) creates a superb execution of intense storytelling. Every action sequence is heart-racing, with the overwhelming feeling of danger looming in every action scene. Dunkirk is one of the most riveting World War II-set stories in film history, surpassing the likes of even 'Saving Private Ryan'. <br/><br/>As visually stunning as Dunkirk is, the film would be nothing without the unparalleled musical mind of Hans Zimmer. Zimmer's genius is on full display in Dunkirk. The score is nothing short of captivating, with even the simple ticking of a pocket watch (how it was actually recorded) having the ability to drive you to a point of bursting at the level of intensity and anticipation being showcased on screen. The entire audible side of Dunkirk is chillingly wonderful. The roar of a fighter plane, the startling crack of a gun shot, or the massive bang of a sudden explosion all help produce that astonishing atmosphere, the film simply wouldn't be the same without the masterful audio.<br/><br/>Nolan did his research, and found that, like the soldiers trapped in Dunkirk, his actors needed to (mostly) be young and inexperienced to convey that sense of fear to the audience. The cast is genuinely spectacular. There's the veteran anchors of the film such as Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance but its the young up-and-comers that really stand out. Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard and even pop music star Harry Styles all portray their characters wonderfully, largely using their facial expressions and inner emotions to invoke the sense of danger the film presents to the audience. I was moved and felt connected to these characters, a great testament to the acting prowess of the cast. <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan. His top-tier ability has propelled him into levels rarely seen in cinema, a level of legendary status. The vision for Dunkirk was a bold one indeed, but the artistic wisdom and willpower of Nolan fuels the film into a mesmerizing sight to behold, a legitimate masterpiece and what some would consider to be Nolan's magnum opus.<br/><br/>10/10"

","With not one,but two birthdays coming up,I went into town to get some presents. Deciding to go to the cinema,I talked to a fellow IMDber who praised Christopher Nolan's latest, which led to me seeing the Dunkirk spirit.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Retreating to Dunkirk, thousands of Allied forces wait to be taken back to the UK,as the Axis troops close in. Answering a call from the Royal Navy for private boats to go and help collect soldiers, Mr. Dawson tells the Navy that he will run the ship himself. Getting agreement from the Navy, Dawson is joined by his son Peter and his friend George,who set sail for the battleground of Dunkirk.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Backed by a hypnotic,rumbling score from Hans Zimmer,writer/director Christopher Nolan departs from his traditional dialogue-driven structure for a spectacular (done largely with practical effects) visual assault. Closely working with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema from a 76 page screenplay, Nolan places the viewers feet on the Dunkirk beach, with sand,mud and oil being rubbed across the screen.<br/><br/>Told by Dunkirk veterans that the soundtrack was louder than the actual evacuation (!) Nolan brilliantly uses sounds to turn the gears of war, with the clanging of metal, the rattle of bullets and the screeching of planes heightening the atmosphere of emergency built on the beach. Working from a sparse screenplay, Nolan does very well at using the rough outlines of the characters to place the viewers in the shoes of the Dawson's on the ship,the RAF pilots in the air,and the soldiers, trying to survive on the beach of Dunkirk"

"buiminh2000","8","4","12","23 July 2017"," Don't get all the hate
","I was extremely excited for this movie, but after seeing some of the negative reviews on IMDb, I kinda grew skeptical. And boy oh boy, did it blow me away! I will try to rebuke common criticisms towards this movie as best as possible. Sorry English is not my first language. 1. Lack of character development/background story makes it difficult to empathize with the characters: This is somewhat true. When the movie starts, it gets right into the action without introducing the main characters. Frankly, I got irritated at first when I had to follow these characters whom i knew nothing about. But as the film progressed, their personalities started to manifest through their actions, and I naturally grew to care for them. I know some moviegoers prefer/demand to know more about their background stories, for example: do they have loved ones at home? did they commit crimes before?, etc. Personally, I think that has been in every other Hollywood war movies, and Nolan isn't known for beating a dead horse, but for inventing/pioneering new, unconventional ways in telling a story. I think it's refreshing to see the characters being characterized through the little actions that they take. Generally, people who bash this movie tend to compare it to Hacksaw Ridge, saying that they care more about Desmond Doss than any other character in this movie. To be honest, I just don't care about him at all. He is just the typical heroic type we have seen in other movies, so it just seems unlikely that such character will die. There is absolutely no stake at all in that movie. On the contrary, in Dunkirk, non of the character fits the heroic type; they all strive for survival. Such a realistic take on war makes it more likely that at least one of the main character will die. 2. Non-linear story telling makes the movie confusing: Personally, I didn't find any problem following this movie, simply because Nolan is so masterful in creating a flow that connects one scene to another. Despite being unchronological, three different stories in this movie are beautifully interwoven: they all complement each other in painting the Dunkirk battle in the audience's mind, and ultimately *minor spoiler* become one in the most beautiful way. I'd posit that this technique Nolan employs does not hinder but makes the movie more interesting and unique"
"moneyboy","8","4","12","22 July 2017"," Dunkirk @ IMAX 1570: A Must See
","Caught this @ Imax on Thursday night on the 1570 viewing.<br/><br/>It's a beautifully crafted film. Zimmer's score drones throughout creating a sense of non-stop tension and foreboding. It's relentless, almost fatiguing in parts. The sound-stage and the score really make the film. You hear and feel so much of the film. It was bloody loud in parts. I could have been Tom Hardy's co-pilot and still couldn't hear or understand a word he said.<br/><br/>Nolan once again uses time as a motive, utilising a non-linear structure telling three separate stories that intersect during the Battle of Dunkirk. It's done very well. The cast is very good throughout, all giving solid performances.<br/><br/>My only criticism would be that it was pretty tame and a somewhat low- key rendition of the Battle of Dunkirk. It's almost minimalist in parts.<br/><br/>Very, very solid filmmaking. <br/><br/>Will watch this again as I think the Imax experience was a little overwhelming and all encompassing at times – the dog fights, dive- bombing and air scenes were intense!<br/><br/>Definitely an early contender for awards season."
"makris-66043","9","4","12","22 July 2017"," One of the most realistic depictions of war in cinema history
","Many war movies in the past have focused on character development and heroes within a battle. However Dunkirk showcases the horrific aspects of war to a greater extent than ever seen. Nolan encapsulates the terror of battle, the desperation for freedom and above all suspends the viewer in constant anxiety thanks to Hans Zimmer's excellent yet terrifying score. Above all this movie was just real; some might say to its detriment but personally I have never walked out of cinema so speechless in my entire life. Nolan's inability for mediocrity is exemplified with Dunkirk."

","The wait is finally over. This is the most excited I've been to watch a movie in years. And it sure was worth the wait.<br/><br/>To sum up this movie in one line: ""Nolan does justice to war."" But for someone who has recently been obsessed by the happenings of WW2, I'd go so far as to say Nolan has given us one for the ages. Every shot, every scene has been carefully constructed so as to elicit the perfect reaction from the audience. There is minimal dialogue. Nolan has received criticism for over-explaining things in previous movies. Here he takes a total 180° turn in that regard, giving us one of the most realistic portrayals of war while keeping it truly engaging.<br/><br/>You would do well to know a little about the miracle of Dunkirk before stepping into the theater. Nolan makes no excuses for you as the audience. His approach towards telling the story is unique in that few war movies have zero backstory. This also helps to keep the movie tight and gripping from start to finish.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer is in his element. Stellar performances from the ensemble cast. <br/><br/>Nolan's best? Definitely right up there."

The acting, effects, sound, and all in-between was fantastic! The pacing would seem awful at first look, but it keeps you on the edge of you seat! You will be in the middle of a fast paced action scene , when it cuts to a more slow, calm shot. This works so well in the factor of: ""Whoa! What Will happen next?"" All the time.<br/><br/>My only two complaints- The character development was minimal, and you hardly knew anybody's names.<br/><br/>And there was sometimes buzzing from one of the soldier's microphone. I don't know if it was a mishap with the theater's speakers, though.<br/><br/>My rating - 9.5 / 10"

","After a recent viewing experience of the extraordinary trilogy of Batman, I realized, though quite belatedly, that, other than the innovative narration of a superhero's complicated life at the beginning, another appealing antithesis of Mr. Nolan's renditions to what's typical of the assortment of monotonous kicking ass movies is nothing but those phenomenal orchestrations of music. Exhilaratingly, Dunkirk not only repeats it but make the movie look like the long, detailed music video featuring Hans Zimmer. Great! <br/><br/>The theme, reunion at home, is also very sentimental for citizens from a once war- stricken country in that the graphic rendition of instant co-operations between civilians and soldiers truly plucks the heartstrings of those who learned how their country, after innumerable cities being burnt to the ground, finally won the right to live because of similar ties of solidarity. Not a British, I do feel the venerable patriotism shown in every move of those volunteer captains. Thanks. <br/><br/>All in all, the enlightening partnership of these two genius again brings forward a world-class application of cinematography. Hope to see much more!"

","I spent an hour reading reviews and I am honestly amazed by how stupid some people are.<br/><br/>''The characters had no background or development, I didn't care for them.'' They weren't suppose to have any of that. Those few ''main'' characters are there to represent thousands of men who were in Dunkirk. It's not about a single person, a single soldier. They were basically a metaphor for everyone who fought there, or even in entire WW2. And not caring about the characters? God, I cared. I cared so much for each and every soldier I saw and I was hoping they'd get home eventually. I was on the edge of my seat, on the verge of crying.<br/><br/>''The scenes cut off and sometimes I didn't know whose perspective I was watching.'' Does it really freaking matters? I loved the fact scenes cut off and that at the times I was confused and needed a moment to catch up.<br/><br/>''I couldn't follow the story because scenes cut off and the story was non linear.'' Can't help you there, you're just stupid.<br/><br/>''The sounds were so loud and the music annoying.'' THAT WAS THE BEST PART. IT SET THE MOOD FOR EVERYTHING. THE TICKING, THE SUSPENSE... IT WAS BRILLIANT.<br/><br/>''I didn't see Germans, we needed more battle scenes.'' Once again, that wasn't the point. The Germans didn't matter. It was those soldiers that mattered. Their lives. The movie wasn't about the war, or fighting. It was about men fighting for their lives and fighting to get home. The movie didn't need Germans or more fighting. We got British perspective because that's what Nolan wanted and he did a goddamn great job. <br/><br/>To conclude, this is the second war movie I've ever cared about. Next to Schindler's list. This is my first Nolan movie. And now I'm gonna go watch all his other movies and be glad I'm living at the same time as this damn genius. If I could rate this movie higher than 10, I WOULD."
"LongLiveTheNewFlesh27","9","3","8","5 August 2017"," One of Nolan's best films yet...
","Christopher Nolan is an admirable filmmaker. Every time he comes up to bat, he swings for the fences. Sometimes he misses (The Dark Knight Rises, Interstellar) and sometimes he succeeds wildly (Memento, The Dark Knight, Inception). Dunkirk is a wild success, and may rank as one of my favorite of his films. The film immediately throws you into the action and never lets up, taking you on a journey that is intense, terrifying and incredibly satisfying. Technically, the film is impeccable. The cinematography is gorgeous. Nolan uses both 70mm and IMAX cameras, giving the film both an epic and a claustrophobic look. The score is brilliant, using a ticking clock motif that never lets up. The film is also complexly structured, following land, air and sea and the different stories that take place in each different area. Dunkirk jolts back and forth in time to tell each of these stories, and honestly, I think it works all the better for it. It gives you the feel of the confusion and chaos of war. At this point, I'm not sure if this movie is a 10/10 yet. I'd have to go see it again, but as it stands, it is a very solid 9/10. Go see it on the biggest screen possible."

(I know it's based on a real story but...)<br/><br/>Also that plane flies for AGES without fuel.<br/><br/>However, it has some very suspenseful, tense setpieces and great sound design and visuals."
"evan_harvey","8","3","8","3 August 2017"," Excellent, if lacking a little
","Dunkirk: bit of a mixed experience for me, but overall, it was really well done and I left the cinema thinking about it, which is more than I can say about the majority of films these days. As Churchill said ""we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations."" The first hour dragged a bit, and I'm not sure I really got a sense of what it was like on the beaches (from wikipedia: ""Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective mole onto 39 British destroyers of the Royal Navy and civilian merchant ships, while others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water""). Apparently some Dunkirk veterans claimed it accurately depicted the events though.<br/><br/>The aerial sequences are excellent, and despite the RAFs involvement, a recurring theme in survivors' accounts is that they never saw the RAF in the skies above them. Apparently around 50 Spitfires were lost during the evacuation period. The Little Ships part is likewise excellent, and central to capturing the sense of duty and heroism of the civilian crews.<br/><br/>The film does suffer a little from not having a central character narrative, which can leave the impression that it's a bit cold and clinical. Depending on your view, this could be a negative or a positive. I ended up viewing it as a positive. The coldness serves to heighten the sense of tragedy about it, and it was a tragedy. The director said that he chose not to delve into character stories, as that's not the point: the point is the overall disaster and the evacuation. I would've liked a better depiction of the brave French (and other nationalities) soldiers who stayed (and died) to protect the evacuation.<br/><br/>The three interwined stories (the mole, the sea and the air) were handled well, although the timeline is, in typical Nolan style, mixed up for dramatic effect. Overall, a great film. See it for a dose of realism and history amongst the weak crud that Marvel churns out."
"statuskuo","7","3","8","3 August 2017"," An Experience
","This isn't a movie. It's an experience. So I treated it as such and walked away...disoriented, since you really feel like you are there. Watch it in IMAX 70mm 15/70 rather than 5 perf 70mm.<br/><br/>For an American like me, I'm not entirely sure what the big deal was. But to Brits it meant a lot. When the stranded soldiers are desperately wanting to get off the island, the German soldiers were closing in. Problem...you never fully sense the horror of the war like the beginning of ""Saving Private Ryan"" Instead, you get a relatively quiet movie based on a rescue mission. The battle was an absolute failure but the victory was in its retreat. Interesting concept.<br/><br/>With most of Nolan's movies...what can you expect except total immersion. For that...what an accomplishment. For others who hate on Nolan for being...Nolan, you probably will hate on this too."
"lessardjoseph-558-701267","6","3","8","3 August 2017"," Good war movie, but not great.
","It was a good movie as far as visual effects. However, there was very little acting. The movie made the German air force look small and inept. Whereas the RAF fighter was able to fight on, and on, and on, and fly forever without fuel, and shoot down German planes faster than Rambo mowing down Russians with AK-47s, The aircraft also never ran out of ammunition, like a cop in an action movie who never reloads and shoots hundreds of bullets. If you have an aviation background like me, you will know that with weight and balance issues, bullets are limited to a certain amount. My other issue, being a person of french descent, was the total lack of time given to the french soldiers who held the line so that the British could escape. The french fought bravely, unlike many Americans think. But they suffered from poor generalship at the time. They had better tanks than the Germans, but these were poorly deployed. Overall, despite these mistakes, it was a good weekend movie. I gave it 6 stars."
"q-93285","7","3","8","2 August 2017"," A reasonable review
","This is a reasonable review that will surely disappoint both sides - the ones that love it and the ones that hate it.<br/><br/>Nolan has such a huge, loyal following that this film would be loved no matter what. As of now, this film has shot up the IMDb top 250 and is currently at number 55. <br/><br/>No. This film, is not the 55th best film of all time. That's completely unreasonable. <br/><br/>Before you call me a hater, my favorite film of all time is Inception. I loved Nolan's Batman films (and I normally don't like Batman films) and Memento, as well as Interstellar and the amazing The Prestige (also in my top 10).<br/><br/>But this film is not that good.<br/><br/>I saw this film yesterday a few weeks after it came out. The volume was completely normal. People criticized the ultra-loud soundtrack, but it seems that this was adjusted somehow because the audio was not just not-very-loud, it might have been a little on the soft side. (For the sake of reference: I saw it in a big North American theater in IMAX.)<br/><br/>I know what people mean when they say ""loud"" when referring to Nolan's films. Inception was very loud and The Dark Knight Rises was the loudest film I've ever heard/seen in my life. So I'm not doubting anyone.<br/><br/>As to the film - I don't get why Hardy was cast in this film. I'm not sure what his contribution was - other than bring his big name to the investors of the film. It really could've been anyone else and would not have made any difference.<br/><br/>I like the fact that they used a lot of practical effects and huge numbers of extras, but why didn't they use CGI to augment the production. I don't see it as practical-vs-CGI, they can be used together. Oh well.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was okay. Nothing special. Sometimes it added to the mood, sometimes it was annoying and distracting. <br/><br/>The use of celluloid film instead of digital was interesting. The film had a nice grain to it, I like the saturation of analog film and since this was a movie set in the past, the use of film was appropriate.<br/><br/>Overall a good film. I don't get the 10 star reviews or the 1 star ones and I feel that the 10-star ones have a Nolan bonus while the 1-star ones are compensating for the 10-star ones or have systems where instead of not- awarding stars for something they didn't like or something missing, are instead giving minus stars for every flaw until there are no points left to deduct.<br/><br/>Be reasonable. 7/10. I may watch it again, but not anytime soon."
"eshwarmail","8","3","8","31 July 2017"," Dramatic, twisted and uplifting. Not the best of Nolan, but a great attempt to retell an almost harrowing story
","It can be a presumed general consensus that it is easier to become a star actor than a star director. While some enjoy cult following, others are more mainstream. Very few among them are able to consistently balance between the both which is where Christopher Nolan stands on a pedestal among his contemporaries. Nolan had a strong cult following throughout the early part of his career and then 'The Dark Knight' happened. The fans were at a fever pitch during conclusion of the trilogy with chants like ""in Nolan we trust"" reverberating the entire social media; there is no such precedence for a movie director. <br/><br/>'Operation Dynamo' which is a code name for the evacuation of Allied soldiers from Dunkirk is a widely recorded operation that took place at the end of May 1940. When the British Expeditionary Forces along with French and Belgian armies were trapped in France surrounded by Nazi Germany troops at the height of their power, the only way out seemed to be an evacuation from Dunkirk which had adequate port facilities. <br/><br/>The story is said from 3 perspectives - <br/><br/>LAND: Where the ground troops are desperate to find their way to any of the ships available that can ferry them home; <br/><br/>SEA: Told from the view of crew of one among many merchant navy and personal boats which came to the rescue <br/><br/>AIR: A Spitfire squadron of three in lookout for any Luftwaffe threats<br/><br/>The thing that strikes you most is the fact that you are in the middle of the operation as soon as the movie starts without a background or a narrative (even when I was not expecting one). The gloomy vista of the beach, pale and desperate soldiers, a body here and there sets up the chaotic but silent atmosphere without hardly a word being said. The electrifying yet subtle background score keeps you at the edge of your seat and takes the overall experience up a notch. A similar compliment for cinematography too. <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has so far been able to meet the sky high expectations of his fans and critics alike but there has always been a trick up his sleeve to wow his audience at some point in the movie. This is not that movie. It has far little character driven story to be considered as a dramatic movie and a complete lack of background narrative to be taken for a documentary. But it does hold a small trick that Nolan has perfected over the years - scrambled screenplay with intertwined timelines; It has become a bit of a habit to let the audience solve the puzzle which is his screenplay and the gratification one gets when the pieces are put together gives him a box-office hit. While I got entertained, I still find it evolving into a pattern. <br/><br/>There have been many WWII movies. Some great ones too. What does Nolan's Dunkirk bring to the table in an already crowded genre? It neither has the grit of Saving Private Ryan as much as you hardly see a drop of blood in a war movie, nor does it feature the drama or compassion as in The Pianist or the flamboyance and entertainment value of The Great Escape. But it does hold its ground by staying grounded. There are no faux heroism sequences, an unremarkable debut of a very popular singer and does not try to suffocate itself with too many stories. The ensemble cast delivers to the point that you no longer see them to be acting. The irony of a victory in evacuation is not lost in its storytelling.<br/><br/>Dramatic, twisted and uplifting. Not the best of Nolan, but a great attempt to retell an almost harrowing story."
"zain-nov","6","3","8","31 July 2017"," Over all Dunkirk is a nice job but it does not fill up the hopes one walks into theater with.
","Christopher Nolan's movies over the year have become a huge craze and have a sincere fan following. With Dunkirk Mr. Nolan has taken a much different work in his resume. I would start with one of the mostly compelling part of his movies. Background Score Only work I admire of Hans Zimmer is with Christopher Nolan, Whether it's TDK or Inception or the best to date Interstellar, Hans has always proved to be diverse and mind bending. But with Dunkirk he has gone way too far. Even from the start score is way too heavy for nerves, movie itself is very short but that intensity and pressure is unnecessary from the scenes which should have been all about sound editing and mixing instead of relying on same technique as Chasing scene from TDK and Docking scene from Interstellar. Hans' work is good but is not needed at most of the time as it makes it all more artificial rather real. Memento Mori We might have missed Chris' brother Jonathan Nolan, who was absent from writing credits (may be too busy with Westworld) 3rd time since Chris' breakout film Memento back in 2000. Jonathan was not involved in Insomnia 2003, fan favorite Inception 2010 and now Dunkirk. However he was present in spirit of Memento, a movie which was adapted from his then unpublished short story Memento Mori. Memento was built on a complex web of time lapse and chronology so is Dunkirk. Three different stories of different time period all in 106 minutes and running parallel. To avoid confusion it was displayed at the start how will it be. Although it is beautiful idea, however bringing together three different time periods, by pulling one way too long and shrinking one way too much made it feel uneven and hard to relate to. Movie showed Mole for 7 days and yet not a single night. Mainly because it wanted to focus on its connection to the rest of the two stories. Chaos without Drama One thing Christopher Nolan is notorious to create since TDK is the chaos. That's something movie shines on. Whether it's the Mole or Air, there is huge fear over the fate of vessel, plane and the lives. Among characters the confusion and fear has played the best, although the lead felt weaker without any outcome and reaction. Drama throughout was cut off, an element which was criticized to cover up the scientific gaps in Interstellar's plot. At some level it worked as it maintained the tone of the movie but at other side movie was losing its soul over that. Tag line gave it all Usually it's the trailer, but here it was the tag line ""When 400,000 men couldn't get home, home came for them."" For the people who had no idea of events at Dunkirk, who were only out to see another of Christopher Nolan movie, there was nothing left but Kenneth Branagh's overly expressed emotions as movie moves into the final segment. Beside the plot line, the fabrication of one day at sailing into one week at mole had also taken most of the suspense away when audience know it from the start that home is on its way. Home being many ships only focused on one. With the movie which propelled ensemble cast, focusing on one ship was narrow for the story. Ship itself was sailed by ""Mark Rylance"" who was miscast for the role as he could not bring what was required to appear as a man willingly walking into the war without any aid. Good thing is Those are too many negative words but there are good things about Dunkirk, which could be the Direction. Even with all the wrong choice Nolan made, still movie keeps audience captive at point. Another quality is by default its length which does not make the viewer suffer through completed of second and sometime third hour which most of the war movies do. Cinematography is very good and so is Sound editing and mixing but unfortunately excessive use of background score has taken over those departments. Over all Dunkirk is a nice job but it does not fill up the hopes one walks into theater with."

"Bangell153","7","3","8","27 July 2017"," A remarkable spectacle but lacks an emotional connection
","There's a reason why Christopher Nolan is one of today's foremost directors - he manages to fuse genuinely awe-inspiring spectacle with an emotional core. Take Interstellar: a flawed masterpiece, probably too flawed to be a masterpiece - but Nolan leaves the viewer in a maelstrom of emotions. Dunkirk, while masterfully sewn together, surprisingly lacks an emotional punch.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the brilliant part: the spectacle. The film is relentlessly paced, immersing the viewer in the chaos of war for its entire duration. This is visual film-making at its best, combining the marshalling of vast crowds of people and real sets which characterised the great war films of old, with the close-up, fast-paced excitement at which Nolan has always excelled. Particularly notable is the use of sound - the music is very minimal, the soundscape instead filled with shrieking engines, groaning ships, and starling cracks of bullets which shock the audience every bit as much as the characters. The effect is to create an omnipresent sense of threat - though Nolan never shows the face of a German soldier, instead turning the situation into a pulse-pounding race against time. Sticklers for historical realism will, as usual, find plenty of little things to nitpick - as well as the occasional glaringly improbable detail, such as super-effective bombers and ships sinking unbelievably quickly. But in terms of the general feel, I appreciate that Nolan has not served up a bombastic myth: we see soldiers acting cynically to save their own lives, a sense of quiet duty rather than patriotic fanaticism on the part of the rescuers, and a general feeling on the beaches that ranges from gloom to utter despair, rather than perfect stoicism or unremitting hope.<br/><br/>To immerse oneself in this extraordinary historical episode, look no further than this film. But of course, every historical film needs to zoom in and follow particular narratives about individual characters. The problem is that the characters in Dunkirk are all entirely undeveloped - and of course, this is not a mistake by Nolan, rather than attempt to put the focus on the episode as a whole, showing the plight of the entire army. The individual narratives we follow are merely microcosms of the different aspects of the battle. A movie without stories, or without characters whose paths we are invested in following, will always struggle to resonate with an audience, and makes the whole event feel more like some brilliantly-produced virtual tour of Dunkirk than a piece of visual storytelling.<br/><br/>I suspect every individual viewer will differ in the extent to which they agree with my conclusion that the movie does not connect, and does not grip its audience beyond with anything other than its sheer spectacle. I would recommend this film to any interested viewer - I do not regret my viewing at all, and I am sure that many readers of this review will enjoy the film even more than I did. But - although I'm a history buff (PhD) who's always delighted to see a historical episode so brilliantly recreated - I do feel that Nolan has missed a chance to really weave a human drama into this grand spectacle, and create a classic."
"lpirc","7","3","8","24 July 2017"," Lack of story depth
","I loved the scenes but not the story. It is not deep and not well connected. The timeline is not linear and few times when it switched to other location it was not so easy to track the time. Also the main characters didn't show much emotions, so I guess that this was the reason that also I (as a viewer) didn't. But then again, the scenes are wonderful and it's definitely a movie you should watch. Also if you read the other reviews you will see that a lot of people absolutely loved it, so maybe you'll find yourself among those. ;)"
"jon.h.ochiai","8","3","8","24 July 2017"," Good, Not Great
","Writer and Director Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" literally soars in the air; otherwise, pretty ordinary on both land and sea. Too bad. ""Dunkirk"" is very good, not great. And I am a big fan of Nolan. ""Dunkirk"" follows three interwoven stories about the evacuation of over 300,000 British and French troops from Dunkirk during World War II, prior to U.S. involvement. Civilian boats contributed in large part to this massive exodus back to England. ""Dunkirk"" is the distinct visual masterpiece. The 70 mm format is amazing. Nolan's dialogue is minimalist and Hans Zimmer's provocative score essentially narrates this relentless tale of survival, bravery, and perseverance.<br/><br/>Something seems amiss with ""Dunkirk"". ""Dunkirk"" aspires as the great hero story. However, as much as the heroes compel, their stories become indistinguishable at times. Then again that may be Nolan's point that in war the hero survives. I don't know a lot of the actors in ""Dunkirk"" aside from Tom Hardy. Fionn Whitehead as infantry soldier Tommy is strong. Mark Rylance as boat captain Mr. Dawson has marvelous gravitas. Tom Hardy as courageous fighter pilot Farrier is commanding. His performance and charisma are stymied by his confined presence in the cockpit of his Spitfire for the duration of the movie. Kenneth Branagh fares best as Commander Bolton, who distills the conscience and gravity for the responsibility of saving the lives of thousands of soldiers.<br/><br/>All are very good, on the verge of great. Perhaps, part of the muted expectation is that this is history, and we kind of know how it ends. Though the message that ordinary people transform as extraordinary is not lost in Nolan's harrowing depiction. <br/><br/>Soldiers line up on the white sand beach of Dunkirk under the gray sky, as they wait for ships to take them home. All the while, they must contend with Nazi bombers and fighters determined on their demise. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema and Nolan brilliantly paint their existential treatise of war on the screen. <br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" truly soars as Farrier and his pilots battle Nazi bombers and fighter craft in the skies. The drama and imagery are breathtaking. We experience both the expression of freedom and danger in every engagement. Hardy is powerful. The movie could have used more of him. And more of this imagery. <br/><br/>Whitehead as Tommy captures the youthful innocence and idealism of the soldier. Tommy desperately wants to go home. Along with his fellow soldiers, he endures sinking ships and terrifying bombing attacks. Like the other soldiers, Tommy is a young man, virtually a boy with his entire life ahead. Many soldiers die in the aftermath. They will never fall in love, get married, or have a family. Nolan in the end reminds with uncompromising clarity that the cost of war is too high. War maybe hell. War is definitely sad."

","This movie is so overrated that I was compelled to write a review for the first time in 50 years of movie watching.

The score was interesting. I liked the way the movie used natural (or natural-like) sounds at different intensity levels to build suspense for different scenes.<br/><br/>2. The unrealistic ending made me question the integrity of the script writer and director. This was a war movie, not a hang-gliding propaganda piece.

"rorabeckapril","10","5","17","24 July 2017"," I Am Talking To You Leonard
","Reading the polarized IMDb reviews for Dunkirk, a film I feel very strongly about, I was reminded of Jonathan Glazer's modern classic Under The Skin, which received a similar split response by audiences. Both films received a highly favorable response or a highly negative one, but I am sure that any viewer with a true understanding of cinematic worth will recognize both as major achievements by their respective directors (I am talking to you Leonard Maltin.) The few professional reviews of Dunkirk that have been negative have criticized the film for having little character, a video-game like feel, and a non-linear story line; but, in truth, although this is very much an ensemble cast, Nolan's choice of little known Fionn Whitehead to lead what is supposed to be a summer blockbuster movie, is brave and astonishingly successful. More well-known actors such as Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, and Cillian Murphy all play exceptionally strong characters and represent more than their characters and the conflict played out between warring factions on a battle field: they represent the struggle of human nature to persevere in the dire moments when a heroic spirit is required. I do not know how anyone can say that these characters and situations are not heartfelt-- it is true that they are not the neatly defined caricatures we are used to seeing (I am talking to you Leonard Maltin), but they do represent very real humanity struggling to survive in a life or death situation.<br/><br/>As to the non-linear nature of the story telling, it only added to the suspense of the film's climax. Although the time-skipping technique has been used to strong effect in Nolan's other films, this is the first time where I thought it to be less of a clever device and more in service of building climatic dread. Maybe it is the fact that the film's subject felt more historically important than a super hero or cyber-noir blockbuster, but I believe Dunkirk elevates Nolan in the same way that There Will Be Blood elevated Paul Thomas Anderson.<br/><br/>Something more should be said about the dire nature of the film. Dunkirk is a film about the human struggle and the choices that must be made in life, choices that have a lasting effect on human psyche and human health. Although there is a happy resolution of sorts, it is a tangled one, with the death of innocents and the capture of at least one of the film's main heroes by enemy forces. The film seems to say that it is not so much the outcome of these events that is important, but how the individual chooses the handle such events; and there is a clear dichotomy in the film between the hero and the fallen hero archetypes.<br/><br/>I am not a professional reviewer of films, but I do feel that I know in many intrinsic ways what makes a film successful and to what degree a film achieves its goals for film or entertainment. Dunkirk is a resounding success, a modern classic. I wish I could be more articulate in this point, but I have already wasted enough time trying to expound upon something that should already be very clear upon the viewing of this film. Anyone who disagrees has a Disney-fed brain and represents in a multitude of ways what is wrong with our poorer and poorer society (I am talking to you Leonard Maltin.)"

","Will hope to keep this short, and to the point. Not to avoid spoilers since DUNKIRK is part of history. But for all the immensity, it's still a tight character-driven film, from beginning... as a young soldier dodges German bullets on the edge of the invaded French town... to the middle... as the same kid winds up on several aerial- bombarded boats... to the end when...<br/><br/>So, alright, it is possible to spoil. What's important to note is exactly what kind of World World II movie it is. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, for instance, narrowed down, was a Body Count adventure: a handful of soldiers that we get to know from the start, on their way to a particular destination, being picked off, one by one, with very few survivors. DUNKIRK, on the other hand, is a bareknuckle Disaster Epic but with a relatively short runtime, and surprisingly enough, coming from Christopher Nolan, there isn't much dialogue at all...<br/><br/>The visual spectacle and audio splendor is built into the very foundation (shot in IMAX without being a gimmick), hauntingly exploiting the roaring sounds of the planes during dogfights to the nightmarish clunking howl of ships going down — all the while using three specific ""characters"" for ongoing perspective: The first is that aforementioned British soldier, starting out in France and being knocked around like a rag-doll; a small family boat from England heading towards the formidable destruction; and the few ally fliers. These people never override the story yet are interesting enough to invest in and care about. And the triple tier device is not only edited to handoff from each other and drive the story forward, it's mostly pieced together as if taking place at the same exact moment and location (obviously symbolizing the adjoined situation).<br/><br/>Without Generals or Admirals providing grimacing exposition to teach us about this particular invasion/evacuation, and only sparse moments with a Colonel (Kenneth Branagh) standing firm on a targeted pier, the frantic action is what's being fully experienced by the viewer, as if you're one of those men on the long stretch of beach, like sitting ducks waiting for the reigning terror from the skies above. And what's really interesting is you never actually see a German soldier (if you do, then don't blink), making their hellish, dominating, bombarding armory (visible planes to stealth torpedoes) the primary antagonist. Basically, putting history aside, DUNKIRK is a War Disaster Film pitting man against machine with seemingly impossible odds — while the overall suspense relies on the few desperate possibilities.

"cruise01","10","5","17","21 July 2017"," Dunkirk is an intense experience, impressive with every work done on the film. It was spectacular.
","Dunkirk is an intense war film that grabs you in the first minute and does not let you go until the end credits roll. I will have to say probably one of the best war films. Christopher Nolan has added his signature style with a non linear storytelling with three story narratives that collides with each other, amazing cinematography work by Hoyte van Hoytema, impressive action sequences that relies on practical stunt work even the cat and mouse aerial combat scene, and music composer Hans Zimmer score was great. Dunkirk literally is one big battle for survival from the beginning moments of hearing the time ticking and seeing Fionn Whitehead running across town with snipers shooting at him to reaching the beach of Dunkirk awaiting with the other soldiers as they are being evacuated. Nolan creates the intensity very well knowing anything can happen at any moment from bombs falling to being shot at. There is no safety for these soldiers that were fighting for survival to get home. <br/><br/>The plot follows 400,000 soldiers that were waiting to be evacuated from Dunkirk. As a couple of ships were coming to take them out of there. The German planes kept attacking them from above. And only a few spitfire pilots Farrier (Tom Hardy) were the only defense against the Germans. The plot was kept fairly simple with no politics getting involved or the backstory to these characters. It starts with bullets flying and these soldiers trying to survive. Nolan did not try to add any character development since it was focused on the entire war experience. We could already sympathize on these people because they were young soldiers who are desperate for survival. <br/><br/>The action sequences are throughout the movie. It starts with it and builds the suspense and momentum. Nolan is best at trying to make you feel anxious along with these characters. Hans Zimmer score had to be playing throughout and really helped with the suspense building. The sound editing and design was impressive from every bullet sound to explosions to the fighter planes roaring across the screen. Every scene of the movie was engaging and difficult to take your eyes away from it. The aerial combat sequence throughout was the best combat fighting ever done in a movie. It puts the audience in the cockpit with the pilot or seeing it through pov on the plane. It was a wild ride seeing this. There were also some claustrophobic moments as the soldiers are in a ship in the cafeteria and an explosion out of nowhere floods the boat. It can be scary to see what these guys went through. <br/><br/>The cast ensemble were bunch of unknown actors but they all did there best like Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Harry Styles, and so much more. Then, there is Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy, and Tom Hardy who all did great. The film does have less talking and a lot of suspenseful action. I feel like every actor had at least ten lines. And it never slows down to catch a breath. Which makes the pacing of the movie spectacular. Being Nolans shortest film since his earlier films. The tone of the movie felt like a ticking time bomb. The non linear plot structure worked so well. The effort has to go to the editor Lee Smith, who structured the film so well as three narrative stories interconnecting. Every scene kept the film running with anxiety and suspense. Overall, Dunkirk is a great war film that I definitely recommend checking out in theatres. There is a lot of action and suspense building to put you on the edge of your seat. The cinematographer, the editing, music score, the cast ensemble, and all the practical effects like the aerial combat and action is amazing."

","When Christopher Nolan announced that his next movie was going to be about World War II, people were skeptical; they had their doubts. But people had their doubts when Heath Ledger was cast as The Joker and Nolan proved them wrong. <br/><br/>With Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan has hit the bull's eye. He has proved once again that no matter what his films are about, they are always going to be an amazing experience.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a film about the Dunkirk Evacuation ( Operation Dynamo ) that took place during the World War II. In 1940, more than 4,00,000 soldiers were evacuated on the beaches of Dunkirk, a small French town. Dunkirk is a story about that miraculous event.<br/><br/>It is an unusual film. What I mean by that is, any moviegoer going into the movie would not expect the kind of film he would see. Most of you may have seen Saving Private Ryan and will be hoping for something similar but Dunkirk will throw you off balance. It is the complete opposite of Saving Private Ryan and that is why it shines so much.<br/><br/>It is an experience and not a story about some individuals. There are no character backstories, so you won't get to know much about the characters. **You are in the battle from the first scene itself and you are going to stay there for the next 107 minutes.** You feel like a ghost watching the brutality of world war with your own eyes (Thank god, most of the war is bloodless).** There is very less dialogue, which you may hate, but it is also a unique thing about this masterpiece.** It is a no bull crap approach towards war. The war is not forgiving; you won't get time to shave your beard or shake hands with your friends or talk about your high school crush when each step you take may decide your fate. It is war and it translates to death if you are not careful. It is about people fighting for their lives and wondering if they will be able to make it through.<br/><br/>The lack of character backstories and dialogue may be a shortcoming of the film but the more I think about it, the more sense it makes.** It results in a film that is thrilling, intense and nerve- wracking from beginning to end; there are no scenes that kill the tension.** Also, It does not politicize or glorify anything. It just shows you the war in its most raw form. It is terrorizing from the first scene till the last. There is almost no CGI; the IMAX cameras were placed on real airplanes and the film was shot, It makes my jaw drop in awe.<br/><br/>***Dunkirk is the most realistic depiction of war I have ever seen on screen.***<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous and you will wonder how the DOP Hoyte van Hoytema was able to film it. The sound editing and mixing is on spot (Hans Zimmer's name is enough). The bullets sound exactly like bullets and the explosions are like real explosions; you won't get the feeling that Michael Bay is trying to blow things up. Last but not the least, what to say about the genius - Christopher Nolan. Most of his recent films have focused more on the crazy ideas and visual wonders but **Dunkirk proves that apart from being a person who has some amazing ideas, Nolan is a great storyteller too.** His storytelling abilities shine in Dunkirk. He himself is the writer and without his writing, it would not have been the film it is. he uses the nonlinear narrative and plays with the concept of time, again in a very effective way.<br/><br/>***With Dunkirk, Nolan has established himself as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.***<br/><br/>It is the best film he has made since Inception. It is a strong contender for the Academy Award for best picture and Nolan himself may get nominated for Best Director, a recognition that he truly deserves. With Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan has hit the bull's eye. He has proved that no matter what his films are about, they are always going to be an amazing experience. Just go and make sure you watch it on an IMAX screen."

","If you are passionate of historical aviation, you'll love this excellent war movie. Forget the ridiculous and unrealistic stunts of ""Red Tails"" or ""Flyboys"". Here the flight scenes are absolutely well done and credible and fit perfectly in the plot. Just a couple of remarks, though: in the close up scenes of the pilot in the cockpit the light and the shadows should turn when the plane is manoeuvring in a dogfight; He-111 planes attacking targets at low altitude are quite unlikely, Do-17 or Ju-88 were a better choice...and in the scenes filmed with the POV from the wing of the Spit the engine doesn't look like a RR-Merlin, which gave a distinct shape to the nose. However, these are minor details and the film is very good. Great show."

"raa-55017","9","4","13","26 July 2017"," Another Nolan Classic
","Christopher Nolan is one of the most talented filmmakers of the century, plain and simple. Every single one of his works has been unique and entertaining, whether its Memento, Inception, the Dark Knight, or Interstellar. And he does not disappoint and continues to dazzle audiences with his latest film, Dunkirk.<br/><br/>Dunkirk tells the story of the British and French evacuation off the beach of Dunkirk during the second world war. The Germans have boxed all allied troops against the water, and its up to the citizens and a few fighter pilots to defend and successfully evacuate all trapped troops.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a very different war film, but I think it works to the movie's advantage. Instead of following select characters through the event and learning their convoluted backstories, Dunkirk focuses on the war event itself instead of developing characters. If you had asked me to name two characters in the film after it ended, I wouldn't be able to tell you. That's because Dunkirk alternates through three stories all going on at the same time to deliver a unique yet powerful experience.<br/><br/>The film is perfect when talking about realism; not a shot goes by that looks staged or fake. Many real and model boats/planes were used in place of CGI, and it goes to the film's credit. <br/><br/>Dunkirk wastes no time setting up the conflict or introducing you into boring characters and their backstories. You are immediately thrust into the situation, which adds to the film's immersion in great amounts. The great visuals are aided flawlessly with Hans Zimmer's excellent score.<br/><br/>Overall, Dunkirk is an amazing film that doesn't focus on characters, but rather the event. It is no t bogged down by any exposition and is a fast-paced thrill ride from beginning to end. Is it Christopher Nolan's best movie? In my opinion, no. However, that does not prevent it from grabbing the best film of 2017 (so far)."

"waswasere","10","4","13","26 July 2017"," A densely woven triumph.
","I've only seen three films twice during their theatrical release. First was Star Wars. The second was Serenity. The third obvious given that it was me who brought the subject up, but after seeing many reviews, I felt I had to see this projected in IMax.<br/><br/>Recent war films have tended to fall into ""war porn"", over- sentimental mush or, in the case of 'Saving Private Ryan', both. That's not necessarily a bad thing as modern audiences, in the main isolated from the actualité of war, do seem to need a hook to get engaged and going for the obvious tropes to shortcut the process doesn't harm a film as long as it is well made. <br/><br/>In this respect, much of the criticism levelled at Dunkirk seems centred on the lack of characters' back story. Counter-intuitively this, I believe, is this film's major strength. I totally buy Nolan's premise that he didn't want to give the audience any more information than the protagonists have. The only exposition comes from Kenneth Branagh's character, but this is used sparingly and no more than is required to advance the story.<br/><br/>I also wonder whether the fact that Nolan's army protagonist is named Tommy has been missed by non-British critics - 'Tommy' being the nickname given to the rank and file infantryman of the British Army, or as Commando comics would put it: ""For you Tommy, the war is over."" It reinforces the idea that Nolan was creating ciphers for the audience to place themselves into and wonder: ""what would I do?""<br/><br/>One overlooked detail is that whether Mole, Sea or Air, our every- man protagonists make major either/or decisions which have crucial bearing on the plot. I won't detail them here as I don't want to introduce any spoilers, but it pulls together the idea that an individual caught up in a moment will make split second decisions, which on their own perhaps mean nothing, but when chained together can alter history. I liked that. It made the split time-line narrative all the more powerful, as any one of these decisions reversed would have doomed the film's outcome.<br/><br/>It's been gratifying to see US audiences embrace this ""British movie (with) an America budget"", as Nolan put it. Hopefully it will mean that major studios will see that there is a market for intelligent big budget summer block-busters, made with care.<br/><br/>Can't leave this without mentioning Hans Zimmer's score. It is such a phenomenal soundscape. <br/><br/>And if I'm being honest, I think I preferred the wide-screen version!"
"Troy_Campbell","9","4","13","26 July 2017"," Greatest WWII film since Saving Private Ryan
","Christopher Nolan has mastered the intelligent blockbuster; his films are precise, mature and thought provoking without skimping on the spectacle. This war picture, based on incredible true events, proves he can bring that same balance to even the most serious of films. Dunkirk follows three interlocked stories: young soldier Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) tries to escape the hellish beach of the titular French town, fisherman Mr Dawson (Mark Rylance) is employed by the Navy to head across the English Channel, and fighter pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) protects the skies as best as he can. Not as straightforward as it may sound, the narrative is a meticulous web of apprehension, struggle and dismay. Just when it appears the tide is turning—literally and figuratively—another hurdle presents itself. A movie of few words, Nolan allows the awe-inspiring set pieces and commanding performances to speak for themselves. A lasting shot of Kenneth Branagh's face as he witnesses something the audience isn't privy to resonates more than any monologue could hope for. Thanks to Nolan's insistence on practical effects, the action sequences are raw, exhilarating and a master class in building tension. Utilising real aircraft allows for some utterly breathtaking aerial dogfights, whilst the large-scale ship sequences are nightmarishly nerve shredding. Credit must be given to both Hoyte Van Hoytema and Hans Zimmer too. Hoytema's cinematography, whether underwater or tens of thousands of feet in the air, is beautiful; Zimmer's score, all ticking clocks and suspenseful opera, unsurprisingly brilliant. With cracking visuals, stirring set pieces and powerful acting, Dunkirk is the greatest WWII film since Saving Private Ryan."
"PackmanWSU01","10","4","13","25 July 2017"," Poetry in Motion
","Too often, war films fit in a convenient narrative box. Take Saving Private Ryan ( a masterpiece which I love by the way). Time is taken to craft the narrative, introduce characters, etc. And nowadays we take that formula for granted. I remember the year Saving Private Ryan and altogether different war film called The Thin Red Line was released. Critics praised it, film goers loathed it. I did not like it much the first viewing either. I agreed with others that there was not enough action, many actors (such as George Clooney) had performances that barely registered. But the experience of the film stayed with me. The Thin Red Line was visual poetry, and an examination of mans duality with nature and the indifference of war.<br/><br/>I bring this up because, in many ways, because Dunkirk is sort of a spiritual successor to The Thin Red Line without the internal philosophical monologues. Dunkirk is heart pounding and riveting. It is the most intense film I've seen in years. The dialogue is sparse, characters are too numb by the experience to bother. Character development is minimal. The film is too urgent to get caught up in such trappings when the goal is just to survive.The film is a masterpiece for those two reasons. The film is an experience and the story is Dunkirk. Even watching the film you feel the futility and insignificance of individual lives in the midst of war. It is a best picture contender that goes against the grain. What Nolan achieves here is mesmerizing and true poetry in motion."

"AnishMisra","9","4","13","25 July 2017"," Dunkirk Review
","Dunkirk is a film written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Whenever a Nolan film comes out, I am very excited. I am a fan of each and every film of his. So when I knew Nolan was going to direct a film on WW 2 I said ""He is Nolan. He won't do anything straight."" And that's what I got.<br/><br/>Plot: Set during World War 2, this focuses on the evacuation of soldiers trapped in Dunkirk.<br/><br/>Story and direction: Whenever I go to a Nolan film, I always expect to be surprised in every way. And Dunkirk is exactly that. It got me surprised in each and every scene. I don't expect less from a Nolan film. And since it is written by him too, you don't expect the story to be that simple. We get the story in 3 perspectives: Land, Air and Sea. And each of these have a time-line attached to them. And also we get the non linear narrative, which is Nolan's style. The most people have complained about little characterization. I don;t think we need characterization for a war film. In real time, we don't have time for any chitchat. And we don't also get to see any of the opposing forces. Which was also a change. The horror that someone is always behind you just to finish you off, was enough to keep me scared. Which I think Nolan got right. Then we have the vast production values. I heard that to minimize VFX extras and planes were actually used. Even if VFX was used, I couldn't know. It was seamless. Nolan gets a Hats Off from my side. Taking such a risk actually paid off. The sound design was awesome too. The gunshots, bombs, etc... I guess they sounded real as ever. I have never paid to sound design in any film except for this one. Ans finally Hans Zimmer. He is a genius. The BGM enhanced my interest in this film further.<br/><br/>Acting: I guess when it comes to casting Nolan nails it. Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles were great in their roles. So as Jack Lowden and Tom Hardy. The amount of depth and conflict that Hardy's character faced every minute was riveting. Mark Rylance was exceptional. You could easily see the dedication on his face. Not to miss out Kenneth Branagh. He too was good in the limited role he had.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: I guess it would be where Cillian Murphy's character says Dawson to turn around the boat. We get to see the horror a soldier has faced and why is he scared. And then Dawson says that he is just scared. He will get over it. That scene was just picture perfect.<br/><br/>Verdict: The film is very good but not excellent. In comparison to other war films the film is a shortfall. I actually can't fault it. Everything was perfect. But not to give it a 10.<br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10."
"ar-anmolrawat","9","4","13","24 July 2017"," It's not a movie, but art!
","It's not a movie, but an artistic piece that will surely bag many Oscars. I was a tad bit disappointed because something was missing from the movie. I absolutely loved the direction. Nolan shines here and arguably, it's all in his court this time because there is no script to the movie. It's all about how he has portrayed the events through his perspective. I loved the BGM, which is obvious when Hans Zimmer is involved. I loved the acts; so believable. even Harry Styles, a singer gave a flawless act, now that's good direction. I loved the cinematography. Those grand shots with that epic score was phenomenal. I loved the climax scene. It gives you goosebumps literally. I loved how it does not involve back stories of characters, those blood boiling dialogues, war strategies, lead characters coming out like hero or the melodrama that is common with war movies. It is about the rescue and that's what you get to see. Loved his narration in three different perspectives. But still, I missed something."
"paulspencer-90394","8","4","13","24 July 2017"," If you think Nolan doesn't show emotion, you've missed the boat.
","First off, I wouldn't say I am a massive fan of Nolan. I always find his dialogue a bit clunky. But you can see why the critics love him; he makes cinematic films, in that they need to be seen on the big screen. What he also does, like many of the great directors, is give you something every time you see the film again.<br/><br/>I watched Dunkirk on 70mm at the Odeon Leicester Square, and it was well worth it. The action starts straight away, and does not let up. The three perspectives play out well. The boys on land struggle against a continuing hail of bullets, bombs and torpedoes. The people on the boat see all sides. And the pilots showed just how impossible the odds were. The plane scenes were very good.<br/><br/>My personal faults with the film are - the dialogue again. It sounds a bit like one person telling a story rather than actors playing a part. The story of the boy on the boat and the soldier, I didn't think it worked. The unseen enemy were literally that. It would have given the film a bit more of that ticking time bomb conundrum if we the audience knew just how close the Germans were. Lastly, Michael Caine. when I heard his voice it put me off slightly, as I kept thinking, is that Michael Caine? The big plus, I thought the scene with the small boats was an emotional triumph; not overstated or overblown, just the right amount of tone for what was a minor victory in a much larger defeat. Nolan gets it right with the lighting, locations, cast and scenes. Even the music is good, especially the variation on Nimrod at the end.<br/><br/>Finally, we go back to why film critics love Nolan, he makes movies that deserve to be seen in the cinema. I have recently been to see Scorsese and Kubric retrospectives in London; both give the audience something to think about. Nolan will probably be spoken about in the same tones in the near future. Chances are, he will adapt a novel, and it will be hailed as a master piece. This one was close."

","When talking about war movies, ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Thin Red Line"", and recently, ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" come to mind. ""Dunkirk"", however, isn't that kind of war movies. This is not your average mainstream war movie. In fact, I don't remember if I could see any blood, gore, excessive profanity, or NAZI (Except for those few last seconds of the movie). ""Dunkirk"" is more of a survival thriller than a WWII flick, but somehow, will always be remembered as an excellent WWII film, for good reasons too.<br/><br/>Nolan proves once again that rating isn't strictly a restriction to produce high-quality masterpiece. Many people were skeptical about a WWII movie with anything less than R-rated. Nolan and crew had the last laugh after all... The cinematography's gorgeous beyond words, the acting feels very genuine, with very very little dialogues and each characters have some depths (traumatic pilot, brave and unwavering weekend sailors, honorable officers, resilient soldiers, naive kids, and desperate young men surrounded by enemies from behind and wild ocean in the front).<br/><br/>Nolan got out from his recent sci-fi, mind-bending mega-blockbusters (The Dark Knight trilogy, Interstellar, Inception) to a documentary- like WWII movie, with equally outstanding, if not better quality. ""Dunkirk"" will, without doubt, be in the top 5 of my favorite war movies ever.<br/><br/>Oh, and should we even mention how great Nolan-Zimmer are when working together?"
"sundance_kid_no1","10","4","13","23 July 2017"," One of the best movies ever made
","Dunkirk is a cinematic triumph. Regardless of the nay-saying of less-appreciative viewers, characters do not need names, the desperate plight of the main characters, whether it be running out of fuel or finding a safe route home is enough to show the macro and not the micro nature of war. Listen to Hans Zimmers ridiculously tense soundtrack, complete with ticking clock, and you can find the emotion of the film. This is a thriller, a horrific tale of desperation and survival. Nolan delivers an emotional roller- coaster; one of his best, and one of the greatest war films of all time."
"NicoleSantamorena","10","4","13","22 July 2017"," Nolan captures the anxiety of war
","Christopher Nolan's story of Dunkirk is not the traditional war story. His film is experiential. It does not show the opposing sides face to face or give background information. Instead it puts you right in the thick of disaster. He turns the classic war story on its head. Putting the audience in the action and making us feel the sense of urgency these men faced. This is a story of heroism, but it is also a story of fear and panic. The film allows for the viewer to feel afraid, to be unsure of what will happen. In traditional war films the enemy is clear and visible, but in Dunkirk the whole landscape is the enemy, the Germans could be anywhere. This is not a film about war, it is a film about the fear that comes with tragedy and the response to that fear. <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has created a harrowing film. He expertly crafts a palpable sense of unease. The minimal dialogue and phenomenal sound track/ sound design further aid in building the sense of impending doom. Zimmer will most definitely be nominated for an Oscar for his soundtrack. As the events of Dunkirk drag on, you can hear the ticking of a watch laid over explosions, lapping water, plane engines, and bombs. Time is running out and you can feel the desperation the soldiers felt. The panic is evident, it is tangible. The dismal color grading, the sprawling landscapes, and the use of practical effects only heightened the intensity of the film. I could feel myself desperately hoping that the characters on screen would survive. I felt myself holding my breath when Collins' plane went down. I couldn't help but feel devastated when all the soldiers and nurses drowned. My heart was pounding through the 106 minutes and I almost forgot that 338,000 men made it out of Dunkirk. <br/><br/>The non linear story line helped add to the anxiety and uncertainty. The intersecting narratives provide a frantic environment, not dissimilar to the experience of war. The interactions between the narratives made for some very beautiful moments in terms of story telling. The British soldiers turning away French soldiers only for Aneurin Barnard's character to later admit he is a French Soldier in the midst of panic over the possibility of him being a German spy. Cillian Murphy turning Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles away from the rescue boats only for the 3 of them to later be rescued by Mark Rylance. Collin's being rescued from his plane by Rylance and later helping rescue Whitehead and Styles connected the 3 factions; air, sea, and land. Nolan expertly intertwines and connects these characters without ever having them get to know each other. They are connected by their experiences. <br/><br/>I was extremely impressed by the acting. I realize that there wasn't much dialogue, but the way the actors portrayed and emoted fear was extremely realistic. I could feel the uncertainty being stifled by Kenneth Branagh, the horror experienced by Cillian Murphy, and the grief portrayed by Tom Glynn-Carneyr. Even the actors with minimal screen time wonderfully expressed skepticism, dread, and sorrow. Tom Hardy's performance perfectly captured stoicism, while Fionn Whitehead captured doubt superbly. Aneurin Barnard's nervous, resigned mannerisms made his character suspicious from the beginning. His panicked ""Je suis French!"" became much more than a sigh of relief. I was extremely impressed with the new comers- namely Fionn and Harry Styles. I found them to both be extremely believable, Especially the angry trepidation of Harry Styles. So if you had doubts about Harry's performance, lay them aside, he was a welcome surprise. Nolan's choice to cast young lesser known actors truly paid off and made for an even more devastating blow when they were met with tragedy. <br/><br/>Dunkirk was a beautifully shot, wonderfully cast, edge of your seat film. I didn't know a film could be such an experience. Well done, Nolan."

","Never has a movie been so unwatchable because of how intense it is until this came along. This movie was just all around intense, scary, and realistic to the point that I wanted to leave early. This is not a good film to watch and eat popcorn/drink soda. It is very much a depressing and intense thrill ride. The craftsmanship is off the charts, but the movie is way too vicious for its own good. It didn't even feel like a movie. This is not a healthy movie to watch, you might get sick or be traumatized for life. I don't recommend it for everyone. I'd definitely show this film to any young kids who wish to become soldiers. Show them that they are wasting their time and they will regret signing up for war.<br/><br/>9/10."

","Summary:<br/><br/>Dunkirk is the story of a true World War Two operation that took place at Dunkirk Beach bordering France and Belgium which depicts the evacuation of 400,000 soldiers surrounded by enemies.<br/><br/>Is it safe for my kids to watch?:<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to kids who are older than 13 years old. The entire movie is extremely intense with constant gunfire and peril to the characters. The soundtrack adds even more tension. From the first scene to the very last, a ticking sound effect, as from a clock, is heard. It gets faster during more intense scenes and slower. Some intense scenes are during the planes shooting at each other, also known as a dogfight. A pilot is in an intense situation and doesn't think he will survive much longer. Another pilot's cockpit latch does not open when the plane is sinking. Soldiers are under constant fire by planes and surrounding enemy soldiers. Bomb blasts are heard throughout the movie. A boat gets hit by a torpedo and several people inside are trapped swimming around in the water. Soldiers are covered in ash from nearby fires.<br/><br/>Overall: I love world war two history. I was waiting for the release of this movie for about a year. The only thing to watch out for are some of the intense scenes written above. Other than that, another flawless masterpiece by Nolan."
"duncan_buchanan","10","3","9","8 September 2017"," Genuinely a film of the decade.
","I quite often flippantly rate films higher than they deserve immediately after I've watched them because of the initial excitement felt from the buzz coming out of the screening, I then re-look at my ratings days/weeks/months later and realise how wrong I was. That said, Dunkirk has been rated 10 and will firmly stay at 10 without question.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I've seen a film with such a small amount of talking, with such a minimal amount of character names that are explicitly given and that relies on such a relatively small plot in the grand scheme of film making. It's been even longer still that I have seen one that even though it lacks all of the above it still manages to make you care for every single soul on that beach. <br/><br/>That's not to diminish what happened there in anyway whatsoever, but looking at it from a film makers perspective, rescuing soldiers off a beach would usually be a 10 - 15 minute scene at most in any film. Nolan et al manage to ensure the 90 minutes pass with fairly minimal exposition, talking, minimalistic music design, lack of character 'development' so to speak, minimal location usage and above all else, crucially, minimal down time. Once you get through the first 2 to 3 minutes, it simply doesn't stop.<br/><br/>The score whilst sparse and difficult to listen to on it's own, feels very layered and textured, gripping and tension building - you'll catch yourself with clenched fists at least once purely because the music dictates a continual uneasiness, aided by the virtually constant threat of gun fire, bombing and torpedoes. It's an Audio / Visual masterclass that will no doubt be taught at colleges and universities in years to come.<br/><br/>Upon reflection, and this is what I love about Christopher Nolan as a director, none of the things I've mentioned above matter. The confidence this director has in the way in which he makes his films is right there in front of you. He throws out the rule book and creates his own set of rules. These usually would render films at the mercy of people like us who want to tear things to shreds purely because our opinion is the only opinion that matters and who cares what anyone else says.<br/><br/>But in reality, in the cold light of day, it's an utter stroke of genius. Anyone who is of a certain age in the UK will at the very least know the story of Dunkirk, will know the significance of what happened and what it was the pre cursor to. So for Nolan to effectively create a character out of the story rather than the characters within it is unfathomably brilliant.<br/><br/>I do not remember the last time I shed a tear at a film in the cinema. Or at least, if you'd asked me that yesterday I could have hand on heart say I couldn't remember. But I know darn well now that it happened today.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunning, the music is excellent (alongside the film itself that is), the acting is perfectly balanced and nuanced, the direction is spotless it does and will always be at the top of the list for me with films to better. It's a war film but not as we know at and it benefits so much from that fact.<br/><br/>See it in the cinema if it's still available to see."
"mmcgee282","10","3","9","31 August 2017"," The best Imax experience I had
","This was the first time that I had seen a film presented in 70mm, since the last time I went to the Imax in New Orleans, the Imax Entergy theater.It was those full shot on Imax film featurettes.I saw this one at the McWane Center in Bham Ala.I was surprised for this was the first time that I saw an Omnimax presentation, the film projected.A huge circular screen.It brought you into the film as almost as 3d does.The<br/><br/>scene where the soldier is running from the others shooting at him, where this one soldier jumps from this brick fence.Although a little distorted, being shown in circular Imax.The film almost looked digital, but, film these days are so tough it can break projector down.Now there is no leading star in this film it seemed all the people playing soldiers were the stars.I think this was humor, but a British man, played by Mark Rylance and his son, some blond actor, I Think Tom Glynn Carney, wants to go to Dunkirk to help with the war, in their small boat. The best friend of the young man.played by Barry Keoghan, who later ends up being knocked down on the boat, after the older man and his son picked up a disturbed soldier the kid ends of blind and later picked up many other soldiers, the kid is dead by that time.There is one of the soldier who survived and want to avoid getting killed, like he wants to get out of it and another solder too, who later is accused of being a spy.One of the actors I kept seeing as one of the heads waiting with all the other soldiers to move.I kind of had gotten confused with this pic.Maybe the circle screen was distracting me from the story. Were they, the soldiers leaving from France or going to France from to England? the captain looked familiar.Later on, the name was shown at the end Keneth Branagh as commander.He sure changed.There was an intense scene where soldiers were hiding under a ship and some one fell into the ship but was not the enemy, but out side, the enemy was shooting bullets through the ship causing it to sink forcing many of the soldiers to get out. Another scene where some soldiers are invited to a ship where they are given food, but the younger one stays out just in case the ship gets hit. The enemy hit the ship and everyone goes under water. The younger soldier on top of the sinking submarine is about to jump off the ship, but decide to help the other soldiers out of it.There were many good scenes.I almost got confused with Dunkirk being the invasion of Normandie, but that was different, aka, The Longest Day. The scenes kept switching to Cinemascope letterbox back to 70mm the contrast and color seem to differ from 35mm to 70mm.You notice the quality of the film. The 70mm scenes were of the best quality.Although the sound was a little too loud drowning some effects out although this screen was even bigger than the Imax at the Grauman's. This kind of Imax screen is not good for all movies presentations, it is away to get people of the cable and the internet.Excellent war movie, Fun for everyone.A bit Bazzare being shown on circular screen.Love it. 08/31/17"

","I believe many movies based on war - First or Second - has to be more than just bombing places and tearing buildings apart, firing boats and bodies torn in pieces! How many good and true stories might be out there waiting for an opportunity to be told. This is another good example of a good story developed. A different -- or maybe many different angles of the same event happening in Dunkirk and on that shore where it looks like the Devil was taking some vacation there. Fortunately, God always show up and things got better. Unfortunately, no matter how many movies show the downside of the war and all the bad things that come tag along, and many forever, politicians will always make up excuses to start other wars. Well, will maybe make another story later, until then, this is a very good movie but don't watch it on TV. See if you can go at a good movie theater to see the beautiful picture and maybe a perfect direction from Mr. Nolan."

","In my humble opinion, near perfect. Brilliant script, cinematography, soundtracks and acting. Mark Rylance in particular was in my humble opinion absolutely brilliant in his portrayal (based on a number of real incidents from a variety of vessels but using Titanic 2nd Officer Lightoller's role in Dunkirk as a foundation. Superb. Kenneth Branagh was notable too and not too dominant. Even Michael Caine's voice use on the radio was carefully done. My only content gripe was the unnecessary use of a 1950s railway carriage. The overall result a brilliantly directed, balanced and unromanticized war record including an incredible amount of subtlety (e.g. through the background to each and every single notable quote listed here) from a brilliant script right through to the order of titles at the end.

"Al_The_Strange","8","3","9","25 July 2017"," Dunkirk Review
","Imagine waiting in line, in which you don't know what's going to happen. Maybe you'll be shipped home, to safety and comfort. Maybe you'll die.<br/><br/>In 1940, 400,000 Allied soldiers faced awaited their fate on the beaches of Dunkirk. For nine days, these poor souls endured heavy gunfire and bombardments, while a fleet of civilian ships raced to their rescue. There was no naval fleet or air force to swoop in and save the day. The soldiers had no choice but to wait--to live, or to die.<br/><br/>The 2017 film Dunkirk is an intense cinematic experience that places the audience in line with the soldiers, the sailors, and the airmen. Offering little in terms of character hooks or color, the film immediately dunks the viewers in the madness of war, starting off with men running for their lives in the streets, before following them on land, sea, and air. Three specific perspectives are used to show the battle. One is the shoes of a soldier who does everything he can to find a ship home. Another takes place on the deck of a humble yacht, helmed by an old man and a pair of boys who want to do their part in the evacuation effort. The third happens through the eyes of Spitfire pilots racing to stop enemy bombers and fighters from killing more troops.<br/><br/>Despite each narrative having different lapses of time, they are all interwoven together. It can be a challenge to understand the order of events, since the film will show something happening (such as a plane going down), then follow-up with it again from a different angle. This method creates some fascinating disparities between perspectives, as some characters perceive events in one light, but then audiences see that their views were skewed or wrong. The finale in particular is a complex multi-sided affair, which ambiguously suggests both defeat and victory. The triptych plot also gives the film rhythm, so that it becomes a series of waves that washes over the viewers.<br/><br/>And it will feel like waves and waves of terror. The story by nature is terrifying, and the film is careful to remain understated and let the events speak for themselves. There's little dialogue to this (which will spark some complaints that the characters lack depth or presence). But the actors do succeed in making their struggles convincingly, painstakingly convincing. It's all amplified by the film's style. Over each scene, Hans Zimmer's score washes over the soundscape with an eerie, creepy sort of industrial ambiance. The camera moves organically across the geography--it gets a little rough when it follows the characters on foot and in the tight corridors of ships, but it's very smooth and elegant with the aerial footage. Most of the film is drenched in steely blue and gray--at times, it makes the environments look beautiful, but it becomes hellish when sand and water washes over the characters and threaten to smother them.<br/><br/>That's ultimately the point of all this: the experience of war-time fear. The style and script focus on the hopelessness of the situation, before exploring all the horrifying situations in which soldiers could die: obliterated by bombs, shot by guns, drowned in the hold of a ship, drowned in the cockpit of a sinking plane, struck or crushed by falling structures, and more. With the film showing so much danger and threat, it struck me that there is a (perhaps unintentional) parallel between the English channel and the River Styx. After all, these were men trapped in a state of limbo, being picked off by unseen, faceless enemies, while waiting for a safe crossing. Even if the soldiers get out alive, they still face an ambiguous future where war continues and more will face death.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is an industrial-grade thrill ride. It's looks and sounds steely, cold, and oppressive, but it hits hard--the cinematic equivalent of a Rammstein song. The narrative is rather odd, but it does succeed in dipping audiences into all the dangers of war. With the film's dedication to showing realistic replications of ships and planes used in the evacuation, it's also a faithful and insightful view of historic events I was otherwise unaware of. In spite of this, the film is a valuable experience in its own right.<br/><br/>4/5"
"stevenrotherforth","9","3","9","25 July 2017"," Action speaks much louder than words.
","Dunkirk<br/><br/>""A chance to get to know you better would have been nice!"" This was never a thought that crossed my mind in regards to the characters in Christopher Nolans latest cinematic offering. I've watched several critic reviews and the stand out negative associated with this film is the apparent lack of character development. I however do not share this common gripe. Instead I see exactly where Nolan was going and what he was intending.<br/><br/>This is a war movie. A war movie that focuses on that very subject and immerses the audience in the horrors and despair of all that goes with it. From the very first sound of gunfire we are jolted out of our cinema seat and into the streets of Dunkirk. The startling realism is staggering. The audience can almost smell the sea air and feel the sand from the beach whipping up at their faces. As the wind blows froth from the ocean and onto the beach the texture of this film is almost touchable. We don't just hear the explosions, we feel their impact. The screaming sound of enemy bombers approaching chill you to the very bone as the sound builds to a panicking climax. I urge you to witness this film on an IMAX screen with the best possible sound system. Perhaps this films greatest achievement is just how it manages to transport the viewer and put them right amidst the despair. You are fighting for your own survival here. No time to make friends! This is why character development in this movie is minimal. Who has time to talk about themselves when they are running, swimming and cowering away from death?<br/><br/>The story is told from three different perspectives. Land, sea and air. Christopher Nolan believes the audience to have a level of intelligence that needs them not to have everything explained and pointed out. He trusts we can keep up and work things out for ourselves. This is good as the film bounces back and forth through time more frequently than Marty Mcfly, often overlapping events as they are witnessed by different characters.<br/><br/>Land is despair! As thousands of men queue to board ships that can take them away to safety. The ships are sunk and those who survive end up washed back ashore. Almost as if the beach is hell and it won't let them go.<br/><br/>Sea is hope! Home is on the horizon, just out of reach. Hope in the form of the civilians who cross the channel and risk their own lives to save the trapped men.<br/><br/>Air is both danger and protection. Enemy bombers swoop in picking off the stranded like shooting fish in a barrel. Protection is the Spitfire pilots that gracefully glide in to take down the attacking enemy. Once again a great turn by Tom Hardy who plays the lead pilot. Hardy delivers his performance with just his eyes as he wears a flight mask.<br/><br/>I think Dunkirk can be regarded as one of the best war movies ever made. To be held in the same light as Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. Christopher Nolan takes a very different approach in regards to telling his story but it's a refreshing change and critics shouldn't gripe. Action speaks much louder than words."
"PyroSikTh","8","3","9","25 July 2017"," A Relentless Experience that Demands to be seen on the Big Screen
","Nolan is great at crafting experiences, and Dunkirk is absolutely an experience. It demands a screen the size of a large wall, and a surround system that can handle extremely loud and deep noises. He puts you right in the shoes of his characters, with minimal dialogue, and encourages you to strap yourself in for the ride.<br/><br/>However, what did surprise me, is that Nolan somehow still managed to weave an unconventional narrative into Dunkirk. The plot follows three different viewpoints; The Mole, The Sea, and The Air. Each one is title-carded with a timeframe. The Mole is one week, The Sea is one day, and The Air is one hour. For a long time this bugged me, as I couldn't work out what these timeframe's signified. Eventually I figured out that they were the amount of time each viewpoint inhabited. The viewpoint of the soldiers and officers at The Mole spanned a whole week, the viewpoint of the sailor and his young crew took place over a single day, and the pilots only had an hour of fuel when they're first introduced. Except rather than introducing these viewpoint chronologically, Nolan introduces them all at once. These three different timelines all running concurrently to one another creates a staggered sense of flashback and foreboding. We see characters drift from one viewpoint to another and back again, completely out-of-sync. He manages to take this, and somehow still craft an enthralling plot line that references and explains itself, resulting in twists and turns that otherwise would not have been present, and prevents it from getting too convoluted and confusing.<br/><br/>The camera work is simply spectacular. We're put underwater with the soldiers, or bobbing on the surface. We're forever peering over ominous sand dunes, or crammed into Spitfire cockpits. We see fire from below, and a stalled engine from above. We see bombings from the air, from the sea, and from the land. One of my favourite pieces of camera work was from a camera strapped to the side of a boat as it capsizes, with the water level slowly peering in from the left until it consumes the deck, as we watch soldiers desperately jumping off. We're put on that boat as it tilts and goes down. There's a few shots of genuine beauty as well though. Shots that just linger with a moment and let it wash over you. One of the final scenes of a Spitfire sat on the beach in flame definitely springs to mind as one of the most impactful single-shots of the movie.<br/><br/>The music and sound design has a lot to answer for as well. This movie can be incredibly loud, which just immerses you even more. Each gunshot is a punch to the gut, each bomb explosion a skipped heartbeat, and each screaming air raid a terrifying experience that scares you to your core as it would the soldiers on the beach awaiting their fate. Then there's Hans Zimmer's score, which is about as Zimmer as you can get. I mean the film literally opens with a Zimmer clock tick tock tick tock. It never lets up either, this ticking rhythm is kept up for literally the entire movie. It's solid scoring from the very opening moments until very late in the movie, and it's relentless. Just tick tick tick tick tick for over an hour. The orchestra builds on this rhythm and the music fluctuates around it, but the ticking is ever present. Nothing instills a never-ending sense of suspense better than Zimmer's score here. And it makes the eventual silence at the end even more significant, when the panic and race against time is finally over, and there's just nothing, and it's a massive sense of relief. Variation 15 of Edward Elgar's Nimrod is also integrated into Zimmer's score so well, creating a massive sense of hope in the film's closing moments that it's hard not to smile and feel completely satisfied.<br/><br/>The thing with Dunkirk though, is that it is an experience first and foremost. It tells the story of the evacuation of Dunkirk, not the story of a particular character. As such, there is no depth to any of the characters. They're all just tools to the story. Dialogue is at a bare minimum, with much of the exposition left to visual, sound design, and character expressions. The Acting from all involved did exactly what was required though. The silent exchange of looks between Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard, and Harry Styles on the beach says all that needs to be said. The nod of approval from Mark Rylance to Tom Glynn-Carney is all that needs to be said. The wave from Jack Lowden to Tom Hardy is all that needs to be said (except in this case twice, because it has completely different meanings depending on your viewpoint). The salute from James D'Arcy to Kenneth Brannagh is all that needs to be said. The shaking and quivering of Cillian Murphy is all that needs to be said.<br/><br/>As I've mentioned, Dunkirk is an experience. It demands a big screen and massive sound system. It's not about characters, it's about the event, it's about what it was like to be there. It immerses you in the deep end and doesn't let up until the sense of relief at the end. It weaves a surprisingly unconventional narrative in and out of one another, manufacturing twists and revelations and opening up different perspectives of the same events. While Dunkirk is light on character and emotion, it's yet another masterclass of technical filmmaking from Nolan. I give it an 8/10."

So yes, Dunkirk is more a sensory experience about what it would like to be in a war. <br/><br/>It does not really tell a story about Dunkirk in the drama sense of the word, but it does make you feel the hopeless situations in which these mens were subjected. And in this sense this movie is brilliant, because after going out of the Theather you have really see things from a different angle. <br/><br/>Contrary to some recent war movies, it's not overly violent (you understand what happens but except one time don't really see the gory details) but it's definitely very stressful to watch. <br/><br/>If you can, go watch it in IMAX, it will blow you away."

"Hitchcockyan","9","3","9","23 July 2017"," Slam-DUNK!
","Ingeniously applying his cerebral skill-set to the mechanics of historical war dramas and factual portraitures — Nolan unleashes a meticulously crafted, suffocatingly suspenseful survival epic that bears his patented structural spin on its dirt-covered sleeve. He doesn't follow a set template but creates his own — radically cross-cutting between perspectives of variable time-frames, the narrative unravels simultaneously on land, water and in air, before converging in a breathtakingly volatile finale. The audacious split-narrative works brilliantly and possesses the urgency that would've otherwise been lost to a more conventional approach, instead we get 100 mins of sustained panic-inducing climax which is further intensified by Hans Zimmer's pulsating score resembling a ticking clock and surging tide.<br/><br/>Nolan isn't really concerned with telling a story, preferring to create an experience - and a supremely immersive one at that! Devoid of didactic monologues and cheap sentimentality, thrusting us headlong onto the Dunkirk sands we're given a glimpse into the crack of rifle-fire, the maelstrom of war, the frenzy of fear, the distinctive wailing siren of the Stukas, the muffled screaming of drowning men or the shell-shocked groans of the ones that temporarily made it. The exclusively Brit ensemble (featuring the likes of Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy etc) is uniformly excellent with a particularly impressive turn from newcomer Fionn Whitehead. Technically, DUNKIRK is as much a visual feast as aural bliss. Hoyte Van Hoytema's evocative lensing lends stylistic harmony to the proceedings through careful juxtaposition of nerve-wracking air-combat sequences, chaotic underwater stretches with the panoramic paranoia of the war-torn beach, propelled further by bone shattering sound design and some crisp editing.<br/><br/>Ultimately, DUNKIRK is a masterwork of understated terror grounded in brutal reality and in the very best tradition of great (spectacle) cinema — packs the power to transport the audiences into the very heart of the action, especially when experienced on the all-encompassing IMAX screen."

","Being a fan of Christopher Nolan, I had always been excited for this film of his. Happily, I can report that it does not disappoint by any stretch of the imagination. This film depicts the Allied evacuation of Dunkirk, France in 1940 (before the United States had entered World War II.) At only 106 minutes, Nolan's film doesn't have an ounce of fat on its bones. While the film contains relatively little dialogue, it never feels minimalistic. Rather, its astounding and wide-scale cinematography makes the film feel grand and bold on a scale rarely experienced in modern cinema. The film alternates between three points of view, each of which is set over a different time span: those on the land, the sea, and the air. That said, this never feels distracting or too difficult to follow. <br/><br/>The sense of suspense depicted in this film is masterful. Using a simple but effective score and relatively minimalist sound effects, audiences are fully engaged in the heart-pounding tension. This is one of the most thoroughly tense movies I have seen in theaters in a while. The ability by Nolan to juxtapose such sound and visual effects to create an immersive experience is wholly unique and commendable. While characterization of the pilot characters could have been slightly improved, the film's characters are generally thorough. All in all, this is a near-perfect war film that must be seen--and experienced--on the big screen. 9.5/10"
"kcgunesq","8","3","9","21 July 2017"," Good overall, but underwhelming
","I saw the movie in IMAX.<br/><br/>The genre earns this movie an extra star. Without the historical context, its a 7/10 movie.<br/><br/>The general consensus that the dialogue gets lost in the sound effects is correct. I don't mind loud movie sound effects when appropriate, but there was an almost continual low frequency drone throughout the movie, even when it wasn't clearly connected to engine noise, gun fire, etc. Strategic silence could have helped this movie. I believe an audio remix before release for home sales would help.<br/><br/>Acting was generally fair, but nothing special, overall. However, I did like Mark Rylance's performance.<br/><br/>Several scenes or events seemed less than historic and little more than obvious attempts at emotional triggers.<br/><br/>One very quick scene near the end appeared to be a special effects failure to me.<br/><br/>I do not expect to buy this movie, though I can see watching it again once it is widely available for streaming."
"mritunjaymarch","9","3","9","21 July 2017"," And again Nolan did not disappoint us...
","Dunkirk by Nolan is one of great directed movie this year. One of the great thing about this movie is Nolan is not telling a story about a solider or bunch of solider who are in middle of war. He showed us the situation of 400,000 man on Dunkirk there is no story in this movie this is war and he really put you in that situation with thrilling sound effects and visuals. I am really expecting Oscar nomination for Nolan for this movie. Harry Style really did a good job in this film, Mark Rylance always nice to see him in the movie Cillian Murphy Kenneth Branagh Tom Hardy they are as usual great.. Great score by Hans Zimmer the clock ticking sound really scared me.. One thing that people complaining about character yes characters are important to tell a story but this is not a story this is moment where characters were doing everything to survive. Yeah this bother me in the first half of the film but i totally understand that this need to be in that way. But yeah one thing that Nolan could do right about this movie is that he can told this story in linear way.. Because until the Cillian Murphy scene on the boat i did not know that it was usual Nolan. i think this movie would more better if the screenplay was in linear old fashion manner"

"J_Batek_II","10","2","5","21 August 2019"," Best & Most Realistic War Film Of The Current Century. Non-Stop Tension. Perfect 10.
","By the standards I set for the depiction of war on film, this is a perfect movie. This film needs no love story, or 30 minutes of background monologue from Tom Hanks, or cheesy soundtrack music for marketing purposes. This is 100 minutes of tension, fear, uncertainty and confusion. In the fog of war, there is no room for all of that sentimentality that Spielberg and other filmmakers have been propagating for decades in war flicks. So, maybe your mom or your girlfriend won't find this wartime experience enjoyable... ok, so don't ask them to share it with you. Too many filmmakers think they are being clever by placating studio executives and/or ratings boards and softening their films. Afterwards, they brag about the love story that afforded them more violence or an extra 45 minutes in the theaters. In an attempt to make a movie with something for everyone, they end up with a film that is somewhat inauthentic when portraying the actual war. In reality, guys that sit around telling stories and staring at black-and-white photos in a war-zone, die in that war-zone.<br/><br/>In 'Dunkirk' (2017), Christopher Nolan avoids all of the mistakes of past directors when depicting war on film. 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) is one of my favorite films, and I gave it an 8 rating on IMDB. An 8 rating sometimes represents a film that could have been perfect, but fell short for some reason. In the case of 'Private Ryan', the film starts authentic and becomes more of a family film. That's stupid - we don't send children to war. We don't take our girlfriends or our mothers to war. We don't take an orchestra to play uplifting music before we charge, or sad music while we talk about our time back home. 'Dunkirk' keeps the tension and tone for the full 100 minutes. No sappy love stories or cheesy music - just war and the effects of war on individuals.<br/><br/>'Dunkirk' (2017) also contains the best non-verbal acting in an war film that I have ever seen. For decades, we depicted war through the designer glasses of Hollywood - where everyone speaks clear English and all soldiers look like movie stars. WWII was a WORLD war, including many countries and languages. Add some hearing damage from explosions, and people had to learn to communicate with their eyes and body language. Non-verbal communication doesn't always translate well through film, so Hollywood dumbs everything down for the viewer with dialog. Much like war, ""Dunkirk' requires complete attention to detail. Some viewers will completely miss entire subplots of the film by looking at their phones instead of watching the eye contact between two characters from across a boat. So be it - war isn't for everyone, and this film was made for people to experience war on film.<br/><br/>Modern technology allows 'Dunkirk' (2017) to create the authentic sights and sounds of planes and bombs that are period-specific to WWII. Lightweight mountable cameras helped to create the best aerial dog-fights in a film since Howard Hughes set the standard over 60 years ago. In our era of technology, most directors choose to post-produce effects with computers. 'Dunkirk' kept the computers to a minimum. Apparently, Christopher Nolan is aware that war isn't always symmetrical or pretty.<br/><br/>After writing a couple of hundred in-depth movie reviews, I am getting less and less comfortable awarding a point for ""My Personal Favorite"" movies. I am a 'math guy', and 1 point is 10% of a perfect 10 rating - it's significant. I have only awarded about 5 of those points so far, and I may go back and remove them later. But, I don't know how to quantify, by category or numeric value, just how refreshing it is to see a film that doesn't pander to executives trying to capture the largest possible audience, or editing down to score a PG-13 rating. My rating system doesn't have a way to award a point for being so much better at depicting realism than every other film in the genre, while using less technology. So, until I find a better way to quantify it's greatness, I am going to give 'Dunkirk' (2017) that extra point for being my new favorite war film.

","Non-linear story lines can get lost and muddied under a lesser director, but not with Nolan. A film with no real center and told from multiple point of views, Dunkirk is nevertheless a showcase of artistry and emotional beats.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is told from three perspectives, all under duress from the same enemy. The film is a masterpiece in editing as it builds drama and tension by exchanging scenes between the multiple point of views to present character development. The first half hour builds the premise as the characters find ways to escape their encirclement from the enemy. As the story progresses scenes are alternatively presented to show moments of despair, relief and hope. Solid acting from the cast carries the film and makes the viewers sympathize with their predicament. Heroism is sprinkled throughout, never missing the point that in war casualty is inevitable. Sacrifice, trauma, the need for self-preservation and survival is ever present and is explored by the various interactions between the characters.<br/><br/>The film's truly shines in the artistic department. Glorious cinematography, production design, special effects and powerful score. It is worth watching for those qualities alone.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the premise of having no real center is what makes Dunkirk short of a masterpiece.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Neptune165","7","2","5","16 July 2019"," the day seemed to last forever
","The horror of war. Everything in this movie is perfect. It's a mesmerizing and horrific masterpiece. The movie purposefully is not about characters. They barely talk, a lot of them don't have names and they all share equal screen time. Even the biggest star in the cast doesn't get any special treatment from the camera. This is a fresh new approach to war movies and portraits the fact that war is about everyone and about every single event, small or big. a lot of people miss the point and try to judge the movie like a traditional war movie. This movie is all about feeling and perception. one thing worth mentioning are the sounds of the movie....not (only) the sounds tracks, but the sound effects....the shooting - its all so loud and authentic. make sure you watch this movie at a system that has good sound, because the noise of the gun-shots and Aeroplane engines are incredible the bombs. this movie grabs you by the neck, drags you into the war with these soldiers and does not let you go until it ends. 2 hours felt like 40 minutes, the cinematography looked spectacular and the sound was fantastic, and not just the music. Bombs, bullets, screams, airplanes, it all sounded so raw and realistic and you're constantly on edge. Not one dull moment in the entire movie. Yes, there's not really a character arc or development for these characters. All these people were equally represented in this event and this is how they reacted to it. And this movie shows beautifully that most of these men don't want to go to war, they don't want to die or kill, but they have to. One of the best movies of the year."
"elliottthomasc","10","2","5","15 June 2019"," This era's ""war"" masterpiece
","I can't help but to emphasize how many classical ""non-war"" elements this film has, which makes it an even better war film. I don't want to include any here because I don't want to spoil the movie.<br/><br/>This film has top tier directing from the man himself Christopher Nolan. In my opinion, this is his second best effort for a film (right behind The Dark Knight). Amazing acting by new and older actors such as Fionn Whitehead and Cillian Murphy. Great script with low dialogue that helps embrace the theme of the film. One of the key elements to this film, was the terrifyingly brilliant score by the legend Hans Zimmer. The very eerie and ticking clock elements in this score really help complement the theme of this film.<br/><br/>Amazing film, glad it go the credit it deserved. Can't wait to see what else Nolan has in store for us."

"algernon-72259","9","2","5","23 March 2019"," Very good I strongly reccomend the movie.
","Dunkirk is a movie with heart and soul.<br/><br/>When British troops landed in continental Europe to help French fighting with Germans in 1940 they were pushed back at the coast of the North Sea (part of Atlantic Ocean).
You will see how the British struggled to evacuate their troops and allied forces (French and Belgian) from the coast near Dunkirk.
If you expect to see another Saving Private Ryan it is not the case.
There are no massive battle scenes. Instead, there are people's stories and you will see the II WW history from individual point of view of soldiers and ordinary people taking part in the evacuation.
I can reccomend it as a must-see movie because of the passion and tension the film has plenty of.
Moreover, the scenes, the settings, landscapes, the scene shooting and, the music is beautiful.
Let's watch."

","Holy mother of God, this is the most boring movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I don't consider saying anything about the events of the movie spoiler, simply because the movie doen't have any story whatsoever. But if you're really sensitive maybe skip this review.<br/><br/>Certainly there are worst productions out there, but being a C. Nolan directed movie, I had somewhat high expectations. No, I didn't read anything about the movie, didn't watch any trailer. I just went there knowing it was about war and that it had the C. Nolan signature. Oh boy and how I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Sure it is beautiful, it feels realistic, believable and sort of an accurate side story (or a side event, rather). But as entertainment it fails miserably. There's only one single event in the whole movie, which is soldiers trying to flee a battleground. It ends just as it starts, the only difference being, that hey somehow succeed to flee at the very end, after trying the whole movie an failing over and over.<br/><br/>I can understand why, despite being this average, the movie is still so sucessful: american culture clearly loves everything surrounding war: the backstage, their army, their history of fighting, certainly hits their feels. Yes, the movie is covering a british battle, but still, the theme is there. Even subconsciously, it hits their patriotism, it's a subject of absolute respect for - most - americans. That's fine and actually a beautiful thing. But for the rest of the world I see how a Big Brother war simulation would be enough to earn anyone's respect.<br/><br/>Also some of the happenings are hard to digest. During the movie a lot of huge carries go there to rascue them and no one seem very thrilled. Then at the later part, a bunch of small fishing boats arrives, and suddenly all the soldiers are chearing up. Seriously? It doesn't look like they would able to carry that many soldiers - 40k or 400k soldiers, if I recall correctly. If the enemy could take down multiple war ships, why they should feel safe in a small boat? And HOW did they succeed? That didn't make any sense to me. It feels like they just noticed they had 3 hours of movie already and had to rush an ending for the sake of sanity.<br/><br/>Still, it has beautiful visuals. I can respect the effort of everyone involved in the technical aspect."
"blueclocks-87731","10","2","5","9 September 2018"," A message to the naysayers.
","This is one of my all time favourite movies. Hats off to Christopher Nolan who's done once again. It's the closest thing to being actually in Dunkirk. Nolan makes you experience the confusion, desperation and fear the actual soldiers must have felt and only a director of his calibre can achieve that. 
But what has really prompted me write this review is seeing the constant bad ratings this movie has been getting lately and I can only think of two reasons for this recent trend: either some trolls with a lot of time in their hands are at work on imdb and or there has been an increasing number of ignorant reviewers submitting their opinions of movies that are well beyond their intellectual capacity. To the former I say, ""What you are doing is low, sad and pathetic"" and to the latter, ""Please refrain from reviewing movies you can't understand as it is not fair for works of art like Dunkirk to be brought down by ignorance."""

The acting in this movie is amazing. I sat at the edge of my seat from the start to the finish of the entire movie. The subtle clock ticking in the background and then stopping at just the right point is simply perfect. You really have to stay on your toes with paying attention to this movie because of the dates and times. It goes back and forth with it. I seriously can't see how anyone can give this movie a bad review because the way that this film is shot is like ART WORK. The cinematography was top notch.

","I was so looking forward to this movie. What a major disappointment!<br/><br/>The biggest problem: there is absolutely no sense created of how monumental was the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of men. No feel of the flotilla of pleasure boats it took.<br/><br/>The movie concentrates on a few vignettes that follow the trials of small groups of people, with each vignette overstaying its cinematic effectiveness. The effectiveness is made even worse by the attempt to tell 6 or 7 stories simultaneously - the back and forth between the stories becomes tedious quckly, as we revisit situations we had already lost interest in and forgotten.<br/><br/>But worse is the annoying film score from the usually dependable Hans Zimmer. I get the attempt to create a feeling of oppression using minimalistic composition techniques, but the effect here is what one feels when a car alarm is stuck open for a 30-minute stretch outside your home, with the owner of the car who knows where.<br/><br/>Seriously, I can believe people were raving about this flick.

"lilleanmachine","9","2","5","10 March 2018"," Dunkirk: A Timeless Film
","Timeless films like Titanic, Grease, or Top Gun have had an strong effect on the pop culture development across the globe. In today's world, modern films have still been prominent in playing the role of a strong pop culture influencer as it once revered for. Nowadays, movies have evolved so much more than just a cultural influencer; now movies are masterpieces of modern art than can be experienced from the confines of your chair. The film of Dunkirk, released in 2017 was a near perfect historical recreation of the evacuation of British troops from the shores of Dunkirk during World War II; so acurate in fact that it was able to bring a WW2 British veteran, that was actually at Dunkirk, to tears. The movie follows the stand points of three different types of people, the soldiers, who are trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk, waiting to depart on their painfully slow transport, the Royal Air Force (RAF) who are taking a small squadron of planes to Dunkirk to protect their troops and transports heading to and from Britain, and the civilians, who are commandeering boats to try and speed up the evacuation of the troops. Dunkirk, in my opinion, is one of the best films released to this day.<br/><br/>The main reason that Dunkirk was a masterpiece in my eyes was mainly due in part to the great cinematography that encompassed the movie. From the first minute of the film, I had been completely entranced into the movie and it's story. Within an instant, the scene's intensity was set with the ear-piercing sniper shot followed my the barrage of raining gunfire. Scenes throughout the film are filled with moments that captivate and entrance you to the story telling and progression of our protagonists. Despite the fact that many viewers were not able to remember the names of any of the characters, the imagery and story is still able to remain engraved in the heads of the viewer as a prominent film. I especially loved seeing the aerial combat scenes that were, in my opinion, some of the best dogfighting I have seen. Many of the aerial scenes follow the main pilot of the Fortis Squadron, Fortis One, single-handedly take on German Nazi bombers and Lutwaffe aircraft as he attempts to protect the rescue ships from getting bombarded. The film's cinematography and story also does a great job at following and potraying the fear of Dunkirk and of fear of dying on the beach, shown in the rescued soldier that made it on the boat with the English boy and his dad. Cinematography wasn't the only great storytelling device of the story. One of the most effective storytelling devices was definitely the amazing score that accompanied the film. For example, throughout the enitre score, there is the presence of a ticking noise that helps to set a fast paced story and represents a lack of time for the British soldiers. Through the dramatic composure style that the famed, master composer Hans Zimmer brought to the film, the story and tone of Dunkirk was able to be perfectly framed.<br/><br/>However some people do not see movies in the same light as the general populous. On the Internet Movie Database, I was able, after a ton of searching, to find a review written by anonymous reviewer, claimed that the film was, ""boring, tedious, and without character"". All arguments of that statement, in my opinion, are completely wrong. First, the story has loads of action, which really is the enitre point of the film. From scene one, since the first sniper shot, the action keeps on persisting in moments that are truly glorious in cinematography. The next complaint, the tediousness, is there to build character development and to show character interaction, which the user later goes on the say ""character building to be an enormous let down"". IF that is true, the why did you complain that it was too tedious in detail? Lastly is the complaint that the movie is without character. Yes, it is true that the movie does not do a fantastic job at trying to make people remember names, but you don't need names to remember character.<br/><br/>As impact on popular culture, Dunkirk has been extremely influential on the modern aspect of filmmaking. It has allowed for the world of great cinematography to be recaptured by the general public. Through its filming style, it supplies the audience with a great idea of a beautiful, historically accurate movie. The Soundtrack encapsulates the audience in a stunning environment that figuratively put you on the scene of the Dunkirk beaches. The action is so intense and real, that it thrills even the most avid moviegoer. Finally the story, which was developed over the story of the soldiers, was accurate enough to bring a veteran to tears. These aspects are the reason which has proven Dunkirk to be a timeless film. Dunkirk forever.<br/><br/><ul><li>Yeet Machine</li></ul>"
"allenleein","10","2","5","8 March 2018"," Dunkirk: The legend ends, the unknown knight rises
","From The Dark Knight trilogy to Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan is trying to tell us how to define a true hero.<br/><br/>In Batman Begins, one key point of Bruce Wayne's desire to become Batman is so that he can be a symbol of something. A beacon of hope so that people can aspire to be a better one. This is a thread that continues through all three films, particularly The Dark Knight Rises, where Batman is honored as the savior of the city, not Bruce Wayne or any one person.<br/><br/>Pointedly, Wayne says at the end of the film, ""A hero can be anyone."" Indeed, one of the major themes of The Dark Knight Rises is the consequences of the mistake made in The Dark Knight. By holding up Harvey Dent, in particular, as a bright role model, Batman and Gordon were forced to cover up his crimes committed as Two-Face. That cover-up led to some of the bad things that happened in the third film.<br/><br/>Usually, World War II movies (and historical war movies in general) tend to narrow their spotlight to one man, one hero maybe a few, and that often works; we're made to care about a soldier because of where he came from, what he left at home, and who he is. We're meant to sympathize with him and thus want him to live. And if he's a hero, then the film's drama and tension - and, usually, inspirational triumph - come from watching this person whom we've come to care about succeed. In short, we're expected to care about this person because they've become, however temporarily, a sort of friend(character, self).<br/><br/>In Dunkirk, the closest that Dunkirk comes to this mode of storytelling is in the fishing boat sections, where three men who aren't part of the military don't have to be asked twice to head off and do their duty. But even then, we get scant information about them - enough to make us care about their fates, but not much more.<br/><br/>The true hero is one who conquers his own anger and hatred .The true hero is that nobody remembers what they meant to do. We only remember what they do.<br/><br/>""It's not who you are underneath, it's what you do that defines you."" - Batman Begins<br/><br/>""A hero can be anyone. Even a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy's shoulders to let him know that the world hadn't ended."" - The Dark Knight Rises"

"JACKTHEJAMES","7","2","5","26 August 2017"," Visual Expresion Vs Character Expression
","If we valued the expression of motion picture to be the cult climax of visual connotation, Dunkirk would be a solved masterpiece. I personally felt no indicator of time or pressure to feel lost in the story in the whole run time of the film. Nolan uses high angle shots to explore this open fantasising and still rather unexplored area of time in history on screen. The sound track that booms the planes war flight delivers the chill of placing you in sand on Dunkirk. But the characters delivering this story and map out the foundation of the war frame and harness no power to connect personal emotion to screen.Do we ask the question then, should Nolan have used characters to deliver the story along the way to develop that connection on screen with human emotion or was it passive enough to allow the cinematic expense of ""war in action"" to be enough? If we pulled out any of the boys acting in this piece and placed them in octane drama and asked them to deliver more dialogue, they would drown in ordinary mundane common muck. True Harry Styles cannot really be faulted for this first time big screen appearance  and his ability to act should be credited accordingly. However if human emotion is the way to value cinema then this film just lacked that simple connection to make you fight for someone or better yet, the British soldiers that were fighting for the time they lived in."
"chrisdwagner","9","2","5","18 August 2017"," Quite a visual spectacle by Christopher Nolan, quite a mental bore by Christopher Nolan.
","Indeed, Dunkirk was a great film that accurately depicts the events that happened in real life. I'm glad I finally got up to go see it, choosing it over Baby Driver and Atomic Blonde. Dunkirk had many parts that made me bite my nails in anxiety, and many parts that had me wondering what the f*** was going on.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* The first ten minutes of the movie where it introduces the three plot lines are confusing. What are the people in ""The Mole"" doing? Why are they running through the city? WHY DOES THE MAIN CHARACTER HAVE AROUND 2 LINES THE FIRST HOUR? All these questions buzzing around, but I guess the visual aspect makes up for it. <br/><br/>Second, why does the movie mainly focus on The Mole for the first part and then at the end all of a sudden think Tom Hardy is the most important character? And I'm sorry, this isn't important, but Gillian Murphy is one of the biggest actors in there, he's in most of the movie, and he never even gets a name. He's cast as ""Nervous Soldier"". Really? And why is 1/5 of the movie Kenneth Branagh staring thoughtfully into the distance? Don't get me wrong, very good acting on his part, but yes, now the biggest memory of that film is his deep eyes. I'm kidding, it's the fire on the sea scene.<br/><br/>Anyway, I guess this movie is worth it, but make sure you're ready to endure the confusing first half hour. And excuse the lack of plot; it's a historical film, the whole idea and series of events is the plot."

Spitfire ammunition - a Spitfire only carried ammunition for 14 seconds of firing - Tom Hardy uses getting on for twice that. There is no way a Spitfire could shoot down that many German aircraft in one sortie - Sometimes Heinkel bombers absorbed the complete ammunition of 3 or 4 Spitfire or Hurricanes before going down.<br/><br/>2. Yellow nosed Bf109, they only appeared for one one unit of BF109s late in the Battle of Britain - Yellow noses were only adopted by the Luftwaffe fighter arm as a whole in 1941 during the attack on Russia. YNBs (Yellow Nosed B******s as the RAF called them ) would not have been seen at Dunkirk.<br/><br/>3. Limited number of aircraft - The Germans came over in 10s and hundreds, the RAF came over in Flight, squadron and wing strength - In the film we so no more than one German bomber and two fighters at the same time.<br/><br/>3. Dunkirk itself appears as intact, almost untouched, in the film, whereas the city was reduced to a smoking ruin by artillery and aerial bombardment.<br/><br/>4. Chaos, the streets of Dunkirk were littered with destroyed British and French lorries and equipment, with bodies littering the streets. In the film it looks like the most orderly town on Earth. Even the military stores on the beach are lined up in neat rows.<br/><br/>5. At the opening the British Tommy runs a few hundred yards from the Dunkirk ""perimeter"" to the beach, whereas the actual perimeter was at the string of canals that surround Dunkirk, 5 to 10 miles back from the beach.<br/><br/>6. The vast majority of those evacuated were taken off from the mole. The little ships played a gallant part, but it was the mole that played the major role.<br/><br/>7. The British trudged for miles to Dunkirk, fighting a rear-guard action and facing bombing all the way. Many British soldiers said once they reached the perimeter of Dunkirk they felt a huge sense of relief, and that Dunkirk itself was a ""picnic"" compared to what they had endured getting there. <br/><br/>8. Where is the ""Treachery of the King of the Belgians""? - The king who ordered his army to stop fighting at the height of the battle (something for which he was kicked out as King by the Belgian people themselves once the War was over) forcing the British to take over defense of a huge portion of the front line. At the time the British and French blamed Dunkirk on the Belgians and all the newspapers of the time were full of stories of this ""treachery"" -All this seems conveniently forgotten today.<br/><br/>9. Lastly, and to my mind most importantly, in the film at no stage do the British soldiers fight back. The British army put up heroic resistance at a string of sites protecting the retreat to Dunkirk and then did the defense of much of the the perimeter for a crucial few days, repulsing the initial German assault, before giving up the perimeter to the French."
"gortx","Null","2","5","28 July 2017"," A Triumph of Analog Filmmaking
","DUNKIRK is a triumph of analog filmmaking*. It's the kind of physical old fashioned movie-making that demands the literal BIG screen to tell. Seeing it back to back with the CGI-fest VALERIAN couldn't make the contrast more vivid. But, if DUNKIRK were only a technical feat that would be only a measured victory. Fortunately, Director Christopher Nolan and his cast and crew have delivered a knockout.<br/><br/>Nolan adopts a 'you are there' approach from three perspectives: Land, Sea & Air. Little attempt is made at a greater narrative, although the scenes with Kenneth Branaugh as the Commander give some bare-bones context. But, the bulk of the picture is straight-up in your face (especially in 70MM Imax!) action that plunges you into the events. This isn't the first film to do this, despite what you may have read (there's the fine 2007 Israeli film LEBANON, most of BLACK HAWK DOWN and others). What Nolan does well here is to not make the action too disjointed despite the triple perspective AND a incongruent timeline (the land, sea and air components all take place over differing lengths from one hour to one week). Further, Nolan is able to give us intimate moments amidst the grand battlefield. The casting is impeccable with Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Fionn Whitehead and others all bringing their moments to the fore when called upon.<br/><br/>Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is, naturally, the biggest tech credit, but Hans Zimmers ticking time bomb of a score and Lee Smith's editing are also top notch along with the huge cast & crew. Like the Dunkirk operation itself, this is a team effort on the grandest scale. A few scenes don't really work and the epilogue could have been dispensed with. I'm certain that Nolan wanted the audience to exhale after the intensity of the main story, but, I didn't feel it was necessary nor all that well done. Minor quibbles aside, this was an enveloping experience (my legs were literally shaking with nerves) that needs to be seen on the biggest 70MM film screen you can get to. *(yes, I know there was some digital involved)"
"jeannefrancoise","7","2","5","23 July 2017"," First Nolan history movie
","Dear readers, Dunkirk (or Dunkerque in French) is a based on history movie that recalls about the allies soldiers of World War II that had been trapped in Dunkirk, a city in Northern France. The beginning of this movie is quite epic, but after watching it, there are some critics that I need to deliver as a movie lover. The critique is about the plot itself. I love Christoper Nolan. I watched all of his movies that are always mind-blowing, so that when I watched Dunkirk, I hoped that I can see a mind-blowing movie of history of World War II. My expectation was not really fulfilled, but at least I can enjoy the beautiful landscape of war zones. Well, Nolan is not a history movies director so far, so that he must learn a lot from the history movies directors that are more experienced to create a beautiful war-plot. In Dunkirk, you can not understand the plot. Who against whom? Why he did that? Or who with whom? You could only understand it if you are history lover or if you read a lot about World War II, but that is the history movies Director's part isn't it: To make understand the audience about the history. In this Dunkirk, I am so sorry to say that Nolan did not explain the big plot before the Dunkirk events, for example there was not an explanation why the soldiers were trapped in Dunkirk and why there were the divisions of attacking strategy between Infantry, Navy, and Marine soldiers, and also there was no such a good ending to explain who finally wins Dunkirk event. Based on my experiences watching Nolan's movies, he tries to mind-blow people with the plots, but in Dunkirk, I feel just watch National Geographic series about the war. Sorry Nolan, as a big fan of your movies, please learn to make war movies plots."

","<ul><li>spoiler alerts!-</li></ul><br/><br/>I want to be very honest with you. I love Christopher Nolan's movies. His last movie was awesome, so I bought a special version of bluelay of the Interstellar. I would watch Memento over and over again. If I did not like his previous movies I would give him 3 starts for the Dunkirk. However, I do like his past movies, so I raised my rating from 3 to 7 stars.<br/><br/>2 hours and half long watching this movie, all I thought was why all the soldier look fleshly clean and not exhausted looking at all? Yes, they acted like exhausted, terrified and devastated but I could not feel anything from their acting. That thought kept bothering me for 2 hours after spectacular beginning scenes were over.<br/><br/>To me, all soldier seem like Abercrombie and Pitch models whom were dumped into salt water for 10 mins then poured some sand then put some murky mud oil makeup on their faces.<br/><br/>I could not really feel them being in an intense war evacuation scenes. Except for few, they all looked like they would suddenly get out of water and start doing model walk on a stage for some luxury fashion show.<br/><br/>The only explanation I have for why I had such impression was that every scenes were too perfect and beautiful. In addition, uniforms and clothing the soldiers and civilians wore looked like they were just delivered from a dry cleaning store. Commander Bolton particularly had sharply ironed uniform very sharp..... Thus, I might have not been able to put myself into serious war situation.<br/><br/>One of Few scenes I only like was the last part where the pilot barely landed his plane without crashing it. I just loved the whole scenes for no reason.<br/><br/>Maybe I expected too much from the Dunkirk...."
"jacabiya","Null","2","5","22 July 2017"," Where's Michael Caine?
","MAJOR SPOILER: At the risk of been added to the dreaded blacklist, throwing all caution to the wind, I'll say it: Michael Caine is not in this picture. <br/><br/>I went to this film expecting exciting action sequences, sweeping drama, technical virtuosity and a genius-level script. All the trademarks of a Christopher Nolan film. Also, obviously, like so many, I went because of Michael Caine. After all, this is a Christopher Nolan film. This is Nolan's first film set in England, well, actually in France, but with British people who want to go back to England. Wait, maybe The Prestige was set in London, I don't exactly remember. Wasn't Tesla in that movie? Tesla was never in England, not that I know. The Batman movies were definitively in Metropolis. Interstellar was in rural America and later somewhere else. So was Inception. In all places except England. Whatever. How will Nolan use Caine? I wondered. This is the first opportunity Nolan has had to use Caine as a British man in a British film that takes place in Great Britain (or in France, oh wait, the Prestige, maybe). Batman's butler may have been British, I'm not sure. Caine as a NASA scientist in rural America, definitively American. So I sat and waited for Mr. Caine to appear on the screen. This is, after all, clearly a British film, I thought, the most British film Nolan has made sans The Prestige. There's Mark Rylance. There's Kenneth Branagh. How much more British can you get? There's Irish Cillian Murphy. Caine should appear at any moment, I thought to myself, and settled for the impending appearance. Michael Caine in Imax again! This will be surely a memorable experience. Will he appear in a boat? In a plane? He's kind of old to be riding around in a plane, you know. Surely, he'll be a general giving commands at headquarters. Or maybe he will be one of those colorful English fishermen. The minutes passed, then an hour, and no Caine. Where's Caine? I kept asking. Not even a cameo? Did I miss him in the crowds? Then a frightening thought crossed my mind. Wait a minute, didn't Caine die in Interstellar? Is he actually dead? Really dead? It can't be, it would have been news all over the world. Then the movie ends. No Caine. Unbelievable. I checked the web and yes, Caine is still alive in real life. Nolan, you ungrateful bastard, how dare you? How could you do this to Michael Caine? You know you would be a nobody if it weren't for Caine! How could you leave Michael Caine out of the film covering one of the most important episodes in the history of Great Britain, in its finest hour? How could you do this to your fans? Did you kill him for good in Interstellar? Did he ask too much money? Why, Mr. Nolan, why? For whatever reason, leaving Caine out of this picture was a big mistake on your part. Mark my words, Nolan: this decision will haunt you for the rest of your life, and will cost you dearly. I guarantee it."
"CineMuseFilms","7","2","5","20 July 2017"," a special effects spectacular based on Dunkirk history
","As the movie world erupts in loud applause for Dunkirk (2017) there is a serious question being overlooked. A defining characteristic of historical drama is that it leaves us with a better understanding of history. If a viewer knew nothing of the history of Dunkirk would this film make sense? In other words, does this film have a coherent narrative that explains what happened or is it a digital effects spectacular?<br/><br/>Dunkirk depicts three dramatised military scenarios that unfold in the air, on the ground, and at sea. Viewers must draw on prior knowledge to make sense of why 400,000 mostly British troops became trapped on a French coastline surrounded by German forces and facing imminent annihilation. The only hope to save what Churchill had called ""the whole root and core and brain of the British Army"" was to evacuate the troops across the English Channel. From fragments of talk between officers we gather that British Forces were unable to provide effective air support and troop-carrying vessels, so a hastily arranged flotilla of 800 British fishing boats and pleasure craft are sailing towards Dunkirk to save whoever they can carry. The action shifts frequently between parallel and sequential timeframes: in one scene, the camera is running along a beach, the next flying in a Spitfire sortie, then on top of or under a sinking ship. There are no prominent protagonists or antagonists, just archetypes of military and civilian personnel, both heroic and not. We follow a couple of young soldiers fleeing for their lives while enemy bombings and gunfire tear into their comrades. We meet a British civilian skipper who has answered the evacuation call and follow his journey across the channel to rescue soldiers from bombed ships and downed planes. We share the cockpit of a lone British fighter pilot as he fires on enemy planes to stop them bombing British troops on the beaches and on vessels, all while knowing that he is running out of fuel.<br/><br/>What happens in each of the film's fictional scenarios is not the point: it is the totality of chaos and the scale of relentless carnage that assaults audience senses. When seen in high resolution 70mm film the spectacle is overwhelming. The booming soundtrack is repetitive and manipulative; constant percussive pulses and orchestral strings designed for only one purpose: to increase audience heart-rate. The dialogue is minimalist and voice recording quality in several scenes is poor but the action is all that matters. The scale of the combat scenes is massive and there are numerous scenes where the viewer will be disorientated, not knowing the good guys from the bad. But this is a pale imitation of what it must feel like in the chaos of battle.<br/><br/>This is hardly entertainment. If the director's intention is to numb viewer's senses with a 106- minute glimpse of hell then this film is a success. If it is to tell the story of Dunkirk, it just does not have the narrative framework to explain how and why one of the world's biggest military disasters even happened. If it is to commemorate the Battle of Dunkirk, then turning the story into a massive digital effects spectacle makes a limited contribution to our collective memory of what has been described as the crucial turning point of World War II. Where it fails to illuminate Dunkirk history it makes up for as an immersive masterpiece of spectacle."
"bessarabilya","10","4","14","7 August 2017"," Another Nolan's piece of art
","When I heard that Nolan is making his new movie and it's going to be about war,I was a little stunned.I can truly say that he is genius,but he has become so good in directing for different things.He proved a few times that he can direct all kind of movies,starting with his bizarre ""Momento"" and continuing with superhero movie about Batman and his truly amazing last cosmic saga movie named ""Interstellar"".But ""Dunkirk"" is not a movie about superhero,and not even physics.It's about feelings and i personally had some doubts about Nolan's ability to show these events in a way that could touch me heart and make me empathize with heroes. But you know what? He actually did.This is not a movie about heroes.No,of course,some people may call them heroes,may admire their desire to live.But their actions are not noble at all.Instead of doing their best to destroy enemy army,they just try to save their life,just try to leave the battlefront and leave,going home,back to bars full of alcohol I wrote about that,because i have seen a lot of negative reviews for the movie,that claimed that Nolan didn't do his best to show events in the best light. But maybe he didn't want to.This is a movie about PEOPLE.Just ordinary people trying to save their lives and helping people around to save theirs. The history is written by winners.And,of course,nobody will say about his moments of fear,when his thoughts were only about life and all possibilities to save it. It's really a piece of art.I personally recommend this movie to anybody,no matter what you nation or color of your skin is."
"John-564-342449","10","4","14","2 August 2017"," Outstanding on many levels & with a more radical narrative structure than ""Pulp Fiction"" has...
","It's a film about one historical event, covered with three 'short stories', which are told from three distinct POVs, each processing on a different timeline with a different 'time compression' rate... <br/><br/>Sounds strange? It is, but it works. <br/><br/>You won't even notice most of the time, that there is something odd about the storytelling until you suddenly understand it.<br/><br/>Not even ""Pulp Fiction"" - which was a similar collection of three linked short stories told out of chronological order - dared to go as far in terms of experimental representation of time.<br/><br/>The main reason it works is, I think, that the audience is used to see 'time compression' strategies in movies all the time and has learned to accept them: Storytelling is simply the art of the ellipsis. Very, very rarely we see movies in 'real time'. Even rarer are movies which use different 'time compressions' next to each other to tell the story. It's so rare, that only Michael Haneke's ""Code Unknown"" (2000) comes to my mind. But ""Dunkirk"" goes even further - it's the first movie I've ever seen that combines three distinct 'time compression' rates with three distinct POVs.<br/><br/>The miracle is, that it doesn't feel forced like a formalist experiment, but it all comes together naturally through the event itself: a) A Spitfire's time in the air was only about an hour. b) Crossing the channel by boat and going back home took a day. c) The soldiers waiting on the beach of Dunkirk to get home took sometimes a full week.<br/><br/>All these POV's have a different time line or time cycle and Nolan decided to represent that through his storytelling. The rules are established quickly at the beginning.<br/><br/>Nolan compresses the time for each perspective differently, with the 'spitfire in the air' storyline being more-or-less in 'real time'. The three story lines/perspectives seem to have a similar running time in the film, but they cover and represent three timelines of very different length. All POV's cross each other at some point in the film, so there is at least some common part of all three timelines, where they overlap. It totally works and feels more organic to the story than in ""Pulp Fiction"", where it was more of a 'meta device' to make the pulpy content more interesting. <br/><br/>The screenplay is a masterpiece: One suspense sequence after another, people facing impossible choices at a propulsive, terrifying pace, not a wasted minute, every line of dialogue counts. Nolan is a master at misleading the expectations of the audience and then surprising them with something totally unexpected. <br/><br/>The writing is so TIGHT and the story offers so many surprises, that you'll see a different movie the second time, because you'll see scenes and characters with different eyes than before. The characters are nuanced and complex: People who seem to be 'heroes' suddenly are cowards or crazies, the terror of war shows anyone what he's truly made of and everyone makes the terrifying experience that he's willing to compromise his humanism to save his own life. It's a surprisingly dark film, that won't make you feel too good about humanity.<br/><br/>It avoids most clichés successfully. It feels different than any other war film. It's an epic that avoids everything you expect from an 'epic historical film', including a long running time, and makes it feel like you are there.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" is much closer to films like the Hungarian Oscar winner ""Son of Saul"" and the Russian classic ""Come and See"", than to any war film Hollywood has ever produced.<br/><br/>I saw ""Dunkirk"" 3 times now and every time I discovered something new and it became an even stronger experience. Most complaints I read about the movie don't hold up to scrutiny and it's close to perfect.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" will win Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Directing, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Music, Best Sound and Best Sound Mixing.<br/><br/>I hope they'll build a giant 70mm IMAX cinema and play it forever.<br/><br/>PS: Just in case you'll miss it - Yes, at the beginning it's suggested that the soldier wipes his ass with the ""You are surrounded"" leaflets. So, there's some good humor in ""Dunkirk"", too."
"orbcardinal","10","4","14","26 July 2017"," Incredible
","As someone who is a huge fan of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, a lot of war movies, in my opinion, have fallen short of a good and accurate portrayal of what happened during the war. This story was not a commonly recycled one, which was very refreshing. It told a story not many tell, where the good guys ultimately lose in the end. This movie was also very straight to the point and didn't glorify anything. In the first five minutes, we see six or seven soldiers. By the end of those five minutes, all but one have been shot dead in an extremely intense scene of just watching the lone soldier run for his life from extremely loud and terrifying gun shots. It was raw and to the point for the rest of the movie as well, which was very well done. The movie was told from three different perspectives as well, which admittedly was slightly confusing to keep track of. However, you see the three perspectives seamlessly come together in the end to tell the ending of the story which I thought was a very well executed idea to go with. Without spoiling too much more of the movie, overall I am giving this a 10/10 because I truly believe this movie deserves the hype is gets for the story it's telling and how well it did it."
"WarnersBrother","10","4","14","24 July 2017"," We shall not see it's like again
","This is not only a superb effort at Film Making but it is perhaps something that we may never be able to do again without CGI. A tale of the Second World War told and shown without Graphics. It is a Milestone film that will stand with epics like ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Battle of Britain"", the latter to which I believe Christopher Nolan gives homage to both for the aerial sequences and the fact that the two Films must be companion pieces forever in telling of the events of the time.<br/><br/>Shot in 70mm as were the others (a very expensive process that only a money making Director could get approval for) There is an amazing and thankful lack of CGI in this Film and is used only where absolutely needed. Those are real Spitfires, Bf-109s, Heinkel-111 bombers engaged in air combat. They are nearly extinct and getting this made is a historic document that likely can not be repeated. Mr. Nolan is known for films which rely heavily on CGI and here he proves that he does not need it to make film. <br/><br/>It's relentless, when you think you might get a bit of comic relief or calmness you get hit again. It's harrowing and there is no other word. Making history unrelenting is far harder than making fantasy exciting and Nolan has proved his ""Chops"" as a Film Maker with this film.<br/><br/>It is hard to call out from what is essentially a flawless cast so I won't try other than to say the ensemble is perfect. Probably the best coming together of British Actors in many a year. If this doesn't get Best Picture both at the BAFTA's and the Oscar's its a crime.<br/><br/>Not a spoiler but an Easter Egg: Early on when the Spitfires are communicating with Fighter Command the voice of same was very familiar. Michael Caine :)"

","Dunkirk tells the true story of how the UK civilians, the Navy & the Royal Air Force, evacuated allied soldiers from Dunkirk, in the midst of an intense battle, during World War II. <br/><br/>Dunkirk is a mind blowing movie. Christopher Nolan has given us yet another masterpiece after, Memento(2000), Insomnia(2002), Batman Begins(2005), The Prestige(2006), The Dark Knight(2008), Inception(2010), The Dark Knight Rises(2012) & Interstellar(2014). Dunkirk is not just a film. It's an experience. I strongly recommend that you watch this movie, in IMAX. Nolan makes use of the IMAX technology, throughout. Almost the entirety of the film was shot using IMAX cameras. Due to this, almost the whole movie is projected on the entire gigantic IMAX screen(unlike most IMAX movies which just make use of three quarters of the screen). The action set pieces are magnificent. The explosions & gun fire sound extremely life-like, in IMAX surround sound. If you watch this film in IMAX, it will feel like you are right in the middle of the battle along with the civilians & soldiers. It is a very immersive IMAX experience. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat, throughout. It is relentless, thrilling & action-packed, without being gratuitous. The visual effects are an outstanding achievement, considering no CGI is used. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, is gorgeous. The background score by Hans Zimmer, is sensational. Fionn Whitehead is spectacular in his debut, as Tommy. Aneurin Barnard is impressive as Gibson. Barry Keoghan is superb as George. Tom Glynn-Carney is awesome as Peter. Mark Rylance is amazing as Mr. Dawson. Tom Hardy is excellent as Farrier. Jack Lowden is good as Collins. Kenneth Branagh is great as Commander Bolton. James D'Arcy is wonderful as Colonel Winnant. Cillian Murphy is fantastic as the Shivering Soldier. Harry Styles is effective as Alex. Dunkirk is a must watch for everyone. Go, witness the triumph of the human spirit in all its glory!"
"ksstreddy","10","4","14","22 July 2017"," 2 Days since I watched this Film and I still cant get over with it. Dunkirk is Nolan's Comprehensive Guide on Film Making.
","This is the First time I am writing a Review on IMDb and the Reason is ever since I watched this Film I cant stop thinking about it, maybe Writing about the Movie might help me Satisfy.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is Nolan's Guide of Film Making. Here are the points where Nolan Excelled where many other Directors are Failing and Need to learn from Him<br/><br/>1)Story-Telling: Nolans way of Story Telling is Unique and Dunkirk is no Different. Dunkirk follows Three Different stories (The Land,The Sea and the Air) from Point of View of Three Different Characters and the Amazing thing about this is all the Three stories follows Three Different Timelines. The change in the Time lines demands the Attention from the Viewers and makes them Stick to the Movie. It gives a Unique feeling to the Viewers whenever the Characters from different Timelines Collide with Each other.<br/><br/>2)Visuals: Visuals has done the work of most of the Dialogue in the Film. The Visuals are so Rich and Detailed that they brought Intensity to the Film. Specially the Visuals from the Air are Breath Taking and needs a Tremendous Applause. Nolan has proved that War films can be Intense without showing excessive the Blood and Violence. For example the shot where A soldier is Trapped in the Oil Spill and Struggles to hide from the fire in the water was so Intense and Devastating for a Viewer.<br/><br/>3)No 3D: This might seem a bit silly but yes people are no more like ""wow its a 3d film"" and 3d has just become a strain to the Eyes with almost every film coming out in 3d. Some movies (like rise in the planet for the apes..) doesn't need 3d but are done in 3d while Some movies like (The Walk) demands 3d for a better Experience.<br/><br/>4)Portraying Emotions: Nolan is a master in Showcasing Emotions. He showed that an Emotional scene can be powerful without demanding much Dialogue. The scene where the Gibson just knows the boy George wad Dead and when (Cillian Murphy) comes after asking How George was he answers that he was okay and in The climax where (Cillian Murphy) watches the dead body being taken out of the boat and turns around when Gibson watches him were so powerful and Intense<br/><br/>5)Climax: Nolan knows how to end Movies be it Dark Knight or Inception or Interstellar or Dunkirk. He knows Exactly how to end the type of movie he was dealing with, Maybe because of his foresight. The climax is Beautiful with Tommy reading the News Paper with Visuals from all the Charters, relating to the News he was reading (like Dark Knight and Interstellar) and Farrier manually landing the plane was Wonderful and Goose bumpy<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer was as usually at his best and the music was top Notch and added intensity to the Movie<br/><br/>Finally Dunkirk Finishes giving a Feel of Mixed Emotions and a desire to watch it Again and Again and Again...."
"bunny-657-23292","10","4","14","22 July 2017"," The Creative Genius Strikes Again
","Dunkirk:<br/><br/>You live or you die. But the struggle to survive, with the fear of knowing death is certain, is what makes a soldier's life disturbing and hard. Hope is what they have in plenty. Hope for peace. Hope for survival. Hope for Home. Dunkirk is a war film filled with emotions. When I first knew the title and backdrop of the story, I thought Mr. Nolan is doing a war film, and I can expect some very good war sequences with a mixture of some story content revolving it. But what I didn't foresee is, that a war movie can be filmed by showcasing the feelings and emotions of the soldiers, and that their struggle for survival is more intense compared to the actual war.<br/><br/>As always, this movie has Christopher Nolan written all over it in BOLD and CAPITALS. This is not a regular war film where two countries kill each other's soldiers in war grounds to prove their superiority. Dunkirk events are the outcome of a war. An epilogue. The story of the movie is quite simple and almost everyone knows. The evacuation of British and French forces at the shores of Dunkirk, while the German army surrounded them. The script is normal, but is intense in content and very very rich in emotions. All the characters carried the required feel for the audience to get connected to the scene. Some scenes in particular make you feel as if you are in the place and feeling what the character is suffering. Splendid picturisation of feelings. Hats off to the cinematography team.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer is MAR-VE-LLOUS. This man proved what background score can do to a normal script. The BGM elevated some scenes to a level higher than expectations which, otherwise, would seem neutral. This is the heights of orchestra used to the fullest by the genius musician, to create a BGM so intense to carry the whole film on a single tone. Hands down Mr. Zimmer for this outstanding deliverance.<br/><br/>And finally coming to my Movie God, the class this man brought to movies is unmatched by any other film maker in recent times. No wonder the world calls him a Master in movie making. With Dunkirk, he yet again proves his class. Who would have thought a war movie can be made with master class written all over it. Not once in the movie, the faces of enemy is shown nor there is a derogatory comment on any country(which usually is seen in historical war movies). This proves why the world cinema respects him. Mr. Nolan could have easily filmed war on a grand scale, given his reputation and the budget he can get approved. But he chose to show the other side of war. A deeper and painful side. His characters are intense. His screenplay is splendid. And it would be a sin if I don't praise his world class Direction.<br/><br/>This legend never fails to amuse me, intrigue me and astound me in every way possible. He turned a normal movie into a blockbuster with his brilliant, unconventional, non-linear screenplay (ofcourse backed by the master mind Zimmer's scores). He is a genius in film making. His imagination knows no bounds. As always, I bow to him with all of me for this spectacle, which is a pure, raw, clean and class form of cinema. Hats-off Mr. Christopher Nolan. The movie world owes you a lot.<br/><br/>#ChristopherNolan #Legend #MyMovieGod #NeverEndingDevotion"
"autisticreviewers","10","4","14","19 July 2017"," Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
","Christopher Nolan returns with his next feature film, it's not a mind boggling sci-fi, human felt drama or even a grounded superhero epic but his latest offering Dunkirk is a film that not only feels and look like a war film but feels so close to being one through the eyes of Nolan.<br/><br/>Based on three perspectives during the Dunkirk evacuation in the early stages of WW2 (a.k.a. Operation Dynamo), the film's story focuses on the solders on the beach trying to evacuate, the crew at sea attempting to reach them and the fighters in the sky, both defending them and attacking.<br/><br/>As with tradition of Nolan's films, the film heavily focuses on the human aspect and spirit of survival. The horrors they had faced to escape from the attacking Germans frequently and the soldiers themselves facing shell shock and inexperienced, and while the violence isn't as graphic and brutal like other war films like Hacksaw Ridge, Fury and Saving Private Ryan, it seems to be grounded and yet realistic to the true story.<br/><br/>On the technical side, visual effects are amazing with little to completely none CGI, most of the stunts and production design seems so realistic, Hans Zimmer's music score is one of his best works to date, suspense, dread and hopeful themes play in his work. Casting is spot on with solid performances throughout and Nolan's direction is true to the eye emotionally and visually.<br/><br/>Overall, Dunkirk is realistic and true to the history's story, while more of a suspense film than a violent conflict between good and evil, it shows the dangers and the courage that all soldiers went through to make it out alive. With great direction, sound and practical special effects, music score and amazing production value, this possible future Oscar contender is well worth watching for all Nolan fans like myself and as well for war historian buffs.<br/><br/>5/5 - Nick Christopher Nolan is not a director I like, and it's definitely one of the things me and Nick disagree on. For the first time ever I am pleased to tell you that I enjoyed this Nolan way more than is previous installments.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is based on the true story. It was a tragic war. The moment the film starts you don't feel safe. It has you on the edge of your seat. The movie never really takes too long to get going either. We have all these different characters who are all on the same journey and have different paths they all meet on, and it all comes together very nicely.<br/><br/>The performances were all fine. I thought the one that stood out was Cillian Murphy. He was a wreck and was suffering during this war and his acting clearly showed it.<br/><br/>The sound and editing was spot on. Really breathtaking. You believe you are there with the planes and you feel the pain the soldiers are in. You just never know when gunfire is going to go off and who is going to get killed next in this horrible war.<br/><br/>Not a fan of Nolan, but I will admit I really enjoyed Dunkirk. It's the first War Movie I know of that captures the feeling of suspense. Most war films rely on violence such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Hacksaw Ridge."" Nolan uses his brain and gives us something more intelligent than just blood and guts splatted in our faces. He gives us a realistic film of hope, survival and how a nation can all come together to help one another out and fight a war that isn't theirs! Best Nolan film by far! 4/5 - Jay"

","It was great but my expectations were way too high. There bound to be two kinds of audiences for this movie - absolute lovers & absolute haters, but no in-between'ers.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan weaves the magic once again after the dark night trilogy, inception, and interstellar, but this time in Dunkirk,he solely focuses of one aspect of emotion - tension/uncertainty!<br/><br/>It's not an epic, just keeping it short for 1 and half hours. The theme I liked is the way Nolan portrayed all the 3 aspects of war ie., land, sea, air intertwined in WW2.<br/><br/>The intense music that keeps us on edge of the seats, brilliant cinematography that keeps us glued to the screens till end, and the battle sequences including air to air combat are just mind blowing.<br/><br/>I can say this is the best war movie I watched after Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Nolan's intention was to capture the mood of the WW2 and transport the audiences to that 1940's era right in the middle of war zone and he achieved that 100%.<br/><br/>Movie has almost docu-drama feel to it given the nature of war theme back to back juggling among land, sea, and air combats. Almost no CGI was used in this movie.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, Nolan is one of the best directors in the world and Dunkirk is one of the best movies Hollywood has ever produced. All the technical aspects, be it sound mixing, editing, effects, or shot-taking.<br/><br/>This one is the best contender for this year's Oscars!"
"dim404","10","4","15","19 July 2017"," Nolan's best work to date. Must see!
","This must be one of the most gripping and realistic films about WW 2 (not a war film, according to Nolan) ever made. Superbly filmed, edited and acted, it forces you to experience what the people in that decisive event felt, with constant contact with death and annihilation and the desperation felt by several hundred thousand helpless soldiers on the beach surrounded by German troops. The aerial war scenes were magnificent and showed the RAF:s pilots exceptional heroism. An extremely emotional film, a tale of a military defeat turned into a moral victory that influenced the outcome of WW 2 and the world that we live in. Simply a masterpiece."

Why this pilot who has defeated alone and without fuels the whole fleet of the ""enemy"" (for some reason the Nazis, Germans etc are not named) handed himself to the ""enemy""? He could land on sea and be saved by the rescuing fleet.
But this is just a minor detail to this nonsense mess of a film. 
This only part of the movie that make some sense is the closing credits. 
This movie should be used by the police as an interrogation technique, although I wonder what crime deserves such a punishment.

I've never felt so inside a movie with possibly the exception of Avatar 3-D.

"annuskavdpol","8","3","10","6 August 2017"," Like a dream sequence.
","Christopher Nolan, the Director of this film did a very good job at explaining a close to impossible story of failure on the shores of Dunkirk France in the 1940's. The movie opens up with an unknown British soldier walking into the French town of Dunkirk. The French forces are holding off the Nazis as best as they can behind a sandbag homemade barricade. In a way, it seems the French, through their ability to block one of the only streets leading to the Dunkirk beach, saved the lives of the British soldiers; and at the same time the British soldiers in the movie would not allow the French to escape with them on their sea vessels. This detail explains the complexity of war and the expression - all is fair in love and war. Christopher Nolan captures the true essence of the unknown British soldier and his need to survive against all the odds. The filming and the visual narratives showed the viewer the component of luck in many of the survival maneuvers. However, Dunkirk is also known historical to be an ultimate failure on the part of the British; and at the same time a miracle that three hundred thousand British soldiers were able to survive this defeat without being slaughtered by gun-fire, bombs and explosions. Christopher Nolan is a great film director for telling a somewhat open ended story and leaving the unraveling up to the viewer. Like a good novel the author leaves the interpretation up to the viewer. Christopher Nolan, intentional or not filmed this movie, Dunkirk in a dream sequence. Dreams are often collages of piece of visuals that at first make no sense, but on thinking about it, makes lots of sense. Dunkirk 2017 had three narratives: earth; air and water. Dunkirk 2017 was a very original movie. I have not seen a movie is this style before. The detailed camera work and special effects were pin pointed on accuracy. The sight of the spinning spitfire propeller while shooting the Nazis was miraculous. The long Dunkirk beach and the North Sea had some kind of religious aspect about it. The sea itself seems to be a monster. Also the visuals of all the sea foam on the beach caused by the crashing of the waves was like something in a Renaissance painting of Zeus, Venus and Aphrodite. As a viewer, one could almost taste the sea foam. Dunkirk was a failure for the British but in happened at the start of World War II and if all the soldiers would have been wiped out on the Dunkirk beach in 1940, there would have been no soldiers left to fight the Nazis. The British soldiers were able to fight another day; and in the end, the British and the Allied forces were able to bring down the Nazis, which probably would not have been possibly with out these specific soldiers there to help."
"bowiekid","8","3","10","3 August 2017"," Stunning direction with minimalist characters
","This is a film that MUST be seen in theaters. Nolan does a brilliant job of dragging you into the terrors of WWII while keeping you on the edge of your seat; you don't need to know anything about the war to appreciate this film, which is a plus. The film begins with a young man embarking on terrifying journey to escape Dunkirk, an island where the Germans trapped the British army. Nolan shows three different angles of the battle: land (mole), sea and air, and does a beautiful job of fusing all three story lines together with plenty of suspense and a riveting soundtrack. <br/><br/>I was hoping that Nolan would take advantage of the incredible talent who signed onto this film, namely Cillian Murphy and Mark Rylance. Murphy and Rylance share the sea story line, which was exciting. However, I was disappointed by Murphy's lack of screen time and his small number of lines. I wanted more meaningful interactions between the two - there was so much missed potential there. <br/><br/>While some criticize the central character as taciturn, the minimalism here made more sense. Just as Tom Hardy's pilot was never meant to exhibit his fears and triumphs through anything more than facial expressions beneath his mask, the central character was never meant to voice his opinions or make heroic statements. Nolan uses the protagonist's silence to demonstrate the harrowing perils of war - how it blots out your sensibilities and forces you to run on instinct alone. <br/><br/>However, I do agree that many of the roles (namely Harry Styles's part as the gusty soldier who sticks by the central character) could have been filled by any actor. I was pleasantly surprised by the energy Styles injected into his scenes, but he likely won't be taking home any best actor awards...and neither will any other member of the cast, for the matter. <br/><br/>In summary. the real star of Dunkirk is the setting - the battle - itself. Even though Dunkirk isn't entirely historically accurate and its characters are overshadowed by their story lines, it's an achievement in excellent survival storytelling."

","I wonder if I saw the same film on which plaudits have been heaped by critics. At hand is a war narrative told on an Emily Dickensian slant that refuses to trifle with toothy commodities like character development, storyline, protagonist or climax. CGI is dodged to make room for soul and authenticity in this film, but soul forgot to audition. Extreme budgetary considerations went into creating authentic air and sea battle depictions, and nuanced lenswork is on hand with a shrewdly deployed color palate, but the film is no more endearing than a cold limp handshake."

"ameenisapoohead","9","3","10","26 July 2017"," A Different Kind Of Masterpiece. Nolan Refuses To Follow Suit Again
","Just like Interstellar, there is no doubt that this is a flawed film but the films that truly cement their place as classics in cinema are the imperfect ones. To truly create a masterpiece that changes cinema, you have to be bold. You have to be different. Nolan does just that yet again and I forgive flaws for ambition yet again.<br/><br/>The main complaint for this film that everyone seems to have is the main reason I loved it so much as many others did. War is brutal. Not because of the blood and guts as doctors see that in hospitals every day. It's brutal because when you're out there, alone, no one cares about you. You are just one soldier in a huge war. If (and most likely when) you die, you're forgotten in an instant. There isn't a heroic death or amazing last words or witty dialogue and a good few laughs before you die because the world just turns to black suddenly. That's the clear message that Nolan is putting forwards in this masterwork of art. The film itself is a metaphor to show how insignificant the one man is compared to the 400,000. Despite there being VERY little dialogue, I was constantly on the edge of my seat sat up very straight and clutching to the arm rests. This is because I didn't care about any particular, I cared about everyone. All 400,000 were on the line and I feared for every one of them. That is the true genius with this film. That is why Nolan is definitely on the level of Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock. He has shown that the war genre can be completely revolutionised and any old tropes can be completely eliminated.<br/><br/>Aside from the genius in the overall message of the film, the film itself is beautifully filmed and I would argue it is Christopher Nolan's best work as a director easily (even if it isn't his best film). I have never literally felt breath taken by a scene because it's just a figure of speech but I was genuinely barely breathing and not moving at all during some awe inspiring shots, particularly the ones involving spitfires scanning the horizon and ships tipping over. Barely any films have shots this ambitious, relentless, and incredible to behold.<br/><br/>The score was also unbelievable and revolutionary. Hans Zimmer's experimental work with Interstellar where he used noises rather than music pieces has definitely payed off at this point. I would argue the score is even better in this film. Every clock tick, horn and ominous strings instrument in the background added to the intensity of all scenes. Furthermore, it takes a genius to know when you need to be silent and the score is almost silent when it needs to be. I have never heard a more well placed and paced score or sound design in any other film.<br/><br/>Lastly, IMAX undoubtedly makes the experience infinitely better. Despite the screen being twice the size and having a higher quality, it's the sound that takes the stage here. The surround sound gives you goosebumps. You feel every bullet, artillery strike, bomb and explosion in this film when watching it in IMAX.<br/><br/>Overall, there is no doubt that the lack of characters and individual emotion is a flaw that I can't ignore which means this is far from a perfect film (hence the 9 score) yet I got closet to crying than 90% of films I have watched. One of the only films that hit me emotionally on this level is Interstellar but the fact that this film gave me ""the feels"" just as much is amazing. I won't spoil the actual moment itself but people who have already watched it will know what I'm talking about. The patriotic moment in question that occurs towards the end of the film was just incredible and nearly had me in tears mainly due to the very talented cast and their minor, subtle yet powerful roles.<br/><br/>This film isn't perfect but it's one of a kind and has given me an experience that I will probably never forget for the rest of my life. If I'm rich in future, I'm buying an IMAX theatre to install at home just so I can watch Nolan films like this because no other war film or any film for that matter will give you an experience anything like this.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"conndar","9","3","10","26 July 2017"," A valiant attempt
","There is no doubt that Christopher Nolan is a gifted film maker and his talents are there for all to see in this impressive and epic piece. Expertly shot, nicely acted, well made, and put together with care and passion this movie hits many of the marks required to elevate it to status of one of the 'All time great War Movies'. The opening scene akin to Saving Private Ryan immediately drops us into the loud and frightening line of fire. The urban scenes combined with pulsating score have us on edge from early doors. The harsh home hitting salvos leave us very much aware of the ominous might of the German forces and the perilous plight of the stranded allied fighters.<br/><br/>It should be noted, that unlike Spielberg's 15 rated movie, Nolan's is rated at 12s and rightly so. Whereas Spielberg relied heavily on amputees blood and gore, the latter doesn't need to flash pointless blood in our faces. Although not short of truly heart flinching moments, there are no head shots here. What there is however, is an unrelenting sense of isolation, desperation, fear, and mortality. Credit for this has to go the director.<br/><br/>For any war movie fans out there, the best way I can describe the narrative to this tale would be to mention 'The Longest Day'. Our story flips between a set of characters of differing time lines. Unlike the older movie though, all of these narratives meet in a crescendo of completion. This story shows us several viewpoints, all at a very personal level and brings them together into one larger more complete picture.<br/><br/>Here lies my first peeve. Don't get me wrong, it is expertly edited and as a story, it is delivered brilliantly. I just found the jumping time lines, although interesting to take in and a novel way of telling a story, a little annoying. Having the same character in two differing time lines leading to one ending I found odd. It might just be my penchant for old fashioned war movies and how they are told that perked my rigidness. In saying that, perhaps this story is better told in that new manner and a linear tale would not have had the same impact. This is the decision of the director and as I say, his work here is excellent.<br/><br/>I should like to quickly insert my second and last peeve regarding this film before I move on to the good herein. As I watched this movie I couldn't help feel that there weren't enough men on the boats. It might sound small, but fleeing warships had men maybe one or two deep on deck along the side. From pictures I had seen as a kid I remembered these boats being packed to the brim, so much so that they might be in larger danger of sinking from being overloaded than from any German bomber or U-boat. From a movie that instilled ominous fear from the start, I didn't quite feel the sense of bustling over burdened ships. I couldn't help but think 'you could fit loads more in there'. Anyway, a minor detail that I'm sure won't affect your enjoyment.<br/><br/>One thing that most impressed me in the movie is Tom Hardy's ability to act with just the expression in his eyes. This is surely a true gift of a talented actor. It can't be long before he tastes the sweet joy of an Academy award? Kenneth Branagh is his usual stoic self while Cillian Murphy is as solid as always. Just as with 'The Longest Day', no actor hogs the screen time as the story bounces between all our heroes. Worth noting further is that you will be so caught up in this movie you will hardly even notice the guy from One Direction. Time will fly by.<br/><br/>So, is it worth catching? Of course it is. I saw it on IMAX 2D and thoroughly enjoyed it, although an older gentleman who most likely may have been at Dunkirk seemed to think it was a little too loud. War is loud however, and Nolan has pulled off a truly great movie with depth, style and emotion. Must See.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL: After reading some of the so called reviews on here I must clarify that there is emotion in this movie, and lots of it. Real, numb, raw emotion perhaps best seen in the acts that men are driven to through fear and the thirst to survive. Just because they don't cry and tell you their life story or take out a pic of their sweetheart back home doesn't mean it is not there to be seen. It's not a Spielberg, it's not in your face, it's not riddled with C.G.I. and clichéd over acting. I assure you if you have any emotional intelligence you will feel the reality of this movie. If you'd rather see overacting, a three stage play act, lots of effects, and a happy ending, may I suggest you wait for the next Marvel production? This movie is a very good war movie and worth catching."
"henryluck","9","3","10","26 July 2017"," Dunkirk Review
","Dunkirk has to be one of the most awesome films I've seen in ages. Around every corner I was on the edge of my seat and constantly sucked into the intensity of the evacuation of Dunkirk. By what I loved about Dunkirk, was that it was a far more human film then a lot of other war films, making it a film that must be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>The film takes place during the mass Dunkirk evacuation of the Allied Forces (British, French and Belgium soldiers) in May 1940. The allied Forces were severely outclassed in terms of power to the German army and it looked that all hope was lost for the Allied Forces trapped on the beach of Dunkirk. But the army and civilians on ships nearby pulled together in the most humane and brave act of heroism ever displayed in military history.<br/><br/>One of Dunkirk's strongest points was that it didn't have a lot of dialogue or gore like in other war films. The film instead focuses on the intensity of the evacuation through both the land, sea and air. All three of these stories are separate at first but begin to merge with each other near the end. This makes Dunkirk one of the strongest war films I've seen because it's an actual representation of the evacuation instead of some ""Rambo"" or ""Call of Duty"" wannabe. But I did find it weird that there was no mention of Nazis or Germans even once with not even a flash of the Swastika. Nobody spoke German either from what I could recall. This made the film somewhat censored which slightly took away from the feeling that I was in World War 2.<br/><br/>Music is well used in Dunkirk as Hans Zimmer is behind the soundtrack. However, I didn't find a stand out track through the film but the film's music worked well for the scene I was watching such as a plane fight. But considering that Dunkirk is a film about just struggling to survive instead of some big bold action film like the Dark Knight then it shouldn't be so much of a problem rather then just a nit pick.<br/><br/>Sound is absolutely incredible in Dunkirk. Hearing the roaring of a German plane getting ever so louder before it drops an Earth-shattering bomb or hearing and seeing bullets puncture a ship feels jaw-dropping and actually keeps you on your toes. That's just seeing the film in standard cinema, so just imagine what an IMAX screening feels like.<br/><br/>Voice acting is solid and fit with the time of the film. Nobody talked slang or sounded out of place. But none of the characters' felt rememberable or had a sense of charisma. But again this is something that can be overlooked for the greater message of the film.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is one of those films that deserve the big screen treatment because not only does it blow you away in terms of sound but it also feels a lot more human then most war films. It doesn't tell a tale of victory as Dunkirk was one of the worst military operations ever suffered, but from this defeat the allies were able to learn from their mistakes and fight back to win the war, therefore preserving freedom and life for future generations to come. This is what makes Dunkirk special and a film that should be well respected in today's ever growing list of war films and games that make you feel unstoppable when you should actually feel at your most mortal.<br/><br/>9/10"
"pranayjalvi","8","3","10","26 July 2017"," Dunkirk surely will be remembered as one of the best war movies ever made.
","Although Dunkirk is technically a war film, its tone and style are those of a high-octane thriller. For his most serious-minded film to date, Christopher Nolan has employed all the weapons in his arsenal to craft something that, despite the Oscar-unfriendly July release date, will almost certainly be remembered when the Best Picture nominations are handed out.Dunkirk is also one of the best-scored films in recent memory, and Hans Zimmer's music plays as important a role as any character.Dunkirk satisfies as a brisk, gripping survival story. At only 107 minutes, it's also astonishingly short in an era when most movies needlessly run on long beyond the two-hour mark.Dunkirk is less of an epic than Interstellar or the Dark Knight movies – it's more tightly focused with no fat on the bones.

"reid-hawk","9","3","10","24 July 2017"," An exciting thrill ride that does justice to the real event
","There is a great gap between the opinion of general movie goers and more experienced film watchers when it comes to Christopher Nolan. Some people think he is a genius, while others believe him to be above average at best. I fall somewhat in- between those categories, but I think that anyone who loves movies can appreciate and enjoy his newest film 'Dunkirk"". I'm sure there is already a movement on the internet and on reddit to begin calling this film an ""instant classic"", and although I won't go that far I will say that I loved this movie. If I had to put it into numbers, I'd say it's around a 9.5/10 for me. I'll start by discussing what drives the film. It's not characters, as they mainly serve as vessels for the audience to view this film through. In truth the characters are not super fleshed out, but this isn't due to them being shallow, but instead due to the fact that the film is sparse on dialogue. No, the score is what powers this film. More so than even films like 'Baby Driver', I think the score is the most important element of 'Dunkirk'. It is constantly going throughout the film, never stopping to let the audience catch their breath until the very end. It is sometimes more quiet and subtle, taking form as the sound of a ticking clock or light string instruments, and other times it ramps up its intensity to draw us into the action unfolding in front of us. If this movie isn't nominated for best original score as well as best sound mixing it will be a real shame. From the first gun shot on you know this film is going to blow out some eardrums. It's viscerally loud. SO loud that some people complain they could not hear the dialogue, but even though the British accents could be hard to understand I would never say it was too hard to hear them. Sounds instead of dialogue move this movie's story along, and seeing as Nolan is a pretty crappy writer when it comes to dialogue (for the most part) this is a good thing.<br/><br/>Another thing I loved about this movie is just how real it felt, and I'm not just talking about the action. All the boats and planes seemed to be real and not CGI. Even as they crashed, exploded, and sunk into water. It all seemed so natural that I have no idea how he could have honestly filmed it without CGI, yet at the same time if the movie did use computer generated effects they were so top notch that I could not detect them. Due to this and the way they were shot (very up-close for the most part, almost to the point of them being POV shots) I'd have to say that 'Dunkirk' has the best aerial combat and dogfights of any movie I have ever seen by a long margin. But it's not just that either, but the uniforms and the beach and surrounding city itself just looked so amazing and authentic. It truly feels like you're just a bystander watching the chaos take place sometimes. The amount of actual planes, ships, uniforms, and extras Nolan must have gotten for this movie is just insane to think about. And overall it's all filmed so well too. The scenes of characters barely escaping drowning as their ship goes down is so pulse poundingly exciting and the camera is there up close to steadily film it all as it takes place.<br/><br/>This film feels very lean to me. By that I mean not a single shot is wasted, nor held too long, and there is very little downtime for inner reflection or lulls in the action. When there are lulls, the movie tries to force in some seemingly bogus drama, like a character going blind and another character accusing someone of being a spy. I don't love these elements of the film as much, but by the end I do think they lead to some proper story-arcs and actually helped develop our characters. My only real problem with this film to be honest is a continuity error towards the beginning. The camera puts us right up close to a character as bombs are being dropped, slowly but surely edging towards him but stopping just in the nick of time. Then, the film cuts to a wide angle, and here we see no dead bodies or craters from the bombs' impacts. This is such an obvious and frustrating error that it confounds me as to why it was even included in the film. But as I said, I love this movie. The ending for Tom Hardy's character might just be one of my favorite moments in any film. I recommend 'Dunkirk' to anybody and everybody, even if you absolutely despise Nolan I think this film exemplifies his best traits and his ambitiousness as a big budget director while downplaying his flaws."
"taryllsbaker","9","3","10","24 July 2017"," ""A thrilling, terrifying, edge-of-your-seat experience.""
","Dunkirk is written & directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard, Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Jack Lowden, Tom Glynn-Carney, Barry Keoghan, Kenneth Branagh, Harry Styles and Damien Bonnard.<br/><br/>Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II. (12A cert; 106 mins)<br/><br/>To withhold such gravitating tension whilst showing very little of the enemy is a tremendous achievement in suspenseful filmmaking. Christopher Nolan gives us no introduction, no story to back the characters, yet we feel a great sense of terror. To approach the war epic in a completely new and unique way was entirely predictable of Nolan, in no bad sense. We've seen the bloody side of war many times before, so to have a picture that relies less on gore and explicit violence is refreshing. Dunkirk is not your typical war film, this is a story of survival. A terrifying document of Operation Dynamo from three distinct perspectives; Land, Sea and Air.<br/><br/>The film opens momentarily with our first lead, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), walking down a desolate backstreet in France as the Germans drop the infamous ""We Surround You"" posters overhead. Clutching them, Tommy begins to run to the beaches as Germans open fire. The first shot on the beaches of Dunkirk in glorious IMAX 15/70mm film is beautiful but harrowing. In its huge scale, we see troops lined up, preparing to depart. Then we cut to Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), one of many sailors willing to aid the troops trapped in Dunkirk. Alongside is Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and George (Barry Keoghan), two brave young men who voluntarily partake in one of the most heroic missions of all time. Finally, we see pilots Farrier (Tom Hardy) and Collins (Jack Lowden) up in the air, flying towards the beaches, picking off enemy aircraft. It's worth noting that these events weren't occurring so closely in time. Many of the troops were trapped on the beaches for a week, the events on the sea happened in a single day, and the spitfires were carrying fuel lasting a mere hour. But in true Nolan style, he brings these historical events into one singular telling, and provides a constant, edge- of-your-seat experience.<br/><br/>It's very difficult to pick out any highlights from the incredible cast, because of how truly equal they were, but if I must; Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Fionn Whitehead were the most memorable. They all delivered gripping, relatable performances that really connected with me. That said, everyone else surrounding them were just as compelling. Tom Hardy has some fantastic action sequences, which are captured with remarkable skill, attaching IMAX cameras to the wings of planes, using them as if a GoPro. Harry Styles, in his debut acting role, is presented with some difficult lines to deliver, and performs surprisingly well. He, as any other, is strong and convincing. As aforementioned, I could list every performer and discuss how brilliant they were, but to round it up; Dunkirk has one hell of a cast. They all bring something great to their performances and without any major background, still manage to provide the connection required.<br/><br/>Using real naval destroyers, a Spitfire plane and up to 62 ships (many of which were used for Operation Dynamo) – and shooting on IMAX 65mm, standard 65mm and presented on IMAX 15/70mm – Christopher Nolan once again proves he is one of the greatest directors working today. This is his most experimental film, and an engrossing masterpiece at that. Teaming up with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema for their second project following Interstellar in 2014, Dunkirk is a stunning example of how film provides a more vivid, clear and crisp picture compared to digital. If you can, see this on film. It adds a grittiness not present in any digital presentation; I highly recommend the BFI IMAX in London.<br/><br/>Amongst all of the wonderful things about Dunkirk, and Nolan's work in general since The Dark Knight Rises, there is always something that I've disliked; the sound mix. This is not to be confused with sound design, which I've always found impressive in his films, and here it's a work of art in itself. But, the levels are sky-rocketing, a loudness in which quality is lost through distortion. It's an ear-piercing experience, perhaps the result they were aiming for, which makes perfect sense, given the events of the film. However, some of Hans Zimmer's score is hidden underneath this layer of force, as well as the small amount of dialogue.<br/><br/>Speaking of the score; Zimmer's work has a biting energy throughout, utilising Nolan's own pocket watch ticking as a constant reminder of the enemy nearby. I could wish for more emotional substance, however there's very little time for it, and his rework of Edward Elgar's ""Nimrod"" has a charming presence in the third act, an excellent culmination of the score and picture.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is huge in scale, but the way in which it's captured presents an up-close and personal documentation of the bravery of the individuals who were trapped on the beaches, the heroes on the sea, and the fighters in the air. This is Christopher Nolan's next masterpiece, and a film that should be viewed in the highest format available to you.<br/><br/>Verdict; Dunkirk is without a doubt, one of the most suspenseful films in years. An increasing tension in picture and score that provides a truly thrilling and terrifying experience.<br/><br/>Dunkirk – ★★★★★ (9/10)<br/><br/>(format watched; IMAX 15/70mm)"

","Really immersive experience with stunning detail and such emotion told with eyes (due to lack of dialogue) that really felt as if there, getting shot at or going under. One bit that was perhaps too realistic was the soundtrack as I do believe it did damage to my eardrums, especially the planes diving and machine-gun fire. Of course that will vary from cinema to cinema, but be forewarned and ready to protect yourself."

"BigGuy","9","3","10","24 July 2017"," War movie done right
","I really enjoyed Dunkirk, and as I walked out of the theater, I reflected on a number of things that were done right in the movie. Yes, there were some inaccuracies and some things that could have been handled better, but there was a lot to impress. The main thing that impressed me was that the movie was told entirely from the characters' points of view. Things that happen elsewhere, aren't shown. But also things that the characters can't see, also aren't shown.<br/><br/>One of the first scenes has one of the leads walking through a deserted Dunkirk with some fellow soldiers. Shots are fired, and it's suddenly a mad dash to try to get to safety. He never looks back, and the camera thus doesn't show the German's shooting at him, just the obstacles he has to climb over to get to safety.<br/><br/>{Minor Spoiler ahead} Relatively early in the movie there is a dog fight between three British Spitfires and a number of German planes. After the action, they are doing a radio check, and only then do they realize that the group leader is missing. The crash isn't show since they were to busy with their own dog-fight to see what happened.<br/><br/>Where the Germans start bombing the beach, the soldiers all watch the planes approach, but at some point they take cover. Thus they never see the bombs drop from the planes, just the resulting explosions.<br/><br/>{possible spoiler} I also appreciated that the movie didn't end with 5 minutes of crawling text to tell me what happened. Fortunately I knew how many people got off the beach, because they made a point to work it into the dialog. I also knew about the reaction in England (and Churchill's speech), not because they worked a radio broadcast in, but because a solider read it out loud from a newspaper.<br/><br/>The movie also was able to emphasize how desperate the soldiers were to get off the beach, but at the same time there was a sense of discipline. The sense of doom was so palpable that when the civilian craft showed up at the beach, I nearly teared up.<br/><br/>A few other things portrayed/related well: shell-shocked soldier, civilians dealing with losses of friends/family, {spoiler} that some were captured by the Germans, that the soldiers were apprehensive about how their country would respond to the defeat. My wife was very happy to see that there were women on board the civilian boats that came to the rescue, since that was true to the history. She was also happy that it was not a gore fest. Yes, there were plenty of deaths, but unlike most recent war movies, it doesn't show blood and body parts exploding everywhere.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a very well done movie, and if you are even moderately inclined to see it, I would recommend you do."
"The Grand Master","9","3","10","22 July 2017"," Brilliantly tension filled and visually amazing war movie.
","Christopher Nolan has done an amazing job bringing to life the true story of the evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk. From start to finish, the entire movie is filled with tension Dunkirk separates itself from many war movies. It doesn't heavily rely on dialogue, backstories, blockbusting sequences or any sentimental moments to keep the movie going. Surprisingly it does not rely on showcasing the horrors of war graphic violence which seems to be a trademark for a majority of war movies (i.e. Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, Full Metal Jacket et al). Instead, it cleverly focuses on three non-linear story lines which intertwine with each other.<br/><br/>The first viewpoint is on land with the main focus being on British soldiers Tommy (newcomer Fionn Whitehead), Alex (One Direction's Harry Styles who proves that he is not just a pretty face), and Gibson (Aneurin Barnard) who are fighting to survive by evacuating Dunkirk by sea. Also on the ground is Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) who is overseeing the evacuation of Dunkirk.<br/><br/>The second viewpoint is from the air with a trio of Royal Air Force pilots led by Farrier (Tom Hardy) providing air support to the troops on the ground. As they battle the various German fighter planes, they find themselves outnumbered and must successfully outlast and outwit the Germans to keep themselves and everyone on ground alive. Not only that, they must monitor their fuel usage.<br/><br/>The third viewpoint is from the sea. The British Navy is coordinating the evacuation of troops from Dunkirk and this includes commandeering private boats. Mr Dawson (Mark Rylance) and his son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) refuse to let the British Navy take their boat but instead go out on their own to assist in the evacuation. Teenage deckhand George (Barry Keoghan) impulsively joins in, hoping he can help make a difference. Along the way they rescue a shell shocked soldier (Cillian Murphy) who is the sole survivor of a wrecked ship following an attack by a U Boat.<br/><br/>Ever since his directorial debut with the clever thriller Memento (2000), Christopher Nolan has never put a step wrong throughout his career. So far in his stellar career, The Dark Knight trilogy has been his biggest crowning achievement. Here he continues his impeccable track record with the brilliant Dunkirk. Everything about it is top notch. The story wastes no time at all and everything about it just gets to the point and you find yourself rarely taking a breath let along looking away from the screen for a split second. Dunkirk was also terrific in not letting the movie carry on for 2-3 hours but instead keeps it tightly wound at 106 minutes.<br/><br/>If I was a betting man, I'm tipping Dunkirk to receive recognition form the various Award Ceremonies as well as one of the main movies to be heavily featured at next year's Academy Awards. And it's about time Christopher Nolan receives a well deserved Academy Award for his work. Dunkirk is very well done and is definitely one of the most memorable movies so far in 2017.<br/><br/>9/10."
"tapanmozumdar","9","3","10","22 July 2017"," Petrificus Totalus
","War is horrible. Newspaper reports or TV snippets dehumanize the horror. You browse through the oozing news from Syria or Afghanistan and can pickup your bag to drive away to your work. You settle on your study table after dinner and read first person accounts of the wars raging, as an assignment for your writing course. You feel drowned, but the literary skills of the reportage mesmerize you. You float back to the bed of daily life and snore off to sleep.<br/><br/>In its two hours, Nolan's Dunkirk doesn't let you skip the horror for a moment. Zimmer's sounds in loops make you cringe, wishing hard for it to stop. Hoytema's camera takes you within the gut wrenching inches of imminent death – in land, air and sea. Smith's edit roughs you up just every time you think you got a moment of relief.<br/><br/>You feel trapped with Tommy on the French island. Your only mission becomes to survive the next bullet with Alex, dodge the next bomb with Collins or avoid collision with a sinking ship with George. You root for the lads huddled in the hull of a trawler. You cheer at the sight of the planes at the horizon and then stun freeze upon the discovery of a Luftwaffe fleet. <br/><br/>You forget the side these characters represent, you don't care about your hatred for the colonial excesses of their country – you pray with them to reach a paradisaical home.<br/><br/>After a while, you don't remember that you came for the movie upon seeing 8.9/10.0 on IMDb. The craft of exhibition vies for your attention along with the art of narration. You should be glad to see cinema reach such excellence. Instead, you feel hurt as the three perspectives hit you with the single force of a trident. You bleed plenty, turn deaf after carpet bombing, and yet wish the film to run a bit longer. <br/><br/>You may be disappointed if you are a proud fan of Nolan. The narrative doesn't cover much of space or time. The tale is quite brief and contained. The writer - director uses disturbing details to zoom at the place of war or amplify the moments of survival on your face, with no apologies whatsoever. <br/><br/>You hear a clock ticking. Your pulse races at the synthesized ticking of the wrist watch which, you read later, belongs to Nolan himself. The audacity of a man possessed enough to make time shrink or expand to his wish gets visible in every frame.<br/><br/>It works as well for people not invested in the art of cinema. As an entertainment piece (Alas! I have to call a 'war film' that!), this thriller keeps the uninitiated at the edge of their seats. The story works with its three protagonists finding empathy among the masses. Sans any female role, an all-male cast evoke quite a few non-macho emotions – despondency, entrapment, a single minded zeal to survive – to name a few. Never before have you seen a director celebrate a historic defeat on celluloid.<br/><br/>When the lights of the theater are turned on, you can't rise from your seat. You should be home, but you are left with those who couldn't make out of Dunkirk. Petrificus Totalus, the filmmaker might well have shouted instead of yelling the routine 'cut'."
"paul-allaer","9","3","10","21 July 2017"," Best movie of the year (so far), hands down
","""Dunkirk"" (2017 release; 106 min.) brings the real story of the WWI evacuation from Dunkirk. As the movie opens, we are informed that the English and French troops are ""trapped at Dunkirk, awaiting their fate"". We then are introduced to three separate story lines: 1. The Mole (one week(, 2. The Sea (one day) and 3. The Air (one hour). We get to know Tommy, a British solder who is desperately trying to find a way off the beach, back home. Meanwhile, Mr. Dawson and 2 younger boys are readying their small Moontime boat to cross the English Channel towards Dunkirk. And in the third story line, we see three Spitfires watching in the skies for sign of any German planes. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-producer-director Christopher Nolan. He can do almost no wrong in my book, and his movies are EVENTS. Here he brings perhaps the finest movie of his career, bringing an ol' fashioned WWII true story (it's pretty amazing to think that since WWII ended over 7 decades ago, the Dunkirk evacuation has never been made into a movie--not counting the many documentaries of course). There is relatively little dialogue in the movie, so all the drama and tension comes from simply observing what plays out. And how dramatic it is! This is one of those movies that simply BEGS to be seen on the big screen. I must admit that the air battle scenes were simply out of this work. I cannot recall seeing a more thrilling account of WWII air battles since ""The Battle of Britain"". The reported production budget for this was $150 mill, and you can see why. Even better, we (or at least I) feel emotionally invested every single minute of this movie. This is mostly a no-name cast, with works great for this type of movie. Kenneth Branagh has a fairly small role as the pier master, and Tom Hardy is one of the Spitfire pilots. Bottom line: this is for me, hands down, the best film of 2017 so far.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" opened wide this weekend, and I literally couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was PACKED to the rafters, I am happy to report. The couple next to me seemed as into the movie as I was (I saw the woman hide her eyes with her hands on several occasions). Given the stellar critical acclaim this has been getting, and the strong word-of-mouth that surely will follow, I can see his movie having long legs at the box office, and deservedly so. ""Dunkirk"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"themadmovieman","9","3","10","21 July 2017"," Unprecedented in its bleakness and sheer intensity, and exactly what a true war film should be
","Christopher Nolan has proved himself time and time again to be a master of the most complex of genres, but what he does in Dunkirk is on another level, going so far as to change the very makeup of what a movie can be, and providing a relentless, bleak and unbelievably intense depiction of war that surpasses any film before it.<br/><br/>Dunkirk excels in almost every single aspect, but it's clear that its biggest strength comes from the great man himself: Christopher Nolan. First off, this isn't his typical sort of film. Apart from moving away from sci-fi for the first time in 15 years, it's a much shorter and swifter affair, yet it retains the legendary intelligence, intensity and thrills that have made him such a great of modern cinema.<br/><br/>What's most striking about Dunkirk is the fact that it's so unlike any film you've ever seen. With no exposition in the first act of any sort, nor any explicit character or plot development throughout, it's a relentless and unstoppable thriller literally from the very first second. What's more is that it manages to provide an unbelievable level of intrigue in three interlinking stories surrounding the events of the evacuation, and is utterly intoxicating despite what seems on the surface like 100 minutes of explosions and fighting.<br/><br/>But while Nolan works wonders with the action here, keeping up the intensity of the battle at every single moment, it's how he ties that in with the theme of war that makes Dunkirk so powerful. Over the years since the Second World War, there have been numerous ways of looking at the events that unfolded.<br/><br/>From the uplifting and patriotic British war films of the 1950s and 60s like The Dam Busters and The Great Escape, to the more modern and souring depictions like Saving Private Ryan and Hacksaw Ridge, many movies have looked at war in so many different ways, but none has ever shown it in such a realistic and bleak manner, bringing to light the true trauma and horror of battle, all the while retaining a degree of hope and patriotism, such was the mood of the British and wider Allied forces of the time.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call it a depressing film, and the dramatic intensity and action make it a thoroughly exhilarating watch, but the way it depicts the sheer hopelessness of being sitting ducks, totally stranded and surrounded by the enemy, is exceptional, giving a powerful portrayal of the emotional and mental distress that the bravest soldiers not only suffered during the battle, but also in the aftermath of such a traumatic week.<br/><br/>That sense of trauma and bleakness is further replicated in the film's incredible cinematography. While it features sweeping shots of the northern French coast and the English Channel, everything about this film feels incredibly claustrophobic, yet it adds significantly to the intensity of the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Centring on no more than two or three characters in each of the three stories, you feel just as blocked in on the beaches of Dunkirk as the soldiers, as cramped in as a valiant RAF pilot, or as brave and simultaneously frightened as one of the civilians who travelled all the way across the Channel to help evacuate the beaches.<br/><br/>In that, we see the characters act in almost always the same settings. One man is sat inside a Spitfire for the entire movie, where we don't even see his face, another is inside a boat for the entire duration, and the soldiers themselves are stuck on the desperate wasteland of the beach, never managing to find a way out, no matter how hard or how many times they try to escape.<br/><br/>On the whole, Dunkirk is quite an incredible film to witness. Demonstrating the truly masterful powers of director and writer Christopher Nolan by featuring revolutionary and unprecedented filmmaking and storytelling techniques that make for a dramatic intensity the likes of which you've never felt before, as well as proving what a war film should be: bleak, claustrophobic, intense and chaotic, it's an absolute masterpiece of cinema, and one that will undoubtedly go down in years to come as one of the best pieces of war cinema in all of history."
"badastral","10","3","10","20 July 2017"," Will be Referencing Remarkable Future War Films as the next ""Dunkirk""
","As an individual who was a toddler when ""Saving Private Ryan"" first came out, it dawned on me on the 70th anniversary of D-Day that no film that captured a courageous sentiment and anti-war allegory could ever be more captivating. After seeing ""Dunkirk"", I am proud to say that I no longer have to reference mini-series like ""The Pacific"" and ""Band of Brothers"" or films like ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" or ""Hacksaw Hidge"" to ""Saving Private Ryan"" (not many people in my circle know these). I will ensure that I will do everything in my power to make ""Dunkirk"" a classic everyone should know.<br/><br/>What made these other war films memorable was its effective music where much of the time, it engulfs the silence of carnage. What made ""Dunkirk"" standout is that I forgot that Hans Zimmer was the composer up until the credits. Its sound design is phenomenal, particularly with its genuine spitfire from an actual Spitfire. Every hole pummeled on the beach and in the boats left my ears incapacitated. As for the theatrical elements, soldiers are each one of a kind. In reality, the evacuation of Dunkirk saved many, but many still perished. I am usually one for hoping every hero survives, but because of the cost, there was priorities even set for the main characters. Understandably, the shell-shocked acting will have many psychologists puzzled.<br/><br/>This is as much as I can reveal without spoiling a historic week that one could read while visiting Dunkirk, France. Honourably, I made an IMDb account seventy-seven years later just for it."
"eric1","4","4","16","22 July 2017"," Would you call Saving Private Ryan 'Normany'?
","I found that he title is misleading, this movie has no interest in presenting the Dunkirk retreat, rather than focusing on three groups. In other words, if you are not interested in World War II, you probably won't understand what's going on the whole time. It's like to call Saving Private Ryan 'Normany'; or Deer Hunter 'Vietnam War'."
"Samiam3","8","3","11","20 November 2017"," One of the years best
","Dunkirk is a director's achievement.<br/><br/>It's in the way that Nolan stages a handful of brutally suspenseful sequences of peril with an unobtrusive grace that so many directors lack. He allows the camera to linger when others may have cut. He knows that there is no rush to get to the next scene or set up. The characters are stranded on the bleach shores of northern France. They are not going anywhere, so why should we. We can feel their frustration at being a stones throw away from England while the Nazi fighters and u-boat sink every vessel that attempts to get them off the beach.<br/><br/>Nolan has a rare ability to make the audience feel small though his placement of the camera and the depth of his frame. The wide shots are stunning, but without being distracting. That sea and the sky go on forever, which is as beautiful as it is intimidating because certain supporting characters are racing the clock to get to reach that spot on the distant horizon.<br/><br/>There are certain sequences of human drama spread across the film with many be small but they represent what is great. If you are looking for character in Dunkirk you may be disappointed. Similar to films like Gravity, the characters are us. The only distictive individual is Mark Rylance as a veteran sailor taking his boat across the channel to get some of the boys home. He is going on a virtual suicide mission with a casual demeanour that is some kind of extraordinary. It is as if he has convinced himself that if he fears than he fails. He represents what is the movie's strongest theme; the power of ordinary people. The soldiers get home on the private vessels and fishing boats of ordinary Englanders who were willing to heed the call.<br/><br/>The one weakness of the movie is the same as that of Nolans last two films, the sound mix is murky and the dialog often inaudible."
"kastri_gr","10","3","11","7 September 2017"," An excellent war film
","Christopher Nolan made it again.The director of memento,dark knight trilogy,inception and interstellar is in my modest opinion among the greatest directors such as Spielberg,Cameron,Scott,Scorsese e.t.c Dunkirk is a war film which the scenario depends upon the real events that took place from 26 may-4 June 1940 the famous battle of Dunkirk with the successful evacuation of 300.000 British soldiers from the Nazi's troops.<br/><br/>The reason why it is unique is that it is the first war film about the second world war which is referring to an event that occurred at the beginning of the world war 2 and not the end.The second reason this film is referring to real events from the famous Commander Charles Lightoller who managed to evacuate thousands of British wounded soldiers from the mole of Dunkirk.The last reason is the action scenes which were very realistic and not to forget the great acting by Tom Hardy who plays a pilot for the British royal air force,Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton and of course Mark Rylance as Mr.Dawson.<br/><br/>What it is not to be compared is with movies saving private Ryan,Schindler's list,the pianist,fury,inglorious bastards because it is something different.I wouldn't say that it is a masterpiece or one of the best Nolan's movies but it is a movie that someone should see."
"sandwiched","9","3","11","2 September 2017"," Intense in a way you've never experienced before
","""Dunkirk is worth seeing in the theater more than any other movie I've ever seen."" - My SMS to my brother—who loves movies as much as I do—upon exiting the theater.<br/><br/>""I don't think I've ever paid money to be stressed out for two hours before."" - The friend I watched Dunkirk with.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a very unique film.<br/><br/>The left jab is visual. You have the wide open settings of the expansive beach at Dunkirk, the waters of the Channel, and the skies above both. There's plenty of other, ""standard"" shots as well, but the large open swaths of territory are what stick in the mind. They impart a sense of scale to what other movies might feel like condensing down for ""dramatic effect"" (or whatever). While I never quite felt like I saw an entire 400k soldiers on the beach, the amount of soldiers that were there were sufficient to convey that there were a LOT of lives on the line.<br/><br/>The right cross is chronological. The three story lines, whose threads we follow throughout the entire two hours, take place over different swaths of time—one happens within an hour, another within a day, and a third over the course of over a week. Yet this chronological disconnect between the story lines is not detrimental to the tapestry being woven here. Before realizing this disconnect, there were a couple of times when I was distracted by it being day in one scene but night in another, so an awareness of this aspect of the film might be helpful to have ahead of time (incidentally, this disconnect is communicated up-front in the movie from the start—the on-screen title of one location is subtitled ""One Hour"", while the next locale is ""One Day"", etc. I didn't pick up on this until reading the IMDb trivia section afterwards.)<br/><br/>However, it is in the audio realms that Dunkirk delivers its haunting— and extremely effective—uppercut. Two aspects stand out here. One, this is a film that Episode 7's Luke Skywalker would have felt at home in. There might be 50 lines in the entire movie, and yet, you know exactly what everyone is thinking or feeling at any given time. You can read it on their faces and see it in their behavior.<br/><br/>Yet other movies before Dunkirk have had minimal amounts of dialog. The true power behind the aural uppercut is the soundtrack. Viciously intense from start to finish, the score is not as much a piece of music as it is the sound of fight-or-flight adrenaline. It is a constant, never-ending presence throughout the entire movie, and your ears get about as much respite as those brave men on the beach. However, it never comes across as too much or inappropriate. It powerfully maneuvers every moviegoer's mind, heart, and even lungs to feel like you are a part of each scene—and I don't think it's a spoiler to say that none of those scenes were things you'd want to actually partake of. You've probably heard the saying that war is ""months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme terror."" Well, the score of Dunkirk captures those moments of extreme terror perfectly, and doesn't let you forget them in the rare interludes of boredom, either.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has K'd it O of the park (if I can for a moment utterly mix my metaphors). Dunkirk is a movie to be seen on the biggest screen you can get to. And apologies to a sizable portion of the world's population, but don't watch it with people who can't keep quiet during movies. It really needs to be experienced uninterrupted, start to finish.<br/><br/>I'll close by addressing one of the complaints about there being no story to it: utter nonsense. Perhaps the complainer was expecting a Hollywood twist to the well-known historical event. I'm sure the participants would have welcomed such a twist even more. Kudos to Nolan for not interjecting in with an incongruous love triangle or some other nonsensical ""enhancement"". In that sense, Dunkirk is to WWII what Rogue One was to the Star Wars universe—we all know how it ends, but it's the telling of the story that matters. And there IS a story, summed up perfectly in the movie's tagline: ""When 400,000 men couldn't get home, home came for them."""

","I didn't know much about the style of this film so I was open to any take on Dunkirk. Trying to imagine the fear of the sitting ducks at Dunkirk was well portrayed by the faces of the soldiers. Knowing that at any minute you could be shot the wait to leave the beach would have been painstakingly long. There was no real need for character building since there were overlapping stories & the purpose of each character was quickly understood with very little dialogue. There were times I wished that there were subtitles because it was hard to understand but even still the message was given with the eyes of the actors. Most of the soldiers were 17 or 18..just young boys who found themselves in a perilous situation and looking to each other for understanding of what they were experiencing. I really liked the movie, didn't care for the soundtrack and found it irritating when it would rise to a crescendo. This movie would appeal to history buffs like me & to fans of Harry Stiles. There were no real stand outs in the acting but I think that was the point...no lone wolf/ hero"

With the enemy in the face, and the end of the war just around the corner, our soldiers must survive.<br/><br/>Let's start with the actors. The actors who choose Nolan, I don't know where taken out but, are very good. Fionn Whitehead is very good, just talking, but that does not imply that it is a good actor. But those who steal the film, most, are Kenneth Branagh, Oscar winner Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy. Most of the latter. The film gives its own time, because Nolan admires him as an actor. It is a very nice character to their principles as a soldier, and his duty as such.<br/><br/>The truth is that Christopher Nolan is my favorite director, I must admit. Although i also like others like Anthony and John Russo, Trantino and ultimately Matt Reeves. But I am inclined by Nolan.<br/><br/>The effects are very good. I don't know if the planes are real or are effects, cannot be differentiated. And you also have to give a big round of applause to the sound effects. The aircraft, the shots, even breathing of the soldiers. But sometimes the music you saturated too. These 10 minutes with the same music of the violin, to me it doesn't bother me so much, but for the rest of the audience can be very unpleasant and annoying.<br/><br/>The story is divided into 3. In the spring (1 week), in the sea (1 day) and in the air (1 hour). I liked this format. Transforms the movie much more difficult to understand (Nothing is easy in the case of Nolan, Inseption Interstellar or example). Because I can easily have been a story very slow. But Nolan transforms it into something witty.<br/><br/>Uuslmente Nolan was characterized by making films of fiction, but this time in favor of the real.<br/><br/>The truth is that this film, can be one of my best this year. But nothing is going to overcome The Dark Knight and Inception.<br/><br/>The best of the year 9/10"
"aliceprez","8","3","11","29 July 2017"," Nolan's Best Film Since 'Memento'
","This is without question Christopher Nolan's best film since 'Memento'. What truly works for this film is that it relies heavily on the impact that its atmosphere and energy produce and, therefore, it allows its audience to react naturally to the events at hand. This film is largely devoid of much of the patronizing nonsense that Nolan has come to make his trademark over the years. Unlike his 'Dark Knight' trilogy or 'Inception', there is no overstated sense of importance. Rather, this film revels in its directness and honesty of its subject."

","This movie is as good as they get. Amazing cinematography and excellent screenplay. I am not sure if it is an accurate depiction of the history but Mr Nolan has done it again. He has created a masterpiece. I spent the whole time at the edge of my seat. The planes and the ships and the torpedoes and the fighting scenes are shot beautifully. An amazing watch after a long time. Will recommend this to everyone."
"mrblacktip","10","3","11","26 July 2017"," A Solid Left-Handed Pitch From Nolan
","When the title and scope of this movie was revealed I was very surprised: the director that has lead the charge in surreal story telling, superheroes, and sci-fi since 2000, is doing a WWII piece? It did not add up in my head, but I was anxious to see what would come of this unexpected combination of elements. The final results did not disappoint, and left us with a solid left handed pitch from writer-director Christopher Nolan. That said, I would agree that this film is one of Nolan's least accessible films for a casual viewer.<br/><br/>The fact that Nolan left behind sci-fi and fictional tales to tell a story based on true events is something new for the director; doing a war piece is new; and much of his cast was all new save Hardy and Murphy. However, with all these new pieces on the board Nolan still retains some of his hallmark characteristics to ensure a delightfully told story, namely his manipulation of time. Non-linear story telling and time manipulation are used in a large portion of his films whether it be the flashbacks of Following, the meet in the middle of Memento, the journal reading in Prestige, slowing time down in Inception, or speeding it up in Interstellar, the man rarely tells a straightforward story, and he does it yet again in a novel and innovative fashion in Dunkirk. <br/><br/>With seeing the same events from multiple perspectives throughout the film, and jumping around on a time line between the land, air, and sea the film immerses you more so than usual into what it must've been like for the individuals involved. Whether it was the pilot in the downed airplane, the group swimming out of the sinking ships, or the men in the boat having Tom Hardy protect them from his airplane. <br/><br/>I have read some criticisms on how there seems to be a lack of connection to the characters-this film lacks any single leading role (A large departure from typical Nolan) and lacks much dialogue-which can make it difficult to feel sorry for them when things go bad, but I argue that the viewers need to meet Nolan halfway. There are numerous instances that are scattered throughout in which the viewers can latch onto in order to feel more deeply connected with characters if one only puts in the effort. A shortlist of said examples are: The boat captain (Rylance) refusing to turn around despite George getting hurt and the soldier warning against it; Hardy's character deciding to stay longer to shoot down more enemy planes despite his fuel levels; The frenchman opening the door on the destroyer after it had been torpedoed; Kenneth Branagh staying longer to help evacuate the French; Peter lying to the soldier (Murphy) about George. All of these moments speak into the character of the individuals and the sacrifices they were willing to make for the greater good. <br/><br/>Such a terrific and novel way to show the heroism of WWII. 10/10 will watch again"
"anupapu8","10","3","11","24 July 2017"," Just short of a Masterpiece .
","DUNKIRK - Talk about visual treat . Waaow. But I can't start my review before mentioning how much I Love Christopher Nolan . He is the living God of movie-making. Only he can does what he does.<br/><br/>Where I put Dunkirk ? - his 7th best , behind - TDK , TDKR , INCEPTION , INTERSTALLER , PRESTIGE and MEMENTO. That's pretty behind as per his standard but it's still the best movie of this year.<br/><br/>I was almost hopeless about getting the chance to watch this movie on big screen , but I got it , while I was on holiday , unexpectedly . One of those instances when God listens to your prayer.<br/><br/>Nolan had said that he had studied various movies before making Dunkirk. 2 of the major movies were Saving Private Ryne and Unstoppable. Just think about mixing two of such distinct directors - Spielberg and Late Tony Scott , and you could get what Nolan has brought to the table here.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a fast movie , time ticking , nail biting (in a literal sense I was biting my nails) thriller . You can say Nolan has made his own Sub Genre inside the Genre of War movies. That's why you can't call it Nolan's Saving Private Ryne which people were calling it before release. Because it very unique and totally owned by Nolan. It's his own Dunkirk. Its not Inspired. It will inspire future movies.<br/><br/>But you must know about the movie and history behind it before watching it or it can confuse you. Don't worry I will make an exception for this film and give you a crash coarse .<br/><br/>It's about Dunkirk evacuation on a French Beach during WW2 , the biggest evacuation in the history of War. Almost 400000 soldiers were there in that beach and as per Wikipedia 338226 soldiers were saved . Thats the basic plot of the movie. But Nolan doesn't make movies that simple. He told the story with three prospective.<br/><br/>1st - THE MOLE - Telling it from the view point of various Soldiers on the ground (including former One Direction Singer Harry Style , performing very decently) showing a period of 1 Week.<br/><br/>2nd - THE SEA - Telling it from the view point of a Civilian MARK RYLANCE sailing to Dunkirk to help the soldiers , showing a period of 1 day.<br/><br/>& 3rd - THE AIR - Telling it from the view point of Aircrafts with Tom Hardy trying to save the Soldiers from above , showing a period of 1 hour.<br/><br/>All these stories run simultaneously , and get connected at the end. But it seeks concentration. If you will loose the concentration it may make you confuse.<br/><br/>It's a very short film (107mins) . And that was the aim of Nolan. He doesn't wanted to make a conventional war film. There was no politics , no backstories , no photos in the pocket of soldiers for emotional connection , no person shown waiting for the soldiers in the home. The movie shows the physical pain they have to tackle while they were within the war.<br/><br/>You see different emotions , fear , selfishness , unclear mind , hope , within the soldier. They would do anything to go home.<br/><br/>Two important things - Musical score and Cinematography were almost two characters in the movie.<br/><br/>The camera moves very swiftly. Specially in THE AIR section , you feel the movie like you are inside the Aircraft. But it's wonderful throughout the film. It's very bleak and grim . Showing hopelessness. No sign of Sunlight. Beautiful and Horrifying at the same time. Once you see beautiful sea water below the boat , after sometime in other scene you see dead bodies floating in the same water. It's worth an Oscar nomination. What makes it more gorgeous is the least use of Visual effects. I can't point out a single scene which didn't seemed realistic. Add the wide angles and clearity of IMAX camera to it. And it's perfect. Although I haven't seen it in Imax Screen.<br/><br/>But the real winner here is the musical score . You can't beat Hans Zimmer in Orchestral music. The intensity of the synthesizer mixed with the ticking clock is exceptional. Zimmer always saves his best for Nolan. The score is so complimentary to the film is that sometimes you can't even differentiate between the score and the sound of weapons.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Sound effect and Sound mixing department. Which are two guaranteed Oscar wins for this film. The effects were so perfect that the sound of bombs will make your heart jump outside your chest. Will shake your eardrums.<br/><br/>The editing is exceptional. On par with Inception. The transition between three time-line is smooth (if only you concentrate enough) and not a single unwanted scene. The movie keeps on moving every time. Never stops . No time for talk. The survival was continuous from the very first second till the very last second of the movie. I am sensing another guaranteed Oscar here.<br/><br/>But he faulted in some minor things here . Which doesn't happen frequently . There was a scene in the end when it's not shown clearly how Tom Hardy destroyed enemy's plane , it's just shown that something hit it and we have to assume it's Tom Hardy's plane. Also the whole 1week part was not shown correctly . What I mean that I only sensed two nights , and three days , it didn't show all 7 days which felt a little awkward.<br/><br/>This story couldn't have get a better treatment.<br/><br/>And yes , you must see it in the best possible screen available to you.<br/><br/>8.9/10 ANuP APu KuMaR."
"avianblue","9","3","11","24 July 2017"," Trailer does not do this justice - excellent!
","I must admit I was mightily intrigued when I found out that a new, up-to-date version of the Dunkirk story was being made. But then I saw the trailers - and decided that it looked just awful! The initial disappointment was palpable! <br/><br/>But that's the unique thing about this film - it's almost impossible to convey what the audience experience is like (especially an IMAX one) through the limited medium of a standard movie trailer. Because yes, this is a very different war film indeed! As has been stated elsewhere there's not much in the way of a plot and not much in the way of character development so this is definitely not going to be everyone's tin mug of tea - as is ably demonstrated by the variation in the reviews to be found here. The format is such that you're either going to love it or absolutely hate it. So how did I come out of the cinema thinking how utterly brilliant it was? <br/><br/>I guess the best single-word reason as to why this is so good is 'intensity'. This is maintained for most (although sadly not for all) of the film's duration. Make no mistake though, the reason for this intensity lies to a very large extent with the sound, the visuals, and most of all Hans Zimmer's score. These all benefit hugely from an IMAX screening and I'm not sure the film would have anywhere near such an impact otherwise. So if you're going to see it, see it big and loud! <br/><br/>As well as plot and characterization there's a dearth of dialog in this movie but this really makes it into the fantastic experience it is. For instance, when Tom Hardy turns back to take on one last German bomber, despite being critically low on fuel, there's no dialog to explain what's going on. In any other film you would have had his colleagues pleading with him over the radio to head home to safety. But all you have here is a look of sad resignation in his eyes (which is all you can see behind oxygen mask and goggles) as he turns back to the fight knowing that he won't have enough fuel to get back to base. Superb!<br/><br/>Not perfect by any means - it's at its best when Nolan keeps the intensity up but he lets it slip about two-thirds of the way through before redeeming himself at the end. Nevertheless a brilliant, original take on a genre where I thought we'd seen it all."
"RayCharles81","9","3","11","23 July 2017"," Don't listen to IMDb trolls reviews. Its a pretty great movie. 86% audience score.
","If you look at the reviews on here, you'll see most people either love it or hate it, and a few people find it good but not great. However, the latter is less pronounced. The reason why is because only the most passionate people write reviews for popular and critically acclaimed movies such as this. <br/><br/>I'm just writing this to actually help people who may be on the fence about watching it and like me, may not be sure which reviews to believe to make their decision. <br/><br/>However, the audience Cinemascore is very high with an average of about 85%, maybe more, RT is around 83%, and of course here it's 8.7 after 50k + ratings currently. So, analyzing that, you'll find the vast majority of people do not agree with the negative reviews or really any actual rating below an 8. Anyone who rates below an 8 is in the vast minority. And this is not to include a Metacritic score of 94, with about a dozen top critics giving it a perfect score of 100. <br/><br/>Nolan movies always attract haters. Heck, on IMDb any critically acclaimed or pop movie attracts lots of trolls, haters, and negative reviews. So don't listen to the MINORITY that vote it below 8 or are highly critical. They're either trolls, Nolan haters, or they didn't see superheroes in capes so we're disappointed a summer movie was actually artistically made.<br/><br/>Now, that being said, let me give you my brief review: Visually speaking, Dunkirk is amazing and awesome. It's a little like Gravity in that way that the visuals alone are enough to make it a good movie experience. They're stunning. <br/><br/>The film is shot like an old classic, silent war film with very little dialogue, relatively speaking. There is dialogue, but just not nearly as much as most war films you've seen. Simply put, this is visual storytelling, perhaps like silent era films in some ways, but with modern day technology. <br/><br/>But not to worry, the film grips you from the opening scene and is riveting with nonstop action sequences. Personally, I found it hard to look away, my eyes glued to the screen. In other words, if you just accept it as a visual war movie and an artistically made one, there is no need for excess dialogue; it's good enough as is to rivet and immerse you in the battle of Dunkirk. <br/><br/>Technically, and visually, it's about perfect. You feel right away that this is shot like an Oscar contender, and that is sustained throughout. It very likely will get many nominations including Best Picture and Director. <br/><br/>Personally, I thought it was great. There's no wasted scenes, it goes by fast (only about 90 minutes), it's nonstop action, with beautiful scenery and scenes. It plays out like a heroic victory for the allies due to several heroes including a pilot in a dog fight. <br/><br/>This is a 4/4 **** movie with no weaknesses other than if you're into artistic writing it doesn't develop characters. But the story's essence is to put you right into the middle of the action. <br/><br/>I liked this more than Private Ryan (9/10) and Hacksaw Ridge (8/10). Take that for what you will. It's just more immersive, tight, shorter, and visually astounding. I liked that there were no wasted scenes.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, on this one, believe the 10 or so top critics who gave it a perfect 100 score on metacritic, and the audience who gave it an 86% overall. That's telling you most people loved it. Don't listen to the negative critics on IMDb. They made me doubt its worth, but once I started watching it I loved it and knew they were in the wrong. <br/><br/>9/10 (no less than 8)"
"meeza","10","3","11","23 July 2017"," Nolan is the man!
","The great auteur Christopher Nolan has just orchestrated his most mature and visceral picture in his esteemed career. I am referring to the true World War II story ""Dunkirk"". It is based during the early part of the war when French and British allies where stuck in the Dunkirk beach as they are attacked by the German nemesis. British civilians with their ferry boats put on their heroic hats and went on a mission to save the British soldiers. Nolan integrates the viewer right into the dungeons of ""Dunkirk""; either by sea, land, and air. The narrative is presented into these three segments; sea in a day, land in a week, and air in an hour. And they come all together masterfully due to Nolan's firepower. ""Dunkirk"" is Nolan's show. I have never seen a war movie depicted in a fashion where one never sees the enemies and there is such little bloodshed, but works so astoundingly. It is mostly a profound evacuation picture. Now there are actors here that due solid work; Mark Rylance as the civilian seaman, Cillian Murphy as a rescued pilot, Tom Hardy as an air force pilot; and also some young actors that really pulled their acting landing in Fionn Whithead, Damien Bonnard, and Harry Styles; yes I went that direction, that Harry Styles. Hans Zimmer's score is riveting and propels the movie in a very gripping manner. The cinematography, art direction, and production design all allied to perfection. But I go back to Nolan, because this was Nolan's land. And if Sir Nolan does not get nominated for a Best Director Oscar, I will be have to be evacuated from watching next year's Academy Awards. ""Dunkirk"" is the best film I have seen so far in 2017. ***** Excellent"
"theandrewahern","10","3","11","23 July 2017"," Dunkirk (2017) Movie Review
","""We will never surrender"". At this point I've come to believe that this should be the personal motto of director Christopher Nolan and his team, as once again he has delivered a film that is nothing short of a masterpiece. Currently sitting at a ""fresh"" 92% on RottenTomatoes.com, an 8.8 on IMDb.com, and a 94 on Metacritic.com, Nolan's 2017 film 'Dunkirk' is arguably his best film to date.<br/><br/>'Dunkirk' immediately stands out for it's unique non-linear narrative, wherein three major plot threads spanning the course of one week, one day, and one hour are interwoven and interact masterfully with one another. Across the three threads the audience is introduced to several characters whose experiences are all vastly different yet ultimately intertwined, unbeknown to them. Herein lies the one and only criticism that I have seen expressed regarding 'Dunkirk', as it lacks a single human center, but I believe it works wonderfully for the film. Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy, and all the young men playing foot soldiers all do an excellent job in their roles, and the lack of a single lead and the very minimal amount of dialogue throughout the film makes it feel real and aids in building the illusion that the audience is present at Dunkirk, watching these terrible events unfold. It is visceral and together with Hans Zimmer's unforgettable score, utterly haunting.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer is director Christopher Nolan's normal go-to for the scores in his films, and it could be argued that the two are something of a package deal. In every film that the two have collaborated on – 'Inception', 'The Dark Knight Trilogy', and 'Interstellar' – just to name a few, the scores have meshed with the visuals and stories so successfully that the movies would feel utterly different with a different score. 'Dunkirk' is no exception to this rule, and may even be the prime example of it. In every moment of this 106-minute film tension is building and had me at the edge if my seat, heart pounding. Never have I seen a film without a dull moment such as this.<br/><br/>In conjunction with the fantastic score by Hans Zimmer, 'Dunkirk' sports breathtaking visuals by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and is edited wonderfully by Christopher Nolan's long-time film editor Lee Smith. Every scene is both beautiful and terrifying. It is a rarity to see a film that works on literally all levels – story, plot, score, visual, editing, etc., and yet here 'Dunkirk' is.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan's 'Dunkirk' is a short film. Clocking in at just over an hour and a half, it is one of Nolan's shortest – but arguably his most important. Based on the historical event, known as the Dunkirk Evacuation – taking place between 26 May and 4 June 1940 – Nolan masterfully and respectfully introduces this important World War II event to the mainstream.<br/><br/>Whereas many war films and period pieces are long and drawn out, Nolan's 'Dunkirk' is tight and efficient – successfully entertaining, educating, and eliciting emotional responses from its audiences on one of the most important events in the past hundred years without being dragged down by superfluous extra material. 'Dunkirk' is not only Christopher Nolan's best film to date, it is one of the best war films of all time."
"anandthrissur","10","3","11","22 July 2017"," Epic as the regular ""Nolanish"" way ....
","Dunkirk was perhaps my most anticipated movie this year and as speculated, this pure visual ecstasy is the BEST Hollywood movie this year. Helmed by the top notch Director of this century Christopher Nolan, this movie literally made me numb for those 106 mins of sheer spectacle and nerve-wracking moments.<br/><br/>Without any 2nd doubts, I can bet on it that brand #ChristopherNolan can't fail in his narratives and I can even predict that, this guy can't deliver a flop. Not in this lifetime   #Maverick. I bow down to you my master, my inspiration.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a simple black bar with a title DUNKIRK and the very next moment we are put in a situation with utmost paranoia and fear. Yes, I want to stand up and clap for the sound designer and composer Hans Zimmer who have designed a masterpiece sound effect which makes your heart pound rapidly. We can almost feel the heartbeat of those characters and the intensity of that situation, Kudos guys <br/><br/>Second in the line to be lauded is the DOP #HoyteVanHoytema for executing the vision of #Nolan with his camera work. Editing is perfect while there are only 20% of dialogues in this movie ( Epic  ) No lead heroine or any antagonist but still, the movie succeeds big time in creating an atmosphere which will haunt you even after you leave the cinema hall.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple about the evacuation of more than 300,000 soldiers, mostly British who gets stranded in the land of Dunkirk and the screenplay is written brilliantly with 3 factors ( Aerial, Sea, and Land ) whereas Nolan being himself, has smartly cut the timeline and duration for each factor which brilliantly meets at the climax. With this, #ChristopheNolan has reached at par with the filmmaking techniques of Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1st and foremost, it has to be none other than the great #ChristopherNolan himself. Cinematography ( Best experienced in IMAX screens) Sound design and Background Score. Tom Hardy's sheer presence. Cons:<br/><br/>NONE ! The only depressing part was that when I stepped outside the theater, I already started imagining the next #Nolan film and god, the feeling that I need to wait for another couple of years for his next film! #Sad #InNolanWeTrust."
"subxerogravity","8","3","11","21 July 2017"," My mistake. I did not like it as much as I thought cause I did not see it in IMAX
","So I made the mistake of not seeing this movie on an IMAX or a 70mm screen. The problem with that is that Chris Nolan set this film up for Imax so much that it did not fit any other screen properly and I could not get over the fact that the movie was not on the full screen and I'm now biased.<br/><br/>I'm gonna have to be convinced to see it again cause from what I saw I got nothing. I see other people who saw it in it's true experience and were talking about how visually amazing it was. I could see that, I did love the scenes with the dog fighters. I liked how the music combined with the visual to make for this intense feel. The motion of the picture was like one big War Scene, which seems cool.<br/><br/>Not much of a story overall. There was one fully developed subplot of a father who lost his son in the war who help out the boys of Dunkirk by lending his boat to the rescue. It was a real touching and dramatic story which also involved Cillian Murphy, but it's weird that the story does not take up that much of the movie because the other stories were not as fulfilling.<br/><br/>What I'm seeing here is that Nolan is pulling a Micheal Bay going for a more visual masterpiece without much story. I don't want to be too hard and judgmental without seeing it the way Nolan designed to be seen, but it does suck that the only way I can really enjoy the film is to see it in IMAX.<br/><br/>So see it in Imax I guess."
"dooooominic","10","3","11","21 July 2017"," Hope, is a dangerous weapon
","Christopher Nolan's latest film Dunkirk undoubtedly serves up to the audiences' expectation for another epic film under the Nolan name, following The Dark Knight (2008) and Interstellar (2014). Nolan accurately tells the story of Dunkirk during WWII without any hold backs. Intense, thrilling yet hopeful and optimistic, Nolan shows the side of humanity that is rarely shown in other action or war movies with the exception of Saving Private Ryan (1998), which may just be the closest comparison. <br/><br/>The cruelty of war, the fragility of lives are accurately shown with the 70mm IMAX camera; anything could happen, anyone could be dead. There are no superheroes such as superman to come and save the day. Stunning visuals with real airplanes and ships and little to none use of CGI place the audiences right in the center of the on-going war, or evacuation on the beach of Dunkirk. Nolan arranges this intense war thriller with three different aspects: land, air, and water. All of which are then are intercepted by one another in an almost linear time line. Nolan attempts another Memento (2000) time line but at some point in the film, it brought the audience confusion in a war film that could be better interpreted with a linear time line that is commonly used in a major action event which is also what the audiences are used to. <br/><br/>Several themes are explored in the film as mentioned above, and it shows how brilliant Nolan is that he is able to pull it off and place all of them within a single war thriller that is around two hours long (which makes it one of his shortest films). Nolan achieves his goal with Dunkirk and the movie itself should be viewed by anyone interested in a thrilling and intense war masterpiece: in the water, in the air, on the beach of Dunkirk."

"jennifercapp","10","2","6","16 June 2018"," I'm stunned people hated this film - but then -
","I watch just about every war movie and tele series I can, and Dunkirk is my favourite to date. It's totally brilliant and clever, but most of all, totally different to others in this genre, which I reckon is at the heart of why people hate it so passionately.<br/><br/>In a way, calling it a war film is a misnomer. This is not the stereotypical war flick, in any way. It's not about being in the blood and muck with everyone dying around you while you hang by a thread - if you want that, something like Black Hawk Down can't be beaten. It's not about individual failure or triumph - say Jarhead or the Hurt Locker - nor even about how 'the unit' works - that's what Band of Brothers or Generation Kill has well and truly covered. <br/><br/>It's really an evacuation movie - a movie about being trapped, and about time closing in on those poor bastards on that beach, the psychological experience of that.<br/><br/>Aside from it being a beautiful movie to look at, and exploring the psychological experience in a way I've not seen in a war movie before, the way time is handled in this film is to me the truly magic part. It's almost as though time is actually the main character of this film. It circles around and back around, creating and maximising that feeling that these guys are pawns, trapped, waiting, always waiting for what happens next, (just as those at Dunkirk must have waited,) not knowing if anything would happen before the enemy got onto that beach. It reminds me of the book Catch 22 by Joseph Heller, where the timeline circles around three times, escalating at each pass, the pressure only increasing. I admit I usually hate non chronological movies, with the proviso, unless it serves a purpose - and this movie is one of the very, very few that fit that proviso for me.<br/><br/>I admit that if you watch war movies for action, you're going to hate this film - but for a film that captures a psychological truth of this part of the war, this film stands brilliantly alone. I love it."

","As far as the technical aspects of the film go, the film is pretty solid, has lush visuals, looks and sounds amazing. However, in viewing a cohesive film that tells a story and entertains? Not really, as impressive as the film is visually, it did not resonate with me and bored me to tears. I did not care about a single character in this film and was a serious struggle to stay awake to the film's conclusion . The film is taken from the point of view of three, on land, sea and air and much like the characters in the film, I was sitting around and waiting for this to end. Durkirk is Christopher Nolan's WW2 war epic and as such is way too long, self indulgent and very low on action. The action that is in the film is all pyrotechnics and essentially a big special f/x circlejerk with forgettable characters and an incoherent story. Thumbs down on this one."

","After the trailers, the awards and the hype I was looking forward to watching this. How disappointed I was. I missed the chance of seeing this at the flicks, and how glad I am.<br/><br/>What should have been a portrayal of an amazing feat of collective bravery and stoicism failed dismally to convey the the sheer scale of this remarkable event. I hope no veterans watched it as I imagine they might feel betrayed or cheated of their real story.<br/><br/>We relied on Kenneth Branagh to tell us the scale, rather than any visual effects. Shame he was doing it with some container vessel cranes in the background and modern warehouses. Couldn't the director be bothered to find the right angle.<br/><br/>The number of vessels involved was pathetic. Some crappy CGI would have been better than the little regatta that was used in the film.<br/><br/>There was no real sense of peril created.<br/><br/>Imagine if Britain had not managed to recover so many troops from the BEF and other nations. Nazi invasion would have been a reality and any hope of the USA getting involved would have been pointless without fortress Britain. This event was so important it deserves to be portrayed properly. The producers and director should be ashamed. You failed. I feel for Kenneth Branagh having to narrate some of the key points the film failed to put across.<br/><br/>And well done Supermarine for inventing the perpetual motion device for the Spitfire that could zoom up and down the shoreline, win a dog fight and land in German territory. Shame the pilot had to burn the one and only example. Yes I'm being sarcastic!!<br/><br/>I think Monty Python's women's guild would have done a better reenactment."

","After reading some of the negative reviews on here I felt I had to balance it out somewhat. One of the criticisms was that it was boring, bland and that the characters had no depth. I didn't see that at all. What I saw was an incredibly tense series of scenes with an underlying musical score that was brilliant. <br/><br/> It was almost like watching a play, the scenes were short and dialogue kept sparse because the story just told itself. The story of Dunkirk. Some of the characters didn't have names because of this. The air scenes with Tom Hardy were beautifully shot, the beach scenes atmospheric and poignant. I love the fact that the men didn't have unnecessary dialogue, that there was just enough to convey the misery and the fact that they were all damaged from what they'd experienced. <br/><br/>I feel that some people are so used to blood , gore and massive explosions with 20 characters all running around at once, screaming and shouting that they just didn't get this film at all. That's fine, if you want to see that kind of thing but don't give negative reviews just because it wasn't exciting enough for you. <br/><br/>This film captures the emotional coldness of what it might be like to experience trauma. It also shows how some men couldn't face fighting anymore, that they werent loud ballsy heroes but quiet, scarred ones.<br/><br/> It's a shame that some people can't see the beauty of this film, that they are so jaded by Hollywood special effects and confusing overdone scenes but I for one loved it."

"WubsTheFadger","9","2","6","16 February 2018"," Dunkirk
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has delivered another stunning and emotional film. The story is powerful, emotional, and inspired. The story is expertly separated from past, current, and future experiences shared by a few characters. All the characters show various treats from cowardice, courage, honor, pride, and sacrifice. The story can be a little confusing to watch, but after a second viewing it clears things us.<br/><br/>The dialogue, or lack of dialogue, is amazing. The facial expressions and use of music to express tone, mood, and intentions are stunning.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Tom Hardy, Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance, and Cillian Murphy perform the best. Aneurin Bonnard, Barry Keoghan, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, and Harry Styles (surprisingly) also perform well. <br/><br/>The dogfight sequences are the best part of the film. The use of practical effects and the amount of extras is what makes the film seem real.<br/><br/>The amount of powerful and emotional moments are few, but they are extremely potent. The ending is sobering yet inspiring. It shows us that patriotism and sacrifice can lead to hope.<br/><br/>Pros: Powerful story, good dialogue, facial expressions and lack of dialogue are great, amazing acting, Tom Hardy's performance is stunning, dogfight sequences, practical effects and the staggering amount of extras, extremely potent emotional moments, and a great ending<br/><br/>Cons: The story can be hard to follow at some points and there is a scene about an hour and a half in (Tom Hardy is in a plane over the beach) that looks fake<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9.0"

"morganstephens512","9","2","6","21 August 2017"," An extremely suspenseful movie
","In fact, so much so on the suspense level that it remains in my opinion the best part of that entire movie. The entire time I was sitting in my seat thinking about what could possibly happen next. I had no idea that a war movie could have me nearly as much to my seat that it had been while I was sitting and watching Dunkirk. <br/><br/>The movie is told in three different stories. One at sea, one in the air and one on land. I remember that as I was watching the movie, pretty much the whole time I was wondering who the guy behind the mask when he was flying his plane going to be. There were two men in planes. Both of those reveals were able to pay off, but both paid off for different reasons. The one at the end of the movie paid off since it was just for a few seconds and it showed that he would rather die than let the Germans win the war. <br/><br/>One thing that I could not get myself to buy at all in this movie and this is the main reason I only give this a 9 and not a 10 is the kid who dies half way through the movie. All he did was just tag along with the ship master and his son and give a guy some tea and then he dies. All of a sudden he becomes a hero in peoples eyes. I know I may sound horrible when I say this, but I just can't get myself to buy this at all. <br/><br/>The acting was good overall, the soundtrack was great, the effects were decent but the story and suspense made up for that somewhat lacking category. And aside from that minor nitpick I have with that kid, I am overall very proud of this movie and think that it was something that people should see. I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it but when I did see it I decided that it was a movie that I was glad to see."
"realmuthaf","7","2","6","2 August 2017"," Chris Nolan's expensive WW2 playground
","Christopher Nolan is no original choice when it comes to picking favorite directors, and I'm no non-conformist in this sense, I liked very much every movie of his that I've watched so far. And while I can't say I dislike this either, I believe that Dunkirk is his inferior work.<br/><br/>From the technical standpoint, of course, everything is beautiful, with Warner Bros. basically letting Nolan make a small World War 2 of his own with real boats and planes and over a thousand extras. There's also an interesting gimmick with three timelines of different length being shown at the same time, as the events happening on the beach lasted a week, on the sea - a day, in the skies - an hour. It's still a gimmick, but a fairly interesting one, and if not for it, I'm afraid the movie would've been way too boring.<br/><br/>The problem is that Dunkirk failed to resonate with me in almost any way. I've read people say that the film is devoid of emotion, but I don't think it's exactly a problem here - an idea to make a war movie just about survival isn't a flawed one, we've had plenty of movies over-glorifying soldiers in the past. But still, my impression of the film was very superficial and started to immediately wither away even as I was walking out of the theater. The director obviously wanted to generate and hold suspense for the majority of the movie, but I thought that it didn't work, even though there were a few tense moments.<br/><br/>Two additional minor nitpicks are that the PG-13 rating shows more in a war film, especially after the recent Hacksaw Ridge, and that it looked pretty weird that there were only three Spitfires on the British side and a dozen of planes on the German side. As Wikipedia tells us, the airborne casualties of both sides were over a hundred planes each and while I get that Nolan couldn't get himself a whole working fleet of planes, their small number still looked off.<br/><br/>Another thing I've heard people praise is the soundtrack. Here Hans Zimmer thought that if he's a renowned composer unanimously praised by viewers and critics alike, he might as well just record a clock ticking and add some random drums to it and still get away with it. And alas! He succeeded. Waiting for him to record the sound of himself burping with drums and loud noises in the background and still being praised for the next movie.<br/><br/>So yeah, Dunkirk looks good and is loud, but that's about it, unfortunately. I would say that Mr. Nolan in general is not overrated, but this particular movie of his just might be."
"almanjit25","6","2","6","31 July 2017"," A Visually Sumptuous and Yet Sub-par Offering from a Master
","Dunkirk could be classified as a war movie, an action flick or a suspense thriller depending on who you ask. For me, it's a melange of the three. The tension is palpable, the visuals astounding and the historical details are for the most part accurate. Of course there are some liberties in the factual accuracy department that have been taken.<br/><br/>While gorgeous to behold and offering a score that steals the show so to speak, the emotional core is rather hollow. It's a snapshot of a military disaster, a wartime slice of life as it were, a realistic but impersonal depiction of a major event during WWII. We as the audience experience it as bystanders. You see this event as the people present would have but far removed. We don't know anything about these characters apart from their immediate circumstances. I know it wasn't the point but that is what left me underwhelmed. It was all about survival but without the individual insight. It's a generalized vision of what everyone saw and felt but it takes away the personal experiences. <br/><br/>The film is short, very short for a Nolan film and tries to weave multiple threads and timelines together. An event of this colossal nature cannot be summarized and this film feels like a summary. It's non- stop action and we don't get to experience the psychological turmoil and trauma, the emotional turbulence and deeper character interactions that would have naturally occurred. Sure there are some harrowing scenes of this nature but they are very few. The score is brilliant but manipulative and tricks you into feeling something that you wouldn't otherwise feel. There is no strong protagonist per se, we experience it through the eyes of everyone in the area. It's ambitious but emotionally distant. We zoom from land to sea to sky, the timeline is so squeezed that we don't feel the any of urgency the characters would have felt. Time is the vital factor, a sense of it's moving slowly and the panic that it elicits is absent even though the score features what is essentially a ticking clock. The visuals and cinematography take focus away from the human element. It would have worked much better as a character- driven miniseries in the vein of 'Band of Brothers' or 'The Pacific.'"
"ccorral419","8","2","6","28 July 2017"," Did our soldiers sacrifice for this?
","Director/Writer Christopher Nolan (""Batman"" and ""The Dark Knight"" series) is no stranger to big budget/loud productions, and for that reason he should know that actors need to mic'd correctly in order to understand their dialogue. However, in ""Dunkirk,"" at least three-quarters of the films dialogue is in audible due to the period accents of it's actors and the continuous gun battles, overhead plane attacks, sinking and colliding ships, rough sea sounds and more. Does this ruin the film or storyline, not really, but it surly doesn't help. ""Dunkirk,"" if anything, is a visual film that takes the audience on a journey of survival as its young Belgium, British Empire and French soldiers find themselves evacuated on the ocean front (Dunkirk, France) as the German's attack from land, sea and sky and they await their rescue. The film is filled with a variety of familiar names (Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Harry Styles, relative new comer Fionn Whitehead), along with a whole slue of handsome young men, all who do a great job dodging bullets, leaping from sinking ships, evacuating from downed planes and swimming for their lives. However, throughout the film I kept finding myself fighting my own battle to understand the dialogue. Tragic as the films story was, at the end of the film I couldn't help feel sorry for the soldiers (deceased and survived) knowing that they experienced such trauma to today be represented by a self-center administration as we find ourselves involved with. While the acting is good, special effects terrific, cinematography outstanding and the score is haunting, ""Dunkirk"" is not the film so many are making it out to be. The disappointment here lies in the hands of the director and sound department."

","Memento is in my opinion the best directed film of all time. Prestige I love. Interstellar, Inception, Dark Knights all very good movies. <br/><br/>So Dankirk. Let's take that patch right of and say: ""Dankirk lacks deep characters and emotions. Dankirk also lacks interesting dialog (or even dialog all together). <br/><br/>On a technical perspective this movie is perfect. The musical score is 10/10 The camera work is 10/10 The acting is very good, but the actors really don't get an opportunity to shine. <br/><br/>Nolan managed to make spectacle scenes without Hollywood bs. The movie is tense and the tension doesn't feel forced, like in most modern Hollywood movies. <br/><br/>Definitely the movie is something different, especial for Nolan. I would say this is his take on a more minimalist approach to characters, which helps the tension and the technical aspect of the move, shine even more. <br/><br/>Nolan recently said he would never do superhero movies again, he obviously wants too try himself in different genres and ways of filming, and I can only salute that. Even though that means I will not get another Memento or Prestige so soon."

Various players activities, that are blended together, in a story which, through some fine editing, each show us a portion of the overall tale, about how a massive military contingency are rescued, despite a significant threat from enemy aircraft and submarines. We are shown, rather than specifically told in dialogue, and the message is clear, that in perilous times, we can all pull together. I'm thankful, that I was able to view it in the largest format possible and feel that my money was well spent to see another great work, by a great producer of cinema. In a day or so, I may watch this movie once more, although in a smaller format, so as to compare the experience and to pick up on details which I'm sure I may have missed."
"theseanbastow","7","2","6","21 July 2017"," Dunkirk is the truest war film in years, but is it really Nolan's best?
","I have just seen Dunkirk and I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. This is not your usual big-budget war flick filled with gore and lame back stories. It hits the one aspect of war most fail to show us - genuine terror. Throughout the film we do not see a single Nazi soldier, nor do we hear a single German word; what we see, hear and feel are the bombs, the bullets and the horrifying sound of the Messerschmidts, just a few seconds after catching our breath.<br/><br/>The characters discuss nothing but the events of the moment, they say nothing of their family, their jobs back home or their plans when they get back. Nothing matters but surviving the next German onslaught. The constant time jumps and regular Nazi attacks keep us disorientated from beginning to end and we have very little time to think.<br/><br/>As a war film, it is the best in a long time, and it is the most honest in Western cinema. I left feeling as though I had just witnessed the actual events with my own eyes, rather than a film based on true events. This is owed to Nolan's desire to remain true to the facts, which is the underlying theme through all of his movies.<br/><br/>However, I must disagree with many reviewers who say this is Nolan's best film yet; it is purely down to my own tastes but I already feel as though I would not still be thinking about it in a few weeks, unlike Interstellar or Inception. Dunkirk's biggest flaw as a movie is, ironically, its biggest strength as a war film - it lacks humanity. The truth is, I cared about the characters only because they felt like real soldiers losing their lives, not because I felt any emotional attachment to them. I've given it a 7 because, while it is the best war film in years (not a difficult feat), it is not one of the best films, nor is it Nolan's best. <br/><br/>And for those of you who are wondering, I did not even notice Harry Styles. And the lack of American soldiers coming to save the day will prevent it winning any big Oscars. BAFTA's yes, but not Oscars."
"pc95","8","2","6","21 July 2017"," Visually Stirring with Nolan Panache
","(spoilers) Reminding us of his labyrinthine layering more from Inception in story-telling, Director Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" tackles a sub- story from WWII, and well succeeds. The movie is competent, and a bit muted in dialog which seems fairly commonplace in the War genre. The music though and score has undertones of Chariots of Fire all over it, as does the feel of this recent reported labor of love. Occasionally the music overstayed its welcome but other than that the movie was quite good. Mark Rylance may be up for an Oscar with his work here, Supporting or Lead. His performance stands out as sort a throwback of your parent, grand or great grand-parent of the era. It's great storytelling with a look on the chaotic nature of War and Survival without relying too much on violence. Recommended and 8/10."

Rather than the usual eulogies of military and civilian unity against foreign enemies, he reveals the true relationship between war and everyone through three perspectives, one hour, one day and one week, in a panoramic interweaving of sea, land and air. It not only makes you see the history, but also brings you back to the beach of despair and death, and takes you through Dunkirk all over again."

","I mean... what a movie. This is the best war movie I've ever seen in my life, but more than a war movie, it's a survival movie.<br/><br/>I will always love Nolan and he will always be my favourite director and writer, everything he writes and does is so unique and incomparable that you are always left with the desire to see more. In this film I didn't know what to expect from him as it was his first realistic film about war but it turned out to be the best I've seen of war in recent times.<br/><br/>The Dunkirk evacuation, code-named Operation Dynamo, also known as the Miracle of Dunkirk, was the evacuation of Allied soldiers during World War II from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk, in the north of France, between 26 May and 4 June 1940. The operation commenced after large numbers of Belgian, British, and French troops were cut off and surrounded by German troops during the six-week long Battle of France.<br/><br/>This film is seen from different perspectives and you can see how war can be seen from those perspectives. There are the Fortis (flying), the ones who are going to rescue the soldiers and the people who fight on the beach. All people experience war differently and that's what I like about Nolan in this film, it shows us what each person feels and lives that you even feel like you're there.<br/><br/>This film is very claustrophobic (at least for me) and the score of this film is incredible. Hans Zimmer shows us again because he is one of the best composers today. Cinematography is the best and so are visual effects.<br/><br/>The cast is impressive and at the same time varied, as Nolan wanted to make this film with young actors and not very specialized. This is the fifth time that Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan have worked together and at the same time the third time with Hardy.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy is always a win.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I recommend this film to all those who like films about war and Nolan's work. I hope the best of Nolan for TENET that I feel is going to be shocking."

And when there is, it's often interrupted by the enemy attacking. One critique I hear a lot from people is that there's no characters. I argue that this film takes into account that these are just individuals a part of a bigger picture. A battle involving multiple people. This film depicts a historical event in small bits to paint a big picture. There may not be character development, but that's because things are happening so quickly. There isn't much time for the characters to sit down and get to know each other. War is fast paced and intense and barely gives room to breathe.

Every second that goes by the film gets more and more tense as the 400000 brits are anxiously trying to escape the german advance. The movie's lack of dialogue also contributes to this feeling of tension. Nothing is really said about the kids on the beach, or the background becuase we know already. We know these kids have families, we know they could die at any sencond.
The effects are almost all practical and they look incredible. It almost seems unreal becuase of some of the things they did (i wont say in case you havent seen it).
The music is so well done and extremely well implemented. It really delivers a feeling of anxiety and tension as the movie goes on.
The only problem I really had with the film was the aspect ratio changing. Chris Nolan always uses Imax cameras for wide shots and normal cameras for normal shots and the aspect ratio is constantly changing, but it's not too distracting.
This movie really only works on a big screen with loud speakers however. Rewatching it on my 36"" tv really took away from the experience but it's still fantastic."

","Dunkirk is a very polarizing film. It is littered with amazing visuals, outstanding acting, and sound effects and music that have absolutely no right to be as good as they are. But as a film, the story and characters could use a lot of work. But Dunkirk is more than just a film, it is a war film. The lack of character development reflects the fact that Dunkirk is not about characters influencing an event, it is simply about the event. The characters must survive the events that play out, yes, but they aren't developed and we barely know their names. Nevertheless, Dunkirk is terrific at portraying the view of the British Army's side of those events, from the point of view of the civilians rescuing the British soldiers from France, the pilots high in the sky trying to help those trapped on the beach, or the people on land who will do anything to survive. The timeline is warped, and it creates a lack of story continuity. We, as the audience, simply watch events play out until the climax (the oil scene). But even without compelling characters or an overall story flow, Dunkirk is a thrilling and intense ride all the way through, and it deserves a watch.<br/><br/>Special Effects: The planes and boats were real, as was the environment they flew around in. The sound was amazing, and it not only immersed you in the film, but it also created a feel to the film that nothing else has come close to.
19/20<br/><br/>Story: The story is inconsistent and often overlaps from different perspectives, but the urgency of it is clear: The British troops must escape France before ""the enemy"" finds them.
16/20<br/><br/>Characters: The characters are nearly nonexistent. There is barely any dialogue, (and that does serve a plot point) but the movie is more focused on the event; the history; then it is on the characters.
16/20<br/><br/>Soundtrack: This film's soundtrack is golden. Tense, yet beautiful at times, it displays how music is done right.
20/20<br/><br/>Acting: The acting is also amazing. Cillian Murphy as the ""Shivering Soldier"" was the best actor in the film, because even though he had almost no dialogue, he did amazing. Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy were fantastic as well.

","It's my first review of a movie, I read some of the negative ones and felt like giving mine.
I like Nolan movies, so I am biased, but this one certainly suffered from the War Movie label, like Ron Howard's Rush isn't so much a Formula One movie than a great battle of two exceptional human beings.
At so many moments of the 3 stories I was wondering what I would do, in that situation.
Tension is constant, the soundtrack is loud like in Interstellar, but that's one trick for a 21st century movie to create emotions. I dare comparing this editing to Hitchcock's Psycho or The Birds.
This movie depicts one crucial week in the interconnected lives of 400.000+ humans caught in the worst state of our civilisation."
"JakeBrinkman","4","1","2","31 December 2018"," An emotionless war movie with very little war
","2 and a half hours of tension with no breaks makes a tedious film. I'm surprised that all of the people remain largely emotionless during nearly every scene. There is no humor, no sadness, no hope, and surprisingly not even fear. This may be the first time Nolan has disappointed me, as it appears that he spent significantly more focus on the direction than on the script.<br/><br/>With all of that said, it is a supposedly accurate representation of the real event, and it is always beneficial to learn more about past wars."
"olivercase-83355","10","1","2","30 October 2018"," Yet another Nolan wonder
","Dunkirk was a very well crafted and very well filmed movie. The lack of independent characters made it very unique and allowed there to be a bigger picture of the Dunkirk rescue as a whole. It juggles many situations amazingly. The separation between land, air and sea was genius and how they came together at the end didn't feel forced. This film also deserves credit for not using CGI anywhere because the film is 100% practical effects (as in Nolan's style). The only complaint is that Nolan's refusal to use CGI made the movie less historically accurate, but that doesn't really affect the film itself. It is truly an amazing war story."

"jamesrupert2014","10","1","2","11 October 2018"," Outstanding war drama
","Director/writer Christopher Nolan employs three perspectives in three different time frames to tell the story of the evacuation of the British Expeditionary forces (and others) from the beaches of Dunkirk in 1940. The week long 'land story' follows two young soldiers who are desperately looking for a ship to take them off the beach while the day long 'sea story' focusses on one of the 'little ships' of Operation Dynamo, the requisition and mobilisation of civilian ships to help evacuate the soldiers, as it crosses the channel and the hour long 'air story', showcases a squadron of three RAF Spitfires providing air support as they face off against Luftwaffe fighters and bombers. The structure of the film is complex as the three stories are intertwined and told concurrently despite the differences in time frames (I found the film a little hard to follow at first). Each tale in the triptych is excellently told, with a compelling narrative, great script and acting and outstanding special effects. While far less graphic and bloody than ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), the scenes on the beaches are equally intense and the recreation of WWII air combat are the best that I have ever seen. Nolan's cleverly keeps the Germans a largely hidden existential threat and limits the action to the British ports, the Channel, and the Dunkirk beaches, avoiding the politics and strategic discussions that lead up to the Dunkirk disaster/miracle (recently depicted in ""The Darkest Hour"" 2017). All in all, a fantastic war movie and proof that Hollywood does not have to ""Americanise' history to make a compelling historical film"

","Christopher Nolan is, without a doubt, one of the most talented directors going around. So where is he here? Nolan's movies are typically trim, taut, tense, somewhat complex, and totally terrific. Unfortunately, Dunkirk meanders through its 107min and doesn't come close to telling a story that is in the least bit engaging.<br/><br/>The film completely lacks the gritty realism of Band of Brothers, can't hold a candle to the feelgood inspiration of the 1958 film, and makes no real attempt at providing historical insight. That leaves us with a pretty pedestrian WWII flick that doesn't do much at all that is Nolan-style out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>For a man who has made a somewhat spectacular career out of obsession and puzzles, the only puzzle here is where is the genius?"

The plot was poorly constructed, the characters didn't exist and the tension build-up, the thrill wasn't there. The entire movie was a collection of random action sequences, useless Jump scares with cheap sound tricks. The characters were for the most part ""mute"", guns and the spitfires spoke for the most part therefore we can't empathize with the characters. I failed to realize there actually was a situation and a win-condition. One has to be imprisoned first in order to be rescued meanwhile the two soldiers did everything to get their hands on knowing they are taking someone else's spot instead of just following the orders. But they can't be blamed, them along with 400,000 soldiers were assisted by 4 Military ships, 3 Spitfires and around 30 civilian boats.

","When you think of some of the greatest war films in history, there are a few that come to mind. From 'Saving Private Ryan' to 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket,' there are a few that have made a huge impact on society and are considered to be some of the greatest cinema made.<br/><br/>Enter 'Dunkirk.' Christopher Nolan's extravagant take on the evacuation of allied forces from a French beach town during WWII as the German forces descended on them. Central to the events was the fact that British civilians were called on to man their own vessels so that they could make the trip across the English Channel and lend a hand in the evacuation, as the German air force complicated the rescue mission from above.<br/><br/>The main reason 'Dunkirk' works so well is it feels ""real."" Nolan is a master of letting elements unfold on screen without the need to add unnecessary dialogue. The use of sound and wide shots of the open water and beach give the audience an immersive experience, which explains the three Oscar wins for sound editing, mixing and film editing and multiple other nominations. There are enough moments throughout the film to get your heart racing that are truly genuine.<br/><br/>Other achievements by Nolan in the film include the ability to develop many characters in such a short runtime. The audience gets to know Mr. Dawson and his son Peter (Mark Rylance and Tom Glynn-Carney), who heroically race to save soldiers on their personal boat, as well as British soldier Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) and fighter pilots Farrier and Collins (Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden) whose heroics collectively make a difference in the effort.<br/><br/>'Dunkirk' will likely be remembered as one of the better efforts in this genre for years to come, and a large part of this is Nolan's application of film techniques that have worked for many of his previous projects."

","There's only so much mileage one can get out of half a dozen aircraft filmed from all different angles but repeating the same stuff over and over again. If those precious relics weren't capable of safely doing their stuff then I can't think of a better justification for special effects.
Indeed I find myself in full agreement with others who lament how this film totally failed to do justice to the magnificent scale of the achievement of withdrawing well over 300,000 troops from that beach in a matter of days, while under fire. This wasn't DUNKIRK, it was personal glimpses of Dunkirk by some of the people who participated in the evacuation.
My suggestion would be to recut the film to show the intimacy of the different situations portrayed and reissue it under the title ""Personal Stories From The Dunkirk Evacuation"". Then it might be more appreciated and avoid the deserved backlash over the very false banner it was released under."

The film chronicles their evacuation and the tense moments while waiting on the beach and the mole (a large dock). The film follows a few storylines. One is the perspective of British pilots, men waiting at the beach and the many civilian vessels sent to rescue the troops as large battleships were needed elsewhere. For me the main character was the Zimmer music score as it kept a mesmerizing atmosphere of the tension. While this was the opposite of Saving Private Ryan, as there was no true hero character, the visuals felt similar with saturated and muted color tones. The editing provided smooth transitions from scene to scene which helped hold the tense atmosphere. This was a solid war film yet there were a couple egregious continuity fouls such as one fighter plane that was able to glide around without fuel for a literally unbelievable amount of time while shooting down another enemy fighter to boot! As well as a couple questionable character decisions. Enjoyable nonetheless."

We see all of these soldiers with their rifles waiting in line on the beach without any hint why they're such a bunch of cowardly wrecks.<br/><br/>Sure, history has an explanation, but nothing that the neophyte can see here. The point is futhermore un-credible when the ""dangers"" seem pretty mundane, like those bombers dropping something more akin to grenades that bombs.

","After watching 'Darkest Hour' where Operation Dynamo was conceived, comes 'Dunkirk' where it was implemented: civilian boats were called by the Royal Navy to assist in the evacuation of the more than 400,000 British, French and Belgian soldiers trapped at the beaches of Dunkirk, France.<br/><br/>The movie shows three perspectives of the evacuation: Land, you can see hundreds of soldiers lining up at the beach waiting to be rescued; Air, three British Air Force fighter planes are trying to ward off German planes from going after the evacuating fleet; Sea, where the ships and boats try to outmaneuver the German planes while keeping itself afloat even if at overcapacity.<br/><br/>After watching this movie, I sort of felt empty as I struggle to empathize with any of the movie's characters. This is a war movie after all and as Hollywood is wont to do, they pick a main character and show his struggles and eventual victory (Hacksaw Ridge, Hurt Locker, American Sniper, etc.) but Christopher Nolan went with a different direction, focusing on the soldiers' chances of survival as the carrier of the film (and getting his first Best Director nomination in the process.) The cinematography is worth mentioning as well, especially the aerial shots of the ocean from the perspective of the pilots, most notably Tom Hardy who I believe could've made this movie a million times better if only they found a way to make him fly a plane without his mask on.<br/><br/>Favorite quote:

"guaposenorbutler","9","1","2","4 February 2018"," Gotta Watch This One More Than Once
","I remember the first time I watched this movie. It was confusing, played very loudly in the theater and I could barely remember the characters after the credits rolled. I did enjoy the scenes with the spitfires, including the second to last shot of Hardy in front of his burning plane. So overall I was pleased with the aesthetic of the movie but I was not interested in the narrative and I felt there was a void where I wanted there to be connection to the characters. Those were my original thoughts on the movie.
And then I watched it again on Blu-Ray.
Completely different experience watching Dunkirk for the second time. What was confusing upon my first viewing materialized into a harmonious narrative. The way Nolan weaves the three different timelines in the movie can be confusing on your first viewing and I don't think I figured out what was going on until halfway through the movie. Upon the second viewing I already knew what was going on and I was able to make a lot more sense out of the structure and I have decided it is absolutely genius. The way that the three narratives cross each others paths is so seamless. The way that music swelled and ebbed was epic. Not only was I mind-blown by the editing of the film but the second viewing revealed the connection to the characters that I had missed the first time. 
There is no hero in this movie. There are many heroes and several people who make mistakes under the pressure. Because you don't follow the progression of just one character, the importance of the sacrifices and decisions made by each character are multiplied. By viewing this a second time I found it easier to follow the pathways of each character and reflect on their character arcs. The genius of this film lies in its ability to tell many stories at once.. If you watch this film and pay attention to a single character and watch their every move, you will see what I am talking about. Every character had an equal part in telling the story (not the extras obviously). 
This approach to telling a war story is entirely unique as far as I know and it genuinely made me feel as though I had just witnessed the evacuation of Dunkirk from a birds eye point of view. The movie gives you a mixed bag of emotions because some of the sacrifices made by the characters are hard to wrap your head around. Usually in a war movie every character dies in a cinematic way fighting evil until their last breath but in Dunkirk, sometimes characters die in a way no one would be proud of. I think this is a more realistic view on the story than I have come to expect from this genre and it is very thought provoking. The side of war that is often left out of war movies is the indecisive nature of it. No one in this movie had ""plot armor"" and Nolan used that uncertainty to give me an authentic experience. 
To anyone disappointed upon their first viewing, watch it again and pay attention. 
To anyone who has not seen this movie, watch it two times."

"batman50","6","1","2","3 February 2018"," A big disappointment
","I wasn't alive when Dunkirk happened so it is difficult to assess the realism of the events depicted in this film even if it would be better called ""Dunkirk - an impression"". Clearly there was no real story line beyond the fact of the evacuation but it was unclear why the 1 hour flight, the 1 day boat and the 1 week on the beach needed to be highlighted since, by then interweaving the separate dramas and adopting almost dream sequences by the end, any difference was unimportant. 
I am sure people behaved stupidly, badly and irrationally as well as heroically but seeing navy ships moored in the middle of the channel and then being bombed seemed beyond ridiculous. And, given the efforts to create realism, putting the rescued soldiers in 1960s British Railway coaches really jarred. 
As for the ""music""! I am a great admirer of Hans Zimmer but with the planes, the boats and the sea, it really didn't need the pounding, ear-splitting noises that he created to accompany sinking boats and bombed soldiers. The only bit I liked was the brief quote from ""Nimrod"" at the end while the Spitfire was on its magic glide.
I understood the film was episodic and had many changes of time and I could follow those, but it never seemed to catch the overall reality of this awesome event. I was really hoping for more, much more."

"rdavall","5","1","2","30 January 2018"," Well-crafted but ultimately feels empty
","'Dunkirk' is an unusual animal indeed. It's not your typical 'film' in that it not only lacks, but outright rejects the concept of following a traditional narrative structure in place of aiming more for the sensation of an 'experience'. In other words, it's not trying to be a 'film' in a sense. But it also is, and that's the problem.<br/><br/>Several reviews on this website have implied confusion as to why critics praised this film to such an extent. To be completely fair, I can see both sides of the argument. On one hand, the critics clearly have a point: the film is well-crafted. The shots of the ocean are crisp, beautiful and sometimes moving and the camera angles are often surprisingly well-fitted to the atmosphere of a specific 'scene'. True, the shots during the pilot subplot are repetitive (which leads to the sequence itself feeling stale as a result), but this was intentional (although this does not excuse the staleness in itself).<br/><br/>However, whether the critics like it or not, 'Dunkirk' is a heavily flawed product as well in that it's stuck in an awful valley of confusion. Nolan, in his 'film', clearly wants to break from the well-worn format of the sentimental, character-driven war film and focus more on the conflict and experience of Dunkirk. This would be an admirable idea if not for three major factors:<br/><br/><ul><li>'Dunkirk''s main desire seems to be to emulate a reel/recording of the real-life event above telling a more familiar narrative, but simultaneously the 'film' feels the need to focus on the POVs of three soldiers in particular within the conflict. And in this decision, Nolan basically shot himself in the foot. If you want to create an account of Dunkirk but also want to include characters for the audience to focus on so you can convey the horror/emotional impact of war, go for one or the other instead of smashing together two contrastingly operational ideas to create a weird limbo where the scale and flow of the account is lost through the character POVs but the characters are too underdeveloped and flimsy due to the opposite creative obligation for the audience to legitimately care about what happens to them, leading to the 'film' itself dragging into oblivion because there is nothing the audience can relate to.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Related to the above, but the scale of the actual Dunkirk event feels heavily cut down (where did the 150 million USD budget go exactly, into filming more homogenous scenes of ships sinking?). There are less than 1,000 soldiers on the beach itself (a 300th of the actual total) and never once is the audience given an idea of the grandiose scale of the real-life Dunkirk. Again, the film wants to be experimental, but is also too fearful to go all the necessary way, so it kneecaps itself and destroys both its potential directions by rolling with them both.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Nolan is an ambitious and creative director, but at times his ideas seem to lack the necessary discipline to make 'Dunkirk' work as a film. It's the George Lucas problem again (to a lesser extent). Lucas wanted to explain the past of Star Wars, but instead belched out the prequels, which were ambitious but a victim of Lucas prioritizing the stuff he wanted to include over what he needed to include, leading to the prequels being historical records with no central plot or characters. I'm not saying directors can't be ambitious, but it's necessary sometimes to control your artistic vision to create a good, watchable film. And it applies here. I understand the real-life Dunkirk may have included similar events, but did we honestly need so many near-identical scenes of boats sinking? Did the pilot scenes need so many homogenous shots? Why is the soundtrack fundamentally a collection of random sound effects? Again, these were both done for a reason, but explanation is not justification. They display Nolan has ambition, but don't improve or enhance the 'film' in itself.</li></ul><br/><br/>Essentially, I can agree with both sides of the argument - 'Dunkirk' is an example of 'safe experimentation', the kind of film with an impressive exterior and concept that is enough to bolster the egos of the crew and audiences watching but not quite experimental enough to actually challenge either. We need more of the latter category, and 'Dunkirk' would have heavily benefitted from entering this category had Nolan been willing to go all the way. As it stands, we're stuck with an overlong empty montage of beautiful camerawork, interesting concepts and hollow execution."

The call goes out to all civilian boats: bring our boys home.<br/><br/>Dunkirk, in my words: Propaganda leaflets are dropped from the sky by the Nazi Luftwaffe. A British soldier picks up a few, with the intention of using them as toilet paper. The notice reads, ""We have you surrounded"", then the bullets fly. So begins Christopher Nolan's latest film about the ""colossal military disaster"" that became an inspiration to an already frightened population less than one year into WWII. The soldiers are ordered to retreat to the coast and await their ride home. Thousands of men standing-by on a beach in Dunkirk, France. They can nearly see home - across the English Channel - from where they are positioned, out in the open, ""like fish in a barrel"" for the circling enemy planes. The Germans are closing in fast on their position. There is no fleet of battleships and frigates on the way to evacuate them, only a flotilla of patriotic civilians with their fishing boats and pleasure crafts; unarmed but fearless.<br/><br/>Things you'll LIKE about Dunkirk: 1) It is awesome. When it starts, it doesn't stop until the credits role. The story moves very quickly and is seamless. The music is suspenseful, building, and intense and works to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the 106-minute running time. The aerial photography is nothing short of spectacular as it closely captures RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) during his mission. 2) There is very little spoken dialogue but there's a lot of action and the story is shown from three key perspectives. The script I read had 23 pages of dialogue. 2,940 spoken words to be exact (I counted them myself). The entire script has 15,325 words in total, including described action scenes and screen direction. It works, and it works well.<br/><br/>Things you'll DISLIKE about Dunkirk: 1) This easily could have been a longer film, but it's not. As it is now, it's one of the shorter Christopher Nolan efforts at 106 minutes. Following (1998) is 69 minutes, Memento (2000) is 113 minutes. Dunkirk could have added another 15 minutes to the running time without changing the flow. 2) Guys, you may not like the One Direction dude (Harry Styles plays Alex) in this. However, you can take solace in knowing that he can act!"

","Does it live up to the hype? Christopher Nolan directs and also writes this historical drama that chronicles the struggle to evacuate the more than 300,000 trapped Allied soldiers on the beaches of Northern France. Air, land and sea action during the tension filled 1940 invasion of Nazi forces. Solid storytelling matched superbly by Hans Zimmer's musical score; a flawless match with war sounds and bravery. <br/><br/>Some critics claim this movie falls short compared to Nolan's other great movies.
See it for yourself. DUNKIRK is what it is. My favorite sequences are the mass arrival of small British vessels and the flier Collins' selfless landing of his plane.<br/><br/>A very apt cast features: Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance, Jack Lowden, Tom Hardy, Barry Keoghan, Tom Glynn-Carney, Cillian Murphy, James D'Arcy and Kenneth Branagh"

","I don't like war movies. <br/><br/>It's just too easy to dive into the drama and make a profit from has been the most horrible fail at being human, being a society, living with each other. 
So yeah, it's a moral problem, making a ridiculous amount of bucks from something that is NOT a memory duty but a smooth, agreable trip with some conventional obstacles. <br/><br/>That being said...I loved this movie. I just had no choice. 
Cinematography is outstanding, the use of wide lenses is justified by the number of soldiers filling the screens and the landscape of Dunkirk. <br/><br/>Great acting, too, but what I liked the most is the quality of editing. They are several stories merged into the Dunkirk drama, slowly enough to build suspense, quickly enough to not get confusing.<br/><br/>Why would you try to reload when you get fired at by a machine gun though. (beginning sequence)<br/><br/>10/10 would pay and watch the nonsensical moral behavior of watching a soft reconstruction of what has been hell.

","I watched this movie because of the history and the director.
I found it difficult to watch and confusing. The editing seemed all over the place.
All the actors had american accents. The pace seemed like no one was in a hurry to leave or just waiting for the tram . <br/><br/>From what i read in history there were hundreds of merchant boats and british family owned boats and dingies all who sacrificed their lives to bring their country men off the continent. the beginning of the movie should have been like saving private ryan in reverse. Acts of desperation and fear. the horror of the loss of young life and the bravery young men and civilians trying move off the beach. A dozen aircraft at the most. Six lines of men, maybe 2000.
I never felt any of this, a single boat sailing calmly over the channel. There was no visual or emotional indication of the scope of this event. <br/><br/>Compared with all the WWII war and antiwar movies, this one falls short way short.
I wanted to see if the critics were watching the same movie, coming here the audience have seems to have.<br/><br/>Das Boot, Letters from iwo jima both films to me show what war does and how is brings all sorts of emotions that are really difficult to describe. This was the greatest generation regardless which side the soldiers are on. It's just unfortunate, so many had to die."

","Don't assume I dislike this movie because I'm not a fan of the artform of movies. This is a... beautiful movie. And I don't mean to reduce the fact that it's a true and tragic story, but it was boring as hell the way Nolan told it. I can see I am a minority in this, but come on, really? This movie has no characters and barely any plot. The only drive is getting people off a beach. Why? They have 400k healthy troops just standing around while their being bombed and, supposedly, their perimeter is shrinking. You say I should read up on this battle before watching a movie? That's like reading a book to read another book, it doesn't make sense and it's just bad storytelling. Very pretentious movie, and what a cheesy line from Kenneth Branagh when he sees the civilian ships. Ugh.<br/><br/>I am a fan of both war-movies and Nolan's other work, but what am I supposed to be feeling here? The ""war is hell"" message have already been established in plenty of better movies. I guess if you're a history fan or from Great Britain you might enjoy this, but if I wanted to learn about this battle I would've watched a documentary. Alas I wanted to be entertained, not educated.<br/><br/>Also, in WW2 bomber planes had a 4% chance of a bomb landing in a 2000 meter radius of their target! But boats in this movie are apparantly easier to sink than in the boardgame. Maybe WW1 had better bombers, or maybe it's just a bad film.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy didn't disappoint. I think he pulled off writing chalk on his dashboard just fine."
"rcamp3142","1","1","2","21 January 2018"," UGH!
","I like movies that are accurate and true to the facts, this movie has failed miserably. It only focused on a few characters which may have been somewhat accurate but the movie did not portray the magnitude and decisions made at and about Dunkirk. Over 330,000 troops evacuated but the movie only made it seem like a thousand. There was no focus on German decisions, British decisions and little on the overall loss of life and equipment. Even the magnitude of the evacuation was not captured, the attempt to do so was pitiful. The sound track was loud and obnoxious with little relevancy to the movie. This one was a real STINKER and a major disappointment."

","The way this film was hyped you'd think it was on par with ""Patton"" or ""The Longest Day"" in terms of it's epic quality. It was absolutely neither epic, nor even remotely redeeming. It's content is truly paper thin. There is really no concrete story line, other than a couple of blokes who keep trying to get off Dunkirk beach, and keep getting tossed back, only to keep trying. Ok, good for persistence. There was absolutely ZERO character development, not a shred of background as to how the Brits got themselves stuck there, nor any of the drama of the Brit home front to rescue these men. Everything was very ho-hum, like it was completely pre-determined. The film showed nothing of the actual ferocity of the Dunkirk area on both the Brit and German sides. The Germans were relentless in their air attacks, as were the Brits in their defense. The film has the odd German bomber or fighter winging over, and it appeared that only 3-5 Brit Spitfires covered the whole air umbrella. This movie isn't worth seeing in a theater, nor renting on DVD."

","Technically perfect ""Dunkirk"" is a lesson of cinema. Using a wide variety of filming techniques, good editing to assemble the three different sequences of events into a timeline, accurate sound editing/mixing that becomes terrifying (the element of silence is also very well utilized here) and a thunderous original score by Hans Zimmer.
The drama is accommodated into the situation as there is a lack of emotion transcending from the script to the acting. There's not much character development as the whole movie seems to be concluding something. Overall, it's a good story presented so amazingly, that, the visual outshines the substance."

"williegannon","10","1","2","14 January 2018"," Masterpiece with Almost Unbearable Tension
","Dunkirk is masterpiece. It's rare that a film can be almost unbearable to watch because of the tension involved, but Christopher Nolan achieves this dramatically. The tension ratchets up and up right from the very first moment and raises with relentless gravity.
The acting is top-notch, direction spectacular and the story-line, simple as it is, grips and never lets go."
"nickwoodhouse","10","1","2","14 January 2018"," Only Nolan Can Make An Evacuation Movie
","What a cast! Wait why aren't they speaking?. Why this movie stands out from any other ordinary war film is the lack of dialogue. In reality, war isn't some place where characters can sit around the campfire and talk about back home, NO, this is actual war. Nolan's idea for Dunkirk was to not let you get connected to any single character, or not to have one stick out more than any other. This is because in reality everyone is treated as equals when it comes to war, its all a united military. Dunkirk will receive absolutely zero nominations for acting but thats the point. Theres no Academy Award winning scenes when it comes to war, its about your survival, and helping the man next to you. <br/><br/>You simply couldn't script a better ending for this film as it dives into your thoughts and keeps you still in your seats. This is one of the movies that Nolan's career has led up to, not a another Science Fiction classic, but a non-fictional piece. This is one of the all time greatest war films, and Nolan should finally get his long-awaited Oscar."
"steveo122","9","1","2","12 January 2018"," Very well done, respectful and somber
","As have many of us, I've been watching war movies since the '50s.
This is technically, the finest war movie I've seen (save for one tiny little cgi moment, but I'd have to be desperate to pick nits to mention it).
I was mesmerized for most of it. I liked the 'episodic' structure and the seemingly 'scattered' character stories. (Had Cameron done the same thing for ""Titanic"", it would have been a successful movie).
I had no trouble empathizing with the characters so I don't agree with review charges of coldness from Nolan.
But it is not about the characters. It is about an event. A huge event.
So huge that even after all that, as the film was wrapping up, I thought ""Wait...that's it?""
I could have spent another hour hunting with the Spitfires.
I didn't catch on to Nolan's manipulation of time until later in the film.
Best of all, there was no gratuitousness in the presentation of the harrowing events.
Very well done, respectful and somber with an excellent, excellent soundtrack.
I think it's a worthy tribute and I had no complaints near the end, when patriotic pride rears its deserved head."

","First off, unlike some others, I knew the true story. That took most of the suspense out. Kinda like watching ""Day of the Jackal,"" you know DeGaulle lives. And the film didn't do a good job at all of detailing the stakes and the effort involved in the operation. Just a very few shots at the end of the flotilla of English small boats. And no Germans? No dramatization of the crucial decison-making on their part that altered the course of WWII (like the Japanese choosing between bombs and torpedoes at Midway). <br/><br/>The characters were unlikeable, undeveloped, and in the case of the Spitfire pilots, masked. Two that you are supposed to identify with even try to cut the line getting out. All very sterile. Including the soundtrack - meant to give tension, I suppose, but another droning, boring aspect of this film. Even the civilians were robots. The bleak seascape and the weather I get, but all in all a dull, boring film in almost every respect. Even the scene where one of the rescue ships was sunk had very little humanity in it."

"LloydBayer","9","1","2","10 January 2018"," Dunkirk is a technical marvel and a masterclass in visual narration from a director on the threshold of greatness.
","Initial thoughts on Christopher Nolan's war epic - Dunkirk - seems to suggest that this is another exercise in the director's pedigree for mind bending narratives. Three perspectives over land, sea and air occur at relatively different timelines but converge towards the end. That's typical Nolan for you but the nod to M. C. Escher's infinite levels of perceived reality is replaced with a sense of urgency from the very first scene to the last. In between is an exceptionally told and painstakingly assembled jaw-dropping spectacle on heroism. <br/><br/>While both the heroes and horrors of WWII have been a Hollywood stage setter for decades, Dunkirk is all about heroes. And there are plenty from civilian pleasure craft owners to daring RAF fighter pilots to the unsung but courageous few in between. Winston Churchill himself has a mention in the film for hoping to save 30,000 Allied troops stranded on the shores of the titular French coast. What Churchill envisioned, however, was just a tenth of the actual numbers that needed urgent evacuation. Mainly comprising of British, French and Belgian soldiers, over 300,000 Allied troops were stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk. With the Nazi war machine closing in from the mainland, and sea and air routes blocked by U-boats and the elite German Luftwaffe, they would need a miracle to get home. <br/><br/>What happens is literally history and although common knowledge, Nolan's retelling, albeit with a little bit of reimagining, is a deeply atmospheric and nerve-wrecking account of one the greatest rescue initiatives in history. If the intention was to create a frantic race for survival, Nolan, along with Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (who was also DP for Interstellar) and legendary music composer Hans Zimmer not only succeeds first hand, but in the process, elevates this gruelling history lesson into a pressure cooked combat thriller. Yet unlike Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan - one of the goriest war films ever - Nolan keeps bloodshed to the bare minimum, which itself is a rare feat for a war film of such a scale. CGI is also minimised in favour of the real thing - filming on location at Dunkirk, dogfights using real spitfires in actual flight over the English Channel, and shooting mostly on large format film. Also scarce are character dialogue which immensely add to the thickening mood of isolation and despair, until it reaches an overwhelming sense of hopelessness. <br/><br/>There isn't much of a plot either but the on-screen fear, suffocation, claustrophobia, PTSD, that is absorbed and felt by the viewer is THE defining factor that makes Nolan's narrative seminal. Neither are the few characters that are given some importance fleshed out either. There's Kenneth Branagh's top brass naval commander and an unnamed foot soldier surviving calamity after nightmarish calamity on the beach over a period of one week. Meanwhile, a yachter played by Mark Rylance tries to reach said beach during the course of a day. And strapped in the cockpit of a spitfire is Tom Hardy's pilot gunning down the enemy, but compressed to within an hour. That's all there is to the plot, but then again, Nolan's screenplay isn't really a full bodied story and perhaps not entirely intended as such.<br/><br/>That's because Dunkirk, in its entirety, is a riveting narration on the mettle of men, and when these three 'skits' interlace with increasing frequency, you start to see a collage that is beyond the realms of a typical war film; On a fundamental level it's all about endurance, determination, survival, self-sacrifice and then an rousing level of patriotic unity that transcends the preservation of values and culture of the Allied nations. That philosophy aside, this film is a cinematic wonder in both its technical components and its artistic range. Hoytema's deft camerawork, for instance, is deadeye with the details which are often off-centre or in the background or in the immediate foreground of the screen. And given Nolan's minimalist approach to dialogue, watching this film on an IMAX screen just adds to the gorgeous detail of the narrative. Zimmer's nonstop pulsation of a score in tandem with the sound design and editing does the rest of the talking. The lack of emotional undertones or a story that reaches fruition might be frowned upon by some. But it isn't required in this film. The craft and technique employed could make this Nolan's most intimate film yet. Perhaps one of the greatest war films ever made where almost everyone on screen is a hero in his own right."

"Michaelangelo152","9","1","2","9 January 2018"," A technical masterpiece and proof that Nolan is one of the absolute best filmmakers today...
","Christopher Nolan's latest film, ""Dunkirk"", sees the director's take on a topic he has not made a film about since now, namely war. Depicting ""The Battle of Dunkirk"", Nolan's vision for the film is pretty unique and makes it possibly one of the best war films I have ever seen. Nolan has had the idea of making this film before his film career skyrocketed with The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception and Interstellar and it is very apparent that he handled this project with care and wanted to make the best possible film he could about the fascinating story. Additionally, Nolan set out to make a realistic and intense war film, instead of one filled with needless violence (not that that can't be an enjoyable factor and can add to a film if it makes sense, as it did with Mel Gibson's recent film ""Hacksaw Ridge""). 
The thing that Nolan did with this film is put the characters in a life-threatening situation and portrayed the characters' fight for survival as intense as he could while letting you know what you need to know about the soldiers through their actions and not through clichèd dialogue. Working once again with legendary composer Hans Zimmer, the soundtrack is expectedly amazing, Zimmer implements a ticking of a watch sound throughout the whole soundtrack (an idea of Nolan's) that really added to the tension and feeling of time running out. One track in particular titled ""Supermarine"" is one of my favourites, as with previous Zimmer tracks from Inception and Interstellar, it builds and builds and when it kicks in, it's completely riveting and its use during one intense dogfight scene in the film just reminded me of why Zimmer is one of the best if not the best composer working today. Also returning to work with Nolan is dutch cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, who worked on Nolan's previous film, ""Interstellar"". Hoytema manages to make ""Dunkirk"" absolutely gorgeous, despite the topic of the film being war, its colours perfectly fit its tone and the film is overall a technical masterpiece. It also boasts a terrific cast, with actors returning from previous Nolan films like Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy while also having other great actors such as Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance. Newcomers Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles are also fantastic in their roles as 2 british soldiers who are right in the middle of the evacuation and in constant danger. Another thing worth mentioning is the 106 minute run time, normally Nolan's films are around 140-180 minutes and I could've easily watched around another hour of ""Dunkirk"", yet I feel Nolan ended the film before it would've started to drag, even though the pacing is magnificent throughout the whole film and never slows down. By the end of the film I remember audibly saying ""Wait, it's already over?"" and being amazed at how I had just watched 1 hour and 46 minutes of an intense war film that felt more like 1 hour and 20 minutes. All in all, ""Dunkirk"" is momentarily one of my absolute favourite films of the 2017, the doubts I had of Nolan tackling a subject such as war beforehand were all put to rest after seeing this latest masterpiece of his and I recommend it very much. It is an immensely gripping film with a fascinating way of telling its story while avoiding clichés that you'd normally see in a war film, jaw-droppingly beautiful shots and cinematography, some of the best music composed for a film I've heard this year, a perfect run time with excellent pacing and a cast that offers some great performances. If I had to name any flaws, I'd say there were a few editing choices I wasn't the biggest fan of, but they were few and far between that they had pretty much no effect on the film whatsoever. If you love war films or just films in general, you have to check this one out."
"rupertemerson","1","1","2","8 January 2018"," Very poor
","A series of noisy special effects does not make a movie. Excuses for the film try to pretend that the director deliberately did not build characters. In fact many efforts were made to create characters and all failed. Stereotypical cut outs waggled like a children's cardboard play. There were attempts to create story lines but all failed. The fact that the main one was clearly based on Norman Leslie's excellent Dunkirk portrayal demonstrates a hopeless lack of imagination. Why not at least choose a different small ship, a ferry, a sailing boat or something? As well as the many continuity errors there were constantly doubtful geographical and navigational scenes. Technical faults were many but most infuriating of all was the whole concept of the film. No historical insight was considered. Instead it was just a long, boring cliche. A decision was taken to show many spitfires shooting down German planes, just as they were bombing ships, with seaman cheering. While there were some such combats they would have been tiny in number compared with other combats such as fighter against fighter. The historical picture is therefore completely distorted even before one considers the role of French, non whites or anyone else. It was just a traditional attempt to glorify the spitfire which was not a superior fighter anyway. As regards the seaman who was rescued and murdered the boy on the boat, is that a true story? If not, it is in very bad taste. Best go back to the other films relating to Dunkirk which give a greater insight and are well constructed films. If you want decent acting, try The Snow Goose. Let's hope the next millions are spent on something worthwhile which is not about Britain's greatest hour but perhaps explores the darker side of England's past warring, in China, Africa or the Middle East for example. Plenty to choose from."

","I honestly can't understand how can people say this movie was boring. Were we even watching the same movie? The soundtrack is purely majestic and gives this authentic feeling of fear and dread and the action itself is breathtaking. Is it boring because it didn't have a cheesy love story? Well I'm sorry, but war is not about love, it is about survival. And Nolan made sure to clear that up. Or is it maybe boring because it didn't have a main character? Again, war is not about ONE soldier, not about ONE person's feelings and beliefs, it's about unity and the whole army. I think this movie showed exactly that all the soldiers on that beach felt the same: scared, hopeless, desperate for survival.

","Only made it 55 minutes into this major dud of a movie.
That far in and all I could understand was there were lots of soliders on a beach in France (I think) trying to get onto ships. 2 of them were trying harder then the others it seems but I had no idea if they were friends, foes or just happened to be going the same way. 
Saw 2 civilian boats commandeered by the British navy to go help get troops out, one of which went on their own without any navy people on it. 
Oh and a couple planes were doing something akin to fighting in the skies overhead.
How any of this was connected i have no idea.
The sound was worse then I see on youtube videos, my phone could have done better. When I say it was bad I mean half the dialog was not understandable due to weird background noises and ridiculously loud moments.
Sad since the real story was an amazing moment in history.

","It's not that Dunkirk is a bad movie - it's just not anywhere near as good as just about everyone made it out to be. <br/><br/>First of all, the actual event involved the evacuation of 400,000 troops and hundreds of small boats. The movie does not capture the grand scale and immensity of Dunkirk at all. With modern film making techniques it couldn't have been that difficult to make the evacuation look like the huge event it actually was. <br/><br/>Also, the aerial combat scenes were laughable. An airplane here, an airplane there. Lone bomber sinks just about every ship it attacks. One Spitfire runs out of fuel but the pilot glides around for what feels like 15 minutes and even manages to shoot down a Stuka before landing, wheels down on the beach to be captured. Pretty laughable.<br/><br/>The acting was okay but none of the roles were particularly challenging. Maybe a lot of the hype was generated by the presence of Harry Stiles of One Direction in the cast. He's no DeNiro and the role didn't need him to be one.<br/><br/>The scenes of ships being sunk were pretty harrowing though but they aren't really enough to make this movie into more of an event than it really is."

","Of all my years watching film, I've never been this urged to decide creating an account just to elaborate on why this film is a masterpiece, rather than the ""flub"" that so many of its critics so ignorantly clamor.<br/><br/>The main criticism the movie gets is that ""it has characters that I don't know much about.""<br/><br/>Here is why this criticism is flawed and shortsighted: this comes from a conditioned outlook that war movies are to be like Saving Private Ryan and pretty much every other war movie before and after that.<br/><br/>DUNKIRK IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THE REST OF THOSE WAR MOVIES.<br/><br/>The conventional war movie has the characters as its base, and the actual war as the backdrop, the complimentary setting and background that the characters shine in.<br/><br/>Nolan did not go this direction, which is why its praises involve the word ""ambitious.""<br/><br/>For Dunkirk, it's the SETTING ITSELF, THE WAR, as the main base, with the characters acting as the complimentary background for the experience of war to shine off of.<br/><br/>Nolan created a film such that it maximizes us as viewers to FEEL what the events of Dunkirk were like.<br/><br/>This is why the faulty criticism of ""the lack of character depth"" is a silly notion and one that encompasses the definition of simple-minded. To truly be in Dunkirk, in or in about any war on any battlefield that has progressed to a point similar to the events portrayed in the film, the person next to you or the people around you are nothing more than a schmuck who technically signed up for this tragedy but technically never asked for this, either.<br/><br/>There is no Hollywood-fantasy-like moment where you get to know how much the guy to your left has smashed, or if the guy in front of you has ever lost their two front teeth.<br/><br/>Extreme character exposition is not needed in this film for Nolan's direction and ambition to work. But because people don't understand this, because people are judging this work in the wrong perspective, it gets its severely underrated 8.1 rating instead.<br/><br/>The tension, the thrill, the suspense of each and every scene is masterfully done because (and this is coming straight from Nolan's mouth) this is less of a typical war movie and more of a suspense/thriller. Zimmer's amazing music elevates the anxious, claustrophobic aura of the film to unbelievable heights. The soldiers well-grounded to reality and the realistic heroism very appreciative by Hardy's great acting.<br/><br/>So if you are someone who has yet to see this brilliant movie, ignore the unimaginative critics, and go into the movie knowing full well not to expect Saving Private Ryan. Rather, to expect being as close as you can spiritually be to the scary events that occurred in Dunkirk."
"Marc_Israel_365","8","1","2","7 January 2018"," A WWII story inside the Inception studio makers minds
","Juxtaposed human stories of being trapped inside the ticking time bomb of German occupied France. The Christopher Nolan recreation of this famous English story is a noble effort and will entrench you in the three storylines filled with the brutality of wartime death, nightmarish never ending fear, and that elusive feeling of hope. But not to be forgotten, this is a movie about an almost mythical story, as reminded in the conclusion.<br/><br/>But as a Nolan film, much like his peer Tarantino, you can only compare their films to their previous films and not genre based comparisons. Here, the forced juxtaposition of the stories further enforces the pending doom and with the same Hans Zimmer score master as Inception, the films' experiences seem more than familiar. Inception has a small number of personal stories to attach yourself to amidst the confusing time lines and ever ramped up volume and here is where Dunkirk suffers. <br/><br/>Like many war epics, the sheer numbers of uniformed soldiers pushes away the audiences' ability for character introspection and attachment to their experience beyond surface level. But this is a story of a people of valor, honor, compassion and sacrifice. It's also a story that ends in the tattered threads of misunderstanding and unfounded guilt and I'd like to think that is what wartime's stories should bring us. It's never about individual persons but the greater picture of people."

"hoganshero-573-176728","10","1","2","7 January 2018"," ""Wars are not won by evacuations, but there is a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted...""
","I can't remember a Christopher Nolan film that ever disappointed. Audiences are of course very familiar with the 'Dark Knight' trilogy, but should delve deeper into Nolan's catalogue with offerings such as 'Memento' (Guy Pearce), 'Insomnia' (Robin Williams and Al Pacino) and of course my personal favorite, 'The Prestige' (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale). A close viewing of these films will allow you to fully appreciate Nolan's ability as a masterclass filmmaker and Dunkirk is no exception. It is a film that was not only directed, but written and produced by Nolan as well. Unlike his previous films, the World War II events that took place at Dunkirk in May of 1940 are embedded in history, making it an authentic and compelling piece of storytelling made even more powerful by the fact that the film was mostly shot on location at Dunkerque, France.<br/><br/>Since the outbreak of war in 1939, the Nazi's had mastered a combat tactic known as Blitzkreig or 'Lightning War' that had seen a succession of countries quickly fall such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and now France. So sudden was the advance that the British and French rear guard quickly found themselves surrounded and cornered at the coastal city of Dunkirk in Northern France and were literally being pushed into the sea with nowhere to go. The film begins with propaganda in the form of handbills falling from the sky that remind trapped troops that they are surrounded and that resistance is futile. Fionn Whitehead plays Tommy, a private who quickly collects some of the leaflets thinking to put them to more effective use as toilet paper!<br/><br/>The iconic white cliffs of Dover and Dorset are within view but the evacuation is seemingly doomed as the waters are too shallow for larger ships to anchor. At their disposal is a thin jetty known as 'The Mole' that stretches out to see and which is crammed with soldiers who are desperate to escape. Their plight is made even more harrowing by German Stukas with their inimitable notorious scream coined the 'sirens of death', which indiscriminately dive bomb with destructive precision. All would have been lost if not for the selfless actions of the 'little ships' of Dunkirk.<br/><br/>A British soldier removes his head from the sand after another Stuka fly by and infuriatingly exclaims, ""Where's the bloody air force"" in this madness? The historical role of the RAF at Dunkirk was a limited one and for good reason as aircraft needed to be placed in reserve for the impending Battle of Britain. That said, Nolan is determined to cast the RAF in a swashbuckling light and engages the services of Tom Hardy to play Farrier, a Supermarine Spitfire pilot who is flying ""The greatest plane ever built (fitted with) Rolls-Royce Merlin Engines. The sweetest sound you could hear out here"", notes Mark Rylance's Mr. Dawson. The feats of the Spitfire are legendary and were the envy of even the Luftwaffe.<br/><br/>Farrier is flying a sortie across the channel to Dunkirk to provide air cover. Hardy once again reprises his mask wearing, Bane-esque (thankfully his on our side this time) role while spending the majority of his screen time in the confines of a cockpit. Viewers must be well trained to carefully watch his eyes to gauge his expressions and thoughts. However, Hardy has this patented screen aura and it is little wonder that he has earned a reputation as Nolan's muse in 'Inception', 'Dark Knight Rises' and now 'Dunkirk'. Farrier's final radio instructions are from his Squadron Leader and another Nolan regular, Michael Caine, who cautions him to watch his fuel meter ensuring that there is enough in reserve to return home to England. Caine's voice cameo is a fitting inclusion as soon after the evacuation of over 335,000 soldiers from Dunkirk in May of 1940 the 'Battle of Britain' would begin in July of the same year and Caine would play Squadron Leader Canfield in the film of the same name. Perhaps Nolan's next project should be a remake of this 1969 classic.<br/><br/>At the core of this movie is the civilian flotilla also fondly known as the 'Little Ships of Dunkirk' who came to the rescue of the stranded soldiers. Some 850 boats and their sometime sailor crews sailed across the channel putting aside personal safety as they venture into a war zone that is heavily patrolled by German U-boat submarines, Fighter Messerschmitt squadrons and Stuka Dive Bombers. Their courage, but compulsion to bring their boys home to fight another day is admirable and best portrayed by the 3-man crew of the Moonstone, and who can hardly be described as men, but instead as Mr. Dawson, his son Peter and his friend George. It is Mr. Dawson played by Mark Rylance who once again delivers an understated supporting role, not dissimilar to his Academy Award winning supporting performance in Spielberg's 'Bridge of Spies'. His deft seamanship is demonstrated during a near miss attack involving a Messerschmitt, which Dawson correctly identifies technically as a ""Me-109"". The scene is made more memorable through use of a tension filled soundtrack and that it is juxtaposed against another sequence involving Farrier's deft airmanship and a Stuka. Whilst Mr. Dawson's maneuver may appear to be simply a matter of timing, it nevertheless saves the lives of his crew and passengers. Yet it's the dialogue afterwards that is part of the brilliant craft of Nolan's poignant filmmaking and screen writing:<br/><br/>Collins: ""How'd you know that stuff, anyway?
Mr. Dawson: My son's one of you lot. I knew he'd see us through.
(Mr. Dawson moves to one of his passengers who is a shivering shell-shocked soldier and gently ushers him below deck.)
Collins: (mistakenly to Peter) You're RAF?
Peter: No. Not me. My brother. He flew Hurricanes. Died third week into the war"".<br/><br/>The words are filled with pathos and an undertone, which speaks volumes about the characters who now glow before the audience, as we see and feel for them in a whole new other light.<br/><br/>Layered into this end part of the film is an orchestral movement titled Variation 15 (Dunkirk) by Benjamin Wallfisch and is merged with Sir Edward Elgar's 'Nimrod'. Nolan admits in the sleeve notes of the score, ""(Nimrod is) a theme which...I am incapable of hearing without feeling the surprising weight of my father's coffin on my shoulder"". This moving admission from the auteur is again filled with pathos. Nimrod is as much a part of the British psyche as is Dunkirk, which yes was a retreat of sorts, but there is a dignity in this defeat and a triumphant undertaking to ""...prove ourselves once more able to defend our island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone"".<br/><br/>The film concludes with this inspiring speech from the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. The speech is often referred to as ""We shall fight on the beaches"" and it is being read aloud by now returned soldier Private Tommy from a daily newspaper during the finale of the film. It may seem unconventional to conclude the film in this manner, but Churchill's words are rousing and define true leadership in times of crisis, which puts the world leaders of today to shame. The words resonate as the credits roll and are far more powerful and potent than any button that resides under the desk of some phony world leader. And yet in Churchill's speech there is still hope for us all in that one day the vanquished will be finally free from tyranny: <br/><br/>""...We shall go on to the end...we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be...we shall never surrender and even if this island...were subjugated and starving then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle until in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old""."
"Billybobble1","10","1","2","6 January 2018"," A worthy addition to the war genre. Just incredible.
","I want to keep this review brief (things can and do change!), let me first say my great uncle was captured by the Japanese in WWII and subsequently the POW ship he was on was blown up by the Americans. He never returned home. There are only losers in war.<br/><br/>I am generally a cold-hearted s.o.b. when it comes to movies but WWII can really churn me up inside, this one had me sobbing like a child, for the right reasons.<br/><br/>At first I was completely enamoured by the amazing colour and beauty of the moving images on screen, it was like a colourised black & white image from the time. War does not look this pretty. As the film progressed that imagery started to come together to engage the characters thoughts and emotions with barely a word said. By the end, well, it was a journey.<br/><br/>In rigid terms of film itself, Christopher Nolan has shown his true form again and created an outstanding piece of work and I applaud all involved.<br/><br/>Do I recommend this movie? Yes, 100%.<br/><br/>I wouldn't dream of giving a score of 10/10 to any film but for the impact it had with me, to give it 9/10 would be a disservice.<br/><br/>Watch it and disagree with me, but let us never forget. We should never forget.<br/><br/>Edit Oct 2019: Not only do I stand my original view, it's only grown stronger. I am utterly dismayed to see some reviews giving less than 5 stars, these are children that do not know film, and certainly have no conception of war and the sacrifices that come with it (and not least constructive criticism). They should be ignored without question. It is a testament to Nolans work to maintain such a high rating amongst fools with a keyboard.
I adore Christopher Nolan but for me, Interstellar was a huge let down (but in terms of film, very exceptional).
This is his Opus Magnum, it can be hard to quantify for the uninitiated, but we are initiated. I cry just thinking about this film, having seen it once it is truly a difficult time to experience again, but we must, and when I need a good cry I now have a choice of Gladiator or Dunkirk.<br/><br/>This is the one of very few films that will make you cry through your nose. I will always break down when Derek Jacobi says 'Who will help me carry him' towards the end of Gladiator, if Kenneth Branagh saying 'so far' does not equivocate the same with yourself, I pity your absolute lack of empathy.<br/><br/>I'm a 40 year old man, I don't want this kind of sadness but I need it to remind me just how lucky I am and what truly makes a man, human.
During these times woman were not forced nor volunteered for this kind of chaos, not to say they were not part of it, no-one deserves to be part of it, and this film encapsulates that fact like no other I have seen in the modern era.
Christopher Nolan (and cast & crew), I salute thee."
"desmondsmith-252-66701","8","1","2","6 January 2018"," Great story great cast great movie
","I want to start by saying I'm tired of seeing the big names in every movie I see, I think at times big name actors can take away from a movie more than benefit. Dunkirk did a great job of allowing us to focus less on the actors and more on the story. I feel this movie put me in the story and allowed to experience first hand some of the lives that were impacted.<br/><br/>There wasn't a lot of character building in this movie, but that's what I loved, I feel like I was allowed to more so build on the experience over one person's story. Since we're not typically used to a movie being experience based over character based, I think some may find this as a flaw. I did not. There were multiple stories and perspectives, all which immerse you into the current situation.
Christopher Nolan did a great job of creating an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness throughout the movie, I felt like I could never feel safe and constantly looked for a way out. I was on the edge of my seat for the majority of the movie.<br/><br/>Dunkirk was a great roller coaster ride that allowed a view one may otherwise never experience."

","When I heard that Dunkirk was this (now past) years must see WWII movie, I was excited to see the famous Battle of Dunkirk take place. The advertisements portrayed a losing battle where British soldiers were forced back to the beach head and pilots scrambling to take down bombers and German fighters. What we got was a movie taking place after overwhelming defeat over 3 time lines before the evacuation of 400,000 troops from Dunkirk. Most of the movie is spent following a small group of soldiers wait on a beach head trying to either get bombed or get on a ship and get bombed. The other (more exciting) part is spent watching two pilots, one portrayed by Tom Hardy, struggling to protect the sitting ducks on the beach.<br/><br/>The description states that the British troops have their backs at the beach and are surrounded, instead it is 400,000 British troops standing in lines doing nothing for an hour and forty five minutes. The movie lacks direction, and except for Hardy's character no other soldiers are actually doing anything. There is no real sense of urgency, and since there were no scenes of the combat against the Germans to depict just how overwhelming the Germans were, you begin to wonder why they are just standing there. 400,000 doing nothing. Without a clear sense of defeat and urgency, this movie is a long yawn and doesn't live up to the hype. Watch a documentary instead..."

","Like many others, I'm disturbed by the spectacular reviews this dismal piece of work has been receiving. I rarely write reviews of movies, but I'm concerned about what this may mean for the future of movies, so I thought I'd weigh in. <br/><br/>Dunkirk lacks several essential characteristics required by common sense to even earn the classification of the term ""movie"". <br/><br/>First, it lacks any semblance of a plot. The director assumes that we know the actual history, but this doesn't absolve him of the responsibility of providing one, which he has not. A character states the main issue early in the ""movie"", and a screen of words provide us an unsatisfying conclusion at the end. That's it. There's actually nothing else!<br/><br/>Second, it lacks actual characters. Everyone agrees on this point, so you don't need to hear it again from me. <br/><br/>Third, it lacks any semblance of dialog. What little there is is simply irrelevant or too muddled to understand. <br/><br/>Were it not for its other problems, Dunkirk might effectively be a silent movie. But it'd still actually be much less than a silent movie because what passes for its background ""music"" is a few spare notes from a few instruments, repeated over and over and over, ad nauseum.<br/><br/>Coincidentally, after I wrote this review, I discovered that someone actually made an eight-minute silent movie out of Dunkirk! It was much better than the extended version the rest of us suffered through. Indeed, it proved that there were no more than eight minutes worth of ""movie"" in it.<br/><br/>I think that critics have fallen for this ""movie"" in part due to the director's previous work and in part to prove their ""brilliance""--that they can ""appreciate"" a piece of tedious tripe the rest of us do not. We see this all too often (think: modern art), and it's a shame. Let's face it, director Nolan phoned this one in and, for whatever reason, reviewers bought into it.<br/><br/>In short, Dunkirk is just plain awful--a scam that shouldn't have made it past the cutting room floor--a sad and inappropriate tribute to those who risked or lost their lives in the actual event."

Where were the 400,000 stranded soldiers, the huge flotilla of rescue boats and did the RAF only have 3 available Spitfires during the Dunkirk evacuation??? I was waiting for the supposed greatest dogfights in movie history....they never appeared. When this film first came out at the cinema, I read a review stating that during the dogfight scenes it was like being inside a Spitfire, I don't know what drugs the reviewer was on but I would like some. It must have been Kenneth Branagh's easiest gig ever, endless scenes of staring at the sky with a blanked out expression, it is possible he was forced to watch the equally boring Interstellar during the filming of his scenes to help him achieve his expression. Nolan is a bang average film director, I have not seen all of his efforts, but with 20 years in the industry his only film of note is Memento. I have watched thousands of films but Noah is the only film I have watched that is as bad as Dunkirk."

"gavinp9","8","1","2","2 January 2018"," Innovative take on the war film
","'Dunkirk' is Nolan's first war film and as such, it's not typical or predictable. There's no real introduction to the characters - we're suddenly in the middle of 400,000 Allied troops being evacuated from France back to England in the middle or World War II. It's filmed from three perspectives (which works quite well): the land, where Tommy (Whitehead) is trying to get off the beach and Bolton (Branagh) is trying to organize the retreat; the ocean, where Dawson (Rylance) & his son Peter are on a small boat; and the air, where Farrier (Hardy) & Collins (Lowden) are trying to stop the German bombers.<br/><br/>The first thing you notice is the score - by Hans Zimmer - as each of the different viewpoints has it's own motif, but they are all very persistent and add to the tension and desperation of the soldiers to escape. It's interesting that you never actually see any German soldiers and ""Nazis"" are never mentioned, just ""the enemy"". There's no real main character - perhaps Whitehead, as a young, out-of-place infantryman - but they all seem realistic and suitably distraught, just trying their best to survive and make it home. The definition of ""lose the battle, but win the war"".<br/><br/>It's nice to see all the British civilian boats arrive across the English Channel (which looks great in most shots, obviously filmed on a rare sunny day!), with Rylance as the moral compass, and there's plenty of drama on the beach, but the plane battles are probably the highlight, having you on the edge of your seat, leaning with the pilots. It's short - 105min, so not an ""epic"" - and won't be remembered as the new 'Saving Private Ryan', but it's just as good as last year's 'Hacksaw Ridge'."

"dukeda","Null","1","2","31 December 2017"," Dunkirk: What happened to honest film criticism?
","The greatest reward reaped from watching Dunkirk was my rediscovery of film critic, Peter Rainer. His review of Dunkirk displays intelligence and probing honesty. He scored Dunkirk 67 out of 100. <br/><br/>Any film critic who gave Dunkirk a rating of 75 or higher is now on my Burn before Reading watchlist. Critics who scored Dunkirk at 100 are delusional. <br/><br/>At the Oscars, I wonder whether Hollywood will parade Dunkirk in front of us as a triumph in movie making. What a travesty that would be - especially when one considers the real heroics and enormous human cost at Dunkirk. Nolan's movie barely scratches the surface of the evacuation and what it meant to the world. The choppy use of piecemeal vignettes to capture individual stories (that don't even feel real) cripples the film to the point that it has little impact at all. Nolan fails to instill a deep appreciation of the men and women who evacuated 330,000 souls from France in June 1940. <br/><br/>At Dunkirk, tens of thousands of Allied and German soldiers lost their lives. Thousands of pieces of military equipment were lost. Many thousands of British and French troops were captured and later murdered or abused for the duration of the war. Nolan's Dunkirk sporadically focuses on three fighter planes, a few ships, one civilian boat, two wannabe deserters and a civilian vessel grounded in the sand at low tide. What Nolan intended to achieve is beyond me. What critics want us to believe borders on the incomprehensible. It's all a waste of everyone's time. No real story, no larger context, no real characters, no real emotion, no... shall I go on? <br/><br/>Aside from my frustration with the stillborn Dunkirk, my primary complaint is with critics who fail so miserably to offer intelligent reviews of a movie that begs for serious criticism. Has film criticism become a scamming of the public? <br/><br/>How were MetaCritic scores of 100 amassed for Dunkirk? Does the studio strong-arm a handful of ""leading"" critics into raving about a movie and then flush up an avalanche of lemming-like reviews? Are movie critics in collusion with directors and studios? Something in the world of film criticism is pathetically amiss. <br/><br/>I've regained respect for movie reviews offered by film lovers. Movie buffs may not make a living rating movies, but we aren't idiots (unless, of course, we bought a BluRay copy of Dunkirk). Millions of movie goers have been led like sheep to the Dunkirk box office by critics who shouldn't be allowed to guide us to a public restroom. <br/><br/>I think I'll go watch a foreign film for relief..."
"mrcp-43474","2","1","2","30 December 2017"," Dull disjointed and boring
","For a close run escape of 300,000 British and French soldiers, this movie is awfully dull. 
The pacing is ridiculously slow and the continuity at times silly. As an example, an RAF pilot runs our of fuel, the scene cuts to ships at see, night falls then it is light again and the pilot is still gliding across the beach to an uneventful landing. In the actual history about 10,000 small craft heeded their countries call and swarmed ashore. In the movie, we see only one lone boat crossing the sound for the first two thirds of the movie. Then all of a sudden we see about 30 boats the music swells and we see one or two boats loaded. Nothing like the massive chaotic scene that must have actually taken place. This movie has no sense of drama, no sense of pacing and no sense of history."

The potential for a great story was there!<br/><br/>The movie, unfortunately, failed to take advantage of the potential... It was basically a World War II movie with very little fighting and no action. It was boring (I fell asleep twice). <br/><br/>I really don't understand how this film got the rating it did. Unless of course, the people enjoyed the cinematography. I will give it that much. The film had a very ""artsy"" feel to the way it was shot. Wide camera angles that did convey the hopelessness and loneliness of being trapped on that beach and under constant danger from the advancing Germans. But other than that, one of the most boring films I've seen in a long time. <br/><br/>=========== POTENTIAL SPOILER ===================<br/><br/>The film centered around a few hours during the battle of Dunkirk and presented the events from the perspective of various people. The events that were chosen was part of the problem. They were probably the least interesting of all the things that could have happened over the course of the fight/evacuation."

","I was pretty disappointed after watching Dunkirk, technically and cinematographically it's very good, very authentic very well shot including the effects, however story wise it were individual scenes about things that happened and people but it never came together. Furthermore there was a lack of any suspense, everything happened in a very very slow tempo. Even the combat scenes, dogfights of the Spitfires vs the Me109's and the Heinkel 111, were brilliantly shot but with no trill or any suspense. Confusing was the time line of the movie, nearly all the action scenes were shown later again from a different angle and seen though other people's eyes. Also the number of soldiers on the beach, boats in the water and planes in the air was very limited and nothing close to the real numbers. Computer graphics should have been able to coop with that. Overall there was no story, no plot and no end. If I see in some reviews that this is the best war movie ever, seriously get real, no way."

","""Saving Private Ryan"" is widely considered one of the best movies about WWII made in the modern era, and this movie makes its case to be in that elite company.<br/><br/>While Nolan's attention to detail is at its usual high standard, I think what he really brought to life was not only the isolation of those 400,000 Soldiers but the desperation as well. These men are trapped on a beach with the enemy all around them, attacking at apparent will and yet they are so close to home. He captures the sense there are no safe places on that strip of sand, and in that desperation we see what men are capable of--not only in good ways but in bad ones as well.<br/><br/>I will be very surprised if this movie is forgotten come award season."

"matthewssilverhammer","9","3","12","26 July 2017"," Nolan's Greatest Since The Dark Knight
","There are few directors whose name alone can draw in crowds, giving audiences a piece of work that is as thoughtful as it is engrossing. Nolan (Dark Knight, Inception) may be the premier example, offering one philosophical blockbuster epic after another. With Dunkirk, he gives us one of his most emotionally potent and compact films, but its brevity only helps to enhance its breathless vision of military combat and human resilience. This is as close as some of us may ever get to actual warfare, because once the screen lights up, the thrills and emotional adrenaline never ceases. It's 1940. The Germans have trapped the Allied forces on the shores of Dunkirk. These 300,000+ troops were left hopeless and helpless, if not for a ""fleet"" of civilian fishing and leisure boats coming from a town called Dover across the sea to transport them home. We start with one young soldier, opening on the battle-stricken beach, and ending with that same soldier on the other end of the rescue. There is no backstory. There is no epilogue. Nolan simply packs us tightly within this one historical moment, filling it with daring rescues and narrow escapes that Spielberg would envy. But of course, a straightforward war picture this is notwe're talking about Nolan, after all. With very little hand-holding, we jump between three different stories within this battle with no regard for linear momentum or time traditional time constraints. Nolan tells his tale to help us feel the chaos, experience the humanity, and appreciate even the most ""cowardice"" of servants. And, boy, do we. Dunkirk is simply one of the most engulfing, overwhelming war films I've ever seen."
"GorchBrother","8","3","12","24 July 2017"," Best of Nolan

But there is horror. Not manufactured horror, the realisation of what it would have been like to find yourself there, with your badly fitting military clothing, the chilling wind and sea, the time ticking away before the enemy arrive.<br/><br/>The audience doesn't see the enemy. But you hear them. Another remarkable aspect of the film is (quite correctly) conjure the full throated sound of a German machine gun fired in a sleepy town. <br/><br/>I congratulate those who made this movie."
"birdieleigh","9","3","12","22 July 2017"," Did the low raters even watch the same movie I did?
","Just got out of what I'm sure will be the first of many viewings of Dunkirk. I'm a huge fan of Nolan's work and method of storytelling, and when I heard he was taking on a historical event for the first time I was incredibly excited but also a little apprehensive. Historical films are either fantastic or terrible, depending on how you approach them. I knew Nolan would take his usual methods for this one and I hoped they would work well but came in to the film open-minded. I was not disappointed, on any level. <br/><br/>This film was visually stunning, viscerally suspenseful, claustrophobic and compelling. The thing about World War 2 events is that most of us know how things play out. So the point of this film was not to fill us in on something we already know, but to give us a new perspective on it. This film gives us three. I thought the perspective-switching was a brilliant way to build tension and tell the story from angles we may not have thought of before. <br/><br/>I do not understand the complaints about poor editing, bad music, or boredom. I especially don't understand those who claim the film had no depth or that the characters weren't compelling enough. There are many ways to show an audience who someone is without giving their entire backstory, and I thought that Dunkirk in particular did a fantastic job of showing how human beings actually act under pressure. I wonder if those who rated this movie poorly even watched the same film I did, or if they are at all familiar with Nolan's filmmaking style. Dunkirk was different, but it was phenomenal."

","It looks like your run of the mill war movie from the poster. But, when you come to know it is a product of Christopher Nolan, you expect it to be a lot more than just that. <br/><br/>Nolan, once again, shows us what can be achieved with the 70mm IMAX with his one of a kind vision. This film sets a new benchmark for the cinematography in war scenes. It has the best ever air combat scenes where you will find yourself in the RAF pilot's seat and experiencing the flight minus the G forces. The attention to detail is mind blowing, be it the fuel gauge of the aircraft or the torpedo making its way in water and hitting the destroyer. There are a very few dialogues in the movie but it still says so much. Another remarkable aspect of this production is that Nazis are never shown in the whole movie but still you can feel their presence everywhere. <br/><br/>The Dunkirk evacuation was nowhere close to a proud moment for the allied forces. On the contrary, it was a colossal embarrassment brought about by the turbulent politics in France. So, there wasn't a whole lot of 'winning' that could be shown in this movie. But Nolan has created characters who you will identify with and they resist the Nazi onslaught and make it home on their will power. The miracle of Dunkirk where civil boats showed up to bring the service men home can be very strongly felt in the movie and that was what I was looking for."

The fact that almost every veteran or war expert said this movie is realistic, shows how much research happened during pre-production.<br/><br/>Thia movie captured the real emotions of soldiers on battlefield, everyone was afraid and wanted to go home. Isn't that what any of us would have wanted?<br/><br/>Let me couner some stupid criticism I saw here in reviews,<br/><br/>1.

I think this movie became victim of hype. This movie is to underrate as it's by Nolan who is at his peak of direction, movie is pretty realistic based on Hollywood standards, no setting simply pulls audience into war field from the first scene.<br/><br/>But the major one, it requires audience tonpay attention.

It was very pleasing to the eye but if you are enjoying Nolan's movies for their brilliant scripts and and stunning visuals effects you will be half satisfied : The characters have no background there are no clear protagonists and there is zero plot Since Interstellar was the last Christopher Nolan's movie I watched, this one left me very disappointed.

"australiantiger","8","2","7","1 September 2017"," Dunkirk Delivers on All Fronts
","A film where characters are barely given a name and practically no background sounds like an uphill battle, but in Dunkirk the masterful Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, 2008) uses the impersonal element of war to deliver a chilling and gripping story. <br/><br/>Situated in the Northern French town of Dunkirk during World War II, the film follows an eclectic group of characters as the British forces undergo the evacuation of their soldiers in response to their encirclement by the oncoming Nazi army. <br/><br/>The film cleverly follows a non-linear narrative, interwoven into three parts; the mole, the sea and the air. Within the parts, different characters and story lines are followed which never directly interact with each other but are all influenced by the evacuation of Dunkirk. <br/><br/>The ensemble cast features a mixture of established stars and young up-and-comers, with no actor noticeably out of place. A personal favourite performance of mine was veteran Kenneth Branagh's role as Commander Bolton, who despite limited time on screen was pivotal in establishing the importance of the evacuation in its historical context. I believe the decision to provide little background information on the characters did hinder the film, as it was hard to build an emotional connection with a character you know little about. This was evident in the death of George (Barry Keoghan), which would have been more effective if the audience had a greater connection with the character. <br/><br/>As is accustom with the work of Christopher Nolan, the cinematography in Dunkirk is as breathtaking as it is realistic. Counteracting the ever-increasing Hollywood trend of CGI in every scene, Nolan employs a variety of practical effects in the film. At no point did any character, costume, prop or scenery feel out of place or unrealistic. To heighten this realism, Dunkirk was filmed on location in France, used over 6,000 extras and featured actual vehicles from World War II. <br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest attribute of the film is the use of sound. The score was composed by Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, 2000), the recipient of four Oscars and arguably the best composer in Hollywood. The soundtrack fitted the theme of war, utilising high tempo orchestral music to build tension in scenes with great effect. The use of this kind of music wasn't overused however, steering clear of the stereotypical Hollywood blockbuster action film effects. The music was used selectively, noticeably absent in scenes to highlight the dialogue and natural sounds in the film. <br/><br/>The film was at its chilling best during the night scenes in the ocean. As the incredibly loud missiles hit the near pitch-black ship, the audience became completely absorbed within the world and begin to comprehend just how scary the situation would be for the characters. <br/><br/>Overall, Dunkirk was an immersive cinematic experience worthy of multiple viewings. In any collection of greatest World War II films or even war films in general, Dunkirk is a must have and I would be shocked if the film is not featured heavily in the upcoming awards season."

However, I think the hype that I heard about this movie let me down a bit. I felt it was a bit anti-climatic as well.

","I saw the teaser trailer for this war movie a couple of months before its release, I was most excited to see it, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception). Basically set during World War II, the film follows three interwoven different time periods: on land covering one week, at sea covering one day, and in the air covering one hour, all at the time of the Dunkirk evacuation. i. The Mole - young private Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), is one of several soldiers coming under fire from unseen German soldiers on the streets of Dunkirk, he finds British and allied troops on the beach staged for evacuation, he meets young soldier Gibson (Aneurin Barnard). A ship evacuating the wounded is attacked during departure, Tommy and Gibson save soldier Alex (introducing One Direction's Harry Styles) from being crushed by the sinking ship, they get on another boat, but it is sunk by a U- boat torpedo, Gibson saves Tommy and Alex and they make their way to shore. Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) and Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy) discuss the situation; the Prime Minister will not be ""making terms"" and has committed to evacuating 30,000 soldiers, smaller civilian vessels have been requisitioned in order to evacuate. The next day, they join a group of Scottish soldiers on a fishing trawler, they hide in it hoping to evacuate, a Dutch man takes refuge and tells them German soldiers are outside. The Germans shoot at the boat for target practise, unaware soldiers are sheltered inside, it is impossible for the boat to stay afloat with the bullet holes in the hull. Gibson is accused by Alex of being a German spy, Tommy defends him, but Gibson confesses to being French and stealing a British soldier identity, as the ship sinks, Gibson gets tangled in a chain and drowns, a nearby minesweeper is sunk by a German bomber. The boat of Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) arrives and takes many soldiers aboard, rescuing them from burning in oil slick, several of the others are killed in the fire, they cross the Channel and reach Dorset, Alex and Tommy are among other soldiers on a train, they receive a British heroes' welcome. Commander Bolton watches the last British soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk, 300,000 soldiers are confirmed evacuated, ten times the number they had hoped. ii. The Sea - the Royal Navy are commandeering private boats for the evacuation, Mr. Dawson cooperates without question, but he and his son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) take the boat out themselves, rather than let the navy take it, their teenage hand George (Barry Keoghan) also joins, hoping to do something noteworthy. As they continue towards Dunkirk, three Supermarine Spitfires fly overhead, then they encounter and take aboard a Shivering Soldier (Cillian Murphy), he is the sole survivor of a U-boat attack. The soldier discovers that Dawson is sailing for Dunkirk rather than returning to England, the soldier scuffles with George trying to get Dawson to turn back, George falls and takes a severe blow to the head, Peter treats his wounds as best as he can, Dawson is duty-bound to aid the evacuation and continues towards France. They see a Spitfire plane crash in the ocean, pilot Collins (Jack Lowden) is pulled from the plane by Dawson's crew as it sinks. They encounter a minesweeper under attack by a German bomber and accompanying fighter planes, they manoeuvre through weapons firing to take troops fleeing the damaged ship, they narrowly get clear as the spilling oil is ignited. Dawson and his crew pull as many survivors that can fit, including Alex and Tommy, George is revealed to be dead, Peter takes pity on the shell-shocked soldier and assures him George will be fine. In Dorset, Dawson is congratulated for saving the number of men he has, George's body is carried away, the soldier sees this before he leaves and boards the train, sitting in a compartment with Alex and Tommy, Peter takes a photograph of George, he is reported in a newspaper as a youthful hero. iii. The Air - in the air are three Spitfire pilots: Farrier (Tom Hardy), Collins, and their squadron leader (Sir Michael Caine), they are crossing the English Channel to provide air support to the troops waiting at Dunkirk, with instructions for how much fuel they can use before needing to return. Farrier's fuel gauge malfunctions, nevertheless he continues onwards, they encounter a Luftwaffe plane, which shoots down the squadron leader, Farrier assumes command as they continue toward France. They successfully take down an enemy plane, but Collins' plane is damaged, forcing him to crash land into the Channel, Farrier is unsure of his final fate. Farrier continues alone, he switches to reserve fuel, having burned his entire ration in manoeuvres with enemy planes, as he flies overhead he witnesses the minesweeper destroyed and Tommy and Alex's boat sinking. Farrier finally reaches Dunkirk, where enemies are bombarding, and evacuation efforts are being made, he saves the ships and troops taking down the bomber. Farrier flies over the beach and boosts the morale of the soldiers, they clap and cheer for him, out of fuel he glides for landing on the beach, barely cranking the landing gear in time, he is grounded beyond the Allied perimeter, after setting his plane fire, he is taken prisoner by the Germans. Also starring Will Attenborough, Richard's grandson as Second Lieutenant. The performances by such talents as Hardy, Branagh, Rylance and Murphy are all terrific, if you imagined Pulp Fiction, but as a war movie, that should give you an idea of what this is like, the narrative is non-linear, the audience is expected to keep up with the three perspective threads, it makes it all the more interesting, and it adds to the feeling of distortion and trauma experienced in war, of course the action is very engaging also, a most worthwhile Second World War drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Score for Hans Zimmer, Best Cinematography and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Original Music, Best Cinematography and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score.

The story lacks bigger attachment to it's protagonists, of course I didn't want them to die, but the screenplay doesn't really seems to care as to what happens to them.<br/><br/>Grossly overrated, but truly special, ¨Dunkirk¨ is the most frustrated I've been with a Nolan film since 2005.

","Most of people see Nolan as a master in directing and screen writing, I think they're right because I also watched most of the Nolan's films and I liked most of them. If we sort Dunkirk among Nolan's movies this movie is not his best movie or his worst movie. As a war movie we can put it easily top ""10 best war movies "" lists and maybe even ""best 5"". This movie uses so little CGI and shows the other directors again that directors can make impressive war movies without CGI also I must say If I give points as visually probably I would give this 9/10 because visuals are amazing and very impressive. It passes ww2 era and based on real events and film's tag line is""surviving is victory"" if you think surviving is victory probably you're going to love this movie because in this movie there is not much WW2 clichés, exaggerations. However dialogues and character developments are very limited this movie present us Nolan's different viewpoint and makes us feel like the soldiers who try to survive in that beach.<br/><br/>Briefly, DUnkirk is close to a masterpiece and it is very close perfect as visually however it presents us its Motto ""Surviving is Victory"" its character developments and dialogues are weak. 8/10."

"swilliky","8","2","7","23 July 2017"," A grand scale war film from Christopher Nolan
","Christopher Nolan depicts the great effort to evacuate British soldiers during the early part of World War II in his latest film. With Dunkirk surrounded, the soldiers try to flee on battleships but planes continue to drop bombs and sink them. The story plays out in three parts and three timelines, the first story ""The Mole"" plays out over a week on the beach, the second ""The Sea"" in one day, and ""The Air"" in one hour. The soldier Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) tries to escape the beach any way he can from carrying the sick to hiding in an abandoned craft. He teams up with a silent soldier Gibson (Aneurin Barnard) to carry a wounded man aboard a destroyer but then they are both ordered off the ship so hide below the dock. They hear Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) and Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy) discuss the situation on the beach. On a dock back in England, Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and his son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) see the Royal Navy commandeering boats so they decide to set sail themselves to help the truth bringing along young George (Barry Keoghan).<br/><br/>In the air, Farrier (Tom Hardy) and Collins (Jack Lowden) fly towards the beach. Their greatest worry beyond the enemy planes is fuel, especially when Farrier's gauge breaks. The two pilots take down enemy planes with stunning scenes of air battle, probably the best part about watching the film in theaters. Back on the beach, Timothy and Gibson escape a sinking ship and help soldiers out of the water. They venture to another ship where they allowed on board and given tea and toast. Gibson does not go below deck but Timothy goes with Alex (Harry Styles) to eat the food. When a torpedo hits that ship, the men scramble to swim above the surface and Gibson saves their lives by opening the door so they can swim out. Mr. Dawson picks up a soldier (Cillian Murphy) shivering on a sunken U-Boat. The soldier desperately wants to not go back to the beach at Dunkirk having seen what happened.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

"jadepietro","10","2","7","22 July 2017"," War is Hell
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) <br/><br/>GRADE: A- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A visually accomplished film that focuses on its ""war is hell"" theme with memorable details.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: The Battle of Dunkirk, as seen by its fighting soldiers on land, on sea, and in the air.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Dunkirk shows the horrors of war as soldiers are stranded on the beaches of a French coastal town and waiting for the smallest sign of rescue. Yes, it will come, but slowly, as lives are lost and saved. The Germans are in control here, having the advantage to easily aim and fire at the helpless British troops (along with their French, Belgian and Canadian allies). Courage is in abundance as both civilian and military forces come to their aid. Such is war. Such is Christopher Nolan's exceptional film.<br/><br/>Mr. Nolan's vision interweaves three distinct viewpoints of the Allied evacuation, from land, sea, and air, all occurring in diverging time frames. His skill as a director establishes this battlefront in three chapters and he masterfully juggles his action scenes with his mini-cast of characters in each segment, all of which leads to a stirring denouncement.<br/><br/>The film is divided into three chapters. ""The Mole: One week"" focuses on one young recruit, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) and his band of brothers, including One Direction's former member, Harry Styles), as they scurry to avoid bullets and falling explosives. The second part, ""The Sea: One Day"", tells its story of a brave captain (Mark Rylance) and his crew (Tom Glynn-Carrey, Barry Keoghan) who are in rescue mode to save the soldiers, although a recent survivor (Cillian Murphy) of this slaughter protests their mission. Two pilots (Tom Hardy, Jack Lowman) lead a dogfight against the German planes from above in the third portion, ""The Air: One Hour"". The structure of Dunkirk takes these three individual story lines and meshes them together so seamlessly that the moviegoer follows these one-act dramas with full attention as they converge into a satisfying whole.<br/><br/>Mr. Nolan's skills as a director are impressive as he captures this historic piece of World War II lore. For me, the film was very reminiscent of the fine 1962 war saga, The Longest Day, which showed World War II in a fragmented style of battle scenes from various points of view with a matter-of-fact authenticity. (That classic film dealt with the D-Day landings in Normandy.) Dunkirk's powerful visual swept is also comparable to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, one of the greatest war films ever made. This film is superior filmmaking in every sense of the word. (Be forewarned; there is violence due to its subject matter, but it's not as graphic as most war films in recent memory.)<br/><br/>Technically, Dunkirk is a remarkable achievement. The images are photographed with stunning details by Hoyte van Hoytema and the taut editing by Lee Smith ratchets up the suspense. Hans Zimmer's bombastic score and the astonishing sound design complement each other to heighten the tension as well. Mr. Nolan's screenplay is more action than words, but he is one of the foremost visual storyteller in today's cinema. His images are memorable (a horrifying crash landing on water, a sandy beach littered with discarded helmets, war leaflets showering down on some infantrymen walking nonchalantly down a strangely quiet street, the hand of a drowning soldier suddenly becoming motionless in the dark murky waters). Come award season, this film will garner many accolades.<br/><br/>One minor flaw: Due to Mr. Nolan's clinical approach on his subject, the personal human drama is missing from his screenplay. He is more intent of showing the casualties of war. One wishes more screen time was spent on fleshing out the characters and adding some back stories to the major roles. As it is now, they all become stock characters representative of the bigger picture whose sole purpose is to deliver the film's main theme: war is hell but the human spirit will triumphantly survive. The acting, including Kenneth Branagh, Mr. Lowden, and Mr. Rylance, is fine but it never rises to an emotional level due to the narrative structure of the film. The actors are continually upstaged by the physical sweep of the event.<br/><br/>Dunkirk recreates one epic battle in the hands of one epic director at the top of his game. It is one of the year's best films and will deservedly become a film classic for many generations to come. <br/><br/>NOTE: See this film in IMAX format."
"monstermayhem32","6","2","7","22 July 2017"," a movie that could have been better
","When I first saw the trailer for the Dunkirk movie, I will admit that I had rather high expectations for the movie since it did look rather stunning and amazing. Instead I felt that I was disappointed. While there were parts of the movie that were good particularly Harry Styles in his film debut and does his best with the role despite the limited dialogue. Kenneth Branaugh was also good as well as Mark Rylance. However I felt that diminished the film was the lack of character development and felt more like survivors waiting for a rescue and lacked a sense of likability or care for them. Despite that the film did have a wonderful musical score but felt a somewhat longer running time might have benefited the film. Maybe it might get an Oscar in 2018, but only time will tell."
"groznymm-198-222796","6","2","7","22 July 2017"," The Good, The Bad and The Ugly in the Dunkirk
","Christopher Nolan named ten or twelve films that inspired Dunkirk. But why The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is not in his list? 1. At the beginning of the movie, soldiers are walking along the street of an empty city. The same passage of Tuco along the street of the empty city before the shootout with the cowboys of the Angel Eyes. 2. From the very beginning of the film there are no dialogues, despite the fact that the characters meet. And this eye contact dialogue lasts more than ten minutes, as well as in the film about cowboys. 3. Two soldiers run with a wounded soldier on a stretcher, and it's very similar to how Tuco and the Blonde run through the battlefield holding the box with a bomb. And in both cases, the characters pursued another goal. 4. This two soldiers climb to the pier in order to overhear the captain's speech. We see that these two guys are clearly different from the rest of the soldiers with intelligence and ingenuity. It's very similar to how Tuco and the Blonde climbed up the bridge to blow it up. But they had a goal to find a cemetery with gold. They are also clearly smarter than other soldiers. There is an acute feeling that the director uses a list of films to divert attention from the main source of his inspiration."
"clemdeck","8","2","7","22 July 2017"," A powerful, dark film that does not allow time to breathe
","Through Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan makes us live all the intensity of the events of Operation Dynamo. A powerful, dark film that does not allow time to breathe.<br/><br/>First of all, even if Dunkirk is a war film, do not expect the classic scenes of the genre. No great battle scenes where hundreds of actors kill each other. but minimalist clashes focused on few fighters. No dripping heroism either like the American cinema as the secret. But the staging of a furious will to survive. Dunkirk is the story of 400 000 men trapped on a beach waiting to embark for England, while the German army tighten its grip on them, at every moment. We imagine without difficulty the growing anxiety of these men and the phenomenal stress to which they have been subjected. And that's clearly this feeling that Christopher Nolan tried to send us.<br/><br/>Indeed, everything in this movie, from filmmaking to musical compositions, give suffocation feeling. Colors are dull and dark. Dialogues are short and not many. The filmmaking is jerky. Music (signed Hans Zimmer!) is stabbing. All of this creates an oppressing ambiance which truly press on the spectator.<br/><br/>This oppression feeling is reinforced by the fact that at no moment, along the film, we can see the enemy. Always, his presence can only be guessed. He is there and is coming.<br/><br/>This film, like his glorious predecessors Apocalypse Now, or Full Metal Jacket, is a diving into the world of the soldier at war, where death is omnipresent and where struggle for survival can lead the best to the darkest choices. <br/><br/>Nolan succeed here, to create with brio an atmosphere of the most suffocating and to keep the spectator panting all the way. A good movie, which will leave a trace, but not recommended to asthmatic people.<br/><br/>PS: even if from an historical point of view the film is correct, i regret that the sacrifice of french soldiers, without which the operation would not have succeeded, wasn't mentioned."

"regula1","8","2","7","20 July 2017"," An experience, with an important history lesson
","After seeing it, I understand completely the campaign to see this in IMAX.<br/><br/>For one thing, there's actually very little dialogue, so the meat of the film consists of the sights and the sounds. And they paint a pretty grim picture with some traumatizing sounds.<br/><br/>And that's exactly the point.<br/><br/>What Christopher Nolan has done is essentially recreate the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, remove most of the dialogue (as well as the gore, after all it is PG-13) crank up the soundtrack, and reverse the film so the men go into the water instead of coming out.<br/><br/>As a student of World War II history, I understand the situation of the men stranded on the beaches from an intellectual standpoint. What this film has done is what Saving Private Ryan did for D-Day: give the event real emotional stakes, which is what it needs.<br/><br/>The British have basked in the victory of the rescue of their army for decades, but here on the other side of the pond we know very little as a society, probably because no-one has made a movie about it until now.<br/><br/>This film has succeeded in making the disaster and the miracle come to life.<br/><br/>As with any film, there are things that aren't quite right. For instance, it's a good thing there's so little dialogue because almost all of it is bereft of emotion in its delivery (perhaps a commentary on the rattled nerves of the men?).<br/><br/>Perhaps the main oddity of this film is how it portrays events. There are three different story lines interwoven 1. The men on the beach, 2. The men on the boats (really one boat, captained by Mark Rylance's character) coming to save the men on the beach, and 3. Two British pilots, one of whom is played by Tom Hardy, protecting both the men on the beach and the men in the boat. Their stories are not shown in chronological order, and if you don't catch on to this in short order, you may be left confused for much of the film. Did it need this gimmick? You be the judge, but I'm going to say probably not.<br/><br/>All told, this film's take on an event that Americans know little about may be imperfect, but it is sorely needed to show the desperate situation these men faced, and we should think about the possible consequences if those 338,000 men hadn't made it off the beach."
"DoINeedT0","Null","3","13","29 July 2017"," Very good, but what is the relevance?
","Really, in terms if cinematic viewing, this film is an 8/10 pushing a 9/10. Incredible levels of tension that I have rarely seen, really good music and visuals and fantastic acting. The only thing regarding the acting was that the actors mumbled a lot and it really frustrated me that I couldn't hear what they were saying (especially the pilots with their mouths covered). Although it didn't detract a huge amount from the whole story line; since the film was more of a ""show"" rather than ""tell"", it did however, take away some enjoyment.<br/><br/>However, what struck me the most, was how there was not one person of colour in the entire film. I realise that this is a historic drama and they wanted to portray it just as it was in history, which is fine, but these days I cannot see how directors can justify making a film that does not hire any actors of colour. If it doesn't, it begs the question what is the point of making the film, why are you not making an effort to hire POC? There are thousands of black and minority ethnic actors waiting to be hired (and women for that matter, of which I counted about 5 during the whole movie). Colour- blind casting is done constantly in theatre and is never an issue (as well as gender-blind casting), I think it's about time we transferred it to film, the human imagination is very capable of filling in the gaps where necessary.<br/><br/>In fact, we need a change in the whole film industry, more representation for under-represented communities, more female directors, more female protagonists, less objectifying of women etc. etc.<br/><br/>Also, I thought it quite a strange time for this film to be released, why now? I would understand if it were the anniversary of the battle of Dunkirk, but no, nothing. A way in which this film resonated with me (having been in the Dunkirk area recently) and a way that the film could have had a more present day significance if had been done in a slightly different way, is that they could have drawn parallels with the refugee crisis which is still continuing right now. People waiting desperately to get to the UK, having crossed a sea in sinking, overcrowded boats, fleeing from violence."

","Great story and cinematography. One drawback is that is too short - should have included the how and why the soldiers ended up on the beach in the first place - there is no prologue to the story and this leaves you wonder. There are three story lines: Land, Sea and Air - each with characters that you follow in their quest to escape or protect the evacuation. The air sequences are some of the best I've ever seen. This pick got an 8.6 on IMDb, but I give it an 8 out of ten. Great WWII flick but not up to the Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List level."
"theodean-52785","10","3","13","22 July 2017"," Masterfully Thrilling - one of the best movies I have ever seen
","""Dunkirk"" is so good because it feels so real. It's a survival story that puts you right next to the characters. You feel like you are within touching distance of each character portrayed in the film. The music does not take away from this realness. In fact, Hans Zimmer's score utilizes lots of pulses that sounds closer to a heart pounding rather than plain background music. Christopher Nolan's unique directing masterfully starts the film fragmented into three parts all taking place over different amounts of time, yet they all come together into one thrilling conclusion. I will not reveal those parts explicitly; don't want to spoil anything. In conclusion, ""Dunkirk"" masterfully captures the raw feeling of men during the horrific event. The intensity is so high that you never find a sense of calm; but at the same time the intensity forces you to never look away. Early contender to win a multitude of Oscars. 10/10"
"paulijcalderon","8","3","13","19 July 2017"," Demands to be seen on the big screen
","Nolan delivers! I have never been that familiar with the whole WWII Dunkirk situation, which is something my brother (the war expert) wasn't very happy about. But, it's fair to say that I now understand what went down. You know how you usually get a lot of set ups or exposition before the action starts in war films? Well, here they throw that away and we open right in the middle of the entire evacuation crisis. The good thing is that I was almost immediately immersed by it. The story is told through three different perspectives; The soldiers on the beach, the people on the boats and the airplane pilots. All of the story-lines are well done. I cared for what was going on and I could feel the despair from everyone. There's not much dialogue which was refreshing because here there's room for the visual narrative to shine.<br/><br/>I think my favorite perspective was from the pilots. You feel like you are up in the air with them and all of the wide shots of them flying were breathtaking. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is fantastic. The open sea setting was also great. I could almost smell the salt water. The spectacle and scope is off the charts in this film. It's not a character study, but more of an experience of putting you in the shoes of the people during the incident. Nolan succeeded in making everything look authentic because I did not notice any CGI. So, I believed that what I saw on screen was real. The best thing I can probably say is that I forgot people were acting or that the explosions were fake and so on. If someone says they didn't get much out of it, then I can understand. It doesn't give you a lot backstory or a specific main character to root for. We are basically presented with a glimpse of what happened in the lives of all of those people during the Dunkirk evacuation. We don't follow them before or after. And I don't think it was needed in this one. Sometimes it's better to leave that up to the imagination. Just the look on the people's faces was enough for me to understand them. The one complaint I can think of is that the music started sounding too much like a horror movie score at times. I get that war is horrific and all, but it got too on the nose and overplayed here and there. I would have preferred it to be more toned down.<br/><br/>See it on the big screen, because the photography is executed so well it demands to be seen the right way. Also, be on the lookout for the Michael Caine cameo."

","An earlier comment said ""Overall I believe this movie is highly overrated, due to many biased Nolan fans and critics blindly hopping on the hype-train. I found it a very boring movie."" What were you watching? There was nothing boring about this movie, especially as it was only 106 minutes long. It was not a movie about personalities -- it was a movie about an event. A significant event for the peoples of the UK, and ultimately the French, Dutch, and Belgians, Americans. I think it is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, but I sure that the Hollywood people will spurn it because of the lack of diversity and the portrayal of patriotism displayed. Much like Zero Dark Thirty and Lone Survivor, among others."
"rubenm","9","3","14","24 July 2017"," Remarkable tour de force
","One of the most intense scenes in Christopher Nolan's war movie 'Dunkirk' doesn't feature bombs, planes or boats. It shows three soldiers, sitting on the beach, looking at the surf, waiting for help that may never come. While they're sitting there, we see another soldier behind them. He is walking over the beach towards the sea, first dropping his helmet, than his gun. He keeps walking and disappears into the sea. The three soldiers sitting on the beach know what they've seen. And so does the audience. Not a word is said, but an awful lot is shown. <br/><br/>This scene proves that 'Dunkirk', other than some of Nolan's previous movies, is not only visual bravado. It's not just big budget film making, aimed at entertaining large audiences yearning for the ultimate cinema experience. Nolan uses his big budget to tell us something. To give us a history lesson. To show us the Dunkirk evacuation as it really happened. Never do this again, he advises us. Never again decide to send innocent teenagers into a senseless, cruel war. <br/><br/>The film is outstanding in many respects. One: the narrative structure is a tour de force. Three different story perspectives with three different time frames are blended into one film, showing the same events from different angles. Two: technically, the film is perfect. Without many computer generated images, Nolan lets boats sink, planes go down and bombs explode. Three: it may sound strange, but in 'Dunkirk', war has an aesthetic quality. Thousands of soldiers queuing on the flat beach, waiting for boats that are nowhere to be seen, is a remarkable sight and Nolan makes the best of it. The same with the masses of identically clad soldiers, and with the impressive opening scene of soldiers catching flyers, wafting through the empty streets of Dunkirk. Four: 'Dunkirk' is an overall white-knuckle experience. Even although we know how it all ends, the suspense is always there because we don't know who will live in the end and who won't. The minimalist and extremely effective soundtrack adds even more adrenaline. <br/><br/>At the very end of the film, the chilling observations of war cruelty are followed by sentimental British patriotism. In my view, it's the only minor flaw of this otherwise remarkable cinematographic experience."

","This is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, and the best movie of 2017 that I've seen so far. This is not your typical war movie. Typical war movies are about character growth through hardship. Dunkirk has very little dialogue and is not about character growth (in fact, I don't remember hearing some of the characters' names in the movie) because Nolan immerses the audience into the experience of the Dunkirk evacuation, which was hurried and intense and thus likely allowed very little for conversations among the soldiers. This lack of focus on character growth in the movie is what makes Dunkirk unique and it opens up avenues for other thematic explorations, such as themes surrounding national unity. Like any Christopher Nolan film, the cast and the score by Hans Zimmer are spectacular. I'm not sure Dunkirk is the best war film ever made, but it's sure damn great and unique. I hope to see Dunkirk join the likes of other war movies such as The Deer Hunter, Patton, and Platoon at the Academy Awards! If not, it'll definitely be in the class of Doctor Zhivago, Apocalypse Now, and Saving Private Ryan. I'll be buying the DVD as well as the soundtrack-take all my money (okay, maybe not all of it)!"

","As a long time Nolanist and after seeing all of his movies, Dunkirk was no exception to the greatness this man can produce/direct/write. This is a movie one does not simply watch. This is a movie one experiences.<br/><br/>1) A war movie unlike you have ever seen. The whole movie presents war in all of its ""glory."" There are few scenes in this movie that do not present the horror of warfare, the agony all of those men went through or the diversification between them that it created. The story itself does not exist. The whole movie presents itself through a series of spectacular and brutal scenes, pushing the characters to the very limit of their possibilities, driving them to survive. Every scene is crafted with such precision that the viewers feel like they are inside of the scene itself, going through all of the things the characters are going through. This is particularly noticeable in the mole segment of the movie. On the other hand, the sea segment presents the story driven part also depicting most of the acting capabilities of Cillian Murphy and Mark Rylance. The air segment is here to give the movie most of its dynamic, and it does it with such grandeur that it astonishes everyone watching it. The very climax, when all of the three segments come together during the oil scene, is to this point unseen in war movie history. The tension and panic that was created within the characters and how it was transferred to the audience is sheer brilliance.<br/><br/>2) The music. Up to this point Interstellar was considered to be the best Zimmer has ever done due to its time related segments and tempo. But, Dunkirk is by far the darkest and most psychologically challenging soundtrack he has ever done. The tension driving note that is present from the very first scene of the movie until the end credits rolled is ingenious. But, maestro Zimmer created three different themes for the three different segments of the movie that overlay the all present tension note. So, the audience hears simultaneously two different themes: one that creates tension and the other depicting the action present on the screen. It is still unknown if Nolan brings the best out of Zimmer, or is it the other way around, but what ever it is, their collaboration at this point is legendary.<br/><br/>Never before has a movie like this been made. One does not simply see Dunkirk, one feels it in every aspect of his body. All sensations are simultaneously attacked with multiple situations and stories, the tension is present from start to finish, and it is almost completely impossible to find a flaw in this masterpiece. This is a movie that has to bee seen over and over again, as many times possible, in order to capture all of the details it presents, because the shock at first viewing is indescribable.<br/><br/>P.s. I almost forgot. Many new directors and screenwriters should study this movie, because the terror and tension of warfare was depicted without a single drop of blood on the screen!<br/><br/>By far the best this year has offered, and in my opinion the best it could and will offer."
"Rickting","9","2","8","23 August 2017"," One of the best war films of all time
","Dunkirk tells the story of the evacuation of thousands of British soldiers from France following a military disaster. I wasn't looking forward to this particularly. After years of Christopher Nolan being idolized and trivialized by some of the most obnoxious fans on the internet- if you do a negative review of one of his films prepare for cyber-bullying- I have become fed up of hearing about his movies. As well as this, the Dunkirk evacuation didn't seem like a great war story to tell out of all the WWII stories that could have been told. Well, the doubts were wrong. Dunkirk is a technical masterpiece and better than nearly every single major release from 2016. Despite criticism at the lack of character development, for me it worked perfectly. No sentimentality. No weepy moments. No extended dialogue scenes. Here, the events tell the story and the emotional trauma of everything going on, brought to terrifying life by Christopher Nolan at the peak of his powers, are more than enough. Sure, the characters are thin, but they're brought to life by great performances- even Harry Styles is excellent. In terms of virtually every aspect of the film, it's technically masterful, while the non-linear story-telling and focus on people, not explosions, make this a harrowing and emotional experience, as well as a painfully tense one. As a celebration of courage in the face of hopeless circumstances, as a tale of unity, as a suspense thriller, as a historical reconstruction and as a cinematic work in general, Dunkirk is a real triumph. <br/><br/>9/10"
"jamessibley-74433","10","2","8","16 August 2017"," Amazing
","Probably the most gripping movie I have ever seen, there isn't a moment you can sit still and relax. Also what more backstory do you need when it is a true story about the democratic world almost collapsing. The madness of the evacuation was captured perfectly, so powerful and full of emotion."
"preppy-3","9","2","8","10 August 2017"," Visually exciting but emotionally distant.
","Based on fact movie but the war at Dunkirk. British and French soldiers are trapped at Dunkirk waiting to take a ship back to England. However the Germans are doing a non-stop bombing of Dunkirk beach (where the soldiers are) and the ships coming to save them.<br/><br/>Visually this is an impressive movie. The visuals are stunning (especially in IMAX) and the battle sequences are beautifully shot. However there's no emotional involvement with the main characters. You know their names--and that's about it. It's really hard to give a damn if you know nothing about them. I suppose the acting was good but--since they're given nothing to work with--I really couldn't tell.<br/><br/>So visually it's impressive but emotionally cold. Try to see it in IMAX."
"awdboosted95","9","2","8","7 August 2017"," IMAX will get you THERE! Added at least 1 star or 2 here...
","I found the directing here really really good, Nolan kept the audience in pretty much constant tension, that, and the sound coupled with the music were really the high points IMO, all this kept things really tense. The acting was also excellent, cinematography as well, seems the writing was just lagging behind a little as others have touched on due to not getting us more attached to some of the characters and maybe another fault or two.<br/><br/>REALLY enjoyed it overall, the IMAX really helped my seat was shaking at times, the screeching planes were near deafening, and gave a good insight to just how frightening I am sure it sounded for those poor souls. Overall I found the immersion awesome, and like someone mentioned maybe not since Private Ryan have I felt so immersed."
"2001ASOfan","5","2","8","6 August 2017"," ""Dunkirk--The Ride""
","Diving right into the midst of the trapped soldiers at the film's beginning, with only a short on-screen paragraph or so of written explanation of the historical facts behind what we viewers find ourselves experiencing alongside the soldiers and citizens who came to their aid, Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" is more of a pure and simple ""you are there"" experience than I expected. At the end I felt I knew almost nothing of the characters involved: the closing credits make it clear that none of the individual characters portrayed in the film are based on actual soldiers or townspeople who went through the real-life event--they are all fictional. I later read that Nolan based them on composites of real people's stories. He also was quoted as saying he hoped the film would inspire viewers to research the actual people who were there. This left me appreciating the technical skills of the filmmakers involved, but also left me surprisingly uninvolved emotionally. As I exited, I realized I felt like I'd just been on a very long ""Dunkirk--The Ride"" experience at a Universal Studios-like amusement park rather than just having seen a full-length film that fleshed out what the soldiers and townspeople went through. As a ""ride,"" it was too long and bruising: I saw it in a THX large-screen-format house at a multiplex, and you felt the bullets landing and explosions' reverberations from the subwoofers and excellent sound system, but after awhile I found my mind wandering to the technical aspects of that sound work rather than being involved in the film's story progression. Dialogue is almost non-existent, and some of it is lost in the sound mix and unintelligible--probably as intended by Nolan to again give you that ""you are there"" feeling. For me, it was an unsatisfying ride, but I noticed some people in the auditorium applauded at film's end--my gut tells me they likely knew much more of the history of Dunkirk and filled in the blanks left for the rest of us not as well-versed in the history."
"parleon-thedon","7","2","8","30 July 2017"," Dunkirk - Movie Review
","Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors. I will watch anything he makes because he crafts movies that are better than sex. The scope takes my breath away. The music excites me. The visuals are lavish enough without being over the top. However, this is not his best work as far as storytelling is concerned. <br/><br/>For a more in-depth review, check out my video:<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leLEWI5uzfo"
"crimson-17255","9","2","8","30 July 2017"," Something is missing...
","I think a 9/10 suits this movie even though I can't call it a favorite of mine<br/><br/>I decided to check this movie out because it was about a war and the idea of citizens helping out soldiers was interesting to me. However, as soon as I sat in that theatre I was confused. What exactly was the story here? We ended up following a couple people in the movie but none of them could really be called ""the protagonist"". Add to that the point of the movie didn't feel like it was to entertain us, instead it felt like it was trying to say ""this is one of those things that happened at the time, these are the things people did in order to survive, to try and get home"" and so forth<br/><br/>Aside from that I really formed an attachment to certain characters and was SO SAD to see them die. The sounds and panning made it all feel very suspenseful and it added to my feelings for the events and characters<br/><br/>Enjoyed it even though it's a much slower and different kind of movie I watch"
"kanishka713","7","2","8","27 July 2017"," A good movie but not one of the best.
","Dunkirk directed by Christopher Nolan (obviously) starring Fionn Whitehead (debut), Tom Hardy (face covered again!) and Mark Rylance among others is about the Dunkirk evacuation, the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk (hence the name) in France. The extraordinary aspect about this evacuation was the participation of civilians in their small boats who crossed the English Channel to rescue their countrymen.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story from three perspectives the land, sea, and air. It must be noted that the film covers three different time periods in a non- linear fashion – 1 week on land, 1 day at sea and 1 hour in air. This may cause some confusion to viewers. <br/><br/>The movie is fast paced, each scene giving you a healthy dose of Adrenalin. The movie is also realistic with spectacular scenes, which are a visual treat. However the characters lack development and there is hardly any meaningful dialogue. The emotions of the characters are not explored. This means that there is very little emotional connect with the characters. <br/><br/>In conclusion a good film however not one of Nolan's best. Watch it for the spectacular scenes and Adrenalin rush that the movie is sure to bring."
"hiraishinnojutsu","8","2","8","25 July 2017"," Good movies tend to be boring, and emotional.
","Dunkirk is not a kind of movie that the DC/Marvel/Star Wars/Star Trek/Transformers fans are seeking to spend their time and money on cinemas nearby with their loved ones for, as much as realistic as it is on the real battlefield (yet not a single drop of blood spilled, Nolan's style of not wanting to portray any bit of cruelty and sadism, even in this movie, which took place on a battlefield) what makes us so imbibed into the shore with all the desperate British troops is the ever-going background music (It's Hans Zimmer, who do you expect?) which pushes us to feel a little bit uncomfortable, urging us to keep asking in our hearts ""what's going to happen next?"" ""are they all gonna die?"" ""when will the next bombs be dropped?"" ""are they gonna make it home?"". At the beginning of the movie, you may find even the heroes have lost their humankind brotherhood when they're put in this kind of situation in which they're forced to do so (and that's reasonable), but then, some of the brave non-soldiers characters' action will make everyone's faith on humanity restored again. This movie will teach you that victory on the battlefield is not always determined by the number of the dead enemy's soldiers, or the number of the surviving soldiers on our side, or even the numbers of the enemy's territories/forts/headquarters that have fallen, it's more complicated than that! you can murder the entire army of your adversary up to their captains, colonels, warlords/generals, even their kings/presidents/supreme leaders but you still lose the war. The most important thing to put in mind (which is the message of this movie) is that we can still grasp victory in our hands from how many of our friends, brothers, children, grandchildren, fathers that have spent countless days and nights defending our nations, our territories, our idea of truth; freedom; and justice come back to their homes, families, and their loved ones after standing toe-to- toe against the harsh truth of reality of defeat and desperation on the front-line."
"WaelDhouib","7","2","8","25 July 2017"," Technically excellent but careful the story is not character centered.
","It is a Christopher Nolan film. It makes the viewer expect a fascinating experience. <br/><br/>It is a different film from his previous ones. It is not a mystery movie nor a dark superhero movie. This time it is about a battle of war and how soldiers and civilians went through it. There is no major focus on characters as persons but more as equal human beings willing to survive. The substance in the movie is not what you expect from Nolan as we've seen many mind bending films from him.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is not a typical blockbuster film. I find it simple and well made. The CGI is subtle as you might expect with very realistic craft and well made action scenes. It is a very good visual experience.<br/><br/>Excellent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. So different and I really liked it.<br/><br/>Overall, not Nolan's best movie but definitely a good movie."
"sylvestglenn","9","2","8","24 July 2017"," A story to be seen more than once
","Chris Nolan is more than a storyteller; he's a myth-maker. He wants you to experience the Truth of a story – to enter the fabric of a tale and have your perspective altered. To enter the story multiple times and see nuances you hadn't previously seen on prior viewings and have your paradigm shifted again and again with each telling of the myth. He creates a world and asks the viewer to experience the situation, to see what is right before them and engage with that experience, to grapple with the pain, loss, joy, and above all, the Unknown. He expresses his vision, not by providing a bunch of facts and figures or details and extensive dialogue, but through action and rest, through the messy chaos that is life and war, through seeing and feeling the actors' nonverbal communication – to get inside their skin as best we can from our comfortable seats in an air conditioned space. And the actors give us everything we need – from Mr. Dawson's compassion which he has obviously passed on to his son Peter as well as his NEED to go try to save the pilot and Peter's look of understanding, to Tommy's naiveté, weariness, and gentle realism which contrasts with Alex's cocksureness and underlying fear and desperation to Gibson's outright fear and insecurity, but dogged determination. George reminds us what it is like to be on the cusp of life, innocent and hopeful, even though we haven't had any gold stars by our names in the past. Farrier and Collins provide a glimpse of the vagaries of flight and how one ""carries on"" despite the overwhelming circumstances a pilot faces. The shivering soldier reminds us that normal people's minds can break when faced with the horrors of war. Tom Hardy can do more with his eyes and Kenneth Brannagh with a smile than poets can express in sonnets.<br/><br/>And like all myths, Dunkirk can simply be seen as a story, to be liked or disliked, or as Story to be unpacked time after time, allowing ourselves to be engaged and changed with each recitation."
"keegansantiago","9","2","8","24 July 2017"," Another hit from Nolan!
","Dunkirk is one of the most war movies audiences have seen in a long time, it would be considered up to the level of Saving Private Ryan. It is also probably the best WW1 movie ever, Nolan makes that possible because of how he puts in a fair amount of character development that not too much or too little interferes in with the whole situation of the film. Along with the film being a new style of a war movie that it combines features from other genres. This certain style is separating three different scenarios all having to do with Dunkirk. Nolan did a great job not giving this away in the trailers, so it is expected to surprise audiences. Along with doing a good job of transitioning through all the scenarios. Another factor this movie possessed that I enjoyed and appreciated, was that it didn't need to include grisly violence in order to maintain a title as a realistic war movie, as Nolan includes little to no blood at all and shows how the true horrors of war can be displayed without loads of graphic violence/images such as Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge. This was an overall amazing movie with great sound editing, special effects, and Nolan's superb directing skills."
"david-569","1","2","8","23 July 2017"," Nawp... unremarkable.
","Was not thrilled by it.   Should have listened to my gut... that when thou dost protest too much, as in the over amplification of commercials, buzz, pronouncements of grandness, etc... something is amiss.  It was.   Too many clever tricks.  Writing was pedantic.  As historical events being explained during what should have been just normal conversational exchange.  Flashbacks were way too clever-ly exploited.  Too much cleverness.   This epic story did not leave one feeling one was experiencing expanse. This extraordinary historical event that could have changed the world was made, small.  Characters were not really allowed to develop.  Exposition was the ticket, but due to the unevenness of the writing, as in people don't talk like that, it didn't work.  For me at least.  The whole thing had a sense of blocky-ness... as in film this sequence here, film that sequence there... never had a sense of flow.<br/><br/>And the overuse of rah rah historical clichés was that, overused.  If you're going to go for it, go for it. Vamp up a cliché. I don't know how many times ""home"" was used... but fer crissakes, it has to be a build up and culmination of a moment. It never was, each time. Where there should have been moments that swelled up to the sense of grandeur, they were more like deflated balloons.  I was in particular wanting to see the much touted scenes and representations of the Hurricanes and Spitfires.  A lot was made about how this was filmed using different techniques than before.  Yawn.  It would have been far better to utilize real footage of aerial combat.   The air combat was less than interesting.  In large part due to the breaking up of the exposition due to flashbacks.  The expanse of for instance the Heinkel aircraft doing its attack was so unrhythmic, it created far more distraction to flow of those moments in the film. So the aerial scenes were a let down for sure.<br/><br/>And methinks I just nailed what bothered me the most. Felt the writing was poor. But more so felt the sequencing of the scenes jerky, bothersome. One never got the full sense of a scene, and event, because the whole movie attempted to tie itself together through over-cleverness of sequences. Made it very hard to get fully engaged.<br/><br/>A snarky way of saying... I was mostly bored trying to let the flow, flow. There was little flow. The direction attempted to make the story metaphorical. Story flow or metaphor... both failed.<br/><br/>The only character was a father who brought his pleasure boat into the fray.  He was the only one with real moments.  Everything else was unremarkable.  Even the epic-ness of saving 300,000+ men from the shores of Dunkirk was a dud.  They never developed an immense sense of what this was about.  The portrayal of what should have been hundreds of small boats instead of British destroyers was less than remarkable.  Even the officer who was a character meant to provide exposition, Kenneth Branagh, was a yawner.  The story which should have been epic managed to be small, and the dialogue which should have given the actors a sense of epic-ness, or at the least metaphor on a grand scale, managed to create a sense of smallness.  So while am at it... the biggest annoyance was the damned soundtrack. Could not be clearer... the incessant drone of the soundtrack was a huge distraction. Drone is the right word. Loud, pounding, distracting. When you pound away like that, you exhaust the theme and have no where to go. This was repeated, over and over. It grew absolutely tiresome hearing this... made the entire movie which was already uneven in its writing and sequencing, even more distracting. Seriously folks, you have no where to go when one pours in a loud, neverending, repeated theme. You have no where to go. And it got there early on. No bones about it... I hated the soundtrack. It gave distracted support this already difficult to be engaged with film.<br/><br/>OK, this is an unremarkable review but mainly because it was an unremarkable flick.  Had to write it out because I was left disappointed in every aspect.  I so wanted at least the Hurricanes and Spitfires to be cool because I understood they used real vintage planes.  But nawp.  How they managed to make this extraordinary historical event small was a disappointment.  As mentioned, the only real moment was the father and the events with the son.  Give it a 4 out of 10.  And by the way... we went and expected the theater to be packed or at least populated two days after the opening.  Also nawp.  It was spartan.  Not even 10% full.  Says a lot there. Oh well...  wait for it to come out on DVD.  I enjoyed the previews on a big screen far more than the movie which managed to make this extraordinary historical event, small.  Or a better wrap up would be... the film managed to make a remarkable event, unremarkable."

","Visually impressive, well acted and superb sound track. Shooting it on location was brilliant. Much has been written about all of that. While I did really enjoy it there were a few technical things that I wish had been handled better. 1. The AAA on the beach never seemed to be used when the Luftwaffe showed up. Never happened. 2. 300,000 men being moved off the beach in 7 days (or so). Would have required more then a handful of small craft and the occasional minesweeper. I was sorry that this was under represented when the shots of the beach were taken. It would have been nice to get the odd wide shot in there with LOTS of small vessels. Never happened. 3. German Stukas diving on the beach must have sucked. In the movie there were never more than three at a time in the air. I was under the impression that squadrons flew together and 20-30 in the air at a time would be much more likely. Never saw that. <br/><br/>Everything else was great!<br/><br/>Go and see it!"

"pete-murphy97","9","2","8","23 July 2017"," Nolan's WWII Masterpiece
","Christopher Nolan has a backlog of major cinematographic successes, with Dunkirk, he keeps true to his winning streak with a novel, engaging take on the famous WW2 Dunkirk escape from the perspective of the allied forces.<br/><br/>The film takes on the stance of the classical 'Jaws' suspense that we all know. The edge-of-seat anticipation comes from above rather than below: the bombing runs of the axis on allied naval transits brimming with soldiers is a recipe for sheer suspense - Nolan brilliantly capitalized on this unique situation of fragility. <br/><br/>Nolan uses the silver-screen era motif of silence, a powerful tool that brings the audience out of distracting dialogue, and into raw, unhindered audiovisual emotion. The film uses dialogue sparingly, it gives emphasis to no single character, the theme is that everyone is expendable in the face of the looming threat at hand, this works brilliantly and really punctuates the saying 'we're all in the same boat together' <br/><br/>The ranks and regimentation subsides, and we see these men as humans rather than statistical cannon fodder, Nolan makes sure to show us their ravenous hunger, their shell-shocked gazes, and all the trimmings of the brutal wartime circumstance.<br/><br/>While we see so much of the allies, at no one point do we truly see the enemy, we never see the face of the opposition, their threat is elusive and untraceable in that sense; the great sense of unknowing, imposing danger - instead the audience is well and truly embedded in one side of the situation, we are not omniscient spectators, but rather another face among the many - the audience is involved here.<br/><br/>The film follows a very nonlinear structure to complement this sense of unknowing, Nolan teases the audience with the idea of safety, only to rip it away from us soon after, this matches the Dunkirk situation brilliantly - we can never settle throughout, there is never truly an end in sight.<br/><br/>All in all, this captivating entry to the WW2 sphere of film making is a mature, well thought-out and intricately mastered piece of film, an experience not to miss."
"eddie1985","9","2","8","23 July 2017"," Yet another cinematic brilliance with Nolan's stamp all over it from music to cinematography !!
","Dunkirk is an intense war film written and directed by the genius Christopher Nolan. He leaves no stone unturned yet again in generating this masterpiece. Set during the World War II in 1940, it shows the Dunkirk evacuation where 400000 allied English, French, Dutch soldiers were trapped in the beaches and harbors of Dunkirk by German troops. The film is shot from three parts- Mole, Sea, Air covering different periods of time: one beginning on land and covering a week, one on the sea and covering a day and one in the air covering one hour. This is Nolan's style of storytelling where all the is matched in a single narrative. The survival instinct of the lead protagonist Fionn Whitehead is shot brilliantly. Tom Hardy's brilliant work as Royal Air Force pilot taking the enemy down in the sky was shot exceptionally well. The music is thumping with the tickling sound giving you Goosebumps and the shots under water can literally choke you. Not at a single point of time, you will move your eyeballs from the screen. Cinematography is majestic and is surely one of the best film of Nolan.."
"sanjulathish","8","2","8","23 July 2017"," Not Nolans best but its almost there !
","IMO Dunkirk is not Nolans best work, and its not a war movie comparable with saving private Ryan, apocalypse now, Schindler's list etc but ( Nolans best according to me are The Dark Knight, Interstellar, Inception in the order) Dunkirk comes mid of all his movies.<br/><br/>We could not witness Nolan brilliance in this movie, mainly due to its based on history and there is not much u can change or involve Nolan's mind bending theories. but he still manages to use different time line to perfection so that all comes to fruition in an awe inspiring conclusion of the movie. <br/><br/>The main thing that made this an excellent engaging drama/thriller is due to the ambiance the movie creates, and its mind blowing. There is a scene halfway around where a fighter planes gets crashed onto the sea, the sound of the engine, the propeller , and the way the wings gets hold off on the water... it did make me go oooph (that was amazing). The bombing scenes, the drowning scenes, and the sound of the bullet ( Oh man). and visual aspect of the Dunkirk is something that should be given special mention to Nolan for staying with 2D rather than going with money grabbing 3D ones. For me 2D is the best.<br/><br/>Nolans direction + Hanz Zimmers as music director has always produced gems and it will continue to do so. He has also created one here too. you should watch this in theaters to understand the true beauty of it. it was breathtaking sometimes. <br/><br/>Acting wise everyone has done a brilliant job, special mention to Fionn Whitehead he has done a marvelous job of portraying a soldier who is trying to get home. harry styles was good, tom hardy as usual great. Kenneth Branagh,Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy did good.<br/><br/>I didn't rate Dunkirk as Nolan's best work was mainly because i expected more, and a pure satisfaction was lacking for me and we couldn't see the true potential of Nolan here. maybe because it was a movie based on history rather than going with sci-fi or hero level story's where he could add his own imagination in to fore. But its still a great one,it has its moments and effect. But to me its not the greatest war movie, and to me that is still Saving private Ryan (how anyone could compare Dunkirk to SVP, i don't understand.)<br/><br/>PS: Watch it in theaters for the whole experience."
"freedmv","8","2","8","23 July 2017"," Two movies in one: first half = WAR, second half = PROPAGANDA
","I came to see this movie with very low expectations after Inception and Interstellar, those in my opinion are amazingly good in the visual and technical areas, but a disaster character and plot wise. Did i like this movie?<br/><br/><ul><li>Short answer: Yes!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Long answer: I will divide the review between the two halves of the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>The first hour of the movie is one of the best movies of the year. In here one of Nolan's most criticized defect, sketchy character definition, its, in my opinion, something that help the narration in order to immerse the viewer in the historical event the movie is about, the Dunkirk evacuation disaster of the WW2. War has no characters, the people that fight and die in the fields of Belgium and France in the WW2 are just regular, faceless people, in here, the less we know about the characters, the better, since we can empathize with them as if we were living that same experience. And that is one of the major wins of this movie, the first hour of this movie is one action scene after the other, chained, without time to rest or just breath, of what it feels like real war. We cannot see the enemy, the battle is already lost, there is no escape, there are no friends or heroes, people are just fighting to survive. The message is clear: War manufacture just survivors and misery. Nolan master direction here, action is tense, the music fits just perfect (those accelerates heartbeats helps us to feel the stress of the soldiers) and we can feel the pessimism on all the futility escape attempts. It kind of feels like Kubrick's 'Full metal jacket', the message is clear, there are no heroes, war is the perfect terrain where the human misery flourishes. I watch this movie in 70mm and DTS audio, and i must say, this is one of the most impressive experiences of the year, you are just right there on the beach.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie, when the rescue mission is assembled and put on practice. I know this is an historical event so there aren't real spoilers, but i don't want to write anything about the plot. The first half show us how the war produces survivors, but in this part it tries to convince us that war also produces heroes. I cannot agree with that, heroes are manufactured by humans, those are propaganda product to drive the moral up, those who appear in the newspapers or the radio speeches as heroes are just people that tried to survive using any questionable or immoral method in hand. This part of the movie just feels like a generic Michael Bay movie, we have a bunch of heroes that will crush the enemy due their sacrifice and heroism. It is not fitting with the first part of the movie, and the script is quite fragile in order to justify the heroism of the characters.<br/><br/>In general the movie is worthy and is one of the best works of Nolan. Just for the first hour, go to the theater and enjoy."
"eparazak","9","2","8","22 July 2017"," An intense point in history during WWII as told by Christopher Nolan
","Dunkirk is the latest movie from the critically acclaimed director Christopher Nolan. Simply put, it is a true story about the evacuation of thousands of allied soldiers while they're being attacked by the German army.<br/><br/>One of the most important things to note is that the movie's focus, aside from the first and last few minutes, is entirely dedicated to the evacuation. The little bits of dialogue, the score, the shots, everything is dedicated to that. That is this movie's strength, but also brings a minor flaw to the table. As such, there is very little dialogue, which helps set the mood for the war. The movie was also very well acted and well shot. My favorite aspect of the movie, however, has to be the score done by Hans Zimmer. For a war movie, he does an outstanding job with making the tone of the music sound just right; not too upbeat or mellow, but just fitting enough for an intense evacuation. The weakness of the movie? The characters. The characters are very lacking and extremely forgettable. They so forgettable that the only one I remembered was the captain. The only thing I could remember about the soldiers was that one of them was that one of them was played by Harry Styles for some reason.<br/><br/>It's kind of hard to critique a movie about a nonfiction event when you're not incredibly knowledgeable about the movie's subject, in this case, World War II. As such, it's hard to determine whether the movie's portrayal is accurate or not. With that being said, I went in blindly and I feel like I gained some knowledge on the Battle of Dunkirk.<br/><br/>9/10"
"breheneyjames","7","2","8","22 July 2017"," An intense, immersive and thrilling experience.
","This is a very different film from the rest of Christopher Nolan's filmography thus far in that it is based on historical events namely the evacuation of Dunkirk in WW2. Nevertheless, he still finds an effective way to use his signature non-linear story structure and here divides it into three time periods; one week, one day and one hour. Each corresponding to the perspectives of land, sea and air respectively.<br/><br/>On land we have two soldiers played by newcomers Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles along with a whole host of other soldiers trying to escape the beach and moving from ship to ship as they are attacked in doing so. At sea we have three civilians lead by Mark Rylance on a small pleasure boat trying to save as many stranded soldiers as possible. In the air we have two RAF pilots in spitfires played by Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden dog-fighting with German planes.<br/><br/>The technical achievements in this film are astonishing from the stunning cinematography to the brutally realistic sound design to the harrowing score. Hans Zimmer will most definitely be nominated by the Academy for his work here and will most likely win.<br/><br/>Nolan decided to shoot as much of this film in camera as possible and it is very telling given the impressive practical effects present in the film from the real ships to the real RAF spitfires to the real pleasure boats from that era to actually shooting on location in Dunkirk.<br/><br/>The action scenes are incredibly intense and visceral and very well directed. The aerial dogfights are often shown from the viewer's POV making them subjective and immersive. This leads to a thrilling and goose-bump inducing experience throughout.<br/><br/>The actors give fine performances all round despite the fact that none of them have many lines. This film is very much about the event of Dunkirk, which is appropriate given the title, and not so much about individual characters per se. But this is where the film falters for me. There is no emotional anchor. No memorable characters and it is rather jarring.<br/><br/>Other than that, it is a superbly effective survival thriller and I can see it getting an abundance of nominations and wins come awards season."

","""I am truly blessed to have lived the era of Sir Christopher Nolan and his works of art"". Today, I added yet another reason to saying that sentence to my kids one day, when I watched his war stunner - Dunkirk.<br/><br/>The movie has a spectacular plot that gets you right at the edge of your seat, together with its on-point cinematography, they make the movie what I believe it is. In my humble opinion, it has surpassed the other war classics in the likes of Saving Private Ryan and the newly released Hacksaw Ridge.<br/><br/>Let's not forget about the characters' performances and spotlights. Every and each part of the story owns its share of leading characters, which is actually Chris' first work where the plot doesn't point towards a single character. Each character (even the minor roles) received its appropriate amount of spotlight which was a challenge Chris has excelled over the years.<br/><br/>Additionally, the soundtrack. Oh, the soundtrack! What makes a memorable soundtrack is its coherence with the the current scene and the plot as a whole. Check and check! I mean it wasn't the ""classic"" Hans Zimmer work like Inception's or Interstellar's, but it's there among the greats.<br/><br/>On the other side, the movie's slow pace at the introduction can be one of the minor note-worthy problems I have faced at the theatre; however, the pace gradually picked up to a great adrenaline-filled degree towards the end.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy.<br/><br/>All in all, Dunkirk isn't just a movie, it's a major experience that you have to experience at the theatre, because what this guy can put on screen with the visuals and even the sound makes it a must-see destination."

"Cameronius_113","8","2","8","21 July 2017"," One of the most ambitious films of the year
","Dunkirk was released in 2017 and was directed by Christopher Nolan. The film is a representation of the events that occurred in Dunkirk during the second World War when hundreds of thousands of British soldiers were trapped on the island's beaches whilst waiting for help to come.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan is a director well-known in the filmmaking industry today for being very ambitious and making films huge in scope; this film is a prime example. The film never tries to change itself to suit another audience or sub-genre and sticks to its own agenda of telling the story of the events that actually went down and how they occurred, which is why some audience members may not be huge fans of this film.<br/><br/>The film isn't like most other war films such as Saving Private Ryan which incorporate many drama elements into them to make a more involving story; this film chooses to focus on the scale of the event rather than focusing on the characters of the film, focusing on characters being typically what most war films do and how the situation they are in is affecting them. The characters of this film are not a big part and there isn't much dialogue in the film either, which may put off some audience members for not being able to connect with characters. However, I do very much appreciate the fact that the film was never overly-dramatised or included needless exposition for the characters as they are not the focal point of the film, which is the main thing that sets this film apart from other war films I have seen.<br/><br/>As I've mentioned multiple times, the film is very ambitious in showing the scale of this event: the film has three different story lines occurring simultaneously (one on land, one on sea, one on air) which helps to show how the event affected many more than just the soldiers stranded on the island. Also, the film is visually fantastic as well as the sound too; every single time a bullet shot or a plane flew by, I as an audience member felt in the moment of what had happened. The music in the background also added to the intensity of the film, one notable part of the score was a clock ticking throughout which added to the sense of urgency in each scene. There never really is a second in the film where anything stops to take a breath.<br/><br/>What I appreciated the most about Dunkirk was how it was rather experimental in parts, and has tried things that many other war films have never done before. The fact that the event itself was chose as the focal point was the key to creating an immersive cinematic experience and it was an ""experiment"" that overall proved to be very effective. It never turns over to show the political side to the story or add unnecessary character drama as, as Nolan himself as stated, it would ""make the film bogged down"" so it never felt over-crammed or messy, which is something difficult to avoid when telling a story with multiple aspects and sides to it. Thankfully the film wasn't overly long either, having a runtime of just 105 minutes when compared to other films of Nolan's such as The Dark Knight Rises (which has a runtime of around 165 minutes) and therefore it never dragged on or felt stretched out or boring.<br/><br/>Overall, Dunkirk is a film that may not be appealing to most audience members due to it taking a risk in its focal point, however I very much appreciated a change in style and this is a war film that I will definitely always remember and hopefully others will too. I would highly recommend this film, however only to the right audience.<br/><br/>8.1/10"

","Dunkrik a movie to be re-watch, but only on theaters. Why? Because is a movie of emotion, the way Christopher Nolan made this movie is just brilliant. I didn't watch on Imax, but one thing is for sure. I was in the movie, I felt like I was in the war. Is a movie with little dialogue, but what really matter is the expressions of people, you can fell the fear, the disturbance, the excitement. All the emotions that you have in the war, is in the movie. But it was one thing that I was uncomfortable, was the sound, it was really loud, but I thing that was the point. To end, Christopher Nolan, for me, made a great job with this movie."
"jeroen-de-wever","9","2","9","10 November 2019"," Excellent film but probably not for everyone
","What is important to know before watching this movie, and might explain some of the extremely low scores, is that this is not a standard movie. Don't expect character build-up and a plot with twists and turns. This is done on purpose. It is very obvious that Nolan did not want to make a new ""Saving Private Ryan"". Comments referring to the lack of these elements or a lack of emotional involvement with characters, seem to have had the wrong expectations.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a powerful, excellent depiction of how chaotic and demoralising war can be and yet at the same time it manages to offer that glimmer of hope. It shows how different people and personalities are impacted by a hopeless situation. Nolan on purpose does not use names for characters, reflecting the large number of anonymous soldiers that have died. The different viewpoints and time-jumps are meant to make you feel a bit of the chaos. Above all he clearly wanted to give the viewer a feel on the action and despair and not tell an emotionally developed story on a heroic rescue action. On top of this all, the cinematography is just amazing. I do not know any movie that has been able to capture pilot fights with this amount of action and suspense. It actually felt like time flew by with all the action and pacing.<br/><br/>If you view this movie in the right context and keep in mind what Nolan is trying to do, then this is simply an amazing piece of film."

","Yes, OK another film about the second World War However the film leaves the melodrama aside, and creates such a ruthless clipping of events as the war itself.

It is the psychological terror that dominates the action.<br/><br/>Of course, this rather melodramatic portrait of the theme directly influences how the characters are presented.<br/><br/>What seems confusing at first is quickly assimilated, and makes the actions even more exciting.<br/><br/>The great responsible for this dramatic progression is the soundtrack, which in the works of Christopher Nolan is always a spectacle apart. Fleeing from the obvious, he works with silences and repetitions that create the atmosphere of despair and tension proper to the context of war.<br/><br/>War film lovers?! This is a MUST!!

"poisonivy-25023","8","2","9","26 July 2017"," 10 Pros and Cons for seeing & not worth seeing 'Dunkirk'.
","Pro: <br/><br/>1. The movie has an interesting way in telling the battle, through three perspectives- land, sea and air. It gives the film, a unique blend of stories that mix different types of combat, into one film.<br/><br/>2. The movie really does use the 'Show, Don't Tell' approach. The film nearly contain no dialogue, in order to create suspense solely through visuals by cinematographer, Hoyte Van Hoytema.<br/><br/>3. I love the tension between the characters on the boat. You really don't know, what the shell-shocked soldier would do. By far, the most suspenseful part of the film. It kinda remind me of 1944's 'Lifeboat' in certain parts.<br/><br/>4. Wonderfully shot in locations in Dunkirk. Hoyte Van Hoytema really does know, how to frame the camera to make it, look somewhat epic.<br/><br/>5. For the most part, all the acting in the film, was good. Just wish, they gave more material for the actors to use. Some characters seem, a bit shallow and one-dimensional.<br/><br/>6. I love how the film doesn't use flashy or gory effects to get the audience to fear war. Instead, it tries a different approach, by using the fear of claustrophobia.<br/><br/>7. I love that Nolan and his crew didn't use, much or any computer graphics, in favor, for more practical, traditional special effects.<br/><br/>8. Nolan use, three different styles of camera shots for each sequence, with crane & steady cam for the land, hand-held for the sea, and a mixed of both, for the air.<br/><br/>9. Love, how the enemy is barely seemed. It makes for an interesting watch, as you really don't know, when and where, somebody is trying to kill you.<br/><br/>10. A world war film produce by Americans, not told through the eyes of American soldiers. It's rare to see, a modern day war film like that. The last one, I can remember, was 2006's ""Letter of Iwo Jima'. Both were amazing.<br/><br/>Con:<br/><br/>1. The movie's three perspectives- land, sea and air, can be a bit gimmicky, and confusing. Edits could be a little better. Night shots interwoven, with day shots were a bit jarring. Figuring out, what time, every event is happening is also a headache. Non-linear narrative, just doesn't work for a historic real-life event.<br/><br/>2. The movie 'Show, Don't Tell' approach left too much of a vague message to the film. I really couldn't get invested in any of the characters, because we hardly knew them. Some characters seem, a bit shallow and one-dimensional.<br/><br/>3. I believe the movie could had work better, if they show, more of the good side of the three main characters, rather than them, also cowardly about. It's OK to have them, try to escape by any means, but at least, have them fight, a little for it.<br/><br/>4. The music score by composer, Hans Zimmer was disappointing. I felt that, he wasn't use, right. Nolan, instead, of making a large emotional driven piece, chose to make a quiet soundtrack, full of clocks, ticking, and little of anything else. <br/><br/>5. The lack of blood and language was a bit odd, seeing how this is a realistic war-movie. They really could had push the limited with, what PG-13 can bring them. Instead, the film, felt a little safe.<br/><br/>6. Too much, fictional characters, not enough depictions of real-life characters, whom were, honestly there.<br/><br/>8. The film could had use historian Joshua Levine's 2011 book, 'Forgotten Voices of Dunkirk', which is a collection of firsthand accounts that are both humorous and tragic, a lot better. The film was not funny, nor sad enough to carry over, after leaving the theater.<br/><br/>9. In truth, the small boats of Dunkirk didn't leave much of an impact, as the film makes it, out to be. In short, most of the men, left, Dunkirk in larger vessels.<br/><br/>10. Movie is not really worth watching in 3D. Much of the shots, are very standard to a normal movie. Save money by watching in 2D."

","The basic story need not be recounted. The movie trys to capture the reality of the situation, in the same way 'Saving Private Ryan' brought the carnage in Normandy to the screens. It was very different to the old Ealing films.<br/><br/>The silence on the long strand, the desperation of those taking any chance to escape is done well in the 110 minutes allocated.<br/><br/>While I only watch drama's where women earn 50% of the money, I made an exception for this film.<br/><br/>The German air-force don't come out of this well, bombing hospital ships etc.<br/><br/>Perhaps the UK needs this, with the upcoming Brexit drama.<br/><br/>The young actors were exceptional, particularly Barry Keoghan and Jack Lowden. To stand out in this cast was commendable. Harry Styles seems to have a disproportionate number of lines but judging from the cinema, no One Direction fans followed him to buy tickets.<br/><br/>Certainly Winston Churhill wrote the best lines in the movie and possibly, most of them!"
"bronzebong","9","2","9","24 July 2017"," A bold, visionary film from already esteemed filmmaker
","This may be the least Nolan-esque movie I've ever seen. He breaks many of his conventional styles for a less conventional ""Nolan"" movie. The plot is simplistic due mostly to his dedication to tell the story of a real event, something he's never done before. The storytelling is not complex, and is pretty much straightforward throughout. There is no magnificent reveal at the end of the film or jaw-dropping twist. This may be a turnoff for some, as many walk into a Nolan movie expecting the aforementioned things, which he does the complete opposite of. This is not a war epic, such as the likes of Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge. Instead, it is a quiet film, one we've never really seen the likes of. Nolan keeps his standard of breaking genre conventions. Films like The Dark Knight and Memento broke the conventions of the superhero and mystery genres. He creates a type of war/historical film not concentrated on the characters the war affects directly, but instead about the war itself. The characters are mostly unnamed, developed very little, and the dialogue is sparse. There is no cliché moment where the characters talk about their wife and children back at home, or their home that was bombed, simply because there is no time for that; the danger of Dunkirk was present at every moment. He also tells this story in a different way then we are used to seeing in war films. It is not really non-linear as the events aren't happening out of order like in Memento. More like he shows us many things happening at once in different locations, and in the end they come together beautifully like pieces in a puzzle. Tom Hardy's dogfights in the air, to Cillian Murphy's fear of returning to Dunkirk, to the terror of the soldiers on the beach. By doing this, he creates a wholly immersive story. We don't know much about the characters but we feel what they feel, which is a hard feat to master. The most influencing character in the story would be in my opinion cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, who shines throughout the entire movie. It is also hard to point out one specific protagonist, which is alright in this case. We feel for the characters all equally. There is no single person with questionable morals like in all other Nolan movies, and no real emotional arc for any of them, except for the boy George. We learn from his past life that he feels like he does not do well in school, and one day wishes to see his name in the local paper. In an effort to change things, he wants to be a help in the war by joining the retired veteran and his son to save downed pilots. He dies in the battle tragically, and is labeled a war hero in the newspaper at the end. Tom Hardy shines in his role as the leading pilot of the air force we are shown. He communicates so many emotions with just his eyes, as he did in The Dark Knight Rises, and proves himself again to be one of the best actors working today. And of course I don't need to say how great the special (in Nolan's case, practical) effects are in this movie. Real ships sink, real explosions rock the audience. Nothing looks out of place or not authentic, which immerses us in the moment even more. Zimmer's score once again is fantastic. He doesn't compose melodic lines, and it would be easier to describe the soundtrack as more of sound design, which fits the movie. War is not melodic, it is jumbled. He has shown again he is a master at creating music specifically for the type of movie, like in The Dark Knight, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Interstellar. The only flaws I felt were in this movie were the intro and the second act. I felt the text explaining the events that happened at Dunkirk was really unnecessary and detracted us from the five soldiers in the beginning of the film. I also felt the second act dragged a lot, as it was mostly filler for the magnificent third act and finale. It is definitely in contention for Oscar season, perhaps for direction, cinematography, sound design and score. To say this film is boring would be like saying films such as 2001 or Taxi Driver are also boring. Maybe these films are quiet and slow, but there is an underlying brilliance to them. ""All good art is something greater than it admits."""
"eabra48463","8","2","9","24 July 2017"," Well-Crafted and Acted, Unapologetic War Movie
","""Dunkirk"" is a powerful and uncompromising war movie. Christopher Nolan presents a hard-hitting account of ""Operation Dynamo,"" the evacuation of Allied soldiers from France while the German military pounded the French army on the doorstep. Films like this hit the mark when they successfully pull their audience into the fray, making us feel the pain and desperation of those on the screen. ""Dunkirk"" does just this and it does so without apologies and without sappy warm-hearted scenes geared to placate the masses. This film is dark, claustrophobic, loud and nerve racking--often at the same time. The dialogue is minimal, yet the message is communicated clearly and effectively. This is one of the better recent Hollywood productions of any genre."
"dsphipps100","8","2","9","22 July 2017"," Fabulous Production with Little Historical Context
","If I were to sum up Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" with one word, there is no question that it would be, ""Wow"". Among war movies, this one surely takes its place among such greats as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Platoon"", and ""Full Metal Jacket"" – although I'm not quite prepared to put it on the same level as ""Schindler's List"" (if that absolutely shattering masterpiece can be viewed as a war movie, that is).<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" started on its first release day at an astounding 9.0 on IMDb, but by the time of this writing, it has come down to a (probably) more reasonable 8.x. (I gave it an 8 myself.) I'm not going to give away any plot points, but then, for those of you who are familiar with the events of Dunkirk and its ultimate role in World War 2, there's really not much to give away, regardless. (For those of you who are not familiar with Dunkirk's place in history, I strongly urge you to look it up on Wikipedia or some other source and educate yourself about it. I would even urge this BEFORE you see the movie, because understanding its place in history will only increase the movie's impact for you.)<br/><br/>But to get to my review of the movie: The reason I ""only"" gave it an 8 is because, for all the fabulous execution and production quality that is a hallmark of every Christopher Nolan movie, I did not get a sense from the movie of the absolutely critical role that the Dunkirk evacuation had on the eventual outcome of World War 2, which is still the seminal event that shaped the world as we know it today.<br/><br/>If the Dunkirk evacuation had not taken place and/or succeeded, then suffice to say everybody in the UK would probably be speaking German today, and the USA would be only one of a cluster of somewhat dominant powers around the world – certainly not the singularly preeminent superpower that we have become since then. Yes, Dunkirk was really, truly THAT important and critical, even if it didn't seem so at the time.<br/><br/>Nolan seems to have set all this aside, however, and chosen to focus instead on the immediate stories of those who were stranded on the beaches, trying desperately to find a way to get across the English Channel to the ostensible safety (?) of the British isles.<br/><br/>The movie is (thankfully?) not as bloody as ""Saving Private Ryan"", but irrespective of this, in telling those stories, Nolan certainly and without question powerfully succeeds at giving us the sense of you-are-there-and-your-life-is-in-imminent-peril along with the soldiers. We feel the unrelenting combination of hopelessness, terror, and desperation that were surely rampant on Dunkirk's beaches as the Luftwaffe casually used the long lines of soldiers waiting their turn to be evacuated as target practice.<br/><br/>Most viewers would probably not consciously realize this, but the one single element that contributed (for me, anyway) to these relentless feelings was Hans Zimmer's score, even more than what was visually taking place on the screen. In my experience, this is easily the most nerve-wracking, uncomfortable-to-hear Zimmer score that I have encountered. And it's obvious that this is precisely what he had in mind.<br/><br/>There is not one single melody anywhere that I could hear. The whole thing is nearly endless, omnipresent tonal/sonic ambiance. And this ambiance is usually characterized by morphing clusters of dissonance interspersed with nervously tapping/knocking rhythms that will subconsciously refuse to let you relax at any point, just as the soldiers on the beaches could never truly relax. <br/><br/>Then, when the next Luftwaffe plane appears out of the clouds and begins another strafing/bombing run, the music roars up into a thunderous mass of atonality that surely evokes the soldiers' sense of impending death with devastating effectiveness. There were people around me in the audience who were visibly gripping their armrests and tensing up off of their seats during these parts, as Zimmer's score gave us a sense that the planes were coming for US, not just some esoteric character on the screen.<br/><br/>So to sum up, Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" does a fabulously effective job of conveying what it was probably like to be on those beaches and what it felt like to get away – for those who did. But if you're looking for a movie to put the Dunkirk evacuation into an overall historical context, then this is not it."
"gazmar62","10","2","9","22 July 2017"," Dunkirk - simply brilliant ! Nolan does it again ! genius ! Heart pumping stuff from start to finish.
","What I like about Christopher Nolan is he doesn't insult the audience's intelligence , The timeline and focus of Dunkirk is split into 3 points of view ; LAND, AIR and SEA and although it needs your attention the non linear flashbacks and forwards to each POV are a complex intertwining way of showing the story from those 3 perspectives, some might prefer a chronological order but I think that would lose the 3 element POV. On LAND we follow a small band of soldiers for the longest time period and their attempts to get back to England amongst the hundreds of thousands of men waiting to be rescued from the Dunkirk beaches. On the SEA we focus on one day and one of the small boats that ventures out from a small harbour to get across the dangerous waters of the English channel. In the AIR we have the perspective of a couple of Spitfire pilots where their timeline lasting one hour or more accurately until their mission fuel lasts. This really is an epic 'event' film, the way this historic event is portrayed is second to none, there's a real sense of drama and desperation about the how the soldiers try to get back home to just survive on the beach and on the limited ships trying their best to evacuate them. The spitfire pilots are on the clock, they can only stay in the air for as long as their fuel allows and you feel that clock ticking away with every scene from the sky. Of the flotilla at sea we only see one out of the hundreds of boats involved in this momentous rescue mission, but again this isn't about too much character development, it's there to show us a snippet in the lives of ordinary people coming to the aid of a national disaster not ignoring the obvious danger but accepting it needs to be done. The individual character / actor performances are never too big to overshadow the event as a whole. Tom Hardy is fantastic as one of the 2 spitfire pilots that we see and is very much on the job in hand in an almost routine way, he is not trying to be a hero he is just doing the best he can. Newcomers Fionn Whitehead and even Harry Stiles show they have plenty of acting talent and deserve to be alongside some great veteran actors like Kenneth Brannagh, Mark Rylance and Cillian Murphy, who all put in great performances. Come Oscar / awards season I would expect a few best supporting actor nominations. Another aspect of the film I really like is the lack of dialogue, especially at the start of the film , this really allows for the scene to be set and triggers our pulses racing. Hans Zimmer as ever provides a truly atmospheric and great score that adds immensely to the mounting tension that we experience throughout the film. Nolan never disappoints me with spectacular visuals and here again we see some large scale scenes that are of the best ever war film cinematography I can think of. There is plenty of action mixed in with moments of tranquillity, the calm before the storm the harrowing fight for survival in the face of adversity. As I left the theatre I couldn't help but overhear peoples comments of 'wow, what a great and powerful film' I couldn't agree more ! such a must see film, I will be going to see it again next week on the iMax screen, I already rank this as my top film of the year with another viewing I can easily imagine this becoming my favourite film of the 21st century so far."

"tm19","9","2","9","21 July 2017"," One of the best, and a must-see on IMAX
","This is one of the best war movies ever, and this is coming from a huge fan of the classics going back to The Dam Busters (1955), 633 Squadron (1964), and Battle of Britain (1969). And by saying that I don't mean to celebrate violence, or revel in ""our team"" winning. After all, this is Dunkirk. It is, like Waterloo, the definition of defeat.<br/><br/>Sure, there is plenty of violence, but no one in this movie is smiling vindictively as he pulls the trigger. The troops cheer, but it is for their own team. Their team is losing, and with 20/20 hindsight, you know what is at stake: crippling injuries, death, or years behind a barbed-wire fence. With every glimmer of hope, you can't help but cheer along.<br/><br/>Unlike the old classics, there are no heroes who ""save the day"" in every scene. There are no Trevor Howards, Michael Redgraves, or Cliff Robertson's to take names and kick butts. Sure, there is star power in Kenneth Branagh as the Navy Commander, and James D'Arcy as the Army Colonel. There is Mark Rylance, who owns one of the many ""little ships of Dunkirk."" But in every other respect, this is about the individual survivor. Everyone - from lowly private, to nurse, to downed fighter pilot - just wants to get home.<br/><br/>Even the old classics would be hard pressed to compete with the realism of Dunkirk. How many of those Spitfires were CGI and how many were real? It was hard to tell, even on the big screen. I found myself pulling almost as much for the beautiful (and now rare) machines as I did for the men who flew them. The experience is immersive and compelling, although the special effects never get in the way.<br/><br/>The clever time-line is, perhaps, the only obvious concession to modern movie making. Actually, there are three time-lines. Helpfully, we are told at the beginning what they will be. As those time-lines intersect, we get to watch pivotal scenes from multiple perspectives. It's not hard to follow.<br/><br/>I got to see this on the only IMAX screen in New Zealand. It was a privilege. Shot in 70mm film, the detail is amazing. The IMAX format is closer to the old 4:3 aspect ratio, but you get see everything at once, from expansive beaches to rolling waves to foreboding skies. I'm sure the movie will be fine on regular movie screens, but the experience will be different. In the end, this movie is all about the experience."
"pere-25366","9","2","9","20 July 2017"," A harrowing film of Hitchcockian suspense and epic proportions
","Christopher's Nolan latest film see him taking aspects we've seen him employ in his other films combined to make what might be his most mature feature to date. It combines the sheer scope we've seen in films like ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" with the structurally fascinating elements that make up those like ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige"". ""Dunkirk"" excites the senses with its ever-intensifying energy and is relentless in its barbaric portrayal of young men at war. It will, quite literally, shake you to the core.<br/><br/>The story of ""Dunkirk"" depicts the dramatic and real-life story of the Dunkirk evacuations occurring between May 26-June 4 in the spring of 1940. During this time, frequent rescue attempts of nearly 400,000 allied soldiers from Belgium, France and the British Empire were continually foiled due to being totally surrounded and cornered by the German Army at the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk, France.<br/><br/>The film is split into three different parts: Those that are told 1. On land 2. In air and 3. At sea, though each part of the narrative is unified by a common theme: these fighters, who are all merely young men, are here to live another day, not to get to know each other. It's unique as a war drama in the sense that its purpose isn't character exposition but collective emotions, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. There is little dialogue between characters and so the question isn't: ""Who are these men?"" but rather ""Will they get out alive?""<br/><br/>Much like Memento, Nolan's themes of confusion, uncertainty and a persistent feeling of paranoia are in full throttle. The young soldiers appear in full survival mode and the directive choice by Nolan to not to delve too deep into any of their backstories (which he will likely receive backlash for) is fully understood. Let me quickly explain why.<br/><br/>Nolan has created an atmospheric narrative, where the anguish is felt collectively in a mass effect sort of way, I think. To establish character development with any specific soldier would be superfluous and so the viewer, like the soldiers amidst battle, feels a complete lack of personalization. Or rather, the dehumanizing effects of war are made that much more vivid.<br/><br/>Nolan's big-scale epic filmmaking (that would make David Lean proud) is a real joy with this film and has never been so evident. His avoidance of CGI and special effects make the war scenes seem as grounded as possible, presented in such a horrifyingly vivid and unapologetically realistic manner. To witness these scenes in a theater is to completely immerse yourself into the action.<br/><br/>Couple this with yet another epic score from Hans Zimmer and you're left with an experience that hammers home the horrors of the war in such a visceral way that it has to be considered up there (already) with some of the all-time great war films like ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalypse Now"". In typical Nolan-fashion, we have been given yet another unique and engrossing interpretation on a genre and we couldn't be more thankful."
"AndrewArseneau","9","2","9","20 July 2017"," An immersive, unexpected experience.
","Dunkirk relentlessly thrusts you into the experience of desperation in war. The sound design is invasive and brutal. The score is minimal and uncomfortable at times. It is difficult to relate to any of the characters. There are no real standout performances. The non-linear use of time keeps you off-balance. All of these things that would mostly ruin any other movie, are what make Christopher Nolan's historical war piece absolutely brilliant. <br/><br/>This is not Inception or The Dark Knight. There will be many who do not like this film, which is totally understandable. I left the theater unsure of how I felt myself. I went in possibly expecting a cerebral story with a few twists and turns but left without a real sense of clarity. At first, I thought I must have missed something. I kept playing through some of the scenes in my head, and it was already difficult to play out where they took place within the film, mere minutes after the film ended. I think that is all part of the experience.<br/><br/>This film does have signature Nolan style in its cinematography and scale. It's beautifully shot and there are striking scenes. This film is definitely intended for the IMAX format in its scale. That being said, the biggest and most towering part of this film is the sound design. Its uncomfortably loud and jarring. It is one aspect that truly makes you feel like you are in the same desperate situation as the soldiers on the screen. And there are so many soldiers on the screen, mostly indistinguishable from one another. We are given more time with a select few characters, but we are not given much character development at all. I think that is okay. <br/><br/>There is not much dialogue at all. None of the performances really shine in a big way.That is not to say this film is poorly acted. They were intended to be subtle performances and I think the cast succeeded brilliantly. This film is not about how an individual character experiences this battle. Its about the battle itself and how we as an audience experience it. <br/><br/>There are no big war hero moments. There is no one ""hero"" of this film. Rather, in the midst of all of the horror and desperation, we are given these little moments of heroism. Its not ""guns-a- blazing"" heroism, but personal, human moments of people doing the right thing. The littlest acts among such a vast, harsh landscape of survival gave me great hope that was desperately needed in the experience. They are beautiful when they happen. <br/><br/>The action is not filled with CGI explosions. It all feels real, as I would expect with a Christopher Nolan film, especially one with a historical context. It feels as though all of the effects were caught in camera. This is a PG-13 war movie, so there aren't scenes full of dismembered limbs in pools of blood, but there are intense, painful moments. In fact, a lot of the action is almost claustrophobic at times. It felt real. Everything about this film felt fully immersive. <br/><br/>Nolan plays with time in interesting ways in this film. It threw me off and made me feel like I was missing something. This could be seen as a flaw to the picture, and I would totally understand that perspective. I wrestle with that myself. However, upon further thought, think it is just another layer to the immersion. It keeps me from having any real sense of what is going on around me besides the immediate, thunderous sounds of danger. <br/><br/>There is a lot to digest in this deceptively complicated film. Its a beautiful picture meant for the big screen, and more importantly, powerful sound systems. I think this will prove to be one of Nolan's most divisive films. I totally understand why people will walk away disappointed, but I also understand why people will consider it a masterpiece. For now, I side closer to calling it a masterpiece after considering its intentions and the creativity Nolan employed to achieve them. We'll see if that changes as I continue to chew on Dunkirk. I give it a 9 out of 10."
"Nolabrams","9","2","9","20 July 2017"," Dunkirk is a visual and emotional experience that will take the gasp out of you. Period.
","This is an experience like no other. Powerful imagery and emotional symbolism made one almost weep, because the scope of this war-epic is phenomenally crafted. It's a dark film for sure, but it serves as a glimpse of light over and over, with a forever returning theme of truthfulness to humanity. This, combined with the realism and empathetic feel to the setting that C Nolan masterfully has achieved – will make even the dullest being emotional.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is very different from Nolan's previous achievements, mainly due to the very lack of character inside through dialogs. But, amazingly, we can still relate and understand their thinking through the surreal events and clever filmmaking. The scope is real. You feel the seriousness. You feel trapped, just like the young soldiers. This is done almost without any dialogs. The silence between the characters says it all. The ones that stand out from the pack of men are Commander Bolton, Mr. Dawson and Tommy; this is where most of the focus lies and where we get most character depth. The non-linear structure helped with this, it almost trapped the audience in a loop with different perspectives on the event of Dunkirk. And the whole movie is all about the event, not the specific characters. You feel like you're in it so you care for the situation and the characters, even though you might not remember their names fully. All of this is very rare and not often seen on film. It really works in the film's favor, and yes even more inside to characters could never hurt a film like this one. But this isn't a flaw in this film. To relate to characters in this extent with so little talking – is an Oscar-worthy achievement.<br/><br/>To follow these characters in Dunkirk is an exhausting and adrenaline-packed experience with realistic action that you will not question. The realism is stunningly shaped. It might be one of my most surreal film experiences ever. Hans Zimmer's score boosted the experience by tenfold, it got this ""ticking"" feel to it, almost like a heart beating faster and faster throughout the film – Zimmer is a propulsive force that never stops to amaze. The camera-work is just as stunning; you fly like an aircraft and feel the full gravity of the situation! It's a smooth, stylish and artistic direction from C Nolan and 'Interstellar' cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema.<br/><br/>Some minor flaws do exist. The action is at a few places very identical as to what already has been seen in previous scenes, so it took the ""wow-feel"" down a bit. Some individuals will without any doubt attack the ""too realistic"" WW2 feel, because it's not bold enough for them. But to create this movie isn't about being bold. It's about creating something real. And it is, very!<br/><br/>It's an epic experience filled with realism but also small acts of heroism, kindness and forgiveness. Dunkirk is as action-packed as 'Mad Max: Fury Road', and stunningly realistic as 'Saving Private Ryan' but with a bigger slam to it. It reveals the true nature of war, the men behind it and what the bigger picture of it can be.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a visual and emotional experience that will take the gasp out of you. Period.<br/><br/>Personal rating: 92/100 Critical rating: 96/100"

","The slick music is a flaw. It's a pity that traditional Western music can't be adopted in movie about modern affair. Music sound tedious in a repeated oppressive rhythm, as well as the cadenced music that helped to arose the urgency condition. Perhaps better without the background music.<br/><br/>Having watched some Western WWII movies. The common narration was: graceful landscape and relics in motherland, dear family members or lovers --everything in country is so beautiful, and all these should be cherished; be forced to frontier; found be cheated by warlord (only when defeated?); but, in any way, soldiers should behave braveness and obedience (approve the real Japanese soldiers' behavior in late stage of WWII); at last, somebody sacrificed for their honor, the survivals represent the hope of new Caucasian Realm free of non-whites.<br/><br/>-- All above in the service of such a whitewashing: the own country is the core, in other words, England is the most important. It seems most English turn a blind eye to other nation's suffer, and addict themselves to their own perception. People in occupied territory means nothing, and if they does, they should appreciate the occupiers from the same Western ideals for their 'liberation' from the white people. Defeat is not reconciled to -- 'Go down swinging'. If plot not be treated so, the nation's 'self-pride' would hurt. Sometimes, remorse or condemn to warlord are allowed, in an delicate 'apropriate' limit, but it wouldn't account for the main line. Scenarios must be turned around thereafter anyway. Perhaps someone responsibl for movies partially realized the fact, but they just wouldn't recognize it."
"Svenstadt","10","3","17","21 July 2017"," Overall good summer actioner that also honors those who served.
","I saw only two good summer movies this year worthy of note: Wonder Woman and this film! Very good movie.<br/><br/>Be warned that although not gory, it is kinda scary at several points, and the 'jump' factor is pretty high at several points.<br/><br/>I'm impressed by both Wonder Woman and this film by the way the directors were able to escape the usual remakes and what has been done before, and come up with new ways to awaken theaters. These two films truly give an uplifting message and leave a big impression on you.<br/><br/>This movie has a way of putting you in the action and letting you live it, as opposed to narrating what you should think (ie The heros of the film aren't given the usual honors in war films, but you root for them as you're watching) I feel that this is the real way combat would be, and Nolan does a good job of giving a realistic sort of feel to the combat that people would expect I think of real combat would be like.<br/><br/>Only criticism: it starts off kinda fast and intense, and then slowly you get more comfortable as the action becomes more and more predictable. This is actually a good thing because you can feel that tense nature of what I feel real war would be like. The adrenaline drains and you get tired just like a soldier in combat, and you can feel that. I haven't really seen that before on film. <br/><br/>It has kind of a Quentin Tarantino style of narration, like in Pulp Fiction, it has an out-of-order sequence of events and your mind has to put it into order.<br/><br/>If there were more films like this, people would get tired of them. I feel this standalone movie tells a powerful story and Nolan did a good job. Will this movie be forgotten? Most likely. But it does deserve kudos."

","I loved ""Dunkirk"" & i nearly wasn't sure about giving this a try as i thought it would be another really over long boring epic but it wasn't at all, i mean it's Epic in nature as it's about the real battle at Dunkirk so it's all based on real events but it's running time was under 2hrs which is rare for a war based film & rare for a Christopher Nolan film.
I liked how the movie is framed by three stories going on at the time of Dunkirk, we get a Land, Sea & Air story that all gradually meet as one & it's all told so intensely & exciting as well as dramatic & often scary.
The look of this great film is beautiful & moody & the score is excellent & like a distant siren & eerie heartbeat that's always there as a symbol of danger is constantly there & no where feels safe thanks to the brilliant Hans Zimmer, also the movie moves at a good pace & feels like a survival Thriller set in war time.
The cast was great without having too many characters that often weighs everything down, no here we have a few main faces that we follow around in the interlinked stories but none are over dramatized, we got Tom Hardy as a Pilot always in the sky battling the enemy & pop singer Harry Styles is very good in his first ever movie role & debut role is of a surviving young soldier just simply trying to stay alive amongst the chaos & there's the only kind of main character in the movie another young scared soldier who we follow from the very beginning & who teams up with good young french soldier & Harry styles soldier & they become a trio of keep moving soldiers, that main kid is ""Tommy"" played greatly by newcomer Fionn Whitehead & Harry's guy is called ""Alex"" there's also a shivering shell shocked survivor played by Cillian Murphy so there's a good solid British cast.
Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director as we already know but i think his WW2 survival Drama ""Dunkirk"" could be his best!!!
The atmosphere & mood is always kept very tense & almost creepy & danger always feels close by, at times almost as if ""John Carpenter"" directed a War Film & that's a big compliment!!!<br/><br/>All in all ""Dunkirk"" is a superb war drama with an exciting survival Thriller tone & a great group of characters simply surviving a messy war & wanting to get home.
Also i get why we didn't HAVE big main characters to watch & that's because it's about the experience of the crazy war & just trying to keep moving & survive & it could be any man, any soldier story or any pilot story it's a view into the nightmare world of war as an average guy thrown into the thick of the action, it's a film made for the average soldier who can become a hero just by staying alive long enough to get home. EXCELLENT!!!!
Proud to be BRILLIANT."

","Dunkirk - Review<br/><br/>I've heard Nolan described as an emotional mathematician. If that's true, and I believe it is, there is no other film where he has the better opportunity to display his sensibilities as a director than he does in DUNKIRK. Unlike his work in THE PRESTIGE, THE DARK KNIGHT, INCEPTION, and INTERSTELLAR, this is a film grounded in reality, forcing the filmmaker to flex his muscles in less conventional ways. His ambition in following three stories (land, sea, and air) all of which cover different spans of time, pay off in an experience that feels like you're watching the third act of a war movie... except, that is this entire film. The film is simultaneously massive in scope and horrifyingly claustrophobic. It's a technical marvel in cinematography, music, and storytelling. The story bears the filmmakers trademark themes, yet finds interesting ways to package them in unexpected ways. More than that, this is a British film for British people. One in which they can take pride. It's a film about survival and humanity. It's a film about a country coming to save the men that left their home to save it... and that country welcoming them back with open arms when the men coming home feel like they don't deserve it."

","This movie definitely did everything right for portraying the raw emotion felt in a war. There was no romanticism or ""war glory"" just young men afraid of what to do next.

It did just that wonderfully, bringing the audience to the edge of their seat with their hearts beating at the intense parts.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not a huge fan of movies that have war in the main focus, but this movie was a masterpiece. Making the enemies faceless with little autonomy put us in the minds of the soldiers and made us understand how they must have felt being drafted into a war in which they have to kill others just to survive. It made us feel the deep seated fear they felt whenever planes neared them.<br/><br/>Overall amazing movie. It would be a 10 if I were more into these types of movies"

When asked about the movie, they felt that it accurately captured the event, but that the soundtrack was louder than the actual bombardment, a comment that greatly amused Writer, Producer, and Director Christopher Nolan. The end credits state that twelve of the original little ships that participated in the Dunkirk evacuation appeared in the movie, re-enacting their presence in 1940. When Farrier (Tom Hardy) lands his Spitfire on the Dunkirk shore, the plane is actually being piloted by American billionaire Dan Friedkin, who loaned planes from his personal collection to this movie. Near the end of the movie, a Spitfire without fuel is seen shooting down a Stuka dive-bomber. This is historically correct.. The Stukas were notoriously easy targets for fighter planes (especially when preparing to dive) and, in the following Battle of Britain, a significant number were shot down.<br/><br/>
*Emotion- A well thought out and produced film to demonstrate the many darkest matters of this mass evacuation under the German guns. Many details of the on camera scenes were meticulously researched and portrayed. The audience gets treated to some real emotion on how the event was played out during those dark days.<br/><br/>*Based On- An historical WW2 event."

Not every film with long scenes without much action nor dialogue, is by definition ""artistic"". It is risky to match an artistic movie and war movie - and in my opinion, the director didn't make it. For most of the time it was simply boring. Luckily, I had fast forward button... And for such budget, the film was quite austere. Many reviewers pointed out, that all we have seen were some five aircraft, a dozen of boats and several trucks, plus two warships.<br/><br/>What is worse, boring long takes are interspersed with unrealistic, simplified or just absurd scenes. Probably the author of the script tried to show the horror of war, but it does not start good, when the soldiers walk through a calm and deserted city, and suddenly there come shots out of nowhere. Have the Germans just enter Dunkirk?... If so, then there is only one French barricade, restraining them from the beach... Other reviewers or goof-pickers rightfully criticized scenes on a boat riddled by gunshots, or long gliding flight of an aircraft without working engine. It might be only added, that when it comes to air battles, the Spitfire pilot just follows the enemy fighter and shoots, while the victim flies in generally straight line, not trying to break a contact or attack... I understand, that the director did not want to use a CGI, but far more realistic battles were shot in the ""Battle of Britain"" in1969, which is, needless to say, also more entertaining movie to watch, with a proper pace. And if the enemy bomber is shot down, it obviously fells into a relatively small spillage of oil and sets it on fire, to add dramatic effect to a nearby boat. ...And what we see aboard the boat is not a particularly realistic acting either.<br/><br/>By accident, a few weeks ago I've watched ""Their Finest"", also a new film on a similar subject. In spite of being a lighter movie, described as a comedy-drama-romance, I found it more telling about the human nature, than the ""Dunkirk"", and more dramatic as well. And the script of a fictional movie about Dunkirk evacuation, that is being written by main characters in ""Their Finest"", seems to be no more silly and unrealistic, than of the ""Dunkirk"". Only the budget of that fictional movie is a fraction of the ""Dunkirk"", and it has to be shot in difficult wartime conditions. All in all, my thought was, that the fictional movie about creating a film about Dunkirk, was better and more worth to watch, than a blockbuster about Dunkirk..."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","1","3","8 March 2019"," Another Christopher Nolan film that proves he can direct anything.
","Almost like clockwork, Christopher Nolan has directed a masterpiece of filmmaking every two-to-three years since the start of the millennium. While his prior work is certainly entertaining, most of it was set in a fictional environment that allowed him to play with the format of nonlinear storytelling. When I first heard that Nolan would be directing a film about the World War II retreat from Dunkirk, I was skeptical at first. I mean, while he's great at action movies like The Dark Knight (2010), mind-benders like Memento (2000), or even science fiction epics like Interstellar (2014), his only foray into the ""historical"" was via The Prestige (2006), and even that was mostly made up.<br/><br/>What I did not realize going into Dunkirk (2017), was Nolan's ability to create art without the need for fancy camera tricks or mind-blowing plot twists. The simplicity of Dunkirk merely emphasizes the mastery of cinematography and directing that Christopher Nolan can command. Whole sections of this film were devoid of dialogue, allowing the audience to piece together what was happening and what was going through the characters' minds as they try to save themselves from their inevitable demise at the hands of the unseen Nazis (thus making these antagonists much more terrifying, a la Jaws (1975)).<br/><br/>While Dunkirk is considerably slower than other Nolan films, its three separate foci help to drive the story forward, never spending too much time on each as the plots drive to convergence. It does become confusing in a few instances due to one of the character arcs starting a week ahead of the other two; but by the end, the impact of these characters' decisions and actions delivers an emotional climax that is worth the wait. I would certainly be amiss if I did not mention Hans Zimmer's incredible score to this film, practically making every scene come alive with an incessant note of tension and suspense. At any rate, the visual realism and artful presentation of an army in defeat is a rare treat and one that I have not yet seen, or will likely see in the future.<br/><br/>Another Christopher Nolan film that proves he can direct anything, I give Dunkirk 4.5 stars out of 5."
"meeshoffmanns","9","1","3","6 March 2019"," Perhap's Nolan's best Work Yet, Most Intense Theater Experience you will ever have
","Cristopher Nolan has once again established his reputation as a filmmaker who time and time again delivers a great blend of serious themes and storytelling next to great and gripping entertainment value. This in no small part thanks to Hans Zimmer and Nolan's standard co-workers Nathan Crowley and Lee Smith, who put together with him a nail-biting and brutally intense war-film about pure survival and fear, with seemingly no escape in sight.<br/><br/>Acting:<br/><br/>Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Banard and Harry Styles, together with several young actors represent the survivors who do everything they can to escape from the beach of Dunkirk. Their acting is by no means exceptional, but they manage to deliver enough intensity and fear on their faces to feel just as scared as they are at that moment.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy as Farrier acts with just his eyes, but like his role as Bane, he doesn't need anything else really. He sells every hard decision and following determination solely with his eyebrows and looks, and it requires a very skilled actor to do that so easily.<br/><br/>Mark Rylance and his two younger co-stars represent the rescuers overseas, and give realistic and grounded portrayals of civilians who simply refused to turn their backs on their soldiers when they needed help the most.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy as ""the shivering soldier"" is a high note, as his shell-shocked and frightened portrayal of a lone survivor provides an intimate yet tense arc with his rescuers.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh and Brian d'Arcy as two officers from the British Army need to carry most of the exposition and dramatic weight, and do their job well as the two veteran actors that they are. Particulary Branagh portrays the frustration and stubbornness well.<br/><br/>Direction:
This is by far Nolans' best directed movie, solely determined to capture as much of the tension and fear as possible during the entire movie. He sticks close to the actors the whole time, without losing focus on the pivotal battle sequences.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
Hoyte van Hoytema replaces Wally Pfister as Nolan's usual cinematographer once again, and makes great use of the IMAX camera to capture as much of the wide beaches as possible. The grim blue-yellow aesthetic looks stunning, and land, sea and sky are all from outstanding quality in terms of photography.<br/><br/>Plot:
Nolan's preference for unique story structure is shown here, with three separate sections of the Dunkirk Rescue, all at a different point in time, sometimes intersecting. Each section is gripping in it's own way, and although the characters don't have much dept, their simple motivations and struggles are enough to gain our sympathy.<br/><br/>Music:
Hans Zimmer and Christopher Nolan has been a great combination from the beginning, and this may be their best collaberation yet. Zimmer has delivered a score that is so gripping and adrenaline-filled that the tension never falters right from the start of the movie. At times, the music reflects sheer panic because of incoming lethal danger, and you feel just as frightened as the poor souls trapped at sea or land. The score uses an ever-climbing melody to achieve this rising intensity.<br/><br/>Sound:
Seeing this movie in IMAX is not just worth it for the photography, but for the intense auditory experience as well. The sound of incoming German Stuka's is absolutely terrifying, and the gun shots that penetrate the air and shelters are deafening. Never has war been so accurately portrayed through sound as here.<br/><br/>Production Design and Costumes:
Nolan is known for his strive for realism and accuracy, and Nathan Crowley has always delivered on this goal. Dunkirk was shot on the actual beach, using some of the actual vessels and planes, and the rest was so meticulously crafted to look like the original that you would never notice.<br/><br/>Editing:
Lee Smith has masterfully adapted Nolan's vision for this complex story structure, alternating between the three timelines with skillfull editing and demanding the audience to pay attention.<br/><br/>Tone:
The tension is high from the first minute immediately, and never really drops during the entire runtime. You never feel safe, just like these soldiers, and the euforic feeling is understandibly high when the men are brought to safety. It is extremely difficult to keep the tension bar that high for so long, but Nolan pulled it off.<br/><br/>Overal Concensus:
The most impressive war-film since Saving Private Ryan, thanks to Nolan's creative team and his determined approach and vision. There is not much attachment to the characters, but that is not truly the point. Feeling fear and the desire to survive is. 8.7/10"

"Nolamoviedude","7","1","3","20 December 2018"," Visually stunning
","I had been looking forward to seeing this for awhile and decided to spend the extra money to watch it in IMAX. The picture and sound were phenomenal. The movie is about the evacuation of the town of Dunkirk during WWII. The movie is told on 3 different time lines which had me confused for a little bit of the film<br/><br/>1st Timeline: Is of British and French Soldiers waiting on the beach to be evacuated since the Germans had them surrounded. This part of the story starts 1 week before the other timelines.<br/><br/>2nd Timeline: Is that of a man who seems to be in his mid 50's. He's taking his boat from England along with his 17 year old son and his friend to help with the rescue. This starts 6 days into the 1st timeline.<br/><br/>3rd Timeline: Is of 2 fighter pilots trying to keep Germans from stopping the rescue. This timeline starts on like the 23rd hour of the 6th day.<br/><br/>The 3 timelines weave in and out of the movie in typical director Christopher Nolan fashion. The movie ends with the main soldier from the 1st timeline getting rescued by the boat in the 2nd timeline and the pilot of the 3rd timeline (Tom Hardy) getting shot down and captured by the Germans. The movie ended before any French were rescued, only British. Very little dialogue in the movie but visually stunning,"
"bouthwaite","7","1","3","21 November 2018"," A beutiful mess of a film
","This is a good war film that I found myself wishing a lot more from. I don't think there is any argument to made about the cinematography of this film, it is flawless. I couldn't ask for better visual execution. The soundtrack is a touch too over dramatic, but it isn't Zimmerman's fault because the film score is doing everything it is supposed to be doing. Again no faults for flawless soundtrack execution. Now onto the items that I desperately wished had been worked on more before shooting this film. Before I go into my critique, let me first reiterate that I gave this film a 7 of 10.
The narrative for Dunkirk is unbelievably disjointed. We follow several stories connected together in a daisy chain scene compilation. While everything looks beautiful, the stories definitely feel repetitive and you will definitely feel some slow pacing. It will also feel slow because a lot of the conflict in the movie is not combat focused. It focuses on a lot of mundane issues that could happen outside of war. This can be seen in an over attentive focus on gas gauges, focusing on a shot of a mainish character taking a dump on the beach while an interesting firefight is happening, walking, more walking transferring the wounded, and small ships sinking. This wouldn't be quite as noticable if you didn't have the soundtrack announcing all these details so dramatically. In fact so much focus in the film is related to survival, one could make the argument that this is a survival movie and not a war film and you couldn't really prove it wrong.
Bringing me to my last point. This movie feels cheap. It really feels like it is a war film on a budget. It feels everybit of 300 actors on the beach and not 300,000. There are no shots that really setup a fair sense of the scale of this ordeal. There just aren't enough ships, there aren't enough aircraft, the town looks immaculate. Not enough to feel like there is any chaos. The war assets they have get juiced to the limit and filmed from every angle. Even the beach looks manicured as if it needs to be ready to be reopened to the public within an hour after the shoot. I understand needing to stay in the budget, but I've never seen a film where they made me actually worry about it going over budget.
In conclusion it might sound like I didn't enjoy this film, which isn't true. It just doesn't live up to the hype. It's a great film to watch as a one time flick. I'd sell it as being visually excellent but a narrative mess."

","Finally got around to seeing Dunkirk. It was a very impressively made movie. The cinematography and directing in this movie were outstanding. This really is one of the best shot movies of the year.<br/><br/>The dialogue was minimalistic, instead utilizing multiple perspectives to showcase the massive effort the evacuation of Dunkirk took. In many ways it reminded me of Tora Tora Tora, which of course is a compliment considering that's one of the greatest war movies of all time. <br/><br/>Despite not focusing on one character, all of the characters and their actions depicted felt very human. The movie did a great job depicting the brutal effect war has on the human psyche.<br/><br/> The movie constantly left you with a feeling of dread and did a great job depicting World War II combat. As a history buff I loved all of the tiny details added to the movie to make it more realistic. Overall Nolan did an amazing job with this movie. A 9 out of 10."

It was so captivating on the smaller screen, I could not imagine how much more intense it would have been had I watched it on an IMAX.<br/><br/>It was simply one of the most ""satisfying"" war film I have ever watched. It's an emotional rollercoaster ride for over 90 minutes but without the Saving Private Ryan style of close combat fighting.<br/><br/>How much do I enjoy this film? I have watched it 3 times since.

"Yeary72","8","1","3","18 July 2018"," A fast and visceral war movie
","Watching this movie again at home almost a year after it was released to theaters on July 21st 2017, I still have a great deal of respect and love for how this movie and how it portrayed war and how fast and visceral it can be. Christopher Nolan mastfuly helms his shortest movie to date clocking it at 1 hour and 48 minutes, and it flew by. I orginally watched this movie at my local IMAX theater when it came out last year. Though I didn't write my review when I originally saw the movie, I waited to see if it still holds up on my 42 inch TV. Though the booming orchestra was gone and the massive screen was now small, the movie still brought me in to its setting and quick paced nature. This movie is about the event of Dunkirk and how everyone from land, sea, and air were affected. The movie is constantly jumping from these different perspectives. <br/><br/>The editing is quick and strong. Every frame and cut seems necessary and tells it's own story. To the shots of the young men on the beach diving for cover from the enemy bombers, to the dad and his 2 boys saving a scared shell shocked soldier from drowning. It all feels very quick in nature and strong in heart. The main gimmick you could say in this movie is the switching of time and location or our main 3 stories. The Mole, The Sea, and The Air. Each with different amounts of time shown and cut between. I found this style unique and interesting on how it showed originally 3 unrelated stories and how they came to cross paths. Something rarely seems from a movie now a days. <br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie is breathtaking. Very beautiful and intensely shot movie with master cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema behind the camera. He has shot movies including Interstellar, Spectre, and Her. Wide open shots of the beach and ocean soar high in the sky and swallow everything in the frame. These shots really show the scale and epicness of the event. These shots are often mixed in with close up shots of the soldiers in constant fear or pain. Or both. Almost everything in this movie is real. Hundreds of extras, real boats and planes, locations. Extremely immersive. This movie is a something to see visually wise. <br/><br/>The characters and plot of the movie may be the one thing that is lacking here. You don't get to get into the characters minds very often. The movie is so quick paced and intense that very little time is left for talking. But for this movie it really works as a good things. The movie is not based around the characters. These characters that Christopher Nolan have written are strong characters for a backdrop for the main character, that is Dunkirk. I understand this might annoy people but when the movie concluded I still found the events they went though very engaging even if the characters sometimes weren't so fleshed our.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is also very good. Newcomer to limelight is actor Fionn Whitehead and does a great job with the little dialogue he has. Harry Styles, Cillian Murphy, and Tom Hardy all also bring in good performances. Though I believe the best performance in the movie is played by Mark Rylance. He places a strong father and gives much passion and relaxedness to the movie. Great job by all.<br/><br/>I'm conclusion I am giving this movie a 9 because it is a masterpiece in film editing, cinematography and showing the massive scale of war in such a unique way. The acting all around it great but nothing ground breaking. Story and characters may be sometimes be lacking but never seems to bring down the movie much. In IMAX this movie was a joy to see because it is a more visual movie. Most of the joy from watching this movie comes from the events unfolding and not the characters connecting. From the beginning to the end this movie is quick paced and extremely immersive. Never a dull moment. Nolan often brings very visual stories to the silver screen in amazing ways, and this movie is no exception. This movie is about an intense visceral event that 330,000 soldiers experienced on the beachs of Dunkirk directed by Christopher Nolan and it is Amazing."

"anselmdaniel","8","1","3","10 June 2018"," Historical spectacle
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is directed by Christopher Nolan and is a movie about the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces in World War 2. The movie is told from three perspectives: land, sea, and air as all perspectives are followed according to their time length. The land perspective takes place over the span of a week as an infantryman tries to survive. The sea perspective is over the span of one day as a captain of a little boat is aiding the evacuation. The air perspective is a Spitfire pilot in dogfights to protect the sea transports and takes place over the span of one hour.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a visually impressive movie. There is very little computer generated imagery on the screen and the movie benefits from this. The movie has a grounded in reality feel and this increases the tension. It was a great experience to watch this in the theater. Although there are some historical inaccuracies such as the German planes being painted incorrectly, this did not detract from the experience. The movie felt authentic and all the scenes had an authentic feel. Even the sound design felt correct and contributed to the movie. Plane propeller sounds, radio crackles, and ship sirens helped in immersing the viewer. The sound design deserves a lot of praise and it consistently delivers. All of the sound contributes to the emotions of the movie.<br/><br/>The story of this movie is bare-bones. However, the characters and setting make up for the story. The movie is very much a viewing into the battle and evacuation at Dunkirk. The story is also told in a non-conventional way with different perspectives at different times. This movie may be hard to follow with its constant cuts, but this has a purpose with its desire to tell the three perspectives in different time frames. Viewers of Christopher Nolan's previous movies will understand how the director uses the theme of time. The scenes are similar to Memento and Inception.<br/><br/>The actors do a good job here. Tom Hardy deserves special praise for being able to portray his character's strugger with minimal dialogue and his eyes. The other actors also do a good job and there is minimal dialogue in general for this movie.<br/><br/>Overall Dunkirk is recommended. The movie tells the story of the Dunkirk evacuation in a unique way. The sound and visual experience should be had in the largest screen as possible.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

There were no main characters to this version, as everybody portrayed was a hero, even the lowly privates. Glad I was able to watch this and all credit to those involved."
"Leofwine_draca","7","1","3","3 June 2018"," A flawed masterpiece
","Christopher Nolan's DUNKIRK is a flawed masterpiece, an often eye-poping and exhilarating cinematic experience let down by a few problems with the writing. The structure is very clever, although not quite as clever as that of INCEPTION; three separate story strands are explored as the (surprisingly short) running time progresses, best described as on land, on sea, and in the air. Each strand occupies a different length of time but all interact in a satisfying way. Each feels like a separate film. The aerial combat sequences, featuring Tom Hardy, are undoubtedly DUNKIRK's highlight and often quite stunning; you've never seen scenes like this before and they totally convince. I felt like Nolan should make his next film a Biggles adaptation on the strength of them. <br/><br/>The sea sequences play out like a thriller and are also authentic and finally acted, with Mark Rylance delivering another great turn after BRIDGE OF SPIES. There' s no faulting them. Surprisingly, it's the land-focused soldier scenes which see Nolan slip up. The soldier protagonists are presented in the worst light, as cowards who spend their time skulking around, spying on Kenneth Branagh, and then essentially deserting their regiments to hole up in an abandoned ship. I found it ludicrous that the soldiers wouldn't bother setting up a sentry or two in the sand dunes at this point, and their stupidity leads to the expected death and chaos. These aren't huge problems, but I expected more from Nolan. The rest of the film is still masterful, however, and well worth rewatching to see brilliance you won't find elsewhere."
"garethcrook","7","1","3","18 May 2018"," This is very stylish.
","This is very stylish. The colour in the opening sequence would not look out of place in a 1950s Hollywood Musical. Nolan loves cinema and this is the definition of cinematic. This though does detract somewhat from the events on screen, harrowing as they are. It's beautifully made though and Nolan puts you right in the heart of the ever increasing tension. Now I don't know how accurate this is, but I'll assume they did their homework and it's close enough to actual events and with that in mind, as with all depictions of war, I'm reminded how utterly hopeless it all seems. I find it impossible to watch things like this and not wonder how I'd cope. It's not a pleasant thought and therefore a good reason to thank Nolan for that degree of separation. The acting is good, the characters work well, but it's all about the spectacle. The dog fights, with cameras twisting in mind boggling contortions, the perilous nature of the lumbering ships, the soldiers, not as individuals, but the mass of people. I'd be lying if I said the hair didn't stand up on the back of my neck when someone shouts hopefully ""Spitfire"" as the plane majestically sweeps the screen, but much of the film is build up for the third act, up until then it's all primer, as the time jumps that have kept the film just about ticking converge into the predictable rousing climax. The events that took place at Dunkirk will bring a tear to your eye, as will this film. This isn't so much a war film as a survival film and despite its shortcomings, it's overarching bleakness delivers the point."

","Technically, 'Dunkirk (2017)' is a technical triumph, with the direction and cinematography being almost flawless. It's true that it is a cinematic experience unlike almost any other, masterfully creating nail-biting suspense and pulse-pounding tension with ease - not to mention a palpable practicality. Yet this, the feature's biggest strength, is also perhaps its biggest flaw, because it's much more an experience than a traditional film, relying on spectacle far more than story or character and, as such, sometimes struggling to provide any engaging emotional connection other than on a surface level. Christopher Nolan normally creates compelling character-driven narratives far more intelligent than typical blockbuster fare, yet here his focus is entirely on the visceral. Make no mistake, this is still far more intelligent than typical blockbuster fare. Its structural shifting is necessary for the sake of pace (allowing each story to reach its respective finale at the same time), but it does sometimes cause a bit of confusion. Nevertheless, this is a compelling and effective experience. It's brilliant in its own way. 8/10"

","I'll first say that I very much enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. It had all the suspense and action that you expect from a war drama, but told in a different way.<br/><br/>The storytelling in this movie was a bit offputting to me at first. I would've honestly preferred a chronological story. I would've understood more if the movie took the three main storylines one at a time, but the fact that they jump back and forth between three non-chronological stories seemed a bit much to me.<br/><br/>Despite my issues with the chronology, I definitely felt engaged in the story and I had no problem becoming invested in the characters. All of the main actors gave great performances and their characters seemed believable. Halfway through I found myself genuinely caring about the outcomes for each of the main characters.<br/><br/>What I find most interesting about this movie is that it was able to tell a gripping war story without including a lot of intense fighting scenes. The fact that the movie keeps up the suspense despite the Germans hardly ever appearing on screen was downright impressive. You could argue that this was done only to get the movie a PG-13 rather than R rating, but I think it worked out well and I don't feel like I missed out on anything because of it.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't anything revolutionary, but it had good production value and a good story. It's great to see another high-quality WWII movie in theaters."
"jcruz-42957","9","1","3","18 April 2018"," Dunkirk: 9.0
","One of the criticisms of Dunkirk is that it is devoid of emotion or characters, and I'd have to disagree with those criticisms. Dunkirk is a fast paced experiential movie that delivers action, suspense, and emotion. In terms of characters and character development it was basic, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The movie focuses on the characters as much as it can without losing the full thrill experience. The actors playing the characters like Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Barry Keoghan, and Kenneth Branagh put in very moving performances across the board. All with their own character arcs that all induce different forms of tears. Barry Keoghan's George inducing the most. The score is very heart-beating and immerses you into the movie experience like a head being pushed in water. The clock ticking puts a layer of suspense under the entire film that prohibits you from being taken out of the story, and the Shepard tones increase that suspense indefinitely. The music is one of the biggest strengths in the film, but at the cost of being too loud in some dialogue scenes. Causing characters words to be drowned out. When it comes to narrative it's brilliantly structured to produce almost a funneling effect. Over the course of the story this funneling effect slowly increases intensity to the max. Until the very end when the effect turns in reverse to allow for a very epic and powerful ending. Overall, Dunkirk is a speedy thrill ride told in a unique manner, and it's speed doesn't take away from some exceptional moving moments. So I give it a 9.0"

","This is one of the best war movies I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few. It's very cleverly constructed, with three timelines that gradually converge. To respond to one critic, I didn't remember any character's name either, but I remembered who they WERE: The father and his two sons who went to the rescue, the pilot who kept going when he really should have turned back, and the soldier who just wanted to get the hell off the beach. It also shows the random violence and random survival that happens in war. It's an excellent movie."

"destinylives52","8","1","3","18 March 2018"," Good War Movie
","Near the beginning of WWII, hundreds of thousands of British soldiers and their allies were trapped by the German forces on the beaches of Dunkirk. The ships to rescue the allied forces were few and far between, and those few that were sent were under attack from German bombers and U-boats. The British, desperate to save at least a small portion of their trapped soldiers, decide to commandeer small, civilian boats to assist in the rescue. This is the story of ""Dunkirk.""<br/><br/>Told from three timelines that eventually intersect, ""Dunkirk"" will confuse the typical moviegoer who doesn't fully pay attention. One timeline starts a week before the civilian rescue; one timeline starts about a day before the civilian rescue; and the third timeline starts about one hour before the civilian rescue. This is a complicated way of telling the story, but it is effective and absolutely necessary to keep the tension high throughout the movie and to get the audience emotionally invested in the major characters from the beginning.<br/><br/>Timeline one: Tom Hardy plays a British, Spitfire fighter pilot who flies to Dunkirk to engage German bombers and fighters.<br/><br/>Timeline two: Mark Rylance plays a civilian who takes his small boat to Dunkirk to save the soldiers trapped on the beach.<br/><br/>Timeline three: a young, British soldier spends days trying to escape Dunkirk in any way he can.<br/><br/>When I started seeing things that were familiar - the same parts of the movie told from different angles and with either more or less detail - even I was trying to figure out what was going on, but quickly figured out what Director Christopher Nolan was doing, and became very impressed with his choice of storytelling.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Dunkirk"" was the scene when Hardy was still flying his plane that ran out of gas, providing air cover for the soldiers below him.<br/><br/>This movie would have been given an A rating had it not been for the confusing ending. **SPOILER ALERT** Why did Hardy fly so far away from the British soldiers to land his plane, leading to his capture by the Germans? Why not glide to an open spot on the beach close to the British? I understand there were still tens of thousands of allied soldiers on the beach and he didn't want to hit any of them as he landed, but come on! Are you telling me the soldiers on the beach wouldn't have gotten out of the way? I am guessing Nolan wanted a dramatic ending - and it was dramatic - but that drama was ruined because it made no sense to me. What better way to up the morale of the British and French troops by safely landing on the beach after downing several fighters and bombers despite being low on fuel and actually running out of fuel? This man's a hero! Still killing the enemy with a fighter plane that ran out of fuel! Still protecting his fellow soldiers as he glides over the beaches and shores! And then he...keeps gliding far away from the allied troops and lands where the Germans are. Huh? What? Are you kidding? Sorry, Nolan, you made a bad choice.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
"peterhorrey","10","1","3","15 March 2018"," Brilliant...another confirmation of the genius of Nolan
","I get why some people don't get this film. On my first viewing I was glued to my seat as the subtle brilliance of what I had seen was just washing over me. Yes it's not Saving Private Ryan (which is a great film). But this is a totally different way of approaching a war film. An approach only Nolan can pull off. He makes it deeply personal and therefore it gets deep into your emotional soul. 
He takes it from the perspective of three different witnesses, at three different times and three different mediums...remember when you see this one week (land), one day (sea), and one hour (air). Just to think about this conceptually it's genius, but to actually realise on film is beyond belief. The acting is brilliant from every cast member, the scene of the unknown solidier running into the sea..it was pure despair..how does a director convey all that emotion in a fleeting moment. The detail is beyond belief. This is Nolan's best film (he has a faultless CV btw). And Zimmer is his usual otherworldly best...off to take my 19 year old daughter to see it at the Prince Charles tonight (my third viewing)..."

"richarded-94667","9","1","3","10 March 2018"," Dunkirk Litty
","Dunkirk is a war movie that depicts the struggle and tragedy that happened in Dunkirk, France towards the beginning of the Second World War. Dunkirk was played in the perspective of different people who experienced the event, switching from first person. The constant suspense that you could tell was going through the characters minds helped demonstrate the intensity of this event. For example, when the scenes were switching between what was going on with the different characters, from the sitting ducks on the coast waiting to be bombed by the Germans, to the British Air Force that were protecting the ships from bombings.<br/><br/>The story starts off with a boy, probably part of a squad running through a city in France. There are gunshots behind him shooting all his comrades, and he continues to run away from the gunshots. He eventually finds his way to the beach where soldiers are waiting to be picked up by battleships. Over there there are German Air Force planes that are bombing the defenseless soldiers. Priorities are to take people who are injured or need help aboard the battleships first. The boy, finds someone who is injured and makes his way to a battleship, getting on the boat because he has to ticket to get on (the injured person).<br/><br/>The scene shifts to show a family, two sons and a father, who own a boat on the opposite coast of Dunkirk are are preparing to travel to Dunkirk to pick up soldiers. This was one of the strategies that was used to pick up soldiers that were left for dead. Something big like a battleship would be too big of a target for the German Air Force. However, instead of using a few battleships, many civilian boats can come, each being able to carry a limited amount of soldiers but combined, become a lot. Also, the battleships weren't used because they figured that they already lost that battle and didn't want to use up all the boats. They were saving the battleships for the next battle.<br/><br/>One other perspective in the war was with one of the badass British Air Force spitfire planes that were protecting the battleships from bombings from the German Air Force. The story shifted to be in the minds of one of the British squad consisting on three planes. One of the planes were shot down. The perspective of the person we went into was someone whose gas gauge was shot out. So he doesn't know how much ga she ha slept. He relies of his last friend to tell him how much he has. This man is a hero, he took out a bunch of German planes. However, eventually, his friend also gets shot down and is forced to touchdown. Eventually, the pilot runs out of fuel and shoots down his last German plane before touching down and getting captured by German forces.<br/><br/>If you are really into action movies with violence and a lot of suspense, then this movie is going to be great for you. Some of the things that happened were so crazy. Although a lot of events that happened were sad, it helped appeal more to the audience, making them connect more with the characters. Throughout the movie, we learned about the historical background on this memorable event, along with what it might have been like in the eyes of some of the people who experienced it.<br/><br/>Looking at some of the reviews for the movie Dunkirk, I noticed that there were a few low ratings of the movie. Like that is so bad. I just watched the movie over last weekend because i was looking for a nice historical war movie and I guess I was technically being productive because it was homework. Anyways, the main argument that the critic used against the movie is that it didn't allow the audience to connect with the characters in the movie. However, i feel that the main focus in this movie was to portray the intense things a that can happen in the movie. The goal of it was to show how suspenseful Dunkirnk really was. I feel that not focusing on one particular character so that the audience connnects with them was in a way, a sort of theme because then it focuses on the more broad tragedy of the entire scene, instead of just one person."

"SnoopyStyle","8","1","3","3 March 2018"," undeniable skills
","It's 1940. Allied forces are trapped around the beaches of Dunkirk. Naval Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) organizes the evacuation from the pier. Tommy is the last survivor of his squad. With another soldier, they pretend to be stretcher bearers to sneak onto the medical ship. Farrier (Tom Hardy) flies one of 3 Spitfires into action. Dawson (Mark Rylance) with his son Peter and friend George Mills pilot his pleasure craft to the rescue. They find a survivor (Cillian Murphy) from a sunken vessel.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan delivers a visual film of compelling action. He uses great silences. The flying sequences are impeccable. The sea action is compelling with some real ships. I have a bit of hesitation with the portrayal of some of the soldiers. The Cillian Murphy character is perfectly fine as a soldier suffering PTSD. If he's the only one, it would be a very compelling portrayal but Nolan puts in too many. I'm also willing to accept Tommy's lies to escape. It's not until the beached boat where there seems to be a problem. I can understand the Lord of the Flies mentality. With Germans taking potshots at them, there are two logical moves. They could either go out and fight or hide and wait. They have guns and fighting is possible. There is no logical reason to kick out Frenchie which would only prove their existence in the boat. They are acting irrationally which is excusable but Tommy needs to call it out. I would also want a separate section with soldiers fighting rear guard action. Tommy's tale could be so different and more action packed if he stayed to fight for a little while. Overall, Nolan's film-making skills are undeniable and this is a compelling exploration of this historical event."

"krocheav","9","1","3","24 February 2018"," Dunkirk - Survive at all Costs.
","Definitely a one of a kind interpretation of the events that led to the WW11 evacuation of the beach at Dunkirk. War is wasteful and devastating (but also grotesquely profitable for some!) and political leaders of all persuasions gravitate towards it as a means to an end or for ultimate greed. Quite surprisingly the limited dialogue approach works well enough and allows the events that make up these harrowing stories to unravel at their own pace. It won't be for everyone, especially those who have a liking for conventional style war movies featuring individual heroes of the day. If anything, it pays homage to ALL those who suffered at the hands of the tyrannical force that destroyed so much within people's lives across Europe. <br/><br/>Striking aerial footage puts the viewer in the cockpit and forces us to share the fear and isolation of one to one combat in the skies. No-one escapes the carnage and if you do just happen to survive - it may never be the same for you again. Then, waiting for you on the other side was another war - for the home front! 
Yes, its approach is different but, successful for those who can think in terms of survival amid a terrible historic event. The almost mechanical music-soundscape adds to the eerie atmosphere - with this then made quite perfect by the carefully measured strains of Elgar, adding the right touch of civic pride, to highlight the remarkable arrival of the life-risking civilian small-craft flotilla. It's also pleasing to find an Epic that does not feel the need to outstay its welcome."
"justinroome","9","1","3","22 February 2018"," A masterpiece on all levels!
","Viewing Dunkirk in the theater was quite the experience. The movie truly made you feel as if you were on those beaches yourself fighting for your life. With masterful directing, Christopher Nolan has outdone himself and made the best war movie of the decade, and possibly his best work ever! The absent dialogue leaves room for Nolan and his sound editor to craft some of the most terrifying sound editing I've ever heard in a war movie. The loudness of the battle field is overwhelmingly realistic. The cinematography is gorgeous and stunning, transporting you to the world that these men were fighting in. Nolan has created a refreshingly new take on a genre of movies that is long overdue for some originality. Dunkirk will absolutely keep you on the edge of your seat. A can't-miss war movie."
"phubbs","9","1","3","19 February 2018"," Dunkirk
","Christopher Nolan's latest offering is an accurate representation of an event that occurred in 1940 during WWII. British, Belgian and French troops were cut off within Dunkirk, surrounded by advancing German troops. The allies were literally fish in a barrel to the German forces. They were stranded, being attacked from both land and air with the sea to their backs, nowhere to run. <br/><br/>Situated in Northern France, Dunkirk was the location of the massive evac operation which saw large numbers of British civilians man their own vessels in order to assist with the rescue. Up to 400 various manned craft were voluntarily used and braved the English Channel along with various military vessels. Despite the fact that German forces had halted their crushing advance on Dunkirk (giving the Allies some time to organise the evac), the Luftwaffe were still hitting the port and its beaches and enemy troops were still on the ground.<br/><br/>Nolan's film tells the story of Dunkirk from separate angles, land sea and air. The first angle is from a young British private called Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) who has survived a recent German ambush and has made his way to the beaches. We follow Tommy as he tries to get on-board a couple ships only for them to be sunk by German attacks. Tommy eventually ends up back on the beaches with some Scottish soldiers and a French soldier. The second angle is from RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) and two other Spitfire pilots who are part of the British airborne resistance against the German bombers. And the third angle is from a Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), his son Peter and his sons best friend George. All of whom have volunteered to help in the rescue with the aid of Mr. Dawson's yacht.<br/><br/>First off Nolan's film is not like most traditional films. There is very little dialog throughout the entire runtime; instead Nolan relies on pure visuals and the musical score to convey the films atmosphere. That is where the film may be problematic for many people, this isn't a war movie filled with blood, guts, gun battles and explosions. Obviously if you know about the actual historical event then you would know to expect this. The most dialog comes from the story surrounding Mr. Dawson and his son Peter, second to that would probably be Tommy's story, then lastly and most obviously is Farrier's story which is almost entirely conveyed through Tom Hardy's facial expressions.<br/><br/>Now whilst I did fully appreciate Nolan's vision here, I have to admit to finding it somewhat odd watching a movie like this with little dialog. Looking at Farrier's story (the air section), it was indeed very impressive to watch these old Spitfires dogfight with German Messerschmitt's. Naturally it wasn't shot in the typical Hollywood action sequence type way. What you get are highly realistic air sequences which show the planes trying to manoeuvre into position to be able to attack each other. When the attacks come they are short bursts with very little fanfare. When a plane gets hit nothing much happens at first. The pilots communications are brief and not filled with silly quips. Basically overall it kinda feels like you're watching some kind of airshow display or training video, the fact everything is shot in natural light kinda adds to that.<br/><br/>The story surrounding Tommy is probably the most Hollywood-esque part of the movie, but it still may not please some. Once again this is a highly realistic vision, there are no 'Saving Private Ryan' sequences on this beach. The plot is straight forward, Tommy and another soldier try to board ships by using an injured soldier as their ticket essentially. That seems almost wrong but in the grand scheme of things who wouldn't do that? The fact that they try to get away twice and both times the ships are sunk did seem almost too unlucky to me. The fact that later on they reach another ship and yet again it gets sunk, kinda felt a bit overly dramatic perhaps. Did that many ships get sunk in the real event? <br/><br/>Tommy's tale certainly has the most cinematic visuals of the film, the numerous shots of the troops lined up on the beach are incredibly haunting, yet beautiful. Its easily the most intriguing of the three main plots but at the same time its also a bit too 'Spielbergian' methinks. When Tommy meets up with the Scottish soldiers things get a tad by the numbers and a little dull. I also felt the death of the French soldier (who was thought to be a Brit) was again a little touch of Hollywood which maybe wasn't required. It was too predictable, the minute he is exposed as French you kinda knew his number was up. I should add that whilst all this is going on we get little snippets of Kenneth Branagh as a Commander overseeing the operation from the beach. Again like Hardy he tends to emote through facial expressions more than dialog. <br/><br/>For me the weakest of the stories was following Mr. Dawson and his son. Call me shallow but this was simply because it wasn't really that interesting. I found myself yearning for the plot to get back to the beaches, or in the air with Farrier. Don't get me wrong, Mark Rylance puts in a great performance as the calm and steadfast Dawson, and its important to see the civilian angle of this story. The thing is it just wasn't really that intriguing watching this trio sale slowly towards Dunkirk.<br/><br/>The subplot of them rescuing a stranded officer (Cillian Murphy) from a shipwreck was also something of an odd addition. Murphy's officer is shell-shocked, he argues about going to Dunkirk and tries to stop Dawson. This leads to George (Peter's best friend) falling and badly injuring his head...which leads to his eventual death! I really didn't see the point in all this because it goes nowhere. Dawson and Peter lie to the shell-shocked officer about it and that's kinda that. Neither Dawson or Peter came across as upset when the incident occurred or when George dies. You're left wondering what happens with that. Does the officer get done for murder upon return to England? Would he be let off because of the fact he was shell-shocked?<br/><br/>Would I say this is one of the greatest war films ever made? In terms of realism yes. In terms of score, cinematography and craftsmanship yes. In terms of engagement (for me the viewer) I'd say its up there, but maybe not the best. I totally and utterly shower praise on Nolan and co for their vision and what they have achieved here, the authenticity being the number one factor of course (score not far behind). But I cannot deny the film is a little slow at times. I hate myself for saying this but I did find myself yearning for just a touch of romanticised heroism or emotion just to get those waterworks going. <br/><br/>The final sequence showing Farrier taking out one last German bomber before he is forced to land in enemy territory from lack of fuel, was so fecking awesome. Seeing the Spitfire land in one shot on the Dunkirk beach was fantastic, as was seeing a stoic Farrier stare into the camera as he is captured and led away. But dagnabbit Chris, I just needed a hint, a mere drop of glossy sentimentality. The film was so realistic that it didn't really feel like a film at times (again I hate myself for saying this). But bottom line, this film is a tour de force that ignores manufactured heroics and stereotypical Hollywood-isms. <br/><br/>9/10"

","""Dunkirk"" is an action, drama movie in which we watch the evacuation of Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France who are surrounded by the German Army in Dunkirk in France, during the Battle of France in World War II. In this movie we can observe the agony of the soldiers as they wait for the ships to come and pick them up.<br/><br/>In general I liked this movie because of the plot and because of what represents. I also liked the music of it because it made you feel that you are in this movie with all those soldiers. The interpretations of Fionn Whitehead who played as Tommy and Aneurin Barnard who played as Gibson were very good. Another good interpretation was made by Mark Rylance who played as Mr. Dawson. To be honest I expected more from Tom Hardy and I believe that Christopher Nolan didn't use him as mush as he could. In addition to this I have to admit that at some points in the movie I was let down due to the luck of interest or action.<br/><br/>To sum up I have to say that ""Dunkirk"" is a nice movie to watch, you can learn and see some things from the perspective of these soldiers but don't have high standards. I was feeling all the time that something extraordinary will happen and I was disappointed by the ending. Nevertheless I still recommend this movie to everybody."
"thpmorrisey","9","1","3","5 February 2018"," ""Saving Private Ryan it ain't""
","While browsing the reviews for this film I saw one reviewer sum up his dislike for the film with the phrase ""Saving Private Ryan it ain't"". Ironically this sums up exactly why I love the film and why I think it's such a fresh ad exciting war film. 
SPR starts out with (ignoring the clawingly awful modern day sequences) with a terrific action sequence, then proceeds to destroy the momentum it so expertly built by outlining its convoluted and cringeworthy central mission and painstakingly develop every archetypal character.
Dunkirk on the other hand maintains a relentless and ruthless momentum and tension throughout, never pausing for breath and heightened by Hans Zimmers excellent soundtrack. Many have complained about the lack of traditional story or characters but this is precisely its strength, it banks on our inherent humanity to get us to root for the people in this awful situation and their struggles. The simplicity of the plot and characters allow the film to organically widen its scope to a large cast of characters and, combined with the inventive narrative structure, give a truly comprehensive and believable feel for the events of the evacuation. 
Dunkirks shunning of the traditional and tired war movie tropes makes it feel fresh and exciting, truly a classic of the genre in the making, and leaves many of its contemporaries in the shade, Saving Private Ryan it ain't."

"stevenbutten","8","1","3","31 January 2018"," As I Hoped It Would Be
","I grew up hearing stories of the Dunkirk evacuation, my Great Uncle Fred having piloted his boat across from Ramsgate in Kent twice to help bring back stranded and wounded soldiers. He witnessed many harrowing moments, but never thought of turning back.
One thing threaded its way in and out of his recollections: how ordered everything seemed to be. He did not witness the chaos and deadly scramble that so many reviewers here wish they had seen in this movie.
I wasn't there of course, but I was not surprised by the look and overall tone of this film. This has led me to wonder why so many people were bored by it. Could it be the age of the moviegoer? is it the lack of CG special effects giving us huge explosions with digital blood and gore? Is there simply not enough death and destruction for minds anaesthetised by almost constant bombardment of the senses?
Much of the telling of this story in the movie does fit with what I was told by those who were there; if I had a carp it would be that there were not nearly enough small ships to indicate the scale of what happened.
There is tension here; it is an escape story. Will the ships come, and when they do will the Stukas allow them to leave? The effects here are mostly visual; created in the camera, not on a computer and the film benefits greatly because of this. You see what the pilots and shipboard crews see. You hear the Rolls Royce Merlin engines in the Spitfires and you can feel the visceral response, albeit a fraction of what they felt.
To paraphrase Mark Rylance's character: ""Old men start wars and send boys off to fight them."" So many young men were left dead in the waters off Dunkirk, so many young men had to return to Normandy's beaches in 1944 to push the enemy back.
If Hitler had pressed on he may have had the German satellite nation he wanted in Britain, but his plans were foiled when the RAF, ""the few,"" held the Luftwaffe at bay.
This film is a tribute to bravery and perseverance. I'm sorry it didn't have the guile, artistry and jump-up-and-down thrills of some robotic super-hero monster movie. Perhaps the remake will be Guy Ritchie's swan song and he can do for Dunkirk what he did for poor old Sherlock Holmes.
I enjoyed this film immensely and it's exactly what I would hope for in a Christopher Nolan work. I'm going to watch it again."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","3","28 January 2018"," A heroic victory of resilience
","This film is essentially a visual story that tells us how the battle of Dunkirk, or rather the heroic defeat of Dunkirk went, and it went very badly. 400,000 soldiers, English, French and Belgian or even Dutch encircled in Dunkirk and completely besieged till the end.<br/><br/>For the Germans, it was just a question of killing as many as possible while trying to escape and taking those who did not try to escape too much into the slavery of some labor camps, war prisoner camps or whatever they were called. Arbeit macht frei, as we know and worked they were well obliged to do. <br/><br/>For the French, it was only a question of resilience and resistance that started straight away, called for by De Gaulle and mainly by the left with the Communists in the heart of it, in spite of what will be said later. <br/><br/>For the English, the question was only know how many fighters they would be able to save and take to England, fighters that could be integrated into the English armed forces straight away. So the priority was on English survivors who had to be taken on ships, but many were sunk by airplanes or by submarines, and then by smaller ships, mostly private that were requisitioned by Churchill. The last element in this war was the role of the Royal Air Force that was supposed to bring down as many German planes as possible and thus enable the escapees on their ships and boats to make it across the Channel in the least unsafe way possible, with as many survivors as possible.<br/><br/>Historically this battle was essential to demonstrate the power of the Germans and send a tsunami of fear all over the world. At the same time this battle was essential because even if it did not stop the Germans, it prepared the English side of the channel to be ready for the Blitz that was to come and for the RAF to win it, and win it they did. <br/><br/>But why a film about this battle today? To revive the memories of people who are less and less direct witness of the war and the generation born after the war and raised in the spirit of the war are in process of retiring and will soon be in the process of disappearing. But the younger generation may have to learn about it, but learn about it in its absolute horror, and that is a great point to note about this film. It centers everything, every scene on the suffering of the men trapped in that dead-end place. It is also maybe necessary to just remind all politicians in Europe that this continent has had peace for a long time because the French and the German were able to sign a treaty in the early 60s that brought reconciliation and cooperation between the two countries, a treaty that was signed by De Gaulle who had been an essential leader of the resistance during the war and Adenauer who had lived through more than just the war, also the whole post First World War period in Germany meaning the absurd rivalry between the Communists and the Social-Democrats that left the gate to power open for Hitler to come and just pick the fruit. A meager thirty plus percent ""majority"" enabled Hitler to defeat the two main left parties who actually had a majority in the country. That is not brought back in this film but maybe some younger people will be curious enough to look for more data about how and why Hitler seized power in the best democratic way. After his victory democracy was very fast buried, but the first step was a democratic victory in the country.<br/><br/>But the most striking element in this film is, of course, the depicting of suffering, fear, resignation, resilience, hope maybe even in the very heart of the certainty of death had finally come. Pain is beautiful when it is not gratuitous. Some may say that war was senseless. The way it was fought in 1940 was absolutely amazingly meaningless. But once you reach Dunkirk the possible options are very limited and the suffering of the soldiers taken in that trap like as many rats reveals the humanity and the faith of these men in the existence somewhere maybe of peace, justice, and plain humanity. <br/><br/>A beautiful moment of sad awareness.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

","The camera is beautiful. And that is about all. The story is messy. And the list of goofs just underlines the team should have stayed with something they know better. The character interaction is interesting, but the story just does not build up for me. So probably the other good thing about this movie is the fact that there is no hero, no glorification of war beyond the populist ""regular folk"" trying to survive."

","I can see why people don't like this movie. It is VERY different from the usual telling of a war tale. <br/><br/>I was blown away by how much this movie made me feel. Blown away because for a movie about war there was very little dialogue, very little action and very little blood (comparing it to the likes of Saving Private Ryan). Having said that it struck me deeply. I love the way this movie unfolds. It flips timelines quickly and often. There is almost no character development. But it all works perfectly together. I can't remember the last time I was paying attention to the music so much in a movie as I would find myself tensing - while watching people walking on a beach. <br/><br/>The music was definitely setup to disturb you while you watch certain events unfold. The very few action scenes were made extra tense because the music was so perfectly done.<br/><br/>I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone although I think I would warn them that it's not going to be what they expect."
"DeBBss","9","1","3","21 January 2018"," A Unique Take On A True Event...
","I knew this movie was going to be great, even before the trailer, but what surprised me the most was how it told three different stories of Dunkirk. I was expecting Dunkirk to be a movie about what the soldiers did to try to escape the beach of Dunkirk. I like how Nolan took three different perspectives of this event. This version of Dunkirk has to be the best, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Story: 10/10<br/><br/>The story of Dunkirk was an event about the Nazis invading France. The French soldiers got trapped at the beach of Dunkirk. The ally British failed to help fight against Germany, trapping themselves with the French. The way the Christopher Nolan showed the language barrier between the French and the English was well done. There was a scene when a group of English soldiers tried to escape with an old boat, and there was one French soldier, and they quickly turned on each other because of that language barrier between the French and the English. The other side of the story was about a team of three English men trying to rescue the soldiers on the beach. The way they showed how long it took to get to the beach of Dunkirk and the thrill of getting there was well done, it doesn't show them getting on a boat and arriving there the next scene, it slowly shows the progression of the journey. The last part of the story was by air. The pilot part was the weakest part of the movie. I wasn't entertained or thrilled in the plane scenes. I felt like Nolan wasn't interested or didn't really focus on the plane side of the story. I was expecting a little bit more from Tom Hardy, but he got the least screen time in the cast. The way Nolan showed this event through these three sides was interesting and unique. The one issue was the plane scenes.<br/><br/>One unique part about this movie was the characters. Dunkirk wasn't really focused on characters, but more on the story, and I support that idea. I was expecting strong characters and friendships between the soldiers, much like the movie 'Hacksaw ridge'. The movie focused on 300,000 soldiers not knowing anyone else, and nothing in common, but wanting to get out. Although I knew nothing about these characters on the boat trying rescue the soldiers, I did feel sympathy when one of them died.<br/><br/>Action: 9/10<br/><br/>Dunkirk really focused on the thrill and the fear of the soldiers, and because of that there is no gunfights, but just waiting for rescue, and Dunkirk does that well. The sound and music design is the best iv'e ever heard. The music fitted the movie perfectly. The music made it ten times more thrilling. Also the sound design was amazing, hearing the planes flying through the air was just so captivating. Near the end of the movie, there was a scene when a plane was flying over the beach, and it sounded so realistic that if you closed your eyes, you would believe you were actually there.<br/><br/>Dunkirk tells a great story through the perspective of three different sides, land, air, and sea. The movie didn't just focus on only the soldiers, but it also focused on the brave people who risked their lives to save the soldiers. With that and amazing sound and music design, Dunkirk easy deserves a 10/10 or a 9/10. The only reason why Dunkirk gets a 9/10 from me was how weak the story of the pilots in the planes."

","I have never written a review before, but felt so strongly about the overrating of this film that I felt the need.

The scale was just insignificant, the drama and tension wasn't built at all, the characters all lacked personality and therefore you have no sense of feelings for them.<br/><br/>When the film was drawing to an end, it felt like I had just watched a very long drawn out introduction and the main action was due to follow.<br/><br/>I cannot emphasise enough what a huge let down this film is.

","I saw this in the theater and was completely haunted by it's painful realism. I have yet to see a war movie that captures the raw emotion of war with such honesty as does this movie. It was extremely uncomfortable to watch a a result, but like I said, I was haunted. So, I had to see it again. I just finished watching it again, and without the shock and awe effect it had on me the first time, it's even easier to see it's brilliance. Which is why I am amazed at all the 1 start reviews! People are complaining about the lack of dialogue, which to me is one of the features that brings the film such a human touch. I know that when I personally have had a difficult day with little sleep, I'm not much for conversation, and that's a ""difficult"" day at work or with the kids- not fleeing an occupied France after watching friends get blown up, getting shot at multiple times a day, running for safety when there is none, all with little to no sleep, water, food and with no end or hope in sight. For all those who crave dialogue from the soldiers, I ask you, what would you like them to say? Seriously. What is there to say? They're in complete survival mode. They aren't thinking about their families, or some girl they left at home. They're thinking about what they have to do to survive at that moment. They're living inside their heads-like most humans do when under severe physical and psychological stress. The movie is intense and real. It's chaotic and ugly. It is a perfect depiction of war, and tells the history changing story of Dunkirk perfectly. It is truly a masterpiece."

"YellowManReanimated","10","1","3","6 January 2018"," As beautifully constructed as ""Nimrod"" itself
","The best adjective I can use to describe this film is pulsating. It keeps you engaged throughout. <br/><br/>This is done in a number of ways: firstly, there's the claustrophobic intensity. Almost all the scenes are set in the midst of action where bombs could land and lives could be taken at any moment. The characters run, bob, sink and gasp in the efforts of survival. Battle scars are etched on their faces and in their psyches. They are war-weary, suffering in the face of an unwinnable battle and yet the will to go on is palpable and arresting.<br/><br/>Then there's the complexity in the portrayal of the soldiers. Yes we see heroism but we also see fear, selfishness and naked hostility among supposed allies. The environment has become almost every man for himself and we see only moments of self-sacrifice amidst the general current of self-preservation. This must be what a man must go through in such a war. The glory of fighting for your country is a motivator for some but the pure, instinctive desire to live must course through the veins of many a soldier, especially when conscripted and in the face of such bloody battle.<br/><br/>The film is brilliantly edited and paced. You're thrust into the action and never let out; you feel what it must've been like to suffer the way these men suffered and you, as the watching public, feel compelled to salute the heroism it must have taken to merely be able to survive such brutality. ""All we did is come home."" One soldier says. ""That's enough."" Replies a civilian saluting the sacrifice which came from enduring the experience of war.<br/><br/>Well done Nolan, you drew me in expertly and kept me engaged right up to the emotional and fittingly reverent finale."
"niallmaggs","10","1","3","5 January 2018"," Modern Masterpiece - Film Review by Niall Maggs (http://ateenstakeonfilm.com)
","Dunkirk is the latest masterpiece by the excellent director Christopher Nolan. It tells the story of the rescue of 400,00 soldiers during the second World War, while they were stuck on the beach of Dunkirk, and couldn't get home.<br/><br/>Nolan's direction in this is excellent, structuring the story into 3 perspectives: the land, following the troops on the beach, the sea, with the civilians fishing boats heading toward the beach to rescue the soldiers, and the air, following Tom Hardy and two other pilots in pursuit of a German Aircraft, bombing the soldiers on the beach. This method of storytelling is extremely immersive, giving the audience 3 different perspectives of what that experience was like. They get a feel of what was going through the soldiers' minds during the evacuation, and what life was really like. This results in an extremely effective and gruelling (in a good way) film.<br/><br/>Because this is a Nolan film, it's obviously going to look fantastic, with expertly crafted cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, that gives the audience a beautiful experience at the Cinema, and keeps them captivated for the entire duration of the movie. They do a great job portraying life on the beach of Dunkirk in 1940.<br/><br/>The performances were all excellent, as always in a Nolan film, with standout portrayals from Mark Rylance as a civilian attempting to rescue soldiers, who brings out emotion and dedication to his role. Tom Hardy as the pilot is a man of few words but conveys a deep and interesting character, through his heroic actions. Harry Styles is clearly in the limelight due to his previous fame in One Direction, but gives a surprisingly good, but short performance that proves he is quite capable of acting as well.<br/><br/>The score by Hans Zimmer is phenomenal as always, that gives off a tone of dread and fear, while also being extremely suspenseful and gripping. Nolan and Zimmer are always a dream team and it is proven once again in this one more than ever!<br/><br/>The script was very small, but Chris Nolan stated that he wanted to tell the story visually, rather than through dialogue, so there isn't much of it, but the visual aspect is impeccable, that proves you don't really need a 4 hour long script to create a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Overall, Dunkirk is an excellent war film that floors you and holds you down with emotion and non stop destruction, its brutally relentless and chilling but that is Dunkirk's perfection, that gives us one of the greatest films of the year, and easily one of the best of all time."

I never think I've seen a movie that so much imparts a mood, a mood of despair, hope, camaraderie, heroism, but first and foremost, the film masterfully masters the dark thrill that unfolds in Dunkirk and all those involved. The strength of the film is that it manages to convey the human stresses it must have been part of in such operations during the Second World War.
I have nothing negative to adress about this movie. The rolling crew is amazing. The film depicts different fates, and everything is merged to the end.
This is a movie that can also be recommended to those who do not like the genre ""war movies"", as it is the psychological stresses and experiences that are conveyed, and not endless war scenes. Recommended."

"avraham_tal","10","1","3","20 December 2017"," What is heroism? What is cowardice?
","**** MAJOR SPOILERS ****<br/><br/>This movie tries to show the different types of craziness.<br/><br/>Does it mean that you have to be crazy to be a true hero? Probably yes. 
Heroism definitely comes with prices:
The skipper who tried to save pilots and marines got a young boy killed by a crazy surviving pilot.
The British pilot who fought till his last drop of fuel to destroy the German bomber planes got one of the bombers to crash on oily water and burn some marines that where there. And in the end got himself captured.
The marine who stayed on the deck of the destroyer ship and was too scared to go inside and eat saved the trapped solders by opening the hatch.
And, of course the generals who tried to evacuate Dunkirk did get more than a quarter of them (100000) killed.
To be a hero, you sometimes have to make non-logical decisions that are against ""game theory"" rules, and sometimes sacrifice yourself and others. As the yacht skipper said: ""There will be no home if we all go back"".
Some of the heroes are post traumatic, such as the yacht skipper who lost his pilot son and the marine who stayed on the deck of the destroyer.<br/><br/>And what about cowardice?
Are soldiers who try to save themselves cowards? Can we blame them? ""Survival is enough"" as the blind man at the dock said.
Are post traumatic people like the saved pilot on the yacht, and the marine on the grounded ship (played by Harry Stiles) who act against their allies criminals?
As the yacht skipper said: ""He is not himself"". Is he?<br/><br/>This is definitely a fantastic movie. A true piece of art.
Professionally directed and played.<br/><br/>I would also like to mention a final word to the critics who gave this movie bad review or bad score:
This is not another ""Rambo"" action movie, with a simple story or plot.
This movie is about mental states and decision making under stress and trauma.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best."

The cinematography alone is worth seeing. The places they chose to film were great and fitted the movie perfectly. Even though there is hardly any Character development in this movie, everyone did a good job. The action was also a pretty awesome strength to the movie. The ship battles and the dogfights were great and very well filmed. Easily the best part of the movie (for me) was the soundtrack and the sounds. The soundtrack made the movie feel so tense and epic. And also the Guns, planes, bombs, and explosions sounded very realistic. It made you feel like you were actually there. <br/><br/>So overall i enjoyed this movie for what it was; but that being said, it is very overrated and not the masterpiece everyone says it is.<br/><br/>When i first heard that Christopher Nolan (the director of one of my favorite movies The Dark Knight) was directing this movie, i was so hyped and had huge expectations. But sadly not all of them were met. I wanted the movie to have some ground battles but they were mostly in the air or in the ocean. I wanted solid characters but the entire movie is dedicated to the battle. The movie does drag sometimes and its not always interesting. Before i saw this movie i saw an ocean of positive reviews, some saying that this is one of the best war movies ever made. But after seeing it myself, i was not agreeing. <br/><br/>In the end, I did find myself enjoying Dunkirk but it is overrated. Its not ""The Best Movie Of The Year"" nor ""The best War Movie Ever Created"". Its a solid and accurate movie on a real life event. I'm giving it a 7/10 or a solid B."
"stroggos","7","1","3","4 August 2017"," Impressive, yes—enjoyable, depends.
","Christopher Nolan's DUNNKIRK is a war movie par excellence. It is raw, with a simple premise, no exposition needed. The story unfolds entirely through action, similar to movies such as MAD MAX: FURY ROAD. There is little dialogue, but the true nature of each character reveals itself through his (all major protagonists are male) actions.<br/><br/>I appreciate Hollywood making movies like this. Its attempt to depict war in as distilled a form as possible, is a welcome change from the romantic-action- comedy-superhero miscellany we so often see these days. DUNNKIRK is very much ""old cinema"". There's a sense of purity, with a minimalistic score, an emphasis on practical effects, and lots of wide shots and landscape shots that take their time.<br/><br/>That said, whether you ultimately like DUNNKIRK or not depends on whether you like war movies or not. And whether you can endure the intensity... and the deafening loudness of this movie. I have two problems with DUNNKIRK, and although both minor in themselves, together they spoiled my experience:<br/><br/>First, the sound design is jarring irritating. Yes, director Nolan likes to emphasize environmental sounds and have his actors mumble through muffled masks. But the ratio of vocal amplitude to the amplitude of war sounds (particularly gun shots) is simply off. Nolan has a thing for deafening gun shots, and this time they almost made me want to leave the theatre to protect my hearing. While the difficulty of hearing voices compared to the loudness of the environmental sounds may give the movie a sense of authenticity, it also means that there's extra cognitive effort in trying to understand what people are saying. Nolan, don't make your audience work so hard! And please don't give us tinnitus!<br/><br/>Second (and this one is perhaps more of a personal matter), Nolan should really try once and for all not to actively impress us. His style of cinema so desperately wants to instil awe in you, every image cries out 'do you notice how epic this is?' In recent years, Nolan has one made one great epic after another. And yes, his movies are truly impressive, but I would like to see how he would deal with something more small-scale and subtle.<br/><br/>DUNNKIRK is definitely a must-see, if only to be able to talk about it. But be prepared to be actually thrown into the trenches (or beaches) of war, which may not be the feeling you seek in cinema, especially if you can't deal with noise so well."

","I've been patiently waiting for this Christopher Nolan's new war epic and rightly so. This is a very mesmerizing, awesome, spellbinding effortless (seemingly) but astonishingly great movie that captures the terror and (and this is even more horrifying) averages of war tragedy. The movie depicts Dunkirk evacuation from France to Britain, and we witness several main characters suffering loss, pain, thirst, fear, hope, despair, hope again and then - a huge exhaustion. This is a really deep and strikingly realistic war film which show the cruelty and immediacy of was so vividly and so honestly livid that tears are about to come, and you sit on the edge of your chair and clutch fists in pain. Empathy is very deep here, too. All the main heroes, Branagh, Hardy and Murphy among those,do such a tremendous job that you forget you're watching a movie, you feel like you're there, in grim, dim, dreary, dreadful reality of war. I certainly recommend this excellent movie to all serious war theme buffs. This is a very true, decent and honest effort. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
"javi-y-se-acabo","9","2","10","7 September 2017"," Christopher Nolan Does It Again with His Shorter and More Tense Movie to Date
","First of all, I have to say that I have watched all the movies of Nolan, and while he might be too cool-minded and calculator at times, he really knows how to make a movie and how to get you to feel what he want you to feel. For me the best movies of him are The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception and also Interstellar was very good, but I have to say that this enters in my Nolan top 5 without doubt.<br/><br/>The movie tells us the story of how the British army tried to rescue the soldiers trapped in the beach of Dunkirk. It tells us the story in three different time lines. First, there is the mole (one week), then the sea (one day), and finally, the air (one hour). The story goes back and forth in the three different time lines and tells us the story from the perspective of different characters. But the thing that differentiates this movie from other war movies is that it does not have a n emotional weight in the sense that it not stares at just one soldier and tell us his story, how he got to the war, or why he wants to escape from there.<br/><br/>And for that you might think that if it does not have emotional feeling it might be boring, but it is never boring. It transmits you the feelings of a real war. Fear, tension, panic That is helped a lot by the great actors in this movie. Here there is a really big cast, from veteran actors like Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy to the newer actors that for me were the biggest surprise of the movie. From Fionn Whitehead to Harry Styles the all provide great performances that help you connect with them and the situation they are.<br/><br/>And now I have to talk about the visuals. Nolan likes to make his movies' looking the more realistic that is possible, so he decided to use real ships and planes from the IIWW. And also he decided to record the movie in 70mm and that provides an immersive cinematic experience that provides some very beautiful shots with the planes flying over the sea, but also some very claustrophobic moments while the soldiers are being attacked. And to this you have to add the always effective soundtrack of Hans Zimmer who created a one long track using mainly sound designs and that only helps to make you feel more far and tension.<br/><br/>This movie is truly one of Nolan's bests so if you like his style of filmmaking, I'm sure you will like this one. And this is not only for Nolan fans, but also for cinema fans who wants to watch a movie and be immersed in a real cinematic experience."

","The movie starts with one of our many protagonists seeing himself inside the city of Dunkirk and trying to ""dodge"" bullets and running to get past the French line and to the beach of the city. The movie takes you directly into the siege of Dunkirk and from that point on you are constantly on the edge of your seat. There are 3 stories which intertwine really brilliantly at the end of the movie. First the story of a soldier which he tries to find a way across the channel, a story of a father and his boy which with their ship are being pressed into service to go and help with the evacuation and finally the story of a spitfire pilot and the (awesomely visual) dogfights which he comes across. The whole movie is masterfully directed, you really feel you are actually there when the soldiers trying to get a breath of air when drowning or feel the pressure of an air battle or the actual fear the soldiers have while trying to survive and escape this whole situation. Christopher Nolan did it again, and I really really recommend go watching this film!"
"skpn123","10","2","10","3 September 2017"," Masterfully crafted piece of Art
","I am shaking my head when I read the absolute nonsense that this film didn't make an emotional connection. The entire (full) theater was breathless and in tears in the scene where all the small boats were gathered in the distance on their way to rescue 'our boys' who had all but run out of options bar swim back to Britain. Though we had only been introduced to one boatload of characters, we instinctively knew them: They were us, all of us and we only hoped we would have been that brave and not chosen to cower at home. These characters were our grandfathers and our great grandfathers, and we, ordinary people, were saving them, they were ours and by the incredibly crafted art piece that is this film they were able to be nobody yet everybody. Quite a unique and powerful achievement for a film maker to be able to achieve this. Devoid of emotion? You would have to be the Tin-man with no heart or perhaps watching another film....<br/><br/>And my teenage son who is into fantasy and action, and so quite immune to key characters being killed asked me after 'do you think the Pilot made it?' - he had connected - he like everyone else was 100% with that lone Pilot who was the hero we all want to be. We barely even saw his face behind his equipment and we knew nothing of his background yet we will never forget him. What a unique achievement this film is! I don't 'love it' as the story it depicts is so brutal, but I admire it and all those who lived and died there for us their families. A special thank you to all the participants in this film and in particular to Christopher Nolan for bringing it alive in such a stunning fashion."

","There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who love Christopher Nolan films and those who find them pretentious and tedious experiences. I'm in the former and found this film utterly brilliant. Set before the United States entered WWII, the film retells the the British defeat by the German Army at Dunkirk, where they were surrounded on all side by German forces, trapped along the shores of France and desperately trying to retreat back to England. The story unfolds almost wordlessly, following several individual stories amongst what must have been thousands of personal stories. One is of a group of infantrymen trying desperately to sneak ahead in line to get aboard a ship bound for England. Another follows one of the many civilian ships, crewed by a father and two sons, who risked all crossing the channel to bring their boys home. Another thrilling storyline follows an airman who must protect English civilians and soldiers, while watching out for German planes, all the while also watching his dwindling fuel supply. The film is incredibly suspenseful and at times terrifying, which was a bit of a surprise considering the film's PG-13 rating, but that's a big tip-of-the-hat to writer/director Nolan talents behind the camera. What struck me most about this film was how it was able to fully capture the scope of this battle, but did so by telling the the story from three very individual experiences. Time will tell, but I believe this film will one day stand amongst the like of ""Paths of Glory,"" ""The Battle of Algiers,"" and the other greatest war films of all time."

","What's remarkable about this film is its intensity - that ability to pull you in and really feel the tension and terror of the action these boys really faced.<br/><br/>The film relies mostly on these aspects, but also the human interaction - and explores how war makes people paranoid and so full of fear that they are willing to attack their own allies.<br/><br/>The score is remarkable. Hans Zimmer never fails to amaze me, and neither does Nolan's direction. <br/><br/>I'm glad we have films like these that really show and make you feel the horror of the action people face rather than dumb robots destroying buildings and having no emotional connection to anyone involved.<br/><br/>Make sure to see this in Imax!"
"nizzambaharuddin","10","2","11","2 December 2019"," A masterpiece from Nolan
","SYNOPSIS<br/><br/>Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.<br/><br/>SPOILER-FREE<br/><br/>Awesome. Terrifyingly tragic. That is all I can sum up this movie for. FAIR WARNING though; if you're watching this movie thinking it's like the Call of Duty game series, Pearl Harbor or any other movie glorifying war, this isn't that movie. If you're watching thinking it's gonna have those big action scenes you might imagine in a war movie, this isn't that. Or if you're watching just because of Harry Styles, then get your butt off your seat. This isn't a contemporary movie. It's not for the people with short-attention span that 30 minutes in you might be sleepy because of it. It's a thinking movie. All of Nolan's movies are. It's more in line with Saving Private Ryan or The Pianist. It's an anti-war movie.<br/><br/>The biggest compliment I can give to this movie is that it's successfully made me feel like I'm there, with the rest of the characters. It made me feel helpless, terrified, senses fueled to the max and uneasy. It's like watching the perfect horror thriller movie, without the need to show you the ghost / the killer. Some might even say that the movie is too much to take. And I would agree with that.<br/><br/>You can tell that this movie is an experiment from Christopher Nolan. It's his least dialogued movie. And seeing that he has a resume full of heavy dialogue movies, I'd say that's a pretty awesome feat and achievement. This movie is where he showcases his talent of visual storytelling, something that some might say a bit missing from his repertoire. And this movie debunked that entirely.<br/><br/>The characters did their job well too. Suprisingly, Harry Styles's character has more dialogues than the protagonist, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead). But the most stand out performer for me is Aneurin Barnard. So few lines yet so pivotal. Famously, Nolan hates the use of CGI and digital cameras. So they were no surprises that the movie doesn't have that. It also means that the best way to enjoy this movie is in the cinema, either digital or IMAX
theatre.<br/><br/>Probably the only negative thing to complain is the movie is a bit short, the shortest Nolan movie I think. But I don't think the movie need anymore exposition scene anyway. And it might be a negative to some (not to me) but you definitely need to pay full attention to this movie. Especially when a few info comes out on the screen, cause otherwise it might be a bit disorienting and some not be able to piece it together. And to that people I'd say ""If you didn't understand a book, it's not the book's fault"". In a nutshell, a perfect movie. Another masterpiece from Nolan. He delivers yet again."

"sudhakaranakhilan","8","2","11","24 November 2017"," New from Nolan
","So, it's been a large section of reviews and reviews over flooded with the praising and pointing their fascination about the movie Dunkirk and this also seems to be like that. Not in the sense of great reviews and remarks done by BBC, CNN, Hindustan Times, etc but it is a small and very simple writing of a novice which object to point about the man who surrounds with the ambiguous atmosphere all the time and also the man whom I admire a more, in the sense of a filmmaker, Christopher Nolan. Nolan's movies are always a matter of wonder and also it is something an unconventional notes of something which we were not aware about. So that Dunkirk. Let's try point out what are the peculiarities that I am able to find out in this new product from this great filmmaker.<br/><br/>Dunkirk, unlike the other movies of Nolan, is something very different in the sense of writing and direction. We knew the sensibilities and tastes of Nolan throughout his early masterpieces but this one looks completely differ from those dishes. Dunkirk can be simply noted as The Land, The Air, The Sea and The Home. These four phrases correctly apt what the film is about. There we can saw the collaboration of these four factors in its equal appropriations and mixture while the audience never gets off from the seat when the movie goes so slowly and steadily. As we early said the path's deviation of Nolan as a writer and director is completely mixed up with the theme that the movie carries. The audience always wanted 'Nolan Twist' at the end but he already twisted us from the opening with the freshness of the theme that he is going to use. Surround with the cold atmosphere around the place Dunkirk, the audience also get that coldness (not because of the Air Conditioner in the theaters) just because they were also added into the 400,000 soldiers. Their mind to reach out to their residence was the question that arouses each and every frame of the movie. That's why it gets the simple narrative structure and patterns in every course of the film.<br/><br/>Hope and Survival are the key factors that laid the foundation for the plot but actually it can only be relate with the accuracy that these two things are bother about. The first one Nolan wanted to accomplish through hope and survival is the very common needs that a man have to carry throughout his life. Let's forget those were soldiers but just consider them as a mere simple, common human being. For the common man hope is always a weapon and survival is the victory they achieved through that weapon. So here the soldiers are using this weapon to find out their home and when they find it they felt their victorious move over. Once at some point they were searching for some place to hide during that evacuation from the keen eyes of their enemies. They are used to that place because they can't even to go any other place, else. Their suffocation, afraid of the enemies (the plane that surrounds them on the top) makes them the urge to move away from there. So that each and every soldier's eyes were illuminate with the fractions of hope.<br/><br/>Alike, at the time when I wrote my views about the movie Inception of the same filmmaker, here I always wanted to point my hardcore love about the score in this movie, Dunkirk. I pointed early about Hans Zimmers' magical notes while I wrote the review of Inception; I am also wanted to unveil my fascination about him and his composition here also. Throughout the movie there lies the propounding, astonishing background score of Zimmer which gave the audience a fresh appeal to what is going out there in Dunkirk. Each and every frame is circled with small notes of ambiguous outcomes and we just flew into that atmosphere very easily because of these powerful notes. The Super marine music of Zimmer is closely associated with the four phrases that pointed early with its equal togetherness and dividends. Ya, that's something true about, when we enter into the land we receives some sort music ambiance which is completely different from the ambiance of the sea and the air. Zimmer is just trying to find out a collaboration while he composing music for these 'four phrases' but he kept something in his mind, and that is the variety he handled in each section of the movie. Anyway we can simply say, Dunkirk is null without Zimmers' hands.<br/><br/>Hoyte Van Hoytema, the cinematographer also have the level to receive applause when we talking about the movie Dunkirk. Of course, what a wonderful piece of cinematographic work carried out by him like the movements and shots he followed in the Interstellar. Through Interstellar, Hoytema opened up the new visions of space traveling and that ambiance which relates with the simple atmosphere of the village were the protagonists' family resides, and the corn fields etc. But here he just associated only with a smaller area (which seems to be bigger) around the land, air and water. I was very much fascinated about the aerial shots that he used to point about the 'Air's' influence in the 'four phrase'. Undoubtedly this shot can be said the trademark shot in the movie Dunkirk. He can easily handle all phrases with a unique style and it was so appreciable. He along with Nolan helped the audience to get as closer to mindset of the soldiers and the rib of the movie as a whole."
"pipecax","9","2","11","29 August 2017"," Christopher Nolan's ode is a cutting-edge gem of technical art
","Christopher Nolan is one of the almost non-existent filmmakers who keep active excitement with every new release, in this way, three years after his last work, he raises a love letter to war cinema, a mega-production that highlights, in capital letters, an experience that gets by without dialogues, even episodically. Narratively, it's his film less cerebral and ambitious among a gold catalog led by ""Interstellar"" and ""Inception"", however, from the beginning, the story feels warm in its coldness, he assiduously introduces us into the heartless event. The given approach generates partiality in audience opinions since it poses a triplet of plots in parallel: German perspective from their air force planes, the point of view of the independent boat of a veteran and the journey of the main actors through the tragedy, a trio of soldiers who live their own hell. Without falling into subjectivities or appropriations — although director's grandfather was a British soldier who perished in those lands —, Nolan is set at the edge of situations injecting a tempo of the gods, specific dialogues in its effectiveness, and performances denoting professionalism. Being a learned man in the field of selection of tones and objectives for his psychological stories, his greatest strength lies in his form of making movies, here, Nolan displays a new record, one easier to keep pace: Narration in pictures.<br/><br/>The first scene is the best letter of presentation, which will serve as a pattern, for a film imparting intensity. The movie conjures up superlative landscapes, the opening sequence is the entrance of a superb artistic hypnosis, a display of magnificent frames strengthened by a majestic 70 mm and IMAX cameras, the colors and shadows explicit in pictures are which lead the story by far. Functional aerial shots from unsuspected angles, explosions, and gunshots piercing our senses, respectful and quasi-negligible digital effects that ratify the commitment to turn a movie ticket into an absolute visceral experience. Clearly, Nolan film would not be exempt from allegories and metaphors through images; the grayish scum brought by the strong tide is a synonym of human filth, the framing of the soldier taking off his attire and running to death on his own, portraying defeat and pride, the corpses that are buried by snorting wind, the endless lines of men in pursuit of ""salvation"", the palette of blues and greens from the scene where soldiers contemplate an imminent attack, the three men looking at nowhere, the corpses returning to the shore, the covenant between two men burying one innocent under rough sand or the perfect framings of Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy are dreamy compositions that speak through colors, shadows, lighting and setting, a master class of cinematography and photography. The seventh art didn't deliver as such adrenaline and justified action in a non-commercial film for a long time, an artistic and technical triumph. Get ready, because ""Dunkirk"" is going to transcend.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer, a faithful Musketeer, returns recharged and ready to rise with well-deserved awards at the expense of his scores that not only include atmospheric obligations, these try to emulate stressful melody of a countdown, atomic effect of explosive artifacts, meteoric heartbeat or oxygen deficiency of the martyrs, a list of cadences endowing scenes with energy and tension like no other war film. Mr. Zimmer's wonders gain greater strength to the excellent work in the sound editing room, which accompanied by Shepard tone, are exciting. Gunshots are deafening, they are combined with the soundtrack, the crackling of the fire, the teeth chattering of a soldier, the cries of help under the water or the overflight over our heads provoke one of the most compelling cinematic experiences.<br/><br/>I will never forget ""Dunkirk"", the movie that made me lose my record about seeing a film in IMAX cinemas, two words: mind-blowing and memorable.<br/><br/>Some familiar faces go back, flaunting their high acting capacities. Hardy, Rylance and Murphy manage the cast purely masculine, understandable due to the context of the events. Each one offers spirit and personality to their characters to ease the following of the story. The performances of newcomers Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden and new soloist Harry Styles are laudable and rewarding in the skin of children with war uniforms. In fact, Whitehead and Styles make a powerful debut that places them on the radar of quality directors, also in a panorama of acting prestige.<br/><br/>What would be the best words to describe ""Dunkirk""? When the logo of Warner and Syncopy, bathed in a light blue, are unified with the war melodies, my feelings and sensations exploded of delight for the work of Christopher Nolan, creator of cinema with deep fundamentals and objectives. Brimming with complex and magnanimous technical components, intelligent and moving performances, a tremendous soundtrack and unmistakable and always welcome Nolan touch, ""Dunkirk"" becomes one of the best cinematographic experience so far this year, likewise, its function of entertaining for two hours with lights and pirouettes is relegated by the message of peace, unity and solidarity, three constituents not present in our anatomy. Did you think that one of the greatest war speeches in history — promulgated by the British politician Winston Churchill — recited by the protagonist was limited merely to the circumstance of the film?"
"Archie_23","8","2","11","28 August 2017"," An Oscar worthy, intense war drama about the event of Dunkirk.
","Dunkirk, yet again, proves that Christopher Nolan is one of the best film directors of this generation, if not of all time. It is his 10th film and once again - it doesn't disappoint. I liked this movie very much.<br/><br/>Nolan, not surprisingly, chooses to tell the story of Dunkirk in an interesting and unusual way, from 3 different perspectives - in the air, on the water and on the ground. From the first second of the film you are instantly thrown into the action and events of this ""great"" war. And you never really get to relax for the rest hour and forty minutes. It almost feels as the movie doesn't really have 3 acts but is only 1 big act from the beginning to the end. It is a very intense and emotional film and it won't make you feel bored for a second as the story constantly moves forward.<br/><br/>And of course composer Hans Zimmer needs to be mentioned, as once again, his collaboration with Christopher Nolan is amazing. The score in Dunkirk is just incredible, it raises the bar, makes you feel emotional, intense, scared, and it blends perfectly in every scene, creating this intense and powerful atmosphere. The cinematography, lighting and sound is also the highest level.<br/><br/>The cast is fantastic, great performances from left to right, from veterans such as Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy and Mark Rylance to the younger brake-out stars such as Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Bernard and yes I said it - Harry Styles. The movie doesn't show you a certain hero of this story, it is a bunch of people who are trying to survive this horrible event. You can say that it is not as much about the characters and their story as about the incident itself, the main protagonist of this film is the event of Dunkirk.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is one of the best films of 2017 and definitely a worthy Oscar nominee. If you haven't watched the movie do yourself a favor and check it out."

","I have never felt more relaxed in my life. Watching this movie practically put me to sleep, but I mean this in a good way. The director purposely adds a soothing soundtrack of white noise to promote serotonin in the viewer. And the visuals are hypnotic and encourage relaxation.<br/><br/>The brilliant thing about this movie is it has no plot and minimal dialogue. However that doesn't even matter in fact it's intended for calming purposes. The boat scenes are on calm waters with trance inducing waves. The plane scenes are on clear blue skies perfect for a nap. And the beach scenes probably the most relaxing of them all.<br/><br/>IF YOU WANT SLEEP WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
"chaitanya-37157","10","2","11","28 July 2017"," Nonal never disappoints
","'Dunkirk' is well praised and well discussed. But I would point out only one thing. It is a very different type of war movie. It is not centered around a specific individual but it is about an event. It never tries to make you 'attached' to a character. So those who claim that this movie lacks in emotional attachment, are missing the point. It is not made for that."
"TwistedMango","9","2","11","24 July 2017"," Nolan finds new passions and horror in a defining moment of WWII
","Dunkirk comes at a critical juncture in the career of Christopher Nolan. His previous directorial work Interstellar had its moments, but ultimately spun out into a mess of sentimentality and narrative absurdity. If Nolan's decision to helm a film based on a historic event for the first time didn't pay off, he may have found himself dealing with shrinking budgets and suspicious studio heads in the future.<br/><br/>Yet the film breathes new life into the well known story of the mass evacuation of British soldiers from the beaches of France in 1940, and reaffirms Nolan's status as one of, if not the best, directors working today. Dunkirk is able to combine multiple story lines across a variety of locations with a deft touch and an unrelenting pacing that evokes the intensity and desperation of the event itself. This is a less overtly bloody depiction of the Second World War than last year's Hacksaw Ridge, but the threat level remains constant and the action frenetic. The pacing of the script and a tight running time are all elevated by Hans Zimmer's score, which utilizes a ticking watch to give an unnerving feel of time quickly running out.<br/><br/>Nolan continues to refuse to film in 3D, as well as maintaining an admirable practice of incorporating visual and CG effects only when they contribute to the film narrative. This relative absence of CGI and high production values allows for a more visceral feel to the destruction and violence wrought on screen. Combined with the faded colour schemes it serves to give the film a feel of colourised Second World War footage. It has been stressed by a number of critics that the best way to see Dunkirk is in 70mm, though I was still impressed seeing the film on a standard 2D cinema screen. <br/><br/>This balance of spectacle and story allows for excellent set piece events such as the torpedoing of a Destroyer, combined with some strong acting performances throughout. A standout is the always excellent Mark Rylance, portraying a father taking his 'pleasure boat' and two sons out into a war-zone. After Ed Sheeran's woeful cameo in Game of Thrones I was gritting my teeth for Harry Styles. But Styles gives a competent, committed performance and justifies his expanded screen time as a private desperate for survival. The most outrightly heroic of all characters are those in the air reminding an audience of 'how much was owed by so many to so few', and Tom Hardy stands out without overshadowing the film in his role as a stoic Spitfire pilot.<br/><br/>If there are any under utilised actors it's Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton, who serves as more of a mouthpiece for plot exposition than a functioning character. While his exchanges with Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy) do give an overview of the events, there are also some muddles in individual story lines that go beyond the mere fog of war. But as an overall product Dunkirk is a spectacular accomplishment, reminding an audience of the sacrifice and danger of the times. The brief focus on each character could have led to a dehumanising work, but instead connects a raw humanity with the wider consequences and impact of the evacuation.<br/><br/>Nolan said of Dunkirk that he 'wanted to do something that scared him'. This successful embrace of the unknown has expanded his oeuvre far beyond the Dark Knight Trilogy and high concept sci-fi, and resurrected the possibility of Nolan becoming a modern day Kubrick able to excel at any genre he puts his hand to.<br/><br/>https://christophermarchant.wordpress.com/ @BrianInvincible"
"zhangw-18372","8","2","11","24 July 2017"," Most unique war film ever made
","Unlike any other war films which highlight the brutality of the war by depicting bloody nature of killing and cruelty of human nature, Dunkirk instills the fear of human nature. Under extreme adverse circumstance, the weakness and fragility of human emotions could lead to collapse of a full grown adult, even an army.<br/><br/>As an audience, we may easily make rational decisions during the crisis---be brave or even prepared to die as a hero. We may hardly feel how the despaired soldiers felt. But Nolan's film undoubtedly conveys such emotional catastrophe to the mind of his audience."
"its_tanay_here","Null","2","11","24 July 2017"," A movie that will shape the future of cinematic world
","Every great movie consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called ""The Pledge"" (The Plot) – where the filmmaker tries to appear promising. He introduces the characters and the plot: Soldiers, ships, tanks, aircrafts, a perilous war that overlooks, certain death mounting on, bravery, hopelessness, mankind – man and their kinds; basically all that is unbelievable and inevitable during wartime. He shows you all these objects, the plot running, the emotions draining. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, and normal. But of course.it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn"" (The Action) – where the filmmaker attempts to fulfil what he just promised. The filmmaker turns into a magician, and takes those ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. It raises questions about the worst side of humankind – war. Ironically (and hence, unfortunately) war also gives individuals the greatest opportunity to show what it truly means, to be human. You can't comprehend how war, which is our worst action also paves path for our best. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. You're enjoying the ride, but you wouldn't clap yet. Because making you feel and witness the unthinkable is not enough; you have to bring the human side of the human back – you have to merge the plot and the action. That's why every great movie has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige"" (The climax) – where the filmmaker delivers the promise. The part where most filmmakers fail, without this part it would have been an average or a good flick. He turns soldiers into an army of hope, projects war depicting the evil side of humans and the kind side of humans – in all we truly embrace 'humankind'. He confronts you, screams at you, that no man made event will have a disastrous end, there is no such definite peril, as long as we keep the biggest of our weapon alive: #HOPE. He turns time into hope and hope into home and thus transforms what was just a movie into an art of the highest order, in short, a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The filmmaker referred above is 'Christopher Nolan' and his latest unbelievable act is 'Dunkirk'.<br/><br/>It's a credit to the cast that despite the paucity of dialogues, all are uniformly good. Nolan handles all this brilliantly, but what really takes this into another league is Hans Zimmer's music. Relentless, it complements the action ratcheting up the tension to a nerve shredding crescendo. This is a movie based on real events, about mankind's greatest evacuation 77 years ago during WWII. It's an extraordinary undertaking, and Nolan delivers a spellbinding ride. Out of the depths or man-made horror, he's created a gripping tale of human resolve. The event shaped the world back then giving Allied forces the edge over the Axis powers. After, all these years, this movie shall shape the world of cinema from here on. Dunkirk is a landmark with the resonant force of an enduring screen classic. With good 5 months still remaining in 2017, I'm not sure if there is any upcoming movie, which can challenge this magnum opus, if not, the race for Best Picture at Oscar next year could be officially over, quite early."

","Dunkirk may not be the greatest war film ever made, as against to popular opinion where Paths of Glory, Saving Private Ryan and Platoon might be the stronger contenders. It is not the best of Nolan the story-teller as Inception and Dark Knight will always remain the best. Dunkirk is a whole another beast from the world of cinema. It is messy, chaotic and sometimes incomprehensible, yet a beautiful jumble of visuals. This is the masterpiece of Nolan the director.<br/><br/>The evacuation of Dunkirk has always been portrayed as the aftermath of the blunder of Allied forces in France. For Great Britain, it was a moment of survival and resistance that helped them to swing back against the Nazis while for the French it was a humiliating instance of defeat and betrayal from its allies. Christopher Nolan, whose every other movie was either adapted screenplays or original ones, Dunkirk marks the first biopic and thanks to him, the vital stand of Dunkirk will be remembered by the modern generation once again.<br/><br/>One should not buy his/her tickets in the hopes of enjoying yet another Hacksaw Ridge or Fury. Dunkirk is about survival with fewer bullets and blood and it is made by one of the greatest living movie makers of our generation. Prepare to be immersed into the crucial hours of the soldiers on the beaches, the pilots of the Spitfires on the sky and the civilians on their rescue yachts.<br/><br/>On the downside, if you are so much into that, Dunkirk has no memorable characters on its fold, except for Mark Rylance and Fionn Whitehead. Strong character developments were always been Nolan's signature and one might miss such a quality in Dunkirk. Still, it is passable since what he has prepared is beyond words..."

Two of those minutes were in the opening scene of the movie, but after that... Man oh man, was I thrilled. I was literally on the edge of my seat from beginning end.<br/><br/>The negative critics have misjudged the movie because of a lack of understanding. Any lighting issue was trivial. ""Thinking"" solves the chronological issue. It only required a few seconds rational thought to understand the issue once it was made obvious.<br/><br/>Now concerning the matter of character depth, I do wish that the first kid you see had more development... That might have helped the film rating-wise. If I could, I would have given it a 9.8/10. But considering that the movie was not supposed to be about one person, or a small band of brothers, but the event as a whole, I don't think that the film required a strong lead.. Although it might have made it better. It's still a cinematic masterpiece. Go see it. 70mm IMAX if you can. Standard IMAX at least. The score was amazing. The mixing was pro.

","There are those that will attend Christopher Nolan's new World War II film DUNKIRK expecting to see this year's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or HACKSAW RIDGE.  You know, the kind of visceral, blood and guts, shaky- cam, true-to-life experience that modern movie audiences have come to expect from war movies.<br/><br/>These people will, more than likely, come away from DUNKIRK disappointed for that is NOT what this film is.<br/><br/>What this film IS is another reinterpretation of a genre film from the modern master of reinterpretation - Christopher Nolan.  His war movie tells the story of the 400,000 soldiers that are left stranded on the shores of Dunkirk - with no means to escape across the English Channel - at the beginning of WWII.  This is a defeated army that is just trying to survive and that is what this film about - nameless/faceless soldiers just trying to survive.<br/><br/>As such, there is no real hero amongst these soldiers.  They are all young men (boys, really) who just want to go home.  Their struggles are real and realistic - which will, probably, alienate the jingoistic members of the audience.  There really is no ""good guy"" to root for and Nolan, wisely, keeps the German forces off the screen.  They are just as nameless/faceless as these troops on the beach.<br/><br/>As often happens in Nolan's films, there are multiple story lines intersecting each other's with timelines overlapping and doubling over each other.  In addition to the story of the troops on the beach, there is the story of the Armanda of civilian vessels that are crossing the channel to rescue the troops.  This part of the story is anchored by the always watchable Mark Rylance as a resilient civilian who will not waver from his assigned duty.  The third leg of this stool is Nolan regular Tom Hardy as a fighter pilot who is trying to keep the air clear of enemy fighters to give the Armada time.<br/><br/>These interlocking stories are told almost as a silent film.  There is precious little dialogue  and Nolan decides to ""show"", not ""tell"" what is happening - and this is a wise decision - as the Cinematography, from Hoyte Van Hotyema (who also was the Cinematographer in Nolan's INTERSTELLAR) is breathtaking.  I saw this film in Imax with a gorgeous 70mm print and the colors and images were deep, rich and moving - I expect Academy Award nominations for Cinematography and Editing coming from this.  If you get a chance to catch DUNKIRK in 70mm, I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Since this is almost a silent film, the score becomes a very important element and Hans Zimmer, once again, does not disappoint.  His music is driving, incessant and unnerving - adding to the tension of the troops on the beach and the efforts of those that are trying to save them.<br/><br/>Nolan's direction is sure handed and he has an unwavering vision that gives DUNKIRK a look and feel unlike any other war movie I have seen since, maybe, Terrence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE.  If you set your sights for an experience similar to that - a rich tapestry of sights, sounds, action and acting - as opposed to a visceral, jingoistic hero- laden action/adventure then you will be in for a treat, indeed.<br/><br/>Letter Grade:  A<br/><br/>9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
"Jellybeansucker","7","2","11","22 July 2017"," An experience that puts you there
","Dunkirk is made as an 'experience', trying to put the viewer there and experience the same terror and foreboding as the troops. The evacuation plan was a quickly thought up emergency plan to try and get as many troops back home as possible. There was little real expectation it would work as soon as the Luftwaffe started bombarding the sitting targets. The expectations were that the entire German military forces would descend on the beaches and annihilate them. Churchill evidently said getting 40,000 back home, a tenth of the number stranded there would be acceptable. They got 300,000 back. <br/><br/>The British sent in their RAF fighter squadrons in what was in effect the prelude to the Battle of Britain and for Nolan it was a great chance to show in modern movie technology the breath taking dogfights between 109s and Spitfires in the way that 1968 movie The Battle of Britain couldn't. For me the best part of the movie experience was the Spits giving the German military machine the first and rare demonstration of machine and combat equality. Unbeknown to the frightened and later angry stranded land troops was the fact that Britain was fighting their cause out of view in the skies, and preventing their expected annihilation. The air battle was the most decisive challenge to the Germans in the Battle of France with the French planes already blown out of the sky and the French army hardware in the form of tanks mostly still in transit to the north.<br/><br/>This is a different movie from the norm made by a film maker known for his experiments on the screen. Dunkirk is no exception and it will inevitably alienate some who crave a normal linear narrative movie with characters they can relate to. The format chosen here will not give you this character or story depth. If you want that then maybe the movie Dunkirk released in 56 is the better movie for telling the whole story. Dunkirk 2017 is a loud and visually stunning event allowing you to witness the action and fear of those troops their country tried against tough odds to save. With the most emotionally engaging part of the movie the huge fleet of little boats sent in to pick the troops up, many sailed by their civilian owners, you get a taste of the Dunkirk Spirit, thanks in large part to the stirring performance of Mark Rylance. <br/><br/>A big film about a very important episode in the history of War War 2, if not the most illustrious or glamorous or victorious episode for the allies, and one left more to history books and TV documentaries rather than movie makers to inform us of. It cried out to be (re)made in modern style to remind people of the sacrifice of both troops and civilians and how precarious the allied cause was in the early stages of WW2."
"mel_bear","9","2","11","22 July 2017"," A perfect movie ruined by an irritating soundtrack score
","I was eager to see this movie before word of mouth circulated. I managed to catch it at a preview showing a day before general release. I saw in on the large screen with Dolby Atmos.<br/><br/>The film was breathtaking and the aerial photography were some of the best I have ever seen in movies. OK we are in the digital era but the blending of the real and unreal (topped with lots of shaky camera work) was very impressive.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have highlighted the great acting, great period costumes and makeup, and great (authentic) locations. So I ask Christopher why, oh why, he ruined a masterpiece with a ridiculous contemporary pulsating beat soundtrack that relentlessly played virtually throughout the whole movie. There were plenty of sound effects and those would have held the movie without something not remotely in period. This was made even worse near the end when the music built up ready to burst into some great British anthem (Land of hope and glory / Enigma variations / etc) and fizzled out with something inappropriate. I wondered if he was trying to capture a younger crowd. At my session the audiences age would have been 35 plus.<br/><br/>Anyhow this Dunkirk should be a must-see for all ages."

","I have just got back from seeing the film. What can I say? It was intense and lived up to the hype.<br/><br/>The film has no frills, no character development, no backstory, there is no love interest and indeed there is very little dialogue. It's simply a story of essentially four small groups of people – one from the Army, RN/Army officers on the Dunkirk mole, a Royal Air Force fighter patrol and men aboard one of the little ships. I guess the Royal Navy is a fifth group as they are naturally pretty much ever present, invariably adding something to each of the stories – largely as a result of their ships getting sunk having repeatedly put themselves in harm's way to try and get the Army home.<br/><br/>One immediate thing I noticed was at the very start when a few lines were used to explain what was happening; it was not the Germans attacking and surrounding the French and British – it was 'the enemy'. Okay. that seems a little silly but I guess we are all friends now so.<br/><br/>I was a little confused near the start as one minute it was daytime and the next it was dark or heading that way. However, it quickly became apparent that the action is not strictly chronological. By the way this way of telling the story makes it look like the RAF patrol shoots down half the Luftwaffe, but one sees some of the scenes more than once from different viewpoints. This jumbled timeline idea actually works well.<br/><br/>The film doesn't seek to tell the story of Dunkirk. The French are acknowledged - holding the perimeter along with a British rear-guard. Amongst the limited dialogue, there is reference to the German tanks being halted, the Luftwaffe being given the job of destroying the BEF and their French Allies, expectation that 30-45,000 British troops only are expected to be rescued, and that the RAF are trying to conserve aircraft and pilots for the battle still to come. But enough of the story is told through the trials and tribulations of the individual groups and the brief dialogue to make clear what is going on even if one knows nothing about this episode in history.<br/><br/>I was expecting some sort of soundtrack what with Hans Zimmer being involved but instead, during the action, there was a sort of noise as opposed to a dramatic music score. This worked really well too and added to the intensity.<br/><br/>How did the film fare on the trembling bottom lip front? Well there were a couple of occasions on which it was a good job I had the Kleenex on hand – I wasn't emotional you understand, I just had something in my eye.<br/><br/>In summary - a great job Mr Nolan!"

"dncorp","4","2","12","22 July 2017"," Why Dunkirk Happened
","After World War 1, the Spanish Flu Pandemic killed most of the Prime Combatant Age 17 to 29 year olds that would fight World War 2, leaving the Old to take care of the children, this decimated many of the World's Large Militaries.<br/><br/>After World War 1, the French spent most of France's Wealth on building concrete fortifications, as the Maginot Line. Very little was spent on the French Military (Men and Equipment).<br/><br/>The 1929 to 1939 Global Great Depression occurred, most Nations were Bankrupt and spent their Nation's money on everything except their Nation's Defense, while Chancellor Hitler spent most of the Nation of Germany's money on building up the German Military. The Japanese Military built up.<br/><br/>The Modern German Military easily defeated the French Fortifications of the Maginot Line, by bypassing the Maginot Line thru the Belgium Forests. The French Fortifications Weapons could not traverse 360 degrees, the Germans sieged the French Fortifications of the Maginot Line and waited for the French starvation to force the French at the Maginot Line to Surrender, because there was not much spent on the French Military (Men and Equipment) the French Military was still using World War 1 Equipment and the French Military was very small (numbers of men). <br/><br/>The small French Military (mostly Infantry) and British Military (mostly Infantry) attempted to stop the German Blitzkrieg from bypassing the Maginot Line and were crushed by German Modern Armor (Tanks) and Mechanized Infantry, the survivors then fled to Dunkirk (not a Port, water too shallow), instead of Calais (a French Port). Most British Ships were in convoys going to and from the U.S., most British Aircraft were providing Air Cover for the Strategic Supply Convoys from the U.S..<br/><br/>The British Empire was collapsing, the British Empire lost most of the Strategic Resources for British Manufacturing, Fuel for Aircraft, Ships, and Vehicles. The British became heavily reliant on Democrat U.S. President Labor Intensive U.S. Military Defense Industrial Complex for even food to feed the British Civilian Population.<br/><br/>Most of the British Officers failed to take the initiative to regroup most of the ""able bodied"" (not wounded) Armed Soldiers (over 330,000) into Units and attack the German Wehrmacht at the weaker flanks. This lack of British Officer Initiative allowed the Germans to attack south then move west, and then north to completely cut off Dunkirk. Just as British General Montgomery failed to destroy the trapped German Army at the Falaise Pocket after the Normandy Invasion, resulting in the disaster of British General Montgomery Operation Market Garden at the Netherlands as to where some of the German Army escaped to from the Falaise Pocket, the other part of the German Army that escaped would be used during ""The Battle of the Buldge"".<br/><br/>The German Wehrmacht Blitzkrieg was primarily attacking south towards Calaise, not towards Belgium, and supported by the Majority of the German Luftwaffe.<br/><br/>The majority of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) were Hawker Hurricanes (709) as cheaper made of cloth and wood, and not the more expensive Supermarine Spitfires ((372) made of ""Al-e-min-e-Um"", British pronunciation. Aluminum costed as much as gold. The RAF Spitfires would be withheld to ""the Defense of the British Isles"" Only (Battle of Britain). Both looked the same from the ground at a distance, except the wings rectangular on a Hawker Hurricane, elliptical on a Spitfire, both sounded the same as using the Rolls Royce Merlin Engine.<br/><br/>German Navy's Focke Wolf 200 Condor Anti Ship aircraft with low altitude bomb sights to attack surface vessels not Luftwaffe Heinkel 111 with Higher Altitude Area Bomb Sights. Most of the German Luftwaffe's Heinkel 111s were bombing in advance of the German Blitzkreig, and the Messerschmidt BF-109s were doing ""strafing"" as air to ground attacks, as the French Air Force and the British Air Force at Belgium and France were defeated before the German Blitzkrieg Attack. Using the German Navy's FW 200 Condors meant less German Luftwaffe He 111s diverted from the German Blitzkrieg.<br/><br/>With the Japanese Invasion of China, and the French Colonies at Asia, the French Lost the Strategic World's Rubber at their French Indochina (Vietnam) Colonies to the Japanese.<br/><br/>At the U.S. the U.S. Defense Budget was severely cut, the U.S. Military was stuck with Obsolete World War 1 Equipment, 1911-1929 Battlerams (not Battleships) at Pearl Harbor, Oahu, U.S. Territory of Hawaii. While the Modern German Battleships of the Bismark and Tirpitz were launched with radar guided guns. The Japanese concentrated on the New Projection of Power of Air Craft Carriers, and built the Modern Battleships Yamamoto and Musashi. The U.S. Battleship Admirals that controlled the U.S. Department of the Navy refused to acknowledge that the Days of the Battleship as the Projection of Power were over, and continued to spend most of the U.S. Defense Budget on building Battleships.<br/><br/>The U.S. Military was mostly used as a Social Program to House, Feed, Cloth, most U.S. Citizens of the 1929 to 1939 Great Depression.<br/><br/>The Majority of the U.S. Population were National Socialist Democrats, that strongly believed in Germany's National Socialist German Worker's Party, a Political Labor Union, and demanded U.S. not Enter the War at Europe, as U.S. Isolationism. Henry Ford of Ford Motor Company had stated his Support of Germany's National Socialist German Worker's Party, and denounced the Jews during his Speeches all over the U.S., printed copies of the easily discredited Blame the Jews for Everything Conspiracy Theory ""Protocols of the Wise Elders of Zion"" to be given away free to those that attended his Nationwide Speeches.<br/><br/>""Repeat the Same Mistakes and Expect A Different Result"", as after every ""Armed Conflict"" or War the U.S. Cuts the U.S. Defense Budget (U.S. Military, U.S. Intelligence Agencies, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Civilian Defense Contractors, other U.S. Government Defense Related.) from over 20 percent to about 11 percent, as setting up the U.S. Defense to Fail."

"LarksTongue","6","1","4","25 March 2020"," A hollow WW2 film.
","The age old saying for me is that ""has it aged like a fine wine"". This movie for me has not at all. Many people here have rating the movie 10/10 (saying it's as good as Godfather etc.) Many of the reviews were when it came out. They argue that the production design and sound mixing/editing transport you to the war. Yes that's great and all but it kind of is expected from a modern WW2 film with a 150 million budget. Some even argue that the lack of emotion and character building is the intention which is quite simply asinine in my opinion. Seriously you would rather have this movie than the same movie with relatable, likable characters? Movie could have worked a lot better if it was a straight forward narrative.<br/><br/>Setting is a one character not the only character in a story. I get it they have to wait to be rescued and feel paranoid/fear for their life. Great what else? Nothing. I literally don't remember a character besides Kenneth Branagh/Cillian Murphy but that's only because they seemed to have had the most lines of dialogue and are big names. Let alone the obvious reduction in scale as others have said, just look up Dunkirk and see the casualty list. All could have been added with CGI but Nolan is approaching levels where no one challenges his production anymore.<br/><br/>The movie is very imbalanced (3 separate stories) and is everything I'm hating in movies. A massive spectacle that where the movie is written around the spectacle itself. Nolan didn't write a story about a set of characters in the Dunkirk setting. He wrote a movie of Dunkirk and then wrote characters that could fit into it. It's like I'm watching a Wikipedia page movie.<br/><br/>The worst scene in the movie that really bugged me showed the complete lack of emotional binding characters was when Cillian Murphy accidentally kills the child (PTSD) on the boat. The driver barley cares he just sort of looks at it happen and just goes on despite the fact he let the kid come for some dumb reason anyways. Come on 10/10??? Give me a break."
"mgd_m","4","1","4","10 January 2020"," Such an imposture
","The good: cinematography; metaphysical tone; some beautiful, artistic sequences.
Now the bad. - It's not thrilling, as someone says. - It's inaccurate, because there are a couple of moments in which soldiers do idiotic things no soldier would ever do (such as running away from the fire instead of sheltering behind houses). - It's quite ridiculous in the stripped down depiction of the beach: a couple of thousands of soldiers, ten vehicles, three planes. You know, the real thing was 100 times bigger. - Charachters have no background, and are not charachters in a true sense. - The dialogues have always been the worst part of Nolan's movies, and here are no better: naive, and full of exposition. - The storylines are even worse: what the heck with that young guy on the boat? Why should I care? The feeling is that Nolan is making up some easy-gripping situations, and mashing them together with no real structure or motive in a pandering movie. - The editing and the pace are a complete mess. The movie is quite boring, and having those split timelines is a clumsy and confusing attempt to add some value where it's missing. But the result is even worse, because you don't have just a dull story, now you have a dull and messy story.<br/><br/>Now the huge fault of Nolan and the critics praising him is that they are stripping cinema down to something very simple, very unintelligent, packed in something else that pretends to be artistic and witty. That's an intellectual crime. There's a whole generation out there that believes Nolan is the greatest director ever, while he can be very millenial with this supercifial and pretentious approach. Gimme Private Ryan every day. It's not so much artistic and not so much fake-intellectual, but it's accurate, cares for details, it's spectacular, it's thrilling, has a real structure, real emotions, and real characters.<br/><br/>Ps: I forgot the music. Amateurish attempt, again, to inflate the value of prolonged scenes by the use of annoying sounds, which span continuosly across several scenes with no hint of matching the editing. Some will say it's art, I say it's an easy way to fool the audience and aggrandize the mess."

"garyprosser1","8","1","4","27 June 2019"," Visceral and intoxicating.
","Chose to rewatch Dunkirk tonight for two reasons. Firstly, it was the last day it was available on NowTV and secondly, I wanted to see if it transferred well to the small screen, having seen it in the cinema first time around. Well, for the most part, it does.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan set out to make a film about the infamous withdrawal of troops that was as accurate as possible. Reading up on Dunkirk, it becomes clear that while historians and experts on the operation can and will find fault, many of these inaccuracies were either intentional in order to allow for artistic licence (the German plane liveries, the lack of real characters, etc), underplayed (the role of the RAF) or embellished (the role of the 'Home Fleet').<br/><br/>The latter of the three can be read two ways. The popular image is that thousands of pleasure boats, yachts, schooners, tugboats and rowing boats, skippered by civilians, crossed the Channel and brought everyone home. The reality is that just 5% of the more than 330,000 who were evacuated from Dunkirk came home in such vessels. Now, that shouldn't be sniffed at; we're still talking about more than 16,000 men who may otherwise have died on the beach in France.<br/><br/>To his eternal credit, Nolan recognises this fact and other inaccuracies. In interviews, he was at great pains to explain the need for a director to balance realism with dramatic narration and in this regard, I feel that he succeeds because Dunkirk is, for the greater part, a very accurate telling of those 9 days. It is also tremendously watchable, gripping and, though it feels like the wrong word, entertaining.<br/><br/>The tension throughout is palpable. At Dunkirk, the men were sitting ducks waiting to be rescued as the enemy closed in on land and in the sky. We, the viewers, feel this sense of ominous dread throughout, interspersed with moments of intense action, death, pain and hopelessness as the seemingly impossible task of evacuating so many men slowly grinds into action. We feel the desperation of soldiers who just want off that beach, to be away from the bullets, the bombs, the noise.<br/><br/>The noise. Dunkirk won Oscars for its sound design and sound mixing while it was also nominated for Hans Zimmer's score and rightly so. The audio is utterly integral to the film's sense of foreboding and dread and it never lets up. The screams of planes and men, the shuddering impact of the bombs, the stinging smack of bullets into metal and flesh; I vividly recall being in the cinema and wanting it to stop, praying for the noise to cease so I could think straight. Just imagine what the hell it was like being there at the time. Hell.<br/><br/>Similarly, the score adds layer upon oppressive layer to the cinematic experience. Zimmer provides the sweeping orchestral score that underpins all great war films whilst making inspired use of an audio effect known as The Shephard Scale. Google it for a full explanation but in essence, this is an illusory effect achieved by stacking several scales on top of each other, all rising in pitch at once. As the high notes drop away, the low notes replace them, tricking the listener into thinking that the music is constantly rising in pitch. The effect, especially when the sounds of war boom over the top, is incredibly unsettling and brilliant. There were reports at the time of cinema goers feeing nauseous and even throwing up just from the soundtrack. Cinema doesn't get more visceral than that.<br/><br/>Watching Dunkirk, one often feels like one is viewing everything through the eyes of a shell-shocked soldier. Dialogue is intentionally sparse (and sometimes feels a bit too corny, too 'Hollywood', when it arrives) and the action often feels like it's taking place over in the distance. That is until it roars up on the characters and the audience and suddenly, the fog of disorientation lifts and we are plunged straight back into the mayhem of trying to survive in dreadful circumstances.<br/><br/>No one character is the hero. This isn't one man's story but an obsessively considered and thoughtful retelling of the whole incredible saga that was Dunkirk. It is open to debate what would have happened if Dunkirk had failed but if it had, we would have had a very different war. At the time, the British Empire stood alone against the Nazis. America hadn't yet joined the war and Russia still had a peace treaty with Germany. Surrender at Dunkirk, with the loss of 200,000 British soldiers, would have put huge pressure on Churchill to make peace with Hitler. Would he have done so? We will never know but in the aftermath of the miracle of Dunkirk, Britain was galvanised and Churchill would go on to make his famous promise:<br/><br/>""... We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender...""<br/><br/>As a historical retelling, Dunkirk is mostly spot on. As a piece of cinema, it is quite brilliant and frequently overwhelming. As a chapter in history, the real Dunkirk spawned a million heroes whose story deserves to be told as well as Nolan has told it here.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

If you hate how loud it is, how about you go fire a real gun and see how loud THAT is? It's really freaking loud. What the movie did is a more realistic take on what guns and planes sound like, because other war movies and other movies with guns and explosions don't make the sound nearly as loud as real life.

","I remember sitting in the kitchen as a child, eating a banana and suddenly wondering where the seed was that would make another banana tree. I asked my mum and after a moments hesitation she pointed to one end of it and said, ""Think it's there, within the skin."" Of course she was wrong because all edible bananas are seedless. There're sterile.... Which conveniently brings me onto this film.
I'm sorry, but it misses the mark I'd expected from Christopher Nolan. I won't go into the story-line but if I did, it wouldn't matter because really there isn't one worth mentioning. All right, look, basically, it's about a group of boy band members with non military style haircuts trying repeatedly to get from Dunkirk to England. Our main character starts by needing a poo (literally) that he never actually gets round to and ends up back in old blighty sitting in a time travelling train (that was made in 1978 and miraculously taken back in time to the 1940's). That's pretty much it. Famously, there are no computer generated special effects used in this movie, and probably because of that point, it's just not right. Dunkirk itself feels deserted, not a place where 400,000 odd troops and additional civilians have been corralled. The beaches look clean, bereft of disregarded machinery and smack of directorial orchestrated choreography. Have a look at the Dunkirk portrayed in the film Atonement for what must be a more accurate setting of the sheer organised chaos of the Dunkirk beaches. For me, the film never really recovered from that feeling of sterility. For example, when the ""armada"" of civilian ships turned up to save the day there were all of 12 in shot, hardly a heart warming representation of the 850 or so that actually arrived. I watched it to the end (I'm paid to watch films in a quality control role) and found a couple of redeeming features. The last few minutes of the film I found beautiful, so much so, I played it repeatedly. A mix of imagery, Edward Elgar music and Winston Churchill's ""Fight Them on the Beaches"" speech. The other thing I found interesting was the editing, which is not chronologically sequential (a bit like his earlier masterpiece ""Memento"", but not as overwhelming).
Oh, the music. You know that sometimes you can tell when Hans Zimmer has been inspired? Well this lacks inspiration. He uses increases in tempo to add tension to a scene. That's okay maybe once in a film, but repeatedly? In my book that shows a bit of laziness and fatigue. The Elgar piece at the end is really the only time it was a pleasure and worked with the imagery for me. All in all a disappointing 5."
"a666333","4","1","4","3 April 2019"," Tries to be ""artsy"", doesn't amount to much
","I appreciate when a film-maker tries to do something different. In this case, we have someone thinking or pretending they are doing something different. We get a non-linear story line that jumps back-and-forth in time. We get some moody, underplayed music instead of loud, militaristic music. That was a bit refreshing at first. We get an emphasis on the lower ranks struggling to do their tasks and survive. We get little insight into the larger picture or how the situation arose in the first place.
In the end, it still boils down to a low key propaganda film. The Germans are entirely faceless and amount to some kind of vague encroaching evil force. The British are very human, vulnerable, forgiving and guiltless and yet heroic. Just so perfect. In the end, this is another WW2 propaganda film wrapped up in a different package and tied off with the obligatory Churchill speech. I say different as it is different than more bombastic propaganda such as Saving Private Ryan but it is not original. Frankly, it reminded me of the remade Battlestar Gallactica. Stylistically, it is a close relative."
"JDBFilmReview","5","1","4","18 March 2019"," Explosive Blank
","Upon seeing the first trailer for Dunkirk I was captured. I was careful to observe the release date so not to miss the premier. I entered the theatre with a heart full of convicted patriotism and pure thirst for a blockbuster, critically acclaimed mega movie, whose film poster would be worthy of a high-valued portion of real estate on my game room wall. As if to be a frantically filled cannon, loaded in the heat of battle, the film fell short of its target.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan is a cinematic master. This film is absolutely stunning to perceive. Bullets hissing past an unassuming victim of the onslaught. Masterful explosions erupting like a glorious volcano. The sound of panic in the air as enemy planes target the beach. It transports you right into the war zone within the first 10 minutes of the screening. This is where the movie nails it. However, apart from that, I have several issues with it.<br/><br/>
The film is from the perspectives of three positions: Air, Mole and Sea. The editing at certain points feels lazy and not very consistent. It cuts from a dramatic scene or intense action scene very quickly without warning or notice.<br/><br/>
The film is told in a non-linear way. This makes us watch certain scenes twice, through different perspectives. Although this could've been done in a very interesting way, it's very difficult to keep track of whose perspective we're watching at times. Even when certain semi-important characters die, it took me a while to even realize this happened.<br/><br/>This is where my third and final problem comes into question. The characters lack depth. You don't care about the main character, or any of the other soldiers that are dying. If I'm watching a film about war, I like to bond with the characters I'm seeing on screen. When the final scene of certain war films takes place, there is a strong emotional connection for the viewer. If there is no attachment to a character, the viewer won't feel said connection.<br/><br/>All in all, Dunkirk could've been amazing. Dunkirk should have been amazing. I left the theatre with an emptiness and desire for a film that would deliver power and conviction that was even more present than before."

","Dunkirk is not a great movie by conventional standards, it is great a category of its own.

That may sound like a bad thing, but I can't think of any other movie that has accomplished this feat. It is something that needs to be experienced once, and possibly only once as I do not believe I could suffer through the experience again in a theater."

"aprilwilson-18440","10","1","4","30 September 2018"," Loved it
","I've read other reviews and all they are doing is nitpicking the basic movie bloopers such as the shipping cranes along the beach. 
The Battle of Dunkirk was a horrible ordeal when France was taken over by Nazi Germany and the British needed to get their troops back to the island. Yes, they only showed 3 Supermarine Spitfires flying throughout the movie and left out the Hurricanes that also helped, but there are roughly 113 Spitfires left. The factories were making them as fast as possible but keeping them on the island in preparation for the Battle of Britain which occurred in June 1940. 
Honestly, I can continue and entire history lesson on Dunkirk and Britain since it IS my research field. I think Nolan did a good enough job expressing the anguish each level of soldier faced by not including much verbal communication. War is not a time to be a chatty Cathy. All Brits are amazing at queuing so yes, showing the soldiers in lines is what they did. 
Every ""weekend sailor"" vessel was commandeered by the Royal Navy in order to rescue as many troops as possible. Yes, the Luftwaffe harassed them along the beach, I mean, that's all they knew how to do. 
You can not compare war movies from various eras either. Plus, the cast was used specifically to target non British markets. Tom Hardy, Kenneth Brenaugh and Harry Styles are popular names in America, but in Britain, they would have watched this movie even if new and inexperienced nobody's were in it. 
Before you watch it, please research the topic. No movie will be perfect and 100% factual but Nolan did a pretty good job in my opinion.
All the Brits I know love this movie, as do I and I am an American, but a British maritime and world wars historian."

","[...] ""Throughout the film Nolan creates an almost claustrophobic feeling of uneasiness and an overwhelming sense of helplessness is always present. No one feels safe, no matter what their rank is and how important or not they are. There isn't any safe places, enemies might attack at any moment and there's suspense from the first minute to the last. Two of the elements that help create a constant tenseness and suspense is the cinematography and music. Instead of relying on dialogue, it's a film with little dialogue and sometimes there are scenes that play out for several minutes without audible dialogue - something that isn't too usual in today's big budget commercial cinema. Which is both a bold and interesting choice in my opinion. Sometimes, just like in real life, facial expressions, body language and actions can speak louder than words."""

A view of humanity, survival and the human condition during the war. <br/><br/>I do suggest you watch it once to understand what the movie is; then wait a week and watch it again.

"cwade22","3","1","4","8 June 2018"," Yay! Let's watch soldiers flee like cowards!
","The Germans Won at Dunkirk! It was embarrassing loss for the Allies, mainly the British. Why would anybody make a film about an embarrassing British loss? Maybe a German director, but why would a British director want to portray such a masochistic loss? I don't like losing when I play video games. I don't like watching cowards run away. And some of the coward British soldiers called a fleeing French soldier a coward! And who let Harry Styles in this movie?! I had many reasons to avoid paying to see this in cinema! Glad I didn't waste money. Watching it on demand in hbo right now. It's very boring and laborious. One thing I know, don't get on a ship. And the dumb Brits rescuing Brit soldiers from water actually go BACK to the war! Without weapons! That's absurd! Be brave, but be smart, too! The Germans should've sent Straffing planes to kill the soldiers. Stuka only gets points like bridges and ships, but strafers get the infantry kills. This battle was an epic win for the Germans! Why would anybody make a film about this? Maybe a documentary, but a film? Again, this battle was a loss for the British. Making a film about a losing battle is risky. I guess if you're british and love England, you'll like it, but it's still a loss. Harry styles? I gave it a 3 stars because the cinematography and other Details are quality! But it's a very tedious and laborious film. I guess if you like the German side in this war, you'll like the movie, but you'll get bored, too! It would've been great if Joker and Batman and Bane came into the film. That would've made it entertaining. I'm Joking. As a history fanatic with this war, I already knew Dunkirk was unworthy for a film. And if you see the non stop retreating and cowering, you'll get bored, unless you love Seeing men retreat and show cowardice. I'm reiterating the same points, but that's what this film did. Reiterate a big allied loss scene by scene, minute by minute."

","The British Empire and their allies are have retreated to Dunkirk Beach in France to hideout from German attacks during The Battle Of France in WWII. While they're hiding out it's up to Prime Minister Winston Churchill to send three strands of carriers via land, sea and air to rescue these soldiers and bring them back to safety.<br/><br/>Under the direction and script by Christopher Nolan, ""Dunkirk"", based of of actual events sends us back to May of 1940 to WWII in the beaches of Dunkirk where soldiers were stranded and it's up to the military to evacuate them whether by air, land or sea. What makes this movie stand out is the unlike most Nolan films that go beyond the two hour mark, this film has been down-sized at just a bit about the 1-45 minute mark. In the end the old quote of ""less is more"" stands true here with a film not heavily dependent on dialogue and the actions scenes that are scarce, because anywhere past the two hour plateau, this movie would've been overkill. In the end who needs a film with overly done dialogue or gratuitous carnage to tell its story? this is a refreshing war film that can tell a story without going overboard just to get a cheap reaction, but instead to show a real depiction of war being that the fear waiting to be rescued could be just as scary as being injured or killed.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" is divided between four groups characters with various locations on this isolated beach. They are all stranded in the same time frame and in the duration of their time they are either rescuing people or they are trying to escape the beach. The film is ensemble based and that there is no individual character taking the centre stage. The narrative will guide the viewers about the details of each mission without ever spoon-feeding us or insulting our intelligence. Sure there are those traditional film watchers who might not decipher the whole scope of the film and might dismiss the film as being both confusing and tedious. For those who love and maybe even those who are not fanatic about war there is plenty to enjoy in terms of drama and thrillers the film was executed professionally by an iconic director.<br/><br/>Sure there will be the hardcore warheads who will feel cheated because they wanted to see bloodshed and carnage and brutal fight scenes with guns, grenades and explosions. Well, sorry to trouble you, there will be not much of that. But for those who want to see a real depiction of the war and the characters, it's natural that the characters will offer little in terms of communication. Due to the fears of trust, the horrors they've encountered and restlessness, the beach is not customized for socialization. Stories like these don't need explosions, blood and graphic details to get its message across. Just the narrative of going through the topic of evacuating the stranded off Dunkirk is quite sufficient. By keeping it real and doing the essential research, you can see why it won three Academy Awards.<br/><br/>In its duration of 1 hour and 46 minutes long, the dialogue is only about 30 minutes long total and sure enough fans might be bored of that. But what makes up for the scarce dialogue is the isolation and the intensity of survival on this beach. And being that it takes place in WWII, I think we can all get a grip that the fear of when and where the enemies will strike. Thanks to a haunting score by Hans Zimmer, the score generates quite nicely to the fear these characters are enduring. As audience members we know what is to expect from the back stories, but we can still picture in our minds the graphic scenery these soldiers have endured. Therefore, with grandeur music that upstages the dialogue, it makes the narrative all the more efficient in its storytelling.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" is war film that is original in terms that it doesn't depend heavily on graphic bloodshed, frequent gunshots and explosions or heavy dialogue. But the music background and the intense atmosphere, complimented with stunning cinematography, this movie is well suited t be a collector's addition being more of a drama film as opposed to a war film. If you want to really get a better grip of the style of direction Christopher Nolan is noted for than this movie is for you. An award-winning film released at a time when the award season wasn't featured."
"marty8","1","1","4","14 May 2018"," Horrible movie
","I was surprised from the start from the lack of any plot or character development. Yes, we know the ""plot"" is that the Germans had surrounded the allied forces, but there were no scenes that conveyed the fighting, retreating, or the sense of desperation. Just a huge empty beach with lines of men close to the water. This is hardly any more dramatic than lines of men at a soup kitchen. <br/><br/>A soldier (who didn't bother staying with his unit) clung to the rafters of a pier while listening to senior officers talking. So what? There is a French ""infiltrator"" among British troops. The British clearly got the first tickets out, and resented the fact that a poor French bastard didn't want to stay in Dunkirk. Big whoopee. There was a soldier who suffered from PTSD. *Yawn* A rescue boat was in an oil slick that could have caught on fire, but (of course) got out of it in time. *shrug* There was a plane that somehow never ran out of gas until the very end of the movie. *woot*<br/><br/>Early on, a troop-carrying ship passed one rescue ship. Nobody said a word. Later in the movie, a troop-carrying ship passed a lot of rescue ships. Everyone went crazy and whooped. Didn't the single ship deserve some attention too?<br/><br/>There was absolutely nothing exciting in this movie. The director did nothing to engage our attention. He made a somewhat interesting subject as boring as it could possibly be. The reviewers who gave this movie positive ratings don't know what they're talking about.<br/><br/>This movie almost made me wish the Germans had invaded Dunkirk because it sure as hell would have made for a better movie than this. Total waste of time."

I love movies that are made like a Great Classic Symphony - The true Art of Cinema. My favorite being Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" or movies like ""Thin Red Line"". I always hated films that are nothing less than a stage play with one-two shots to let us the audience follow the story.<br/><br/>To me the camera must move, the music must move, the story must move like physically moving, like a great Road Movie. That's Cinema and true Art.<br/><br/>Dunkirk could have taken place in Mozambique and been a story about two brothers escaping a local tripe that wants to torture and hang them, and their only safe heaven would be getting to Seychelles by swimming if necessary. Its how the film has been portrayed in pictures and music that matters. It is this flow and the symbiosis that makes a Great Symphony. A work of Art.<br/><br/>And that is something very few films manage to accomplish, but Dunkirk did.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a Great Symphony.<br/><br/>Go watch it!

Dunkirk manages this quite effortlessly and then some. At the end of the 106 minutes I was both exhilarated and relieved. What a pulse pounding thrill ride ! Quite unlike anything I have ever seen.<br/><br/>There is not much dialogue in the film. Nolan manages to make the visuals do all the talking. He has crafted some of the most epic scenes I have ever seen in a war movie. In fact not just in a war movie , in any movie ever. This has got to be one of my favorite movies. The violence is kept to a minimum. It doesn't rely on it but rather on it's visuals and haunting imagery.<br/><br/>Nolan is known for exposition in his works . I have not been a fan of that and thankfully it's non existent here. This movie is all about war and characters trying to survive in it. The sound design is just incredible. Hans Zimmer's score is innovative and keeps us on our toes. Also impressive is the structure .....but the less said about it the better. It's better to find out for yourself. I love Nolan's insistence on practical effects instead of using CGI. The sequences on the beach , the ship and the sky are all spectacularly filmed. It is impressive how Nolan has put this all the elements together. Kudos to him!<br/><br/>The movie is also supported by a great cast. The lead young actor is stunning. So is the rest of cast Harry Styles, Barry Keoghan, Mark Rylance , Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy who all bring their A game.<br/><br/>Yes the movie may not be for everyone. The characters don't have a backstory, we don't know much about them. They are sometimes indistinguishable in the middle of the battle scenes. The traditional drama is kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>These are all conscious choices of course on the part of the director. It's clear that he wants to immerse us in the war and this is how war is. Characters you meet don't share their life story , war scenes are generally chaotic and most often you don't know where you are , forget about others.<br/><br/>This is probably Nolan's most mature work. Might not be a stretch to call it his best."

This movie literlaly graps you by the throat,. It makes you speachless for minutes.

And even when he runs out of fuel, still is able to destroy an German fighterplane trying to kill helpless people on the beach. Its were the civilian with his little motorship (excellent played by Mark Rylance) insits on helping a drowning British fighterpiot while risking his life.

"mihai-36234","10","1","4","24 March 2018"," Collective Emotion and Visual Masterpiece
","Amazing cinematography. 
This is a movie which has to be seen. 
Yes, there are no well developed individual characters. 
However I think this was intentional. The intent I think was to describe a few collective characters. 
The emotion was there - I actually cried many times during the film. It's about the collective characters of british soldiers, of the british people, soldiers, commanders, nurses, etc., involved in the whole thing. 
And that the individual person actually doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things. Many individual soldiers might day. 50/50 chance maybe. But their individual contribution - taken together with others' actually matters a lot. 
In the end it tries to be I think quite accurate historically on the feeling picture and see it from that specific time. When no one was actually ultra happy or victorious because it was just an evacuation. 
Visually it's great. 
The soundtrack is great and actually makes the movie. Seems to be one take with no pause, which is impressive. <br/><br/>I think the director tried to convey the general feeling at the time, historical accuracy on that level (not on microlevel), and a collective emotion. . And a bit of artistic movie making. 
Instead of general entertainment - a love story + explosions and triumph. like Pearl Harbor for example which I also liked a lot but for different reasons. <br/><br/>I also missed more action in this movie. At least from the commanders part - some planning, discussions, etc.."

","Dunkirk is a taut arty recreation of Operation Dynamo that took place between May 26th and June 4th, 1940 where Britain managed to rescue about 400,000 of their own and allied troops that were encircled by the Germans and trapped on a sliver of land on the coast.<br/><br/>The operation is famous for its use of civilian craft and the sheer number rescued after the humiliating defeat on the mainland. It inspired newly elected Prime Minister Winston Churchill to make his ""we will fight them on the beaches"" speech.<br/><br/>The Good: Christopher Nolan has shown himself a brilliant director since ""The Following"" in 1998 and simply has not been as on top of his game as in this film. He uses, what could easily be a gimmick, an anachronic order of three separate time lines told simultaneously. I usually dislike movies that are not told in a simply chronological order but it simply works brilliantly here fitting both the material and the stories told within.<br/><br/>The movie is also a wonderfully minimalist affair with music used sparingly to create a great effect when it does appear and a taut running time that bluntly is a relief. Too often both war epics, recent Christopher Nolan films (I am looking your way Interstellar) and ""important movies"" in general seem to pad the running time to a kidney-busting three hours packing every piece of flotsam and jetsam surrounding the main story hoping something sticks with the audience.<br/><br/>The acting and cinematography are also top notch. The air combat scenes filmed with real fighter aircraft of the era are a sight to behold and simply a triumph.<br/><br/>The Bad: While the anachronic order certainly does work brilliantly upon reflection of the entire film, one can find it disorienting during the actual viewing if one does not expect it going in.<br/><br/>Nolan does an incredible job recreating the time period using actual ships that were at the evacuation and filming on the actual beach. However, his refusal to use CGI does create a city of Dunkirk that is remarkable intact compared to the actual city of that day and a beach that is not strewn with the hundreds of tanks and thousands of vehicles the British and French abandoned. While that is certainly excusable as an artistic choice the modern seat patterns on the train are a surprising anachronism.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: As the son of a man who survived the blitz and a grandson of a Royal Navy officer, I am certain my tearing eyes and warm feeling during the film will not be shared by all. It is, however, even for those with no personal connection, a brilliant combination of direction, cinematography, and music that is a filmmaking triumph. One of the best film I have seen this year."
"arandonnelly","10","1","4","19 March 2018"," Best Movie of 2017
","Dunkirk is an absolute modern masterpiece of cinema and by far the greatest movie of 2017 in my opinion. It should have won Best Picture and Nolan for Best Director in my opinion. It features such a mesmerising authenticity in its depiction of war as well as brilliant acting, directing and music.It astounds me with its realism and authenticity in its depiction of war, survival, bravery and heroism. To me, it's Nolan's best film since 2008's The Dark Knight. The direction is fantastic, the editing and sound effects are fantastic, the acting is fantastic and Hans Zimmer's score is breathtaking. The only problem that I have with this movie is the lack of depicting the French and their bravery ay Dunkirk, focusing a bit too much on the British. They did build a wall at Dunkirk to fight off the Nazis and to help the British and Allied troops escape, something that the film disappointingly left out. Even then, despite that one flaw, it is still a masterwork of modern cinema in my opinion and to me, by far the best movie of 2017."

"krish-thorcode","10","1","4","19 February 2018"," I know why many found this movie boring
","This is the first time I am writing a review.
Why everyone found it boring? Because, the movie basically was dialogue-less, fiery-fighting-scenes-less, and had very few elements that could vapourise into the eyes of the viewer to define it to be a war-movie.
The movie was not about a war, to be precise. It was about the human- how divergent the subjective decisions of different individuals might look like objectively, during a colossal phenomenon, threatening the life of many- including that of the subject himself.
Some sacrifice, some put their own lives on the lines to help others survive, some just want to survive.
It is a take on the human thoughts and an analysis of deportment at the time of crisis.<br/><br/>I also expected it to be full of violence, but it was rather a very unique approach towards filming war into a movie.<br/><br/>I suggest everyone to watch this movie and evaluate it with what the movie wants to deliver and not with your own expectations, which most probably will be superseded once you engage into it as an actual viewer.<br/><br/>Thanks"

","Those who are criticizing this movie for one are unable to follow the complex storyline and it takes a bit of time to figure out the storyline. <br/><br/>The movie itself demands concentration and attention span far longer than an average peace of CGI s.h.i.t. that is coming out of Hollywood in recent years. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the building up of tension and actual dog fights without CGI. I saw this movie right after USS Indianapolis and there is no comparison. <br/><br/>USS Indianapolis is contrived, un-watchable CGI mess with asinine typical vomit inducing back stories so we would ""feel"" for the main characters. <br/><br/>Yet in Dunkirk if one really gets into the movie, one can feel for the characters.<br/><br/>Those Bitch-ing about CGI not used, grow the F - - UP.

","After more than 1,500 reviews I will simply state was bothered me the most about this film: the color. Come ON, guys! Life - especially war - is NOT a computer game. Therefore, it should NOT look like a computer game.<br/><br/>Dunkirk - as well as most of the north of France - is gray. Even when the sun is out. The first thing that struck me - as well as my sister, who's married to a Frenchman from Lille - was how colorful the place looked. It looked more like Antigua than Dunkirk. And what about the sea? The sea in that region is a permanent gray-green color. In this film it is a bright acqua blue that would put the Caribbean to shame. Even when it's cloudy. Everything scene is tinged by a cartoonish shade of blue. The first scene on the beach was so lifeless in its computer like quality it was awful.<br/><br/>I was so much looking forward to watching this film. But the Dragons and Dungeons aspect of the whole thing was so distracting I could not concentrate on the story. Pity because Dunkirk was one of the most remarkable episode of WWII. It should be treated with more respect.
I guess this is, alas, further proof that the film industry had gone to hell in a plastic bag. I much prefer to watch films like The Longest Day than this mess."

Yet the story works, with the action swelling like a wave, then suddenly delivering a slap in the face. From above, we see a pilot ditching his damaged Spitfire in the sea, and the procedure runs smoothly; later, another flier does the same, and we stay with him as he lands. A tumult of water rushes toward him and fills the cockpit at alarming speed, while he batters on the canopy above, which refuses to slide open. Smoothness, viewed from another angle, collapses into the roughness of panic. All becomes darkness and deluge. Humans turn into creatures of the deep. A pale hand flickers like a fish.

"adean81","7","1","4","4 August 2017"," Dunkirk
","Dunkirk Review<br/><br/>While this is a really good movie, Dunkirk is not your typical war film. It's not about heroes and winning battles but rather a movie about survival. The end message is that surviving a war is simple enough, you don't have to have won. The movie is about the British evacuation of Dunkirk, and the German's bombing them before they can do so. Like other films that director Christopher Nolan has done (ex. Memento), the movie is not told in a linear or chronological order. There are three stories going, that don't intersect until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>There are the characters on the beach that are trying to leave on ships that keep getting bombed. Then there are the civilians from London that sail to Dunkirk to try and help rescue men. The third story is the shortest and that's the Airman shooting down the German planes, to prevent them from bombing more ships. It's not a complicated story line but it helps to know that each story is not taking place at the same time until the end.<br/><br/>The movie is not driven by dialogue, in fact, there is little dialogue. Instead, the sound and spectacular visuals are what drive the story. The sound of the guns and bombing contrasted with silence are there to give a sense of experience to the situation the characters are facing. Because the movie is not about winning a war, it has no real political agenda or alliance. In fact, we never even see any German soldiers up close. The details of the war are not what Nolan focuses on which is what makes it a very different war film. <br/><br/>As far as the story goes it's very compelling and sad to see the characters trying to do their best to merely survive and get back home to London. Overall this is a good movie, but you should go into it knowing what to expect. It's a movie that slowly builds tension and has little dialogue between the characters. It's a drama, not an action movie that is meant to engage the audience in the experience of the events that take place."
"smjacoby-53923","7","1","4","4 August 2017"," Good but could have been better
","I love history and World War II especially, so I thoroughly enjoyed the historical aspects, realism, etc. The air battle aspects were very good (Stuka dive bombers, Henkel bombers, Messerschmidts, and Spitfires). The story related to the small boat that came over to Dunkirk was very good. However most of the coverage of Brits wanting to escape showed them to be almost to a man, self-serving, uncaring (about others), etc. and although that's human nature, it did not put them in a very good light, and perhaps unfairly. There were supposedly 400,000 men looking to escape from Dunkirk, but even in this CGI age I don't think they ever showed a beach shot with more than one or two thousand men on it. And I don't think the most encompassing shot of small boats from England ever had more than 15 or so boats in it. I just don't get why they did not create what I would assume to be a more realistic picture of the magnitude of the effort. Finally, the story was not ""linear,"" i.e. we figured out later that they were showing the same dive bombing or other event all over again from a different perspective (but minutes, not seconds later), or the same person hours before. I'm open to such approaches, but IMO it did not help with the story much. So all in all, I'm glad that I saw it but was hoping for a bit more. The air warfare was the best part. I guess I think the best parts are those that showed men the most willing to sacrifice and who displayed the most honor and selflessness. Perhaps in this day and age that's not so much in vogue."

","It's not a film about war, it's an experience, you just not watching the film about war, but you feel your in the war with the characters. At times it feels like three different movies about Dunkirk all spliced together, cause three story lines are very well depicted here. Characters are not to developed, but the film pulls no punches and gets right to the war, so it was meant to be more on experience and less on development. I like the idea it's less focused on gore, and more on action.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan once again proves what an awesome director he is, he wants the audience to really get a feel of the movie, basically what he does with all his movies.

"jdesando","Null","2","13","19 July 2017"," An elegantly-made war story for the whole family.
","""Wars are not won by evacuations."" Winston Churchill <br/><br/>By that reasoning, no epic film should be made of the evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk beach in May 1940. But this is at least the second rendering, giving wunderkind writer/director Christopher Nolan a chance to create depth for the evacuation of 330,000 troops during a curious lull in the German advance. Nolan has personalized the war even better than Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Germans thought a few of their Luftwaffe could just pick the troops off ""like fish in a barrel,"" thus having no need for Panzers or Nazi hordes. Well, they were wrong because about 800 private boats joined in the rescue, making the common man the hero in an otherwise soldier-dominated WWII. I would have liked to hear some of the German side (I can't remember when ""German"" was even mentioned). Yet, Nolan prefers to leave the enemy unknown and therefore making it existentially more horrifying.<br/><br/>As we've learned from Nolan's cinematic gymnastics, he can take time and switch it around as well as his virtuoso camera. He takes several points of view including three evacuating soldiers and the captain of a small vessel, Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance). In the latter, Nolan is especially effective at revealing the characters of Dawson's son and best friend and the rescued, shell-shocked soldier (Cillian Murphy) in the confines of the small boat. As for the volunteer RAF pilot, Ferrier (Tom Hardy), his cockpit contains all the action of an IMAX geographical documentary and textbook treatment of heroism and claustrophobia.<br/><br/>Where Nolan does not impress is his choice to restrict context so that young persons may not even have an idea this is WWII unless they carefully read the opening titles. By minimizing the dramatic action, Nolan also creates an un-epic story by restricting the context. A more satisfactory drama would be a distributed exposition through dialogue with commanders and politicians as well as the grunts.<br/><br/>The romantic Spitfire dog fights with Farrier, a skilled pilot, are just that—imaginative battle scenes that help give some epic moments. However, the sweep I would have liked came in Churchill's response to the evacuation: ""We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender."""

"nelleke-97387","5","2","14","22 July 2017"," Men's world of Dunkirk ??
","Dear movie watchers and makers, dear Christopher Nolan, <br/><br/>Today I watched, in Holland, the movie Dunkirk, with great expectations, because I love movies and storytelling,I even do some minor work in it myself.<br/><br/>Of course you, gifted Christoper Nolan, did a great job in directing and intermingling several story lines, and it all 'landed' spectacular at the end! Great techniques, good atmosphere of the landscapes, boats etc. Actors were doing their jobs well, although there wasn't a lot of acting required.<br/><br/>I was interested in this movie because of family stories on WOII. We visited, as a child, many of these regions with our father. He shared a lot about WWII with us, his children.(he was taken by Germans and fled away, submerged, likewise his brother. This brother volunteered as a soldier in Indonesia (1945),in the wish AND illusion of being a hero, but history decided different on that!)<br/><br/>Thoughts on war in the direction of heroism I had to leave behind as I was about 13 years old. My teachers and parents kept telling stories about all the TRAGIC.These were the stories that were, to me, REAL. Somewhere,in the movie Dunkirk, I was missing this REAL story, although I'm convinced you all did you're utmost to create it.<br/><br/>Why is it for me so important that these stories are well told, and why I slowly got the feeling that the focus went to something else? Am I right to put it this way: wasn't it slowly turning out to become a men-made demonstration of new techniques? I mean like real- life sensations and insight in the feelings of the men in spitfire's, tanks, or boats? Is this the right focus on war? The real story? In wartime, Mr Death is a cruel lordship, as we all could see. But somehow Mr. Death had, in Dunkirk, too much charm. The real story is: It's not heroic to die in war, as the movie at the end seems to have told us. It's just very, very tragic when it comes this far.<br/><br/>BESIDES Don't we all feel that it is utter nonsense to follow a boy that survives some like three or four major strikes in streets and on boats? Boats that sink under terrible circumstances? Most of the time he even is INSIDE the boat that's full of water?Ever tried??? NO, you won't survive. It's a fairy tale. I don't buy it, because it's just made up for the story line. Of course he would have died at the very beginning, like all his mates. Somehow I didn't buy the fact that he showed up all the time in situations that were hopeless. Why working on this edge, and making hopeless situations heroic? What's the point of that??? (if it's not a fairy tale or myth or something like that, that speaks to the soul!) I'm very afraid that this romanticism is exactly the prelude for young people to think that war can make them heroes. War makes DEAD heroes, and as we are longing more and more for heroism, we WILL get our next war. Let's be brave in daily life, this is hard enough, isn't it? <br/><br/>And yes, sadly enough, the heroes of war often are just MADE heroes, as the boy in the newspaper. Most young men die of stupidity of choices that are made by their superiors or low instincts of others around them. Don't forget the money that's involved, or some other undercover deal or mission. I know a lot about major mistakes of the resistance in Holland during WWII..and inside quarrels. Dunkirk did show some of it, but it lost ground as it became part of the heroism.<br/><br/>What about the brave men at the dock? How could they be brave? They cannot be heroes of their own. That's the deep tragic. In war there is no OWN decision. You're in a machine that roles on. Which way? You can never tell. You cannot know how it will end, so you even don't know, during the war, if you really ARE at the RIGHT side. <br/><br/>SO Was it compassion and deep understanding that set the TONE of the movie?? Maybe you tried, Christopher, but somehow I think, I lost track. I don't buy the feelings you put into this movie, because for me, it's no good to cry victory on an enormous pile of death bodies, made by modern techniques. There must be other important tales to tell. I'm working on it, and of course I can tell you that's no easy task, because so many things in life do actually distract us, all, and our focus IS hard to keep. Certainly"

","This is in my top 10 movies this year but it's not my best top pick (which is a shame). It was still pretty amazing glimpse into such a minutiae true biopic story line. The film started off amazingly explosive especially in a seriously epic sounding cinema (wasn't encoded in Atmos but still epic for sound geeks like me). The bullets just start whizzing pass your head like you're there with the actors struggling to break free. Just superb how Nolan does that with the audience start to finish.<br/><br/>Every single minute is just cross weaving through 3 different timelines of day from 3 different perspectives (Sea, Land and Air). I think I loved the Air/Spitfire scenes with Tom Hardy the most with dog fighting with the Germans. The film volume and bass was turned up so loud the screening I was in, that it felt like you were in the cockpit shooting Germans down and feeling the explosions as bombs drop. The FX guy should definitely pat himself on the back, he did a more superb job compared to Hans at times.<br/><br/>The score by Hans Zimmer was epic👌🏻 although it's not his best work. His score just drives the film forward with intense emotion of making you try to get out with the largest on screen extras in film history. In fact the ticking watch that provokes you into feeling the action scenes you hear through out the film, is actually Nolans recorded pocket watch which is a nice little gesture to add in (not many people realize this).<br/><br/>It's not normally Nolans genre but he did a great job on expressing such an intense and gloomy war plot. Did I say there isn't much dialog provided for the actors. It's because he wanted to express the story in such a way you walk out of the cinema thinking ""Wow that was intense!"". Not realizing you just witnessed half a silent film portrayed in special effects noise and music bombardment. That's what Nolan does best with Zimmer and I'm hoping to see more of this filming in the future.<br/><br/>I do want to head back to Nolans old school ways of filming in 35mm and IMAX 70mm cameras. I think I'm the only reviewer in here annoyed by him doing this for this film. I seriously believe this movie should have been filmed with 8K Red Digital cameras so the picture is beautifully clear with richer colours, dynamic contrast and doesn't get distorted at times when there isn't 70mm shots. Especially for those cinemas not catered to the 70mm film projectors. Either completely film it in 100% 70mm or don't so the format will be.<br/><br/>Realistically does everyone have an IMAX projector at home? no!. None of this and I repeat none of this film completely sucks you into the picture making you want to see it in IMAX (that's just my opinion). There is way too much ocean water, sand scenes and close ups of actors faces to suggest an IMAX viewing. There are way too many people riding the bandwagon in saying ""Go see it in 70mm IMAX! because you don't get the full picture"". I'm telling people to go see it in a theater with the best sound system setup like Atmos, even though it wasn't encoded for it. It will use the surround sound tracking and bass way better. <br/><br/>His past films like Interstellar or Dark Knight were used perfectly in those IMAX panorama Alien world type landscape shots or large scale buildings in the background. Where your eyes are busy looking around the screen comprehending the beauty of the shot. His techniques for this film should have been done on 8K Red captured cameras. I say this because it was completely in the way the movie was scripted to use more of the sound emphasis to build emotion of intensity.<br/><br/>It was great but over-hyped,,,,yes. Went into it thinking it was going to be beyond amazing, but those little things ticked me off hahaha excuse the pun (you'll get what I mean when you hear the score)."

Above all, the movie portrays Hope. It doesn't allow you to lose hope, no matter how bad a situation keeps getting. It makes you believe in humanity. The ending scene where Farrier saves the people at the Mole, the scene where Tommy reads the newspaper on the train, the scene where the people at the station start cheering the war heroes, despite the men thinking that they would be welcomed with nothing but pitiful glares, the ultimate final scene where Tommy just looks up...

The clock ticks away rapidly in this nerve shredding war story, and yet, Christopher Nolan manages to make time stand still in a film that will leave you breathless.

"Gordon-11","Null","1","5","16 August 2017"," An very effective cinematic experience
","This film tells the story of 400,000 British and French soldiers in the Second World War, who were stranded on a beach in Dunkirk, surrounded by German troops. Their only hope of escape diminishes with each passing minute, as the rescue ship and the only pier gets frequently bombed by the Germans.<br/><br/>I say that ""Dunkirk"" is no-frills because it does not show any body parts flying around in merciless battles. It does not need the gory scenes to show just exactly how traumatising and senseless wars are. The soldiers are constantly under psychological threat, as they may be shot or bombed any minute. The beach is so very exposed, there is nowhere to run to. The scene when bombs rhythmically explode on the beach, and each one getting closer to the viewers is very effective. That is quite enough to stun viewers into silence. There are many brief but very effective scenes, such as the final Tom Hardy scene that last for only a few seconds and it is not even in focus. What makes it so profound is the unsaid. The scene in which Cillian Murphy asks for the final time how George is doing is very moving as well, as the boy keeps calm and forgives for the collective good.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is very effective as well. The sound effects are akin to what can be expected in a horror film, creating heightened suspense and deepens anticipation.<br/><br/>It is safe to say that ""Dunkirk"" will drive many people to tears.

All with financial and critical success. Dunkirk is my least favorite. From the technical standpoint movie delivers, but when it comes to delivering true depiction of survival,war and event itself, the movie fails.PG 13 rating is just not enough to show true horror those soldiers endured. War movies are very tricky to direct, and it is either great or bad. There is no middle ground. Viewer has to able to feel in their gut what those people experienced. I just did not find this movie intense and for me it did not look real. I've been thru 4 years of war and I know what Im talking about.

"ljmg-36621","7","1","5","5 August 2017"," It is good, but it definitely has problems.
","It is definitely a good movie, but there are a few things that I didn't like. As you may know, Nolan presents the story of what happened when over 400k soldiers were trapped in Dunkirk during World War II and he decides to tell the story from three different perspectives: one from the ground at the beach, one from the air with a few pilots trying to keep away German planes from the beach and the fishermen that tried to help the soldiers to get away from the beach.<br/><br/>The cinematography is outstanding. The film looks amazing and the sound mixing is beautiful, except for the fact that some sounds are extremely loud, like the sounds from the planes when they are hearing them from the ground. I get that those sounds need to be louder but those were exaggerated to the point that they were bothering me and every time they appeared I was hoping that those scenes were over as fast as possible, something that isn't good for any movie.<br/><br/>Nolan decides to tell the three stories that are happening at different times and I think that that's where the movie struggles a little because at times I was confused because I didn't know exactly which characters we were looking at that moment. There was a time that it was daytime and at the next scene suddenly it was night time and then the next scene was daytime again and that threw me off a little.<br/><br/>I didn't want to talk about the acting because we all know that in a Nolan film it is expected to be great, but I'm going to talk about a casting choice that had a lot of people worried and it's Harry Styles. I didn't expect he was going to be that good. He showed a lot of emotions and was great overall, especially in the scene where (no spoilers) they're inside of a boat they find.<br/><br/>I would've liked the movie a little bit more if the narrative wasn't structured in that way, and some people liked it, which is fine, but I didn't. Is not that I hated it, it's just that they could've done it better. Either way, I recommend anyone who is reading this to go see it because it is worth your time."

But the soul of a film is its story. Unfortunately the story of dunkirk is very simple and weak for a film. Thats why after watching the film we feel something not right. Nolan could have taken a different war story which is much more intense, engaging and nail biting and this story should hunt us after watching the film and that makes a movie a masterpiece. and this didn't happened with dunkirk."
"omerfarooqali","8","1","5","3 August 2017"," A visual treat that lacks compelling characters and dialogue
","Dunkirk was definitely a great movie but I'd hardly call it my favourite Nolan or even Nolan's best (not in terms of directing but holistically as a standalone film). In fact its not even my top three war films.<br/><br/>merits: This is a visual film. the imagery is brilliant. the cinematography breathtaking and the score is hauntingly beautiful and in fact complements the visuals to create near Hitchcock level suspense. <br/><br/>disappointment: There isn't even a single strong character except perhaps the pilot. But my point is there is hardly any dialogue in the film to genuinely empathise with the characters. This is a major setback i think. Maybe it was intentional but a war epic is nothing without melancholy dialogue. speeches; soliloquies; dialogue exploring characters' backstories; dialogues expressing fear, resilience, these are essential elements of a good war flick case in point full metal jacket and saving private Ryan. there is hardly any sustained dialogue beyond a few words from every character in this movie. Also the plot is completely event driven rather than driven by storytelling from the perspective of a protagonist. I guess I enjoy character driven plot and maybe the great war films in the past have set the precedent quite well and so I was a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>Regardless, one cannot overlook the visual achievement and I can bet they will bag the sound mixing Oscar at the very least. Still I really wanted a strong protagonist to tell a compelling story that has been a staple of previous Nolan movies."
"arunshank","7","1","5","2 August 2017"," Christopher Nolan makes a quantum leap with this movie
","Christopher Nolan makes a quantum leap from the unfathomable multiple dimensions of deep space and indefinite time in the Interstellar to a very earthly magnitude of colored grains of sand and the cold waters of the beach of Dunkirk and the moist air of the English Channel. Nolan's sets a tone with a deft, neatly skillful and quick moving triphibian – Land, Sea and Air – interwoven but disjointed narrative. The movie is a tableau of action set non linearly with the story coming out of the nuances of expressions from the actors with little importance for dialogue. From the looks of it, Nolan did not intend it to be a reference for History, if one is looking for a historical account then this is not the movie. Nolan says that if one is looking at the movie with a historical point of view then there are inaccuracies which he stands by - one of them being - the yellow nose paint on the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. Nolan wants to tell a story and in the plot there are always going to be things that may not be accurate, it is the human responses to situations that has driven the movie, it is not about the war, it is about the British. This is more a movie of experience than war itself, this is about the stark terror and shell shock of people that is seen in enclosed spaces in the thick of war. One can see how war has gotten on to the mind and body of the people at Dunkirk when they duck or lie down flat on the ground when the German bombers Junkers Ju 87 spatter the beach with bombs. The movie is with fictional characters and it gives Nolan that much free hand to deal with emotional and other aspects of the story line, the kind of which one may not come to see in historical war movie - maybe we should see it in the light of the recent Brexit and see if there is message in the movie. As I see, the movie has a dig at Churchill who chooses to evacuate the British first and not publicly say that. This is not a standard war movie, it is not about the war, it is about the grit at war time, it is about the resolve, courage and move ahead attitude when decisions are taken, it is about the strength of character shown by people. Nolan's experiments with time is well known in his other movies - Inception, Interstellar, Memento and Following where we see that he loves anachrony, here in Dunkrick he has that much less freedom to experiment, but still does it with the Mole, the Sea and the Air, to his credit he manages to show time moving at different speeds at these different spaces. This is not a plot driven movie, it is a happening, occurrence and participation driven movie, more than concentrating on the carnage and destruction of war, the movie brings in the intrigues of the mind of people and how either quick changes in decisions are made or not made as the situation demands. It is more than Operation Dynamo we get to see here, ironically with no justice whatsoever to the statistics of Dynamo wherein the number of British soldiers evacuated was 185,000, number of French soldiers evacuated 121,000, with 25 destroyers out of a total of more than 150 ship and several 100 fighters planes lost – so don't go in for a crash course of history in this movie, like I said it is about the involvement of people in the war, rather than the elaborate descriptive narrative on the strategies employed in the war by the Allies and the Axis. The Sound has to have a special mention here, it has been dealt with great expertise in the movie, not only the presence of it but also the absence of it at times is the hallmark in the movie, the ever frequent crescendos and upsurge in the noise in the beach - the noise of the Stukas Junkers Ju 87 bombing the beach has been done with great accuracy. Special technical expertise has been concentrated on the sound track to recreate them with instinctive reality to give us a picture of the chilling effect that it could have had on the solders whose only chance against the German Sturzkampfflugzeug dive bombers was chance itself. The movie is a loop where one can think of the end as the beginning, considering the enormity of the Operation Dynamo. The movie pushes through on heroism of war in the subtlest way possible and yet effective to have an impact on the viewers. The movie was half way into production when EU referendum for Brexit was on, the analogies are there for people who look for unintended messages. Briton standing tall in the WW II and what was to come after Dunkirk was the Battle of Britain and talking of BoB, 20 th Century Fox has Ridley Scott to direct the movie Battle of Britain. In all Dunkirk reminds us of what Leo Tolstoy said – the two most powerful warriors are patience and time."

","For anyone who does not know what happened in the early years of WWII this could well come across as an exceptionally well-crafted fictional period piece. There was a short text preamble that said British and French troops had been forced back to the coast by the enemy. No mention of when or why they were there, or even who the enemy were.<br/><br/>The film certainly has bouts of dramatic tension, and there are the expected triumphs and tragedies. There being such little dialogue has created a visual and aural masterpiece. I wonder if a cut will be made that has all the dialogue removed just leaving the soundtrack and sound effects.<br/><br/>There are 3 narrative threads: these are sometimes sequential, at other times they overlap and sometimes they jump back and forth in the time-line - quite confusing.<br/><br/>There are some marvellous flying sequences and I particularly appreciated (to my layman's eye) the minimalist use of CGI.<br/><br/>With the almost faultless attention to period detail that sets this film apart from many others set in WWII it was ruined by a glaring anachronism near the end when railway carriages of 1980s/90s vintage were used, complete with Formica tables and ghastly British Rail upholstery, and not a compartment to be seen anywhere, which I believe was the norm in 1940s.<br/><br/>I had expected more from this film."

"rs403404","8","1","5","29 July 2017"," Good but Not Great
","Christopher Nolan has proved himself to be one of the most talented filmmakers of his generation. However, like every filmmaker he has his quirks. ""Dunkirk"" is the first time Nolan has attempted a movie with real history behind it. It's rare to get a World War II movie that takes place before the US enters the war. Yet, somehow his quirks shined through here louder than ever before.<br/><br/>Nolan's war epic is filled with memorable characters played by actors who are regulars to his films like Tom Hardy as an air force pilot, Michael Caine in an uncredited voice cameo, and Cillian Murphy as a shellshocked soldier. The film keeps the names of characters fairly vague, perhaps because many of the characters don't have an exact real world counterpart. Rather each character is created from the experiences of real life people, which is a skilled technique to maintain the integrity of events while limiting the actual characters such that the movie doesn't feel bloated.<br/><br/>We also get a completely brilliant score by Hans Zimmer who once again knocks it out of the park. He is easily one of the best composers for movies ever. Zimmer always seems to know the exact note to hit to get you emotionally invested.<br/><br/>However, not every trait of Nolan's can be considered good. Sometimes he can make some of his weaknesses work to his advantage. Although I like good dialogue as much as the next person, he has a tendency to rely entirely too much on it to rather that using visuals. This worked in a film like ""Inception"" where he needed to convey a set of rules in a clear, concise way to the audience. However, it didn't work as well in The Dark Knight movies. And it definitely doesn't work in ""Dunkirk""<br/><br/>And while Nolan has become a much better action director since ""Batman Begins"", his action scenes still have little to no lasting impact. ""Dunkirk""'s action all lies within this ""meh"" area. You can get invested in the characters and that causes you to care what happens, but the actual action just seem to happen then ends with little or no fanfare.<br/><br/>Finally, Nolan seems to have tried some sort of artistic editing with this film. Time jumps occur inexplicably that break up the narrative and jolt the audience out of the experience. The movie is for the most part very linear in it's narrative which makes the random time jumps all the more baffling.<br/><br/>Still, this is a good movie. More on par with ""Interstellar"" as far as total quality than something like ""Inception"". It's not one of Nolan's best, but even a weak Nolan film is better than what most studios put out by a wide margin."
"OlieRendch","Null","1","5","27 July 2017"," Visually and audibly stunning but the unorthodox narrative didn't always work for me personally.
","So Dunkirk is the great Christopher Nolan's first film based on a true story, the evacuation of Dunkirk in World War II. No dreams, no memories, no sci-fi; and yet completely Nolan. <br/><br/>The first thing I have to mention is, of course, the directing. If you've seen Nolan's films and enjoy his aesthetic, his style and direction then Dunkirk hits all the right beats in that regard and more. I really felt like I was in this film. I felt like I was on the windy overcast beach, I felt like I was aboard the little English boat, I felt like I was clinging to the wing of a Spitfire. There was no Hollywood fluff, research had been done; things looked and sounded like it is. So like what I said about Interstellar, this film was more like an experience than a movie. Helping this, of course, is yet another amazing score by Hans Zimmer, using a constant ticking throughout and tense musical tones build up a perfect atmosphere.<br/><br/>Acting wise, Dunkirk has a stellar cast with Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy, alongside newcomers like Barry Keoghan, Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles of all people. But one of the interesting choices Christopher Nolan has made with Dunkirk is that there isn't a great deal of dialogue; there are conversations and lines obviously but mostly you have to engage with the film through visuals alone and that's where the actors do really well with their literal acting in expressions, how they carry themselves and reactions to things; all hard to do but I felt they all did a really great job.<br/><br/>Now, something I have to say about Dunkirk is that it has a very unorthodox narrative. There isn't really a beginning, middle, and end; neither is there really a main character. I felt that this sometimes worked but other times I felt a little lost into where and when we were in the film. So although the film looked and sounded great, the experimental style choices Nolan makes with the story didn't always work for me. I admit I wasn't particularly riveted during a lot of what is a true-story WWII battle. The two best parts for me was the opening, which I really loved; you're straight into the situation and I just really liked first act in general. Then my attention was refocused during the last act which I enjoyed and the very last few scenes were really well done. Don't get me wrong, there were moments and scenes during the main bulk which I enjoyed a lot but as a whole, the unusual nature of the plot and restrained dialogue didn't grab me.<br/><br/>In the end, I'm very glad I've seen Dunkirk because it is a very unique film. It doesn't feel like a move, it feels like an experience, like a segment of life, literally an event, which this was. I've thought a lot about a rating and to be honest I feel like you can't fit this sort of film into any sort of rating system really so I won't. Anway, if you're a fan of Christopher Nolan or World War II, or cinema then you'll get a lot out of Dunkirk; if not, then I'd be really interested in what you think of the film as it proves to be quite controversial."

If this had been longer and shown more of a retreat to the beach on a grand scale it would have set the overall panic/stranded tone better.<br/><br/>Never the less, worth while seeing and definitely worth a trip to the cinema for the sound effects on their own!"
"mr_bickle_the_pickle","8","1","5","23 July 2017"," Christopher Nolan is back at it again...
","The film doesn't have much dialogue. But you don't really need it, cause Christopher Nolan really captures the feeling of the war. The visuals were amazing in the film, and all the actors were great. Again, you didn't need constant dialogue, because a look on their face would say it all.<br/><br/>The story is pretty much follows 3 characters. One is Fionn Whitehead, who plays a young soldier looking to be evacuated. One is Tom Hardy, a pilot. And the last is Mark Rylance who is a private citizen using his yacht to rescue soldiers. The most engaging storyline was Fionn's. I think we spend the most time with that character. Also, even though I expected that they wanted to tie story lines together, and the characters would cross paths with one another, it did somewhat feel a bit hokey that it was Mark Rylance's boat that rescued Fionn. It also didn't come much as a surprise to me Aneurin Barnard's character ended up being French. I also wasn't surprised that they killed off one of the young cast members. I figured they would go with that angle of showcasing how sad it is that they died before their life really began.<br/><br/>Technically, I think the film was well directed, had great cinematography, a good score. All would be deserving of Oscars. I think the editing could have been a bit better. Because you're following 3 different story lines (and they are happening at different times) it can be hard to follow.<br/><br/>Also, I know some people are very curious about Harry Styles. He does a very good job, and he has surprisingly a decent sized role/screen time."

","Before seeing this, I was told that Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" is more of an ""experience"" rather than a movie. I can see what they meant by that now.<br/><br/>This movie does not follow a traditional chronological narrative like most movies. There really isn't a central main character or even really a central plot. Rather Dunkirk is broken down into three different ""experiences"", each one taking place over a specific amount of time. The first experience is entitled ""The Mole"" (the name of the beach), which takes place over the course of one week, the second experience is entitled ""the Sea"" which takes place in one day, and the third experience is entitled ""The Air"", which takes place in the course of one hour.<br/><br/>All three events intertwine and overlap with each other which could create a bit of continuity confusion for the viewer. (I think Christopher Nolan was digging into his Memento roots when he wrote this one).<br/><br/>Overall, it was a fun viewing. I can't really say it was Nolan's best, but it was interesting to watch none-the-less. Also Hans Zimmer's score is pretty amazing! Give that guy more Oscars!

An interesting concept of showing three different viewpoints of the situation. The movie also failed to show the fact that 40,000 French troops were left behind when the evacuation was ended."
"scandinavianmail","9","2","16","19 July 2017"," Nolan returns to form
","Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is brutal but surprisingly bloodless - the most blood on screen is probably when a character has an accidental fall in the stairs. It is also a total return to form for a director whose previous two outings were meandering, bloated messes.<br/><br/>The movie follows three groups of people and their different timelines that are of uneven length. This causes some momentary confusion when things cut back and forth too often. But I guess this is not anything that a second viewing wouldn't fix.<br/><br/>We get almost no background for the characters. Many don't even have a name and are limited to few lines of dialog. They are kept on screen for a time and then they are gone. Their stories start from random positions in their lives. Some go on living, some die useless, some die useful deaths. This may distance some of the audience from their fates to the degree that they become meaningless, but it certainly works better for Nolan than his sappy attempt to make sense of human emotions in Interstellar. Melodrama is not Nolan's thing. Tom Hardy gets to wear a mask for almost all of his screen time, just as in Nolan's last Batman.<br/><br/>Zimmer's score is present literally throughout the movie. Thankfully he keeps himself perfectly in line with what is unfolding on the screen. The score still rings in your ears for a long time afterwards."

","It's different from most modern day movies. The dialog is minimal and spoken only if truly necessary, instead the movie uses visuals, proper and good one and not excessive, to tell the story.
The sound is spot on. You really feel everything from small gunshots to bombs to the roar of aircraft engines. And just the sheer way it is put together is genius, constantly cutting between the ordinary soldiers trying to survive, the air force trying to do their best, the commanders trying to make due with what little they have to the civilians trying to do their duty.
Also, I like that there is minimal exposition and from the very start of the movie, the action starts and is constant. Not for one moment can you turn away, not for one moment is there a boring scene."

The cinematography is first rate (expect for the fact that it only shows about 1,000 soldiers on a beach that was supposed to hold a half million. The story - there is no story.

The Germans u-boats and airplanes kill any boats in the channel.

"razorwirekiss-1","10","1","6","14 May 2018"," War is not magnificent and is fought within the individual
","So many scathing reviews here. I love war movies. I grew up on war and westerns. Nowadays I realize the majority are revisionist and hyper glorified nonsense. America lost Vietnam, Rambo won it back. White men destroyed the Natives and John Wayne tamed the savages. It's manipulation of reality by the victors.
 Nolan's Dunkirk is war of the individual. We all experience the world from our POV and the only way to understand the horrors of sanctioned murder is to see what the individual experiences. So no Private Ryan mastrubatory war shots in this film. Just dread and waiting. Waiting for your extinction or moving on to the next event to see if you will live to see Home and family. 
 With Zimmers' fugue like music and Nolan's photochemical film experience Dunkirk is a Post Modern masterpiece that shows was the horrors that we as nations inflict on our young men and women. And the inherent love and good that the ordinary person can evoke for his fellow humans. 
 Beautifully made by a man who wanted our latest generation and others beyond to remember what those who have gone before us have given for our freedoms."
"jac-44480","2","1","6","13 May 2018"," Disappointing Snoozefest
","I am a huge WW2 movie buff and enjoy pretty much anything WW2 related. However, this movie was a letdown of epic proportions. Pearl Harbor set a low-bar for WW2 movies, but this movie was actually worse. At least Pearl Harbor had action, comedy, and character development, albiet cheesy. Dunkirk was reported to have a 150 million budget. How? Where did the 150 million go? It surely wasn't spent on actors. To buy positive reviews? That is the only plausible explanation. <br/><br/>The evacuation of Dunkirk was a major desperate battle involving over 400,000 British and French troops, thousands of planes, and hundreds of ships. This movie fails to capture the magnitude or scale of the battle. No historical or educational context is given other than brief exposition at the beginning and end. In total, we are shown only 5 planes, 3 British destroyers, and maybe a few thousands ground troops lined up on the beaches. The enemy is rarely seen and there are no fight scenes. 95% of the movie is British troops standing around moping on the beaches. The action scenes involve ships sinking and troops diving overboard. It is like Titanic on steroids. <br/><br/>The movie focuses on 3 ridiculous subplots that are not worthy of explanation. All characters are nameless and undeveloped. The ground troops are lead by a skinny coward who repeatedly tries to skip the line to escape. The armada of private boats that arrives towards the end involves maybe a dozen vessels. It looks like a small town boat parade festival. One of the faceless, nameless pilots is revealed at the end to be Tom Hardy. He makes a brief 15 second cameo with no dialogue before being captured by faceless enemy. <br/><br/>What the movie lacks in characters, dialogue, and action, it attempts to make up with constant eerie musical scores that are like running fingernails on a chalkboard. The music is supposed to create a suspenseful gloomy atmosphere, but becomes an annoyance and overshadows the conversations. Half of the dialogue is barely intelligible. I'm American and I understand British is a different language practically, but that wasn't the problem. <br/><br/>The fact that the enemy is never shown is a huge disservice to this movie. It would have been interesting if they showed the perimeter battles and thousands of planes fighting in the skies. Instead all we hear are distant gunshots and a few occasional mortars. They could have shown the opposing forces and strategies of each side."

Not even the town of Dunkirk is portrayed as being in a state of peril - other than a few columns of black smoke and some homes missing some windows and doors.<br/><br/>An awful attempt at making you 'feel' the reality of war.

","There are no doubt that films like ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Saving Er Ryan"", ""Schindler's List"" come to mind when you think of the war films that have been featured in the classics. We can get these films after we relieve ""Dunkirk"", who was sitting on the director's chair of Christopher Nolan. Nolan gave priority to emotional intensity in this film, as opposed to the massive, detailed and cleverly created scripts he used in his essays such as ""Inception"", ""Memento"" and ""Prestige"".<br/><br/>The film has a cinematographic structure that is almost perfect for the world and has a cinematographic structure. One of the thrillers does not fall into a ballast, the soundtracks of Hans Zimmer's grandchildren are accompanied by an unpleasant taste.<br/><br/>In an English-German battle, about 400,000 soldiers Dunkirk, a film about the lives of those who have been disturbed in this region and working to evacuate soldiers from this region, is a bit lacking in scripture, but with emotional intensity and thriller it earns us and offers an extraordinary cinematic taste.<br/><br/>Dunkirk, a 70mm-full-length cinematography, and master names such as Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, and Cillian Murphy are among the films that must be watched along with it."
"leegato","10","1","6","24 October 2017"," A WWII Story Told In Christopher Nolan Style
","As you scroll through the other reviews for this film on IMDb and see some of the reviews rave and complain, you'll notice the common elements. Acting, story, etc. While my review does not contain spoilers (necessarily), if you want to go in completely blind about how the film portrays the Dunkirk, maybe stop reading.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a World War II film told in Christopher Nolan's signature style of temporal irregularities through his storytelling and editing. We've seen him play around with time in his previous films, most notably Memento, Interstellar, Inception, and, to an extent, even Batman Begins. It's in Christopher Nolan's artistic vision of time that helps him tell his compelling stories. Memento's reverse order of storytelling lets the audience feel what it's like to live with the protagonist's inability to form new memories. Inception's layers of dreams (with different time frames) allows the film to align climaxes at different points of each dream. And the latter is what Dunkirk roughly does.<br/><br/>Dunkirk tells the stories of the battle by land, sea, and air, with the events in each setting taking place within a week, a day, and an hour, respectively. Nolan ingeniously crafts these three stories together, weaving their different time frames to align climaxes within the battles and emphasize their individual struggles. The result is a beautiful portrayal that encompasses the entire battle on all three aspects.<br/><br/>I see many complain about the lack of character development in this film, and how the characters aren't that memorable; to be honest, I agree. I couldn't even name the characters if I could. But that's the point! Dunkirk is not a story about a single individual, or a particular group of people. It's about a struggle a community faced, and that there were no individual standout heroes in this war, just many who collaborated together. Even though the film is centered on the evacuation of Dunkirk, it emulates the sentiments of the entire war as a whole.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer collaborated with Benjamin Wallfisch on the score for this film, focusing on emulating and modernizing British classical music, most notably Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations. The result is a colorful, wistful score that draws out unique themes for each aspect of the battle and sonically blends them together as the stories weave in and out of each other. Huge fan of Wallfisch's orchestrations that use the strings to swell and evoke an echoic atmosphere for the film.<br/><br/>While it may be too late at this point, I highly recommend seeing this film in 70mm or 70mm-IMAX formats. The colors in the film are gorgeous, and watching this film on an analog format emphasizes the vast scope of the war and the colorful vision that Nolan aspired for."

","I'm sure everything I'm about to say has been said before over and over but I'll say it anyway. I did spent a quite good moment during the film overall. <br/><br/>The film is visually stunning. The intense music and sound effects create a singular atmosphere that felt quite captivating at times. The acting is on point, my favourite performance comes from Cillian Murphy but we don't see that much of him. So yeah, the movie is technically superb, I could really feel the tension at several points but not as much as one would expect. At times, I was even laid back and simply enjoying the action but it felt like the music insisted on trying to make me feel tense, nervous, trying to keep me on my toes, like it was telling me ""watch out! watch out! be wary! this is a stressful situation!"" and I was like ""give me a break man, I'm not tense right now ( yes, I call my musics ""man"" when I speak to them regardless of their gender) .<br/><br/>The lack of dialogue, character background and the constant invisible threat (ennemies are virtually invisible most of the time and you never see their faces) didn't work for me. I understand why the director made this choices, or at least I think I do but the end, it doesn't matter. Question is if I liked it or not. The lack of emotional involvement towards the different characters made me unable to truly relate, care and thus fully enjoy the movie and story. It also took away some of the tension as I can't get really stressed out for a character if i don't care about him.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a good experience but it's not what I'm looking for in a movie.<br/><br/>Final verdict: 7/10. This rating isn't an attempt to evaluate the actual objective value of the film but merely reflects my appreciation of it."

"caleblimsw","10","1","6","15 September 2017"," An impactful, immersive experience.
","Dunkirk was Christopher Nolan's latest film, which I had the pleasure of watching last week. Dunkirk tells the story of 400 000 men trapped, awaiting evacuation.<br/><br/>What the film felt like for me, was an immediately immersive experience. Nolan places us straight into the action as we are plunged into the city of Dunkirk with Tommy and his mates.Immediately, from the very beginning, you could feel the tension begin to build as the soldiers find themselves in an abandoned city. Where is everyone? Then the leaflets come down, and then we see their plight. Surrounded. On all sides. Then the shooting begins, and Nolan cleverly makes the decision to not show the Germans, instead having us watch Tommy leap and vault away, eventually reaching the beach. With no portrayal of the German soldiers, Nolan is placing us, effectively, in Tommy's point of view, where all he really knows is someone is shooting at him, and he needs to run. And we do feel Tommy's desperation as his friends are cut down, and he vaults and drops his gun because they just keep coming and-<br/><br/>And then he reaches the beach.<br/><br/>All those men, just standing there. Already the tension from the chase is slowly fading. But Zimmer's excellent soundtrack begins to rebuild that tension, as the ominous sounds build up to the bomber strike. Everything feels like we are there, with them, being bombed, running from enemies we can't really make out. This movie delivered a powerfully drawn story of survival, even when interlocked with the story of the courage of the sailors like Dawson who sail out to sea of their own volition. Dunkirk works because it seems real. We are given probably as much information as Tommy has. It feels real, and their actions feel completely valid, think of the soldier screaming for ""the bloody air force!"" It feels impacting because we have just witnessed the destruction wrought by the Luftwaffe, and where were the air force? The lack of dialogue feels natural, as Tommy has just had all his friends killed in an ambush, and then witnessed the great British Army trapped and desperate. We can feel the desperation, the longing of the soldiers, because as they point out, it's just right there now, they can see it, just barely out of their grasp. Home. Safety.<br/><br/>I want to explain for a second why the characters can be developed without dialogue. What we are meant to feel for these soldiers is empathy. Because all they want to do is two main things. One:Live. Two: Go home If you can't empathize with that, then, well, could you empathize with 9/11 victims? Did you feel for them? Unless you're a sociopath, of course! Did you need dialogue? Backstories? No. Because they are ordinary people, trapped in a disastrous event, facing death and injury when home and safety is oh so close. And that is exactly what every soldier in Dunkirk faces. Finally, I would like to mention the beautiful, powerful cinematography, whether the explosions on the destroyer to the tension of the aerial battle. I would just like to note here: Hardy shooting down the last dive bomber is completely possible. Nolan researched every part of the movie. The plot's structure is slightly strange, and off- putting at certain times, yes. But it allows Nolan to advance all the stories equally, and maintain the tension at high stakes. Especially in the Sea plot line, where all three lines intersect. George's death, Peter lying to the Soldier. When it all comes together, the bomber coming back around. And then you realize that Hardy has already shot the plane down, but now you see what the effect of that is from another point of view. And it allows Nolan to unite all 3 lines for a singular, powerful ending.<br/><br/>This is why Dunkirk works. This is why Dunkirk is truly stunning, moving and full of tension, at all times, with Nolan and Hoytema's cinematography leaping to stunning life, and Zimmer's tension-filled score in the background.<br/><br/>I have a new favorite war film. Thank you, Mr. Nolan.<br/><br/>9.6/10"
"Spookinet","10","1","6","14 September 2017"," What i believe people got wrong
","Wow what a movie! But I guess what a person loves about this movie others hate.<br/><br/>And for most (skeptical) critics i read here i think they have misunderstood the purpose of the movie.<br/><br/>The main reason is that Nolan took a realistic approach of the war. It depicts the war as it was not as we would like to see it. I think that's why some people get confused and expect big Hollywood-like battle scenes (as in Saving Private Ryan that gets mentioned in most of the critics here). War isn't just big Hollywood stars doing heroic stuff on screen; It's all the other tens of millions just surviving it... This is a tribute to them, the soldiers and the civilians that just by being there allowed the Allied forces to exist and fight for this number of years and ultimately win the war. On top of that, this is just a small moment in history where the allied lost and are fleeing with their tails in between their legs. It is not a glorious time...<br/><br/>This leads to the building of the character (main critic out there). I feel like people believe that Nolan miscalculated on that side. He obviously didn't. By not giving names or ranks but just faces to people; he gives the feeling that the people on screen are all in it together. Stop wanting to have Hollywoodish heroes (by the way we have Tom Hardy's character portraying someone who is willing to give his life for the others). He gives the feeling that everyone is expendables; that they all went and fight in France and Belgium not expecting to come back. And as said in the movie ""400.000 stranded but only for 30.000 to come back to England"". How could you give that feeling if you had to build characters give them feelings and all?<br/><br/>In an era where most of us have only known war through films and video games, we tend to forget that most soldiers are just kids like us that wet themselves when scared. What Nolan portrays on the screen is just kids being super tired from stress, defeat, loosing friends and lack of sleep (by the way try talking when awake for 48 hours or more). He does that in a wonderful way and if you didn't feel sad if the protagonists of the movie died or not; I felt sad for every extras that died. Great job M. Nolan.<br/><br/>When it comes to the soundtrack; i guess it's a ""hate it or absolutely love"" kind of thing. I was sitting on the edge of my seat all the time because of the music. The grandiosity of the music at it's peak would be used in the most epic scenes and battles in other movies. Here it is used in such a way that if you were to be a veteran of the war, those ""small moments"" would be the unfortunate highlights of a war that would scare you for life.<br/><br/>Added to that, as everyone pointed out; superb filming, super acting, superb visual effects!<br/><br/>In short, best war movie i've seen and would rank it top above ""band of brothers"" and ""saving private Ryan"" (yes i did love Private Ryan as well)"
"noahlenzi","8","1","6","12 September 2017"," Dunkirk is good but not a masterpiece.
","I was lucky enough to see Dunkirk in IMAX 70 mm film. I have to say the extremely large format was more immersive and I really felt like I was there. With the exception of a few moments where it got too loud, the IMAX was great. The film itself is both moving and terrifying. A few scenes left my heart pumping fast. There's little dialogue, most of it is told through characters actions, either random moments of human decency in hard times or harsh desperation. It really shows how war and survival can bring the worst out us but also the small moments of decency. Truly another great Nolan film. My one criticism is the time line is a bit too confusing at first but you'll eventually get up to speed. I think a couple more insert shots that establish where we are in the time line would make the film flow a bit better but I was able to catch on pretty quick and the non-linear story really allows for some intense back-to-back scenes.<br/><br/>So far a big criticism of Dunkirk is that the characters are weak because we don't know much about them. What I took away from the film is that it wasn't about who these people were or what they're personalities are like. It was about where they are now. None of these characters are themselves during the movie (something you'll see with Cillian Murphy's character). They're at war trying to survive. Everyone the characters meet (including each other) is just another soldier in the crowd. The compelling thing is that these characters hardly know each other but they go out of their way to help each other live. I think the film may have fallen into some ""war glory"" cheese if they had flash backs and scenes of them talking about what they're gonna do if the get home all while being shot at. <br/><br/>Dunkirk is an intense experience, its not heavy on plot but its heavy on emotions. Really glad I saw this one. Dunkirk is obviously a good film but not a masterpiece like everyone says it is, The Prestige is."
"cian-obasmith","7","1","6","12 September 2017"," Powerful film but lacked emotional engagement with the characters
","Overall this is an excellent movie, I was pleasantly surprised by the alternative approach to a 'war movie' one which slowly builds dread and creates what seems like a genuine example of what war must have felt like. Where it falls short of a higher rating is Nolan's lack of ability to persuade the viewer to invest emotionally into the characters. The vast array of the cast makes it difficult to really feel fear for the survival of the characters because there is no individual protagonist. This is not to take away from the excellent cinematography, acting and the incredible soundtrack masterfully composed by Hans Zimmer, which I can say without a doubt is worthy of an Oscar."
"tankace","9","1","6","12 September 2017"," We shall at the beaches but at first we need to get out and fast of a beach.
","Clocking in in just one hour and forty five minutes long this the shortest film ever produced by Christopher Nolan after the Following his first feature film way back in 1998. Still in this short time you get five to six different perspectives about the Dunkirk's Evacuation during the first days of WW2 and the stress and fear the was in the air during these days.<br/><br/>Through out the duration of the film you feel that time is in short supply and at any moment a bomb, a bullet or a torpedo will come and kill more soldiers who are trapped like fishes in a barrow and if this army is lost then the war will be over in a moments notice with the Nazis victorious! So Nolan and his team had a very difficult work to do and in all honesty they not only manage to make a good film but actually a great flick, boy after the Inglorious Bastards WW2 has came in full force in the cinema, I can't be more happy about that! <br/><br/>The only thing that wasn't outstanding was the acting ,the actors did their part flawlessly, no doubt about that, however there wasn't any performance the stole the show. And that is fine for this was a story about surviving a insufferable situation and the heroic efforts of military personnel and common civilians who at times went above and beyond to save the stranded army there. As for effects, cinematography, authenticity and historical accuracy ,outstanding ,no other word can describe it best the work that was put here.<br/><br/>Also the one thing that stuck with me was the music which reminded me a lot a ticking clock and filled me with fear and anxiety about what would happened next because if this army was lost then France and especially Britain would have zero capacity on continuing the war so it was a big deal at this point.<br/><br/>In the end when the film was ending we got the famous speech by Winston Churchill and his remark that there is along way ahead of them with this conflict and the end. Although abrupt the end is totally in mud with the situation at hand ""Yes we saved our soldiers, but with evacuation you can't win Wars"".<br/><br/>Overall this film dispute not been as brutal and bloody as Hacksaw Ridge of the previous year is still an excellent WW2 film like the Ridge and what can I say, Mr Nolan you are a magician in the director chair!"
"nickykelly-65134","9","1","6","12 September 2017"," Incredible Film, Wrongly Criticised
","Christopher Nolan has created yet another massive hit, however this time his film does not concern memory loss, Batman, dreams or black holes. This film concerns the real evacuation of over 300,000 soldiers at Dunkirk during the second world war.<br/><br/>Nolan is absolutely correct when saying this is an event film, and this film does an amazing job at making the viewer feel the stress and terror of being killed at a moments notice.<br/><br/>Nolan also manages to make do without blunt exposition, which have unfortunately plagued some of his works in the past, mainly Inception. The only piece of exposition that I noticed in the film was visual, the propaganda posters dropped onto the ally soldiers. And this exposition works perfectly for telling the audience (who may not know of the events) essentially what's happening.<br/><br/>This film uses a very unique structure, not unlike Pulp Fiction, where Nolan shows a number of scenes that are happening at different times, and over the course of different periods. This structure has unfortunately threw some people off, who found it distracting and/or didn't see the need for it. There is a simple answer to this of course, and it is answered in the film. Everything on the beach happens over the course of a week, everything in the civilian boats happens over the course of a day, and everything in the air happens over the course of an hour. I don't quite understand how people misunderstood this or found it distracting, and I do not believe it's the film, or the director's fault for this misunderstanding, as most people, including myself, understood it perfectly. <br/><br/>Another criticism this film has unfairly been given is it's lack of interesting characters. Unfortunately, not every soldier has an investing backstory to sob over, and spend an unnecessary amount of screen time addressing, as a very large majority of these soldiers were just men, men trying to survive and get home safe. Which is all I think was actually needed to care about the characters in the film."
"holamike","7","1","6","28 August 2017"," Dunkirk Spirit
","Being British and having lived for many years near Swanage where some of the UK scenes were filmed I was really looking forward to seeing Dunkirk, Christopher Nolans first film based on true events. Maybe because of this I was a little disappointed and felt it could have been better but overall found it an enjoyable film. We don't get to feel the scale of what happened at Dunkirk when the allies were attempting to evacuate 400,000 troops to England. Instead we get to follow three separate stories called Mole, Sea and Air. Mole is following some of the soldiers trying to escape from the beach, Sea is the story of one of the many small boats that attempted to help the aforementioned troops escape and Air is about the RAF efforts to assist. There is one very emotional scene with the small boats approaching the beaches. Overall I would give the film 7.5 out of 10 and recommend it but advise some additional reading after seeing the film to fully understand the importance of Dunkirk in the Second World War."

Rather than build a baffling, incoherent epic around a concept too ambitious to ever make sense as a movie, he crafts a spare, naked film about a very specific and compressed series of events, namely the military disaster that resulted in the messy evacuation of Allied forces from the beaches of Dunkirk in France.<br/><br/>The film is technically brilliant. Its stars are its editor, composer, and cinematographer, who work seamlessly together to maintain a throbbing pulse of dread throughout the entire film. There are some big stars in the movie -- like Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, and Tom Hardy -- but they mostly blend into the background of the faceless and nameless many who tried to find a way, any way, to get off the beach before the German forces arrived. Nolan can't resist getting up to some of his old tricks, like some mixed up chronology that makes things somewhat disorienting for the viewer at first. But they're used well and serve the story rather than overwhelming it.<br/><br/>I didn't much care for the heavy handed, schmaltzy passages that pepper the later part of the film and feel more like Steven Spielberg than anything that came before it. Indeed, the whole film does feel a bit like ""Saving Private Ryan"" in that it spends most of its running time creating a visceral, almost documentary-like recreation of events and then can't help throwing in some old- fashioned Hollywood sentiment as if the director feels he has to reward his audience with some feel- good pap to make up for putting us through the ordeal of everything that precedes it.<br/><br/>Overall I admired ""Dunkirk"" for its technical craft, but I was mostly left cold by it. It doesn't have any emotional core to it, the feel-good passages aside, which are more bombastic than emotional anyway. There are people to care about in the abstract, but no real characters. These men don't have inner lives, none that we're shown in any case, and that limits the impact of what happens to them. They're representations of men rather than the flesh and blood real thing.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"pramsalim","9","1","6","24 August 2017"," A subtle yet terrifying depiction of war by Christopher Nolan
","Dunkirk is a war movie directed by Christopher Nolan. And like any other Nolan movies, this movie is different. This movie was absurdly short for a war movie. It barely reaches two hours. This was understandable since the movie focuses only on one event, The Evacuation of Dunkirk, where around 300,000 British troops were evacuated from a small beach in Dunkirk that was surrounded by German Troops. The war movies that we're used to seeing usually follows the journey of our protagonist as he battles the odds of war. In this movie, we instantly jump to the situation of Dunkirk without first getting to know our characters. To add to that, there are very minimum dialogues in this movie.<br/><br/>This was a bold decision made by Christopher Nolan. Dialogue is an important aspect of movies. They allow the characters to develop and compels us to sympathize with them. In this movie, Nolan replaced those dialogues with actions. Their action in the event defines who they are.<br/><br/>Now this is the thing that I appreciate the most from this film. The astonishingly realistic depiction of war and its impacts. There is no actual main character in this movie. The main protagonists are actually the men who are struggling to evacuate and to be evacuated, which is incredibly relevant to a sickening fact of an actual war. It cares not about individuals. There are also claims that the Dunkirk movie is a propaganda by the Brits, showing that they are a superior nation, regarding the Brexit matter. For me, this statement is unjust. The film does not shy away from the fact that their assault on France and Belgium is a massive failure. One scene shows a soldier complaining about how he is ashamed of the loss and expects to be spit on back at home. However, the movie is not about the omnipotent Britain and their mighty evacuation. It is about the hopeless men, stranded on the beach of Dunkirk, longing for the scent of home and how despite the horrific war going on, there is still a good chunk of humanity somewhere in this world. We witness as the civilian back at home, fishermen, elders and such, volunteered sailing across from England to Dunkirk in order to save their fellow countrymen. And finally, back at home, when the evacuated men came home in a train with their head ducking in shame, the villagers mobbed their train. And instead of spitting on them, they cheered in triumph. Because victory is not always achieved by conquest. It could also be achieved by unity."

"pokedom","8","1","6","28 July 2017"," A really well made film without character.
","This film is the best of the year? This is the one that will become a timeless classic?... I doubt it. Don't get me wrong, this is a very good film, well worth the price of admission. But there is one serious flaw that makes it difficult to call this a perfect 10/10.<br/><br/>Let's start with the best part of this film: the score. The musical score is fantastic. There's always a ticking sound in the background, throughout 90% of the film at least. When action draws closer, or the stakes suddenly rise, the score adds more music, but keeps the same beat. It really adds to the tension. Every second, every tick of that clock, is a moment these men are stuck in the danger zone. It might annoy some people, but for me it was very well done.<br/><br/>Another thing I really admired was the sound. Not the soundtrack, I mean the sounds of the war. Every gunshot, explosion, and fighter plane, all sounds incredibly loud and realistic. It doesn't sound like a standard action movie, it sounds serious. I wasn't even in the IMAX theater and it was so loud I almost covered my ears.<br/><br/>That being said, there's one (maybe 2) flaws that keep this from being perfect. The characters are somewhat forgettable. Everyone that the movie follows isn't given that much development. You've got the pilot guy, who is... flying a plane. You've got the beach boys who are... trying to get off the beach together. That's it. And there's the three people on a boat trying to save more people, but again, none of them have development. The person flying the plane could be swapped with the two boys trying to get off the beach and not a lot would change.<br/><br/>The other large issue is the issue of maturity. This is a war zone, with lots of guns, explosions, even oil fires that burn the skin of the soldiers towards the end of the film. Yet shockingly it's rated PG-13. There's no blood, severed limbs, and disfigured victims. We see people carrying away the wounded, but they don't look wounded. They look like they've got some ketchup spilled on their chest. There's even a scene where the two boys look at a bunch of corpses from a recent bomb raid, and none of the corpses are missing any appendages or are bloody in the slightest. They were literally just bombed! This guy over here would be missing an arm, that guy would be missing a leg, and blood would be all over that beach. When the oil fire starts (Two-Face flashbacks... wait, that movie and this movie have the same director! It all makes sense now...), nobody is burning, despite being in the fire. They don't even get the Two-Face treatment.<br/><br/>This film is very well made. There's a lack of dialogue, and you just sit there on the edge of your seat hoping that these guys get out of this situation alive. My general advice is go see it, not in IMAX unless you want permanent ear damage, don't get attached to the men you see, and bless up to Chris Nolan. It's worth every penny."
"CinePendejo","9","1","6","24 July 2017"," Interstellar is forgiven. Go see this.
","War is hell. You're shocked, I know.<br/><br/>Film has no hesitation in reminding you that notion for nearly a century, especially those taking place against Nazis. Ever since they axed Hitler, Hollywood is so bent out of shape in exploiting this tired- ass setting by giving us a whole spectrum of good-to-meh WW2 movies.It's like they're exhaustingly transparent, offering us the same level of gunfights, bleeding, ""hoo-rah""s, and the obligatory message mongering about the same damn words ""war is hell"" and ""Nazis are bad"". PRIVATE RYAN, HACKSAW RIDGE, FURY - bunch of others I forgot. It's all extremely tiring to an extent, no matter how good they turn out.<br/><br/>So, to my bewildered face, leave it to Christopher Nolan to up the ante and refresh this tired subgenre into something brutally engrossing and secretly clever. Nolan strips all the extra fat and BS from the resulting picture, leaving us into the fray in some of the most harrowing events in the battle of Dunkirk. It's exhilarating as much as it is depressing, constantly keeping me at the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>The films biggest accomplishments is how it acorporates theme of time into the main machinery of the film. Hanz Zimmers score imbues ticking sounds to crank up the intensity for each time these characters try to survive. The film plays with the timeline with three scenarios (Aircraft: 1 hour/Seaboat:1 day/ Land: 1 week) and jumps in between them with carful and enticing etiting skills. Each character finds ways to either kill enemies or run away with depleting resources or low morale. Say what you will about Nolans cinema trickery, but it works when it works. He's constantly remind you that the biggest threat amongs our worn out soldiers besides Nazis is time itself. This his tinkering feels earned and smartly used without blowing up into pretentiousness (see Interstellar)<br/><br/>But all of that would not mean a damn thing without the performances. With barely any dialogue, we get the clear sense of what they feel just by looking at these guys. Kenneth Branaugh brings out the most dignified performance as a general who struggles to keep his composure. Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy work wonders with their demons of desperation and paranoia respectively. The soldiers, more specifically Harry Styles, never once feel out of touch and shows a lot of the hell they've put up with perfectly. And finally Mark Rylance is just magnificent as always in bringing out the heart and humbleness in his character.<br/><br/>A lot of criticism of Nolans other work points out his lack of focusing on human emotions. I'd say this is finally a break of this mold. As the film slowly reliefs us of the hell that was the battle of Dunkirk, were treated with a finale that's not only a huge relief, but also a slimmer of joy. Soldiers cheering and civilians offering gifts and Rylance assuring the soldiers brace duties. It's like Nolan found something worth embracing for the first time in what seems like forever. Seriously that ending almost got me chocked up.<br/><br/>DUNKIRK is a bravura of ""war is hell"" imagery reworked in what it should feel like in the first place. As I sat there while the lights opened up during the credits, I stopped and finally said ""shit, I agree."" <br/><br/>This is a corker, folks. Don't miss it."
"CinematicInceptions","9","1","6","23 July 2017"," Modestly Amazing
","This wasn't my favorite of Nolan's movies, and wasn't what I was expecting, but it was not a disappointment. In general, I don't enjoy war movies, even the best ones like Saving Private Ryan. Perhaps that is part of why I liked Dunkirk and part of what makes this historical event the right kind of story for Christopher Nolan to turn into a movie. It's not just massive amounts of explosive battles and gore surrounding ""brothers in arms"" dying together against impossible odds, or anything like that. Not to say that those sorts of movies are bad, but there are enough of them already. What makes this such a great movie is not the scale of the battle or the odds that the characters are up against, but the scale of the success that it depicts.<br/><br/>The story of national heroism is told through the perspective of several characters, all of whom are vital to its success. None of the characters are perfect, but all of them are heroic in some sense whether by enduring trials or by aiding those who are worse off than they are. The strangest thing about the characters in this movie were how they were introduced. None of them has a ""character moment"" like those that are usually employed to tell the audience who a character is at the beginning of the story. In this case, all of the characters are distinguished solely by how they act. This points to how expertly Nolan wrote these characters even with very little dialogue and how well they were played by each of their actors.<br/><br/>Although the pacing was not the best in this movie, it did display some very good twists on non-linear storytelling that I'd never seen before. There are three locations/story lines that are introduced at the beginning of the movie: 1. The Mole (1 week) 2. The Sea (1 day) 3. The Air (one hour). Each story is cross cut with the others and they all intersect at a few points, sort of like the inverse of how Amores Perros is structured. A lot of times with non- linear stories and especially some of Nolan's other movies, the events and chronology of the story are difficult to follow. With Dunkirk I never felt lost, in large part because the exact chronology isn't really important. I would go into more detail, but won't for the sake of keeping this spoiler-free.<br/><br/>There was a strange subtlety to how impressive this film was to me. There was nothing flashy, gimmicky, or immediately spectacular about it. But that did not keep it from being a great piece of filmmaking and something that was enjoyable and very engaging to watch. Sometimes things like the dialogue in the Social Network, James McAvoy's performance in Split, the camera-work in Whiplash, or the special effects in Inception stand out as impressive right away. Not so in Dunkirk. Every aspect of the production design, costuming, visual effects, and camera-work was done very well and could definitely be up for Oscar's. But none of them drew attention to themselves, and rather aided the telling of the story.<br/><br/>This may not match up to Inception and Interstellar, and is undeniably new territory for Chris Nolan, but I think he and everyone who worked with him did an excellent job with Dunkirk. I do enjoy his science fiction work most of all, but there was a lot to like here. The world that was created immediately gave me the impression that this was a movie in which any character could die, and that's a rare thing to find in a movie. This made it an emotional movie too, whether by making you share the emotions of the characters or by sharing in their moral struggles or by sympathizing with their plights. The emotional moments were also small enough that I could relate to them rather than being so profound and foreign that their weight was just lost on me.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend you go see this just because it's a great all around movie. I know that my review has been all in praise of the movie, but it's not perfect. The only problems I had with it were that it wasn't as entertaining as I would have liked and the dialogue was unclear at several points. But fortunately, there isn't much dialogue so this didn't matter so much. In any case, try to go see it or at least rent it once it comes out on video. Overall Rating: 8.5/10."
"nathangray704","8","1","6","23 July 2017"," Another christopher nolan hit
","I didn't quite know what I would receive when I walked into the theatre, I just knew christopher nolan made it and that was enough for me. After seeing it I remained in complete amazement of what I saw, the film took a risk and did what I believed to be almost impossible, it refused to focus on characters or a storyline within the event but instead focused on the war and it worked. It made the film feel like a beautifully executed documentary that also filled you with emotion and suspense the entire time. Even without straight character development or story you remained invested into it and frightened for them. This may be a difficult film to watch though as it is probably one of the closer and more realistic depictions of war put to screen but that's also why it's great."

"briner8397","8","1","6","23 July 2017"," Rare quality summer movie
","Moments reminded me of Das Boot (1981) and Titanic (1997), but overall its own creation and statement. I was wary of another war movie until seeing several laudatory reviews. Thankfully it's not the usual hero or conflicted hero war movie; it's not a war movie at all from the perspective of the push and pull of victory and defeat. The alternative take? How about minimal dialog! This isn't storytelling by actors reading a carefully written script (as if real people ever talk like a screenplay); it moves along relentlessly as a condensed version of a very short time period. I also had to think of how Howard Hughes would have loved the flight dogfight scenes from his experience as a fearless pilot and brief moviemaker of WWI flight dogfight scenes. I loathe the excessive CGI in 90% of summer movies, and this one had very little if any artificiality and contrivance. I felt the drab beaches populated by huge numbers of troops, supply ships capsizing, and spitfires strafing. This is a movie about almost constant peril, but I hear that's what war is when it's in gear. I also had to think about our present political leadership and real heroism and sacrifice, but won't go there in this public comment. Dunkirk is a gem."
"wacocga-83034","7","1","6","23 July 2017"," good not great
","This is a good movie that could have been great. Operation Dynamo as the British called it, was much larger than the story depicts. Over 325,000 soldiers were rescued by hundreds of boats, both large and small. Hundreds of airplanes fought overhead the whole time. You see none of the larger scope of the whole battle. Over 200 boats were sunk as well as over 100 planes lost on each side. You never see the true masses of men on the beach awaiting rescue. The Germans did not commit their air attacks in drips and drabs with a few planes as the movie depicts. Some use of CGI could have conveyed to the watcher the magnitude and cost of the evacuation and given it more realism those learned in history demand."

","Positives : Breathtaking cinematography. Brilliant background score. Audience feels like a character being put right in the middle of war. Technical brilliance and attention to detail.

No character development, no emotional connect; its just - feel the war, get rescued, the end. Its very different that any war movie we've ever seen, but expected more from Nolan that just something different.<br/><br/>Is it Nolan's best? I'll put it at no # 7. Memento, Interstellar, Inception, Dark knight, Prestige and Following were better.

"valleyjohn","9","1","6","21 July 2017"," Not quite the masterpiece but still bloody good.
","Rarely has there been a film in recent years as wildly anticipated as Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. Even since it's screening for the critics at the beginning of the week the reviews have been off the scale. One I read even called it ""perfection"" . Do I agree ? well no - but as films go I bet you will be hard pushed to see anything as good as this in 2017. This is the story about the Dunkirk evacuation during the early days of World War II. When 400,000 British and Allied troops end up trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk, France . It loosely follows three stories. One a group of young soldiers who are trying to escape Dunkirk. The other a family who are going out to rescue them on their family boat and finally squadron RAF Spitfire Pilots. I have to say this took me a little while to get into. There is very little , if any , full blown conversations between the characters in this film which also means you get no background information on them which I would have liked. Nolan gets the audience straight into the thick of things with breath taking set pieces backed up by explosions with bullets flying around your head, This is all backed up by a hypnotic soundtrack which I have to say got a little headachy after a while. Because of this cacophony of noise I found it hard to adjust when there was dialogue or perhaps that's just me? It wouldn't be a Christopher Nolan film without him trying to confuse the audience and this time it comes with the out of sync timeline. I wouldn't know Harry Styles if he delivered my post but for a pop star he is superb in this. Probably the standout actor. Overall this is a really good film but maybe not the masterpiece we had been promised but I am a lover of historical movies and I have to say this is right up there with the best world war II films ."

"Pierre_D","9","1","7","15 November 2017"," Nerve-wracking dissertation on military washout.
","Dunkirk pulls few punches while bringing us a clean look at a disastrous military event. We find Tom (Fionn Whitehead), Alex (Harry Styles) and a handful of other young men trapped on the sea while Germans mercilessly pound the surf, bombard their position and decimate their ranks. Dozens of them piled into freighters, buffeted by waves and hope and despair, and few of them will ever return to their homes.<br/><br/>Tension is ratcheted up by the incessant ticking of a watch, reminding us there are scant hours left before the next outbound ship or strike. The Germans are seldom seen; we hear of them planning, we seem them in planes in glorious dogfights with the Brits and we know they are the hammer that will drop, inexorably and mercilessly, on the assembled masses below. The aerial fight sequences are masterfully shot, with bullets ripping the air and the planes painstakingly recreated to give us a real idea of those sequences.<br/><br/>One of the few downsides of the movie lies in its limited character development. We see the effects and results of war, but little is known about the featured soldiers outside of their current projects and a bit on their families. We see their prejudices emerge when they have to make choices on how can leave or enter their holds, however, and those moments are enrapturing.<br/><br/>Dunkirk scores high as a war movie. To miss it is to miss story writ large, even if that story has dire consequences for all involved."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","7","17 September 2017"," Visually and Sound Wise... Wonderful
","Dunkirk (2017) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan's story of German, French and Dutch soldiers being trapped by the German's and the risky evacuation attempt that would require the help of common people.<br/><br/>You have to think that DUNKIRK was one of the most hyped movies in recent memory. As soon as it was announced people started talking about the brilliance that they were expected. Throughout the production the hype grew even more. When the teaser was first released it didn't try to hide anything. The marketing was aimed at people and they wanted the people to know that this here wasn't just your average war picture. With all the hype into it, Nolan actually managed to deliver a great picture and one of the most dazzling that you'll ever see and hear.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of people asking if we really needed yet another war movie. To be honest, the war genre had played itself out even before sound came to movies but I've always said it doesn't matter how many times something has been done as long as you get to see it in a new way. There's no question that Nolan is a technical genius as his previous films prove that. What DUNKIRK has done is pretty darn impressive because everything we see in the film is something we've seen countless times yet it all seems fresh and original here.<br/><br/>Visually this is certainly one of the most impressive war movies out there. Pretty much from the opening to the closing sequence is nothing but action and there's so much that your sense are never given a break. I think what's so impressive with the look is that the director manages to put you in with these characters and you really do feel as if you're in the water with them, in the plane getting hit or on the boat being bombed. The terrific use of sound also puts you right there in the action and some of the sound effects were so real that you couldn't help but feel as if you were right there.<br/><br/>The entire cast deliver terrific performances and especially Kenneth Branagh. Throughout the movie I was thinking that I'd probably be critical because there wasn't much heart or emotion with what you were watching. That was until the finale when it finally hit me with what the director was trying to do. DUNKIRK is a technical marvel and a film that put itself out there as something special and different. It lived up to the hype."
"georgefounts","10","1","7","12 September 2017"," A Taxing, Excruciating and Utterly Beautiful Piece of Cinema
","Like many others, I'm an unflinching fan of everything by Nolan & co. My expectations were raised and, as a Brit, I was eager to see how the story (one with which we've all grown up) would be presented. I can understand the numerous criticisms levelled against ""Dunkirk"" in other reviews but I find that none of them truly take anything away from this brilliant film. I will, however, attempt to address them in my review and justify the 10/10 rating ""Dunkirk"" has garnered. <br/><br/>The dialogue is minimal and at times, can be a weak spot for the Nolan brothers. Branagh and Rylance get the lion's share of speech; providing quiet, mature performances and moments of calm which often act as a foil to the far more action-packed endeavours of their younger counter-parts. What little dialogue there is, it is masterfully delivered by KB and MR. Given the nature of the film, I believe this element fits perfectly with ""Dunkirk"" and its far more physical nature. <br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" is, ultimately, an audio-visual feast. Visceral, loud and unwavering in its intensity, it is a war film where actions, or lack thereof, speak volumes. But none of these actions would have such an impact were it not for the incredible work of Hans Zimmer. The soundtrack to ""Dunkirk"" does not follow the usual rise and fall, the battering of percussion and strings so often equated with Zimmer's music. Instead, after the first few cracks of gunfire break the silence of the film's intro, we are met by a metronomic ticking which pervades throughout the film. Married with a masterfully employed ""Shepard tone"" motif, this ticking and audio illusion make the tensions rise and rise with the pitch to the point of bursting. As the pressure and perils of events on screen finally reach their crescendo, so too does the soundtrack until finally, mercifully... silence. For a small moment on screen, all diegetic noise subsides while the screeching soundtrack mutates into a swell of music and emotion. As Elgar's ""Nimrod"" blossoms into full form, we are given back the Hans Zimmer we know and love. All of this ties perfectly into the events on-screen, mirroring the quiet of the Spitfire as it glides along the beach, all of which swirl into a climax of relief and emotion which brings a tear to the eye. It may not be to everyone's liking, but the ""Dunkirk"" OST is an invaluable feature of the film and aids so much of the feeling behind Nolan's work.<br/><br/>The music would be of little consequence, however, were it not for the truly incredible cinematography, editing and sound-mixing. Having seen the film in full IMAX, the sheer spectacle of ""Dunkirk"" is hard to express. When watching the Academy Awards, one quickly becomes bored of the endless prizes for various areas of film-making that, in truth, most people care little about in the mainstream. Only watching ""Dunkirk"", shaking with the force of screeching Stukas wreaking havoc on the beach, have I ever thought ""Who on earth did the sound editing for this? They MUST win an award"". (Richard King was supervising sound editor, out of interest). ""Dunkirk"" is a film that makes you incredibly aware of how it could have been made, from the way scenes are shot to the manner props and authentic vehicles are utilised. Boasting a fine budget of $100 million, Nolan's commitment to practical effects is of great benefit. With the explosions, the gunshots, the creaking of ships sinking in the channel, everything carries heft and increasingly immerses you. I will, however, concede that when the ""flotilla"" arrives, there are oddly few ships on screen, which takes away (just for a moment) from an otherwise uplifting scene.<br/><br/>The film doesn't need to force a mellow-dramatic ""war is hell"" moment delivered by a shell-shocked Tommy down your throat. In fact, the whole film feels like one big expression of this feeling, but with a far more subtle and sinister undertone to it. Whitehead, Barnard and Styles don't ever seem to act, so much as react in real time and real life to the action around them, fearful of a faceless enemy we never truly see- all captured perfectly by Van Hoytema. ""Dunkirk"" feels as much of a horror as it does a war film; there's never a moment or actor that dampens the sense of threat or pulls you out of the moment. Tom Hardy's eyebrows give their best performance to date and the Spitfire scenes are amongst the most entertaining- all of the aforementioned areas (cinematography, sound, music) are perfectly encapsulated in the temporally warped ""Air"" segments of ""Dunkirk"".<br/><br/>Ultimately, if you come to ""Dunkirk"" expecting beautiful dialogue, huge masses of extras conveying the scale of the conflict, or a heart-warming session of flag-waving patriotism, you will be disappointed. There are elements of all three of these things, but they all give way to something else; something earthy and powerful, the likes of which I've never seen in the cinema before. All of this is capped off with the perfect climax of Fionn Whitehead's voice speaking Churchill's words over Zimmer's music; all of which plays over Tom Hardy staring at his burning Spitfire on the wrong side of the channel. Despite moments of despair, it is, much like the events represented, utterly triumphant. We are never led to think of Dunkirk as a victory per se, but when the screen finally went black I couldn't help but find myself tearfully empowered and swelling with pride. <br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" is a technical masterpiece, a work of art which expresses everything beautiful about film-making and, at its core, is something touchingly human. I understand, however, that others failed to find this emotion and found the film cold in this regard. This may well come down to something as simple as personal preference, but for this critic; ""Dunkirk"" is technically perfect, cleverly told, emotionally exhausting and a stunning piece of modern cinema."

","Unlike other reviewers on this site I'm actually not going to post a critique as such but more a few words about how this film can make you feel. You can see from the score I've attributed that I believe it to be a good film but I have never seen one like this before. For me at least it defies categorization and sits alone not as a movie per se but more of an hour and forty six minutes to be experienced. You will feel immersed in the tragedy, horror, desperation, and sacrifice as well as the hope, spirit, courage, and pure determination of those involved.

","The movie is sensational, totally unlike any war movie. A very epic thriller. I believe that Nolan will be able to win some Oscar in some category that the film of Nolan will dispute. I watched Dunkirk at the cinema ""IMAX"", it is a great experience, the main sound is very magnificent. Dunkirk is the best film recorded in Imax. Christopher Nolan with his creativity and intelligence ability has revolutionized the use of IMAX cameras, which have made it possible to have a large resolution size that is much larger than conventional ... Dunkirk is a cinematic spectacle, it was the best visual and sound experience. Best movie of the year so far ..."

","I like the approach this movie took to present the subject matter. First off, it got right to the point which I always respect. Then, it didn't overwhelm with too much data or subject matter but instead focused on three different points of view of which I found fascinating and appropriate. The premise ""Dunkirk"" is shown from the perspective of land, sea and air with some impressive filming that needs acknowledgment. I saw it in Imax and was captivated and riveted to the screen (my actual words at the time) and at the same time a solid sense of sadness for the madness of war. Men killing men who don't want to be killed but if not killed will kill at the first chance they get. The insanity goes on and I found it at some point repulsive at how man could stoop to these levels of kill or be killed. The movie itself is blameless in this matter and even gets a good nod for presenting the point quite well. I also like the fact that there were no big stars to detract from the film and no one character that stands out. Now for the take-aways, I had trouble understanding some of the British when they speak. Its not just this movie but in all Brit movies for that matter. What doesn't help is all the loud explosions making one trying to understand very hard to do. Still, much to the directors credit, I was able to follow the story and what was going on without hearing spoken words. Another dynamic was on the dogfighting in the skies which was excellent. I had trouble distinguishing who was who as in good guy bad guy as they just showed guys in the cockpit. Unfortunately they all look and sound alike in the cockpit too. Imax for a movie like this is highly recommended if not for the rumbling and larger than life scenes but for actually trying to dodge enemy fire that's how real it comes across. Well done here. It is not a movie I would see again as there are no memorable scenes but it is a movie I would recommend you see for history demands that we all know what took place and how lives were taken one after another. Also, the movie shows men hoping and then giving up hope quite well. I came away from this movie believing that if I was in that war, was there something I could have done better than these men like saving my life or someone elses? The fact is when the bombs drop, when the machine guns strafe, you never know if your number is up or not and that is even if you think you are safe too. Fate, destiny or providence truly calls the play in action that you see in this movie. When your time is up, it is up is what I walked away with. Very sobering. Good movie to snack on, with a tasty drink as well. The movie Dunkirk was done well"
"yashrajs536","7","1","7","13 August 2017"," Not a masterpiece but a good drama !!
","Well today I went to watch ""Dunkirk"" only and only because I am a ""Nolan Fan"". He is one of the finest directors Hollywood could ever imagine for. After watching the trailer I was sure that it would be a drama centric rather than showing war. And it is my personal perspective that this movie is totally made to earn money. But not to show any scenarios of war to the audience. It's just centered on soldiers survival. Which it showed beautifully. Well it can also be understood that no body can make a movie on WW 2 as there were many events happened during that time. But I am thankful to Milan for showing us a taste of what happens when a war comes. How much difficulties soldiers face during the war. And it was horrifying according to me. <br/><br/>Direction wise what can I say?? Just two words ""Maestro Nolan"". Acting wise the actors were good there was no heroism where one hero survives no matter how much he is wounded or anything. It showed the reality of the war not any unexpected miracles total reality Picturization was very good and well captured. But I recommend that it is watchable only in IMAX format. Otherwise it will not give any entertainment in a single screen to the viewers. So overall I can say that it is purely a commercial movie but it does give some sense and shows the consequences of war. Not a Nolan masterpiece but a good movie it achieved it's goal of showing survival of the soldiers."
"ericozu","10","1","7","9 August 2017"," Uniquely conceived gripping success.
","Some people want ""character development."" They want what Spielberg gives them. They want a soap opera. They want to be told what to feel and when. Character development means a kind of conventional story with a lot of familiar markers - it tells you whom to feel for and when and why. This is the stuff of Saving Private Ryan: it's hokey often, it doesn't push us too far out of comfort but it is designed to jerk those tears. I'm glad Dunkirk had a different vision, the kind of ontological realism that bypasses Hollywood conventions. This film is not about HUMANITY, really though it's intensely human, it's about war and the human experience of war. We are ants. It's luck and hope when hot metal comes raining from the sky or ambling through the surf. In a massive experience like Dunkirk, the people have not much power individually and the forces are gargantuan. To represent this one needs a vision, not a story or a soap opera, a vision. Dunkirk is unique certainly...gripping, overwhelming, powerful, and even beautiful though terrifying,"
"peterkettle-904-444717","10","1","7","9 August 2017"," Dunkirk thoughts
","It is a more brilliant film than I expected. A kaleidoscope of the events and incidents that comprise this disaster, it is a masterpiece of montage and collage. Or, more simply, a scrapbook; think of Eisenstein's Potemkin; the shot eye, the shattered eyeglasses, the baby carriage trundling down the steps, the teeming and stumbling legs and feet; this surely is the model for Nolan's great shuffling fragmented and eruptive scenes. <br/><br/>No simple narrative, no sentimental back story, not even a straight time line. This is a chaotic portrait of a chaotic event; the camera is restive and questing, searching almost, to reveal details and perhaps reasons, and not finding anything. Perhaps it is a bit British to pour so much into a defeat, but it was a truly great event. The sequences jump all the time, and time itself jumps too. Night and day, rough sea and calm sea, silence and explosions, dogfights cut to a close up face on a ship, and then an explosion of flaming oil on the surface of the sea which offers the stark choice of burning or drowning. <br/><br/>Back to the dogfight and perspective along the fuselage of a Spitfire, with a yellow nosed Messerschmidt lining up behind. There is what seems to be some arbitrary target practice into the hull of a stranded trawler, but those holes appear from an unknown source. The shells could be German or British; we are not told. Nothing is explained or concluded and nobody is blamed. The Spitfire points at the Heinkel. The residual tatters of social structure in decay is also hinted at, but at that time it was still, just about, holding; officers and gentlemen and merely men, the men in orderly queues. But there are rebellious elements, with individuals jumping that queue. We're getting onto a boat no matter what, so duck down, hide here, become a stretcher bearer so we can squirm to the front of the queue. <br/><br/>Cut to the darkness of night, and the clear calm day. Alternate with rough seas and mist. It is an effective kaleidoscope, as is the music. This score has been praised and criticised but I thought it was superb. Hints of Elgar were not swollen into full blown surges of sentiment, but kept as a telling hint, an indication of national character and resolve. There is no conventional summary or explanation, only a fuzzy imprecision. In fact I wanted more facts; I came out wondering how many 'small ships' were used? How many men saved, how many lost? No such neat answers but Google says: In nine days, 192,226 British and 139,000 French soldiers – 331,226 in all – were rescued by the 700 little ships and around 220 warships. The rescue operation turned a military disaster into a story of heroism which served to raise the morale of the British. The success of the operation inspired Churchill's famous ""we shall fight on the beaches"" speech: We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender <br/><br/>Sticking my neck out after little time to think about it I would say this is Nolan's masterpiece."

"przemekkalwa-72803","10","1","7","24 July 2017"," Instant classic
","I watched, no, witnessed is a better word here, a masterpiece. A true and undisputed masterpiece of modern cinematography. From the very start to the end. Dunkirk is in the same category of movies as The Schindler's List or The Thin Red Line. Though this is not a war movie per se.<br/><br/>Some minor spoilers<br/><br/>There is no enemy shown, though danger and anxiety are omnipresent. From the first scene when in a surreal nightmarish set up the flyers are falling on soldiers from the dark sky. The intimidation tactic works well: you are defeated, we are everywhere and our grip is firming. The bullets are flying. The death toll is rising quickly. And then suddenly the beach. Soldiers queueing, standing in the water and waiting patiently for the rescue.<br/><br/>But there are no real characters here, no development. All of them just puppets in the hand of fate. The name of the game is survival. We barely remember their names, the dialogue is scarce, sometimes inaudible on purpose. There is no need for that. During wartime no one cares about your identity or your background. Nolan shows only what we need to see to tell the story. He is setting up three scenes for us, like in a theatre: the mole, the sky and the sea. Each of them has got a different timeline assigned. A week, a day and an hour. You are sucked into to his vision immediately.<br/><br/>There is one actor that is present here though. Constantly. Never silent. It is Hans Zimmer's score. Pumping anxiety into your bloodstream. From the first second of the movie until the very last. Music is unnerving, it is pulsating feverishly; mechanical tempo created with the sound of a ticking watch. It surrounds you like a tide only to back away, just for a moment though. It never stops completely. Not a one quiet moment. As if Dunkirk is one spectacular video for the music.<br/><br/>The cinematography is also magnificent; wide sombre landscapes are a phenomenal background to the horror conjured by human themselves. Unemotional and raw. No flag waving, no pompous speeches made. The Schindler's List has one very powerful scene that stayed with me. A little girl is running through the Jewish ghetto. Her red coat the only spot of colour in the all grey movie. In Dunkirk same contrast is achieved with the use of red again. This time it is jam, spread thinly on a toast. A memory of home. Heartbreaking.<br/><br/>And there this scene: the conversation between two officers. ""The tide is here"" says one. ""How do you know?"". ""The bodies have returned"". And with that you are punched straight in your gut: soldiers still queuing, knees deep in water, pushing away, ever so gently, floating bodies of their dead brothers in arms.<br/><br/>But it is the grand finale that is truly remarkable. All the timelines finally combined. All the pieces in place. When the crescendo hits I am paralyzed in my armchair. Zimmer's music is flexing its muscle in the full assault on your senses. I realize my hands are clutched tightly. Nails in my flesh. I watch on screen a ship which is starting to move slowly, finally escaping the cold, sandy graveyard. The engines roaring. And then the sky opens up and a massive bomber makes its way towards the survivors. <br/><br/>The guy sitting in front of me is on the edge of his seat. Clutching his head in disbelief. Emotions are running high. Normally I would laugh inside, I would make those jokes about how people can't control themselves. How easy it is for a director to show a couple of tricks to deceive the naïve audience. Not this time though. As I have got goosebumps all over my body. Mesmerized, I watch another plane, a small Spitfire, chasing the dark bomber. Will it catch up on time? This movie does not provide easy answers. No usual war clichés. Anything can happen.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is something that needs to be seen in a cinema. The bigger the screen the better. This is a movie made by a director and a composer in the peak of their prowess. Best Nolan movie so far. That's for sure. An instant classic."

"gcsman","10","1","7","23 July 2017"," I can't really imagine this being done any better
","I'm going to rate this a 10 (which I rarely do) because I just can't imagine this subject being done any better on film. It's going to be a certain Oscar nominee for best picture, director, cinematography, and who knows what else. My wife and I just got back from seeing it in a packed audience during its first weekend of release and we are still climbing down from the superb but unrelenting dramatic tension that carried the film from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Although the evacuation of soldiers from Dunkirk was very early in WW II (1940) and looked like a military disaster, in fact it was already a turning point in the war because Britain successfully saved more than 330,000 soldiers from either obliteration or internment. Director Nolan tells this vast story from the shifting viewpoints of several very focused individual sub-stories which keep you totally, seat-grippingly involved: one small yacht among the armada of little boats that crossed the Channel to retrieve the soldiers; two Spitfire pilots doing battle with German bombers and fighters; a handful of soldiers trying to do nothing more than survive long enough to get on a safe boat. Take a big canvas and make it personal.<br/><br/>The camera-work makes you feel like you are right there, right now, in the moment. The sequences in the air particularly were flat-out stunning. Some scenes you get to see multiple times from different viewpoints (desperate soldiers in the water, men on the boats, the Spitfire pilots) as the story loops around and back in incredibly clever split-time format; Nolan is a genius. And Hans Zimmer does it again for scoring music that ratchets up the tension right away and keeps it there (and just wait for his quotation of Nimrod from Elgar's Enigma Variations at the high point of victory with the arrival of the small boats).<br/><br/>I came out of the theater realizing that it is very good to be living in a time and place without war. Yesterday I saw an item on the internet about a 97-year-old war vet who was there on the beach of Dunkirk as a 20-year-old. He saw the movie as soon as it was out and according to him, the real thing was just like that."
"kenbarr-ny","9","1","7","22 July 2017"," Storytelling At Its Very Finest
","This is a very atypical movie, where the story is paramount and the characters both support and provide the symbolism. Fionn Whitehead's character is named Tommy, the nickname given for British soldiers. That's exactly what he is, a common soldier with all the human attributes. No phony heroism here. He does both good and bad just as any human would given the desperate situation he was faced with. French soldiers were stopped from boarding British vessels in the first day or two of the evacuation, as depicted. There was a definite animosity between the two allied forces at all levels. Christopher Nolan presents with the truth, warts and all.<br/><br/>Of particular note is the story line involving Mark Rylance as Mr.Dawson. His small boat is requisitioned by the Navy to help in the evacuation and chooses to sail it himself with the aid of his son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and a younger boy George (Barry Keoghan). While most of this story line is fictionalised, certain aspects appear to based on the voyage to the beaches by the pinnace ""Sundowner"" and her remarkable owner Commander Charles Lightoller, the senior surviving officer of RMS Titanic. As they sail back to England fully loaded with survivors, a German fighter attacks and Mr. Dawson precisely directs Peter to avoid its attack. A rescued RAF pilot asks Peter if his father was in the RAf. No, replies Peter, his older brother was and he had been killed very early in the war. This is almost exactly from the Lightoller story. Rather than sensationalise this story, it is deftly woven into the narrative of the fictional characters and works remarkably well.<br/><br/>Finally, it is up to Tommy to tell us the meaning of this carnage. Rather than 30,000 troops being rescued, nearly 10 times that were brought back to fight another day. While riding a train from the coast, he reads Churchill's famous speech, beginning with ""Wars are not won by evacuations"" and climaxing with ""We shall never surrender."" Rather than bringing someone to portray the Great Briton, Mr. Nolan chooses to put these majestic words in the mouth of his a private soldier. It resonates with power.<br/><br/>This movie strengths are its subtlety and fidelity to story telling rather than providing star turns for the actors. It is a tribute to the entire cast that they followed Mr. Nolan's plan and together brought forth this powerful retelling of the Miracle of Dunkirk."
"Screen_Blitz","9","1","7","22 July 2017"," Christopher Nolan's rendition of one of World War II's most relevant battles explodes for a breathtaking experience
","Hollywood mogul Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker who almost always knows how to hit the right notes in every genre he ventures. Stepping away from the realm of comic book adaptations and science- fiction, Nolan tests the waters of the war genre in this harrowing retelling is one of most heroic events of World War II in the European front. The journey here is through the terrifying atmosphere of the Dunkirk evacuation following a brutal defeat by the Germany army, and Nolan's take on this event is, in the simplest words, breathtaking. It is a powerful story of survival that capitalizes on tension from the opening scene to the very end, and if Nolan proves anything, it is that he more than knows how to keeps moving without sparing even in a single dull moment throughout its runtime. From a technical scaled to its narrative heft, he becomes the driving force of leading its ensemble cast on the road through one of the defining events of the second war. Set in 1940, this film focuses on the story of 400,000 soldiers of the Allied Powers trapped on the beach of Dunkirk, France by the German Air Force raining down bombs and gunning down the poor soldiers down below. Escaping on the naval ships accompanied by English Admiral (played by Kenneth Branagh), the soldiers are just miles away from home but are forced to deal with the overwhelming German air force attacking them in, that is until the British air force comes to their rescue. The film follows three intertwining perspectives, the first involving British soldiers Tommy (played by Fionn Whitehead) and who escapes with fellow soldiers (one played by pop-star Harry Styles) on a boat across the sea while dodging enemy fire from above. The second one following British spitfire pilot Farriet (played by Tom Hardy) and his squadron fending off against German pilots thousands of feet above the English channel, and another one following Mr. Dawnson (played by Mark Rylance) commanding a private ship on the sea with the help of his son Peter and a young local teenager, while saving a fallen, disoriented soldier (played by Cillian Murphy) in the process. <br/><br/>This war epic is not much more of a war film than it is a survival flick. After all, the goal of these thousand soldiers was to fight against the invading German Air Force for their life in what was seemingly a hopeless situation until the British Air Force arrived on scene. Christopher Nolan captures every moment with stunning emotional resonance and palpable authenticity, and the tension smoldering each sequence almost never lets up. Opening with a British Private played by Fionn Whitehead, Nolan dedicates virtually no time into developing any of the character following their introductions on screen, so there is never a character we are able to emotionally latch onto, let alone distinguish as nearly every character is identical to their dark hair and green army uniforms. The politics behind the battle are left alone as well. Instead, Nolan jumps straight into the action showing the harrowing chaos of these soldiers on land, air, and sea. Similar to 'Memento', Nolan also uses a bold method of experimenting with time, which involves presenting the story into three separate perspectives intertwining with each other. While his method is somewhat effective, it also exhibits the disadvantage of occasionally complicating the storyline, especially as each separate segment takes place within varying amounts of time. On the bright side, his method does very little hinder the gripping realism of each sequence which are shot by Hoyte Van Hoytema who captures the claustrophobia of the soldiers trapped in a sinking ship and Tom Hardy confined inside the cockpit while fighting off German pilots. As this film carries a PG- 13 rating, unused in the war genre, Nolan strays away from the graphic carnage of these sequences in place of capturing the paranoia and emotional devastation of the soldiers, most of which is nicely assisted by a soaring score by Hans Zimmer. Do not go in expecting blood splatters and limbs blown off. And for the performances, everyone in the cast gets the done - - none of whom stand among the rest. <br/><br/>Dunkirk is a powerful, breathtaking war epic that shows Christopher Nolan breathing life into the war genre with spectacular realism and an emotionally gripping tone, while honoring the brave heroes during the harrowing event. This movie reminds moviegoers of the director's talent that ravages the beauty of Hollywood. In other words, it is surprising to say this film could stand as one of the most profound movies of the year, possibly even worthy for some talk for the Oscars."

"lesmoughjames","7","1","8","19 November 2017"," I was a little bit disappointed by the lack of emotions provoked by Dunkirk but nevertheless, was stunned by it's visuals
","I was expected way more out of the performances and plot of Dunkirk; instead of a conventional story with character development and a problem to solve,the movie plunges us onto Dunkirk amidst the carnage. This isn't inherently a bad thing as the horrors and tragedy surrounding the event are presented accurately and respectfully- we the viewer,fully understand the struggle faced by British, Belgian and French soldiers during and leading up to the crisis caused by the Nazi invasion of France. <br/><br/>There is no connection with any of the various characters throughout the movie, so the element of suspense ceases to exist. This is probably the most heavily criticized factor of Dunkirk and whether it can be excused or not is down to the viewers preference. Personally, I love more story driven filmic experiences with well animated characters; as Dunkirk lacks this, something that I believe to be intentional, I cannot help but feel a little disappointed.<br/><br/>Despite this, I still enjoyed the movie, watching it for my birthday at the cinema with friends. The visuals and cinematography are impeccable which is to be expected from Nolan and his team. I also have a great interest in the World Wars and all the costumes and vehicles seemed highly accurate.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Dunkirk portrays to a masterful level, the terror that marked end of the Phoney War and plunged Europe as well as the rest of the world into another conflict ending millions of lives world wide. Being in the center of this chaos, there is no time to fully understand what others are thinking, what kind of people they are, who they may leave behind. We can only watch and hope for their safety."

The way how the director put 3 different stories that represent different moments in time, come together in one final scene. Hopefully more of this to come. Definitely one of the best movies made this year."

","Is this a great classic that will last the test of time? Probably not. Does it suffer from Nolan chronology? A little, yes.<br/><br/>Is it a poignant reminder of the deeds of so few to ensure the freedoms that so many take for granted in today's world we live? Yes it is.<br/><br/>If you are expecting an epic war film with bullets and bombs aplenty then you really should stay clear or rather perhaps you shouldn't and go watch it to educate yourself as this is a movie more about the people who find themselves thrust into wars and their actions throughout.<br/><br/>The movie does nothing to glorify war and nearly steers clear of making a hero out of anyone in the movie altogether instead it highlights the deeds and spirit of the British people during wartime.<br/><br/>It was also a nice touch for those that remembered the movie Battle of Britain made back in the 60's starring a young Michael Caine as a fighter pilot to have him as a cameo in the same role albeit as a voice over only."

"shamrock_d","10","1","8","26 August 2017"," Visually and aurally emotional, gripping and pulsating
","I really liked Dunkirk. I consider it one of the best movies (if not the best movie) of 2017.<br/><br/>I have never gone to see a movie because of a director or any particular actor. Frankly, this is the first time that I have learned of the ""fame"" of Thomas Nolan and the movies he made. I loved ""Interstellar"", liked ""inception"" and not once did I notice Thomas Nolan's name. ""Dunkirk"", I feel, surpasses both.<br/><br/>I saw the movie in an IMax cinema. I'm glad I did and, frankly, I'm glad too that I read some of the positive and negative reviews here on IMDb. They prepared me for the non-linear progression of the movie, the loud, booming soundtrack, lack of character development as well as no central character or a story line / plot. Yes, I saw all of these ""faults"" but, for me, these were the very things that made the movie so compellingly emotional and gripping.<br/><br/>Dialogue was minimal but the little that was said contributed very nicely to what the movie was trying to convey. Much of the movie's message was through the visuals and the soundtrack. The facial expressions, body language, the planes' and ships' ""roles"", the simple acts of eating slices of bread and jam and the subdued reading of Churchill's words all contributed to the montage. You could actually ""see"" the words, feelings and agonizing decisions going through each character's eyes and the actions they took. The flashbacks connected the three ""central"" groups that culminated in the final result.<br/><br/>Somewhat surprisingly, even to myself, I found the lack of numbers in terms of soldiers, ships, boats and planes appropriate to the feel and atmosphere of the film. It conveyed to me the sense of desolation and being alone despite even the few hundred that we see standing around on the beach and pier.<br/><br/>I noticed too the lack of CGI which, for me at least, made it so much more true to life. Some negative reviews asked where the production money went. I believe quite a bit of it must have gone to the sinking of actual ships and boats or, at the very least, full-size props in broad daylight and not behind a screen of smoke, fire or the dark of night. As a result, the sinking and drowning of men trapped in compartments or under a capsizing ship felt so horrific and intense. For me, again, the sinking of the Titanic was nowhere near as good.<br/><br/>Thinking back, too, not once did I see the face or uniform of a German soldier or pilot. This obvious omission actually adds to the primary focus on the soldiers and ordinary people involved in the struggle of survival and rescue at Dunkirk.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of plane and space ship crashes which, while dramatic and life-like, are still obviously a result of CGI. If the planes ditching and the ships sinking were CGI, they must be the best I've seen.<br/><br/>A quick Internet search does show that CGI was kept to a minimal. Some 60 real ships (some actually from WWII) were found and they had to coordinate these ships driven by real people in the scenes. The RAF fighters and Messerschmitts were real and flown in the air battle scenes.<br/><br/>Let me quote from an online article from the Independent UK: ""Everything happens in real life in real time.""<br/><br/>It's obvious then that the producers and Thomas Nolan could have very easily expanded the number of extras, boats, ships and planes with CGI which they chose not to use. I'm glad they didn't. I'm not saying they used none but they did say they kept it minimal, the result being keeping it seamless and very real. CGI, while impressive in its own right, is in the end to all movie-goers, discernible. I've always had a slight tinge of disappointment when I see this, though I still enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is not a war movie. Don't go and see it if you're expecting one. It's about survival, emotions and life-or-death decision-making. Dunkirk provided the location (actually shot there) and the situation. The producers should have said in their trailers and on their posters that this was not a war movie.<br/><br/>I went to see the movie with my sister (the first in the last 10 or so years) and a couple of her friends. Except for one of her friends who felt there should have been more of a plot, we were totally engrossed in the roller-coaster of emotions, visuals and the sound track. The cinema was 80% empty (for which we were actually glad) and only one viewer left early (a young man in his 20's). One movie-goer actually clapped at the end. I didn't, though I was tempted too and would have meant it if I did.<br/><br/>It was a sense of peace that I felt when I looked into the face of the pilot, knowing that the right decision had been made.<br/><br/>As a final note, I would like to quote again from the online article of the Independent UK: ""Everyone on set was permanently aware and alert – no one was looking at their cell phones or sitting around. They were all completely absorbed in the action ..."""

"farchettiensis","10","1","8","10 August 2017"," Not a movie I'd expect to watch in 2017
","There were few films I saw in life in relation to which I thought nothing should be added or removed. I can't decide which is the best movie I have ever seen, and maybe this is just a foolish question. However, I think no movie had never left me with such a clear impression of being a complete work of art as has Dunkirk. I had not watched any of Nolan's prior movies, nor am I familiar with his conceptions of art and beyond. As I left the theater, it didn't seem to matter. <br/><br/>No rating other than 10 would do justice to this movie. This is truly a work of a art. The structure of the movie is brilliant and it's absolutely fundamental to understanding its symbolism. If you miss it, you will not have understood what this movie is about.<br/><br/>I overhead some folks saying it's just another war movie, that is does not provide sufficient emotional attachment to characters, that, all in all, it's a passable, lukewarm sort of movie. It's none of that. Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>Sadly, we've been conditioned by Hollywood to have our hands held by directors and screenplay writers, who abuse narrative and strip cinema of its poetic potential, of its ability to speak and communicate through the poetic discourse, through the magic of images, of camera-work, of subtle symbolism. <br/><br/>We have been led to think that artificial emotiveness, abuse of dialogue and plain narrative, is the normal standard. We've been taught that Spielberg's obvious approach is the golden standard. That, in order to connect with a character, we must learn of his grieving family back at home, that we must see funerals, or be told ""beautiful"" stories his/her, and so on and so forth. <br/><br/>Dunkirk demonstrates this need not be true. It demonstrates the power of cinema as a unique form of art. It asserts values, it asserts a philosophy, a conception of life, of art, of beauty, of virtue. I wonder if this is the reason why it has received backlash from a significant portion of our nihilist Western society? <br/><br/>""It's just another WWII movie."" It's not. I'd chance saying the war is but its setting, its backdrop - and a powerful one, like I had rarely seen on the screens. My interpretation about this movie is that it is about individuals, about individual choices. But it's about human life, too, and hard choices we make. It's a manifesto against nihilism. It purports to show, the way I see it, that the seemingly random actions of individual matter, regardless of their scale. It's the opposite of the Coen brother's philosophy in movies such as No Country for Old Man.<br/><br/>For these reasons, this was not a movie I expected to see. Not in 2017. Not when movies are either so offensively dumb or communicate a philosophy of nihilism or, alternatively, of a romanticized form of determinism, as in Moonlight (2016), or even a pedantic rehearsal of the artsy sort.<br/><br/>This is an authentic, beautiful work of art, and I'm grateful for it, because it tells me that there still is authentic art and beauty. That we have choices. Choices to make beautiful and genuine works of art such as this."

","After 3 painful years of anticipation, I was fortunate enough to get passes for the advanced screening of Dunkirk. However, I wasn't prepared for what unfolded on the big screen. This movie is a rendition. With barely any narrative and full of long shots with whirring plane noises that make you cringe, it is perhaps at the zenith of Nolan's film making. You know that a filmmaker has succeeded when his work has the capacity to teleport you into the scene, and Dunkirk does exactly that. Momentarily, you become Hardy's copilot, the seamen's first mate and the infantry's best friend! I am thrilled that Nolan has moved away from his usual style of film making and returned to producing technically sound films. There is a lot of talk about the effective usage of the mis-en-scene, but trust me when I say this, Dunkirk will put a rest to that! With artful plays on temporal story telling, engrossing and convergent plot lines and involving actors who had just their eyebrows to articulate emotion with, the movie is certainly a Magnum Opus in film making. Watch the movie this weekend!"
"CupPusta","9","1","8","22 July 2017"," A brilliant story about the moral.
","Asphalt paved street. Modern windows. Modern housing on embankment. (Mostly) modern naval ships. Erghh... I told to myself on the first 15 minutes of the movie. With such a budget Mr.Nolan could do better - my thought continued. And then... it all came to me. 1st. It ain't your another war re-acting movie. It's not about that. It's not about armies moved like chess on the boards. No. 2nd. Read some history, give some thought. What d'you see at this spot of time? A change of an epoch. Fallen France, who's major ally, British Empire sends expedition troops to (conquer? stop?) a perfect German modern war machine. It's only Britain now. Nobody else. USSR is still busy dividing Poland and Baltic with Germany. US still have to live through Pearl Harbor disaster to get them into a major war. And UK is aching. Once grand Empire faces now a clear potential Channel dash - and a fight on the Isles themselves. 3rd. A demoralized army group. Yes, they're keeping perfect rows on the beach (very handy for bombing...). But, when it comes to man-to-man, it comes to 'you go, I survive (or I go, you survive, no other alternative). They are moved out, their evacuation ships are sunk, they are moved in again. It's fate. The feeling of fatality runs through 80 pct of the movie. 4th. The army has to be saved. Compulsory. Necessarily. Absolutely. Otherwise, who'll fight when it comes on the English shores?... And here, the 'British' idea unravels to its fullness. You don't save the Army only (though, saving such a number of man is an exceptional retreat operation). It's the Spirit. Spirit, being shown by the people, when the time is at ""if not me (us), than who else?!"". Those chaps on the beach HAVE to be saved. Even shattered and battered - but in the oncoming years of war to go, they will be a core - as we say in Russia, ""a one beaten man costs as two unbeaten"". ... And that was brilliantly shown by the movie creators. Through each individual eyes. Through simultaneous events - at sea, on shore, and in the air. The history is about survival. Or extinction. An historic achievement, on the way. When nothing else is viable - you have a moral to keep you going. VERDICT: a brilliant story about the moral. Dramatic. Personal. Painful. And true. ... PS. I praise all acting by all actors in this movie. It's pointless to discuss, who's 'britishness' is more here... But, Mark Rylance, in telling the essence of ""There's no hiding from this, son,... We've got a job to do"" - that goes deep into your mind. So damn well played!"

","Another amazing picture by Christopher Nolan. This time the Nolan Movie is not about Amazing Story with Action or Turning Points, This time the movie is all about truly feeling or experiencing the incident that occurred in 'Dunkirk'. In the technician point of view the Cinematography, Acting is very good."
"arungeorge13","8","1","8","21 July 2017"," Ticks off most 'war-movie' boxes, without shedding a single drop of blood! [+81%]
","Two names apart from Christopher Nolan seem to have stuck with me after watching 'Dunkirk'.. Hans Zimmer (composer) and Hoyte Van Hoytema (cinematographer). Both these men rise to the occasion and furnish impeccable work for 'Dunkirk'. If the viewer gets a feeling of being right there on war-ground with the lead characters, due credit needs to go to Hoytema and Zimmer. 'Dunkirk boasts of a pulsating soundtrack coupled with mind-bending cinematography. <br/><br/>While character development and dialogue are almost non-existent, Nolan takes the viewer on a journey that delineates the dire essence of war by putting higher emphasis on the aesthetics. When ships sink dime a dozen and fighter planes drop bombs like cows poop dung, one is left to imagine how war can turn out to be persistently brutal. The film is told from three different perspectives..land, sea and air. Episodes taking place at different timelines eventually mesh into each other owing to some smart writing by Nolan and editing by Lee Smith. A crop of well-known faces such as Fionn Whitehead, Harry Styles, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy play some of the more significant characters. <br/><br/>Nolan's choices of wide-angled shots are something for every big- budget film-maker to conduct research on. The struggles of warfare and evacuation are depicted as jarringly as they can get..soldiers being welcomed into a ship with a warm blanket and jam toast only to find themselves gasping for breath a moment later when a torpedo hits, men who hide inside a boat waiting for the tides to get rougher only to find themselves under constant threat of being shot at, young soldiers covered in an oil-spill feeling aghast at the thought of being set on fire via air-strike..there are absolutely zero compromises made. <br/><br/>The final act is pure masterstroke. The tension is upheld by Zimmer's 4/4 beat, speaking a language of its own. The action in the air is viciously exciting but gets sort of repetitive later on. It should also be noted that the film's biggest star Tom Hardy wears an oxygen mask almost 90% of his screen-time (Bane, Mad Max and now this! Surprising? NOT!). Nolan's adept writing also points fingers at the fact that the affairs of war are perennial in nature - heavy sighs are often followed by loud screams of joy, followed by even heavier sighs; humiliation followed by jubilation in a cycle of crests and troughs. <br/><br/>'Dunkirk' is a perfect example on how to make an audience- enthralling war film without rendering physical carnage and bloodshed. The horrors of war can be seen heavily in the eyes of the men at Dunkirk, and that suffices.<br/><br/>Verdict: Excellent, but definitely not Nolan's best!"
"Imaltzer","8","1","8","21 July 2017"," FOR NOLAN FANS: Where Dunkirk stacks up
","To get it all out in the open, I have a deep bias towards worshipping the ground that Christopher Nolan steps on. His previous work has left an indelible impression on how I watch movies and has changed what I know possible to put to the screen. For this reason, I have played Dunkirk back through my head many more times than I would for any other director. After it all, I can affirmatively state that Dunkirk is a technical masterpiece, with an (intentional) absence of the emotional core that so many of us are accustomed to seeing.<br/><br/>From the direction, to the editing, to the cinematography, to the score, to the set design, to the stunt coordination, etc. Dunkirk is glorious to behold. I can understand why many critics have responded so positively to this film. It truly is incredible and worth the extra price of IMAX admission on that plane alone. Having said that, Dunkirk is a stark contrast to the formula people are accustomed to in relation to a narrative arc. Essentially, there is none.<br/><br/>But people cannot claim to love ""graphic"" and ""realistic"" war movies, and then turn to say that this movie doesn't reach that threshold. It doesn't take flying limbs and hanging intestines to make a realistic war movie. Sure, certain aspects of war do require that level of gore to be completely accurate, but what Nolan explores here is the unshakable dread and hopelessness of defeat. In many ways, Dunkirk is more realistic than most war movies out there. One of the primary strengths of the film is that it drops you from your seat right into the center of chaos. And in these heart-pounding moments, you don't want to be a hero, you just want to get out. The omnipresent sense of fear courses through the entire movie, because Nolan surrounds you with his film and the feeling of utter desperation. <br/><br/>Regardless, I foresee that many people will not like this movie. It's been touched on in many other reviews, but with the lack of a traditional protagonist, a certain piece of the story feels lost. There is no single character for the audience to really get behind or root for. I would argue that the real protagonist is simply survival. But as with any time a new form of storytelling is employed, there is going to be controversy and disagreement. I am tired of the formulaic, cut & paste structure so commonly used in many blockbusters today, so Dunkirk is a refreshing break from form. There were still times however, where I felt a palpable disconnect from the film due to this strange story structure. <br/><br/>As I stated in the beginning, I love Nolan's work. It is for this reason, that I accept I've looked deeper into this film than I would have for any other director. In most cases, I would dismiss this film as a mediocre attempt at trying something different, but knowing how smart Nolan is, has prevented me from doing that for Dunkirk. And once I peeled back the layers, I started to understand what he's done with this film. Instead of giving you characters to have emotions for, he has aimed at instilling in you the emotions felt by the every-day young men that actually experienced this event. And not enough can be said for the technical mastery executed to bring this film to life. Even so, this is far from my favorite Nolan film. The Dark Knight, Inception and Memento are all still well above Dunkirk in my personal ranking. The critics claiming this to be Nolan's definitive best film greatly affected my expectations, and I want to set that straight for any future viewers before they see this film."
"ameyarocks96","9","1","8","21 July 2017"," Another Nolan classic
","I went in for the movie being a Nolan fanatic and I am pleased to say he didn't disappoint me. The movie will keep you engaged till the end like his previous movies. The characters created by Nolan did the whole job of portraying the story beyond imagination. The soldiers yearning for freedom and the psychological effects of war on them has been beautifully depicted via these characters.<br/><br/>And not to forget,the magical musician H.Zimmer. He provides the perfect mood for a war epic, makes your heart beat faster now and then with his music.<br/><br/>Every actor did complete justice to their respective roles. Fionn was incredible.Hardy as always did what he does best. <br/><br/>Undoubtedly this is one of the best war movies ever ever made depicting the pathetic scenario of World War II.Though I found it a bit lacking in emotions.The only thing absent for me was that emotional grasp that a war movie ought to have. Movies like 'Apocalypse Now' have done it better.<br/><br/>A good movie? Hell yes!<br/><br/>Greatest work of Nolan till date? I am afraid not.

"soundoflight","8","1","9","25 November 2017"," The Best Film of 2017?
","As the year 2017 draws nearer to a close, I find myself looking back on the year that was in film. Two things stand out to me. One, it was very mediocre year for film. Hollywood is increasingly churning out ""pabulum for the masses"" in the way of high grossing superhero movies (I guess you can't fully blame them if that's all people want to see). And two, ""Dunkrirk"" stands out as one of the most memorable film experiences of the year. <br/><br/>I suppose seeing it in full IMAX helps in that regard (and you really missed out if you waited for DVD on this one). But more than that, ""Dunkirk"" stands out because it completed bucks the trend. In a day of CGI and blue screens, Nolan shot it all in old-school film. In a day where most people would have expected this film to be about gore and epic battles, Nolan went micro, focusing instead on a few individual stories, carefully interwoven, taken out of the overall battle for Dunkirk. And in a day where films are typically comprised of jump- cut editing, Nolan gives us long pans down beaches and along rows of men. <br/><br/>It's not a perfect film, and I think there's a certain level of ""fanboyism"" at play here in some of the reviews. I greatly disliked the loud and jarring soundtrack. Some of the acting was just OK, and Nolan completely failed to capture some of the historic realities of what actually occurred there. Notably, I don't think the true scope of the hundreds of thousands of men and thousands of pieces of equipment was captured. But then you have to go back to the point about either making a ""film"" or a ""CGI-fest."" Given that choice, I will gladly accept the former for what it is. <br/><br/>Barring some hidden gems I've overlooked, this will probably land in the #1 spot on my end of year list."
"christophershobris","7","1","9","29 August 2017"," Nolan's Best?
","I don't know if I would say this is Nolan's best film in his career. Considering The Dark Knight, Memento, and Inception but nonetheless Dunkirk is a solid film. Another film to add to the list of war films that will leave an impact. It also helps if you are a fan of war films. It isn't as gratifying as say...Saving Private Ryan, as the emotion and power isn't their as much as that film. The story is very mature, and the subject matter is professionally handled. Christopher Nolan also proves he is still one of the best filmmakers working today. The cast strength is similar to films like 2001: A Space Odyssey in that many of the main stars are practically unknowns. The only well-known cast members are Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, and Kenneth Branagh. Despite that the newer actors do a superb job. I can surely see some of them in future films. So is this one of Nolan's best? In my opinion its behind The Dark Knight, Inception, Memento, and Insomnia. So about mid-pack. However it does keep me interested in what Nolan will do in the future. Now to grade. Story: A- Accuracy to History: A Music: B+ Characters: A- Effects: A Overall: A-"
"peripatitis-33392","10","1","9","27 August 2017"," a near masterpiece, definitely the work of an artist.
","I am mostly nitpicking here... Anyway. The last ~10 minutes were not necessary imo from a cinematic point of view, perhaps they were from a sentimental-historic point of view but if the film ended the moment the soldiers are unloaded from the ships back to England and slowly are leaving while handed blankets it would be an exquisite exercise in form.<br/><br/>The music although very well produced follows the same ol' pattern from most Zimmer- Nolan collaborations. A stylistic approach standing above all these films making it's ""manipulative"" power very upfront, almost annoying.<br/><br/>It works very well but it starts to feel a bit gimmicky. The ending music though, more like a Vangelis copycat, is actually quite bad. <br/><br/>As for the critic about the lack of character development etc? <br/><br/>I would like to believe that the fear of shame the soldier feels in the train is the directors hidden critic for the audience asking character development although probably not..<br/><br/>A masterpiece is not a bunch of ticks a movie gets in x number of categories. This is a strongly emotional movie and if someone cannot experience empathy for the desperation, fear and horror young kids experience in Dunkirk, the suffocation of drowning etc surely using ""props"" to build a character wouldn't satisfy them either. For me character development would be against what this movie is about."
"akshay-ak-kumar","9","1","9","27 August 2017"," Another Masterpiece !!
","Christopher Nolan is legend and Dunkirk confirms it again. He is rare film maker who knows how to blend reality and fiction and keeps us glued to our seats till the very end.<br/><br/>He can make commercial blockbusters like the Batman series and can also make intellectual blockbusters like Inception and Memento. This guy is a genius and my favourite film makers. Interstellar may have been a small blip but Dunkirk is the maestro at his best.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is based on the true story of WW II evacuation of British soldiers on the beaches on Dunkirk in France in 1940. Nolan who also has written this story tells it through the eyes on different people at different time lines spread across two days. And he beautifully stitches them together at the end.<br/><br/>The story has everything which a war movie has i.e. patriotism, bravery, blood, death, despair, courage, cowardice, patience and finally hope. Yet its not like any other war movie. There are no long dialogues spoken between generals or soldiers, the blood shed is limited, the strategy is not discussed and there are no over the top fight sequences showing courage and bravery.<br/><br/>Nolan keeps it simple and tells us how war affects the lives on many and how soldiers have no choice but to fight even if they don't want to. They also want to live and not die at their young tender age. And in the end, he also shows us how pointless a war is. And finally each of us is a hero at the time of war in our own way.<br/><br/>The film's strength lies in its technical brilliance. The cinematography by Hoytema is mind blowing and definitely an Oscar winning work. While watching the movie, I felt I was transported to 1940 and was part of the soldiers. The art and production designer are top notch. Zimmer's music is good but was a bit too loud at time.<br/><br/>The star cast is brilliant with seasoned actors like Rylance and Hardy doing fine justice to their small and important roles. The rest of cast does a neat job considering the fact that many of them are not well known actors incl Harry Styles from One Direction.<br/><br/>The film is shot for an IMAX audience and the experience left me speechless. It is a beautiful film and a masterpiece from Nolan again. Must watch."

"danielmagalhaes2","10","1","9","9 August 2017"," Dunkirk's protagonist is anyone but Time
","What some people are saying about not being able to care much about the characters says more about people than about the movie. And I believe that for two reasons: <br/><br/>One is because we are so accustomed to the storytelling coming from the literary conventions (a journey, three acts etc) that we got addicted and now can't enjoy other proposals as much as we could.<br/><br/>And two is that the film is a narrative experiment in which Time is the main character and master of the destiny of all there. If there was a human protagonist, this would require more film time to focus on his dilemmas and would eventually break the triptych logic of the narrative. Thus, the only way for the experiment to work was to not privilege anyone on the screen but Time itself, something the soundtrack is practically literal about.<br/><br/>In other words, Nolan did not focus on an arc because he wanted to show that the collective and its cooperation is more important than the individual issues of whoever it is. That's why in my opinion Dunkirk can be considered a deeply humanistic film: while the enemy has no face, the hero has many."

","Saw it today. Good film - excellent acting from all involved. Realism on par with Saving Private Ryan. However, there are a lot of things that seem wrong with this movie, great as it is. I don't think ships sink that fast. The night scene maybe was a flashback. I don't think U-boats would have gotten that close to s launch torpedo in the channel. An airplane out of fuel probably can't shoot down a ME109 in full flight."
"aniseprakash","9","1","9","23 July 2017"," Another Nolan marvel
","Nolan is known for his mind boggling screenplay and storytelling. This time he has come out with a rather dull story with extraordinary movie making. The story is not so new a war that shakes the earth how soldiers fight for their life. What works in the movie is the way the story is conveyed.<br/><br/>Nolan has taken three different links that end up at the same point. Few minutes into the film might confuse the watchers (As Nolan does every time), but once the enlightenment happen the movie takes us inside. Especially the last half an hour of the movie is a thrill ride.<br/><br/>Music is the major aspect of the movie, it elevates the story and makes us to feel the scenes. At times we are left with no music but once it picks up we can actually live the scenes rather than watching it. I took the bullets myself when watching the movie (The marvel of movie making).<br/><br/>Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is perfect to plant the scenes in our mind. Lee Smith's editing helps us to understand the story better. The last half an hour is the perfect example of his hard work.<br/><br/>Above Christopher Nolan's master mind has made a dull story into a memorable experience. It is the experience that any Hollywood lovers don't want to miss. Nolan has added another feather to his hat."
"debjyoti1981","9","1","9","22 July 2017"," Epic !!
","Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is his 10th entry in the conventional filmography, a true chef-d'oeuvre. As reiterated earlier by many it's truly a story of survival in the backdrop of earlier stage of Second World War, where British, French & Belgian forces were on full retreat due to German's Blitzkrieg onslaught. Nolan always expects his audience to use the grey cells while enjoying his vision; Dunkirk is no different. The story commands a unique format which overlays different period, story on beach covering a week, one on sea which takes one full day into account, one in the air while portraying aerial combat which lasts an hour with non-linear blend in time skill- fully interlaced where the dots get connected during climax, very like his earlier works viz. 'Following', 'Memento', though the story is quite simple. 2018 will be a decisive year for Oscars, Dunkirk will surly put stiff competition for its cinematography, movie & direction. The aerial dog-fighting between the German Luftwaffe & British Royal Air-force were amazing. It's a movie which warrants an IMAX viewing. This is not a story of single character but of allied regiments which faced colossal defeat during the 'Invasion of France'. Standout performance goes to Tom Hardy & Mark Rylance. A must watch at the theaters."
"muhammadmohsin9","9","1","9","22 July 2017"," Cinematic masterpiece
","Christopher Nolan makes the trip to the cinema worthwhile each time. I would have paid double for this amazing movie.<br/><br/>The most fascinating aspect of the whole film is the significance of the 3 timelines that are highlighted in the very beginning of the film and how masterfully Nolan makes use of them. It takes a while for you to figure out. I wont spoil it for you any further. But he seamlessly melds 3 different perspectives in the film at the end. <br/><br/>The aerial shots and the music (Hans Zimmer... nuff said) will keep you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>One negative is that the movie does not have that many conversations and does seem emotionless at times. <br/><br/>Overall: Worth every penny in IMAX, would go twice just for the cinematography and the music."
"huntikanand","9","1","9","21 July 2017"," Probably the best movie you'll see all year. Probably.
","The movie is a true cinematic spectacle. Nolan plays to his strengths and succeeds beautifully in doing so. The cinematography, camera work and the narrative all in all are just perfect. What Nolan seems to have a problem with is, the background score. It could've been more undertoned and well, not so prevalent in all scenes. Some scenes would look best just with the war noises and the dialogue. Another problem I have (although a really tiny one) with the movie is that the part with the soldiers, that's supposed to be a 1/3rd or 1/4th of the whole thing is just, well not supported that well by the actors or maybe by the narrative. It needed to be more focused on just one soldier and his hardships, rather than the whole crowd maybe. All in all, a great movie with just 2, forgivable flaws."
"guptaarchit023","10","1","9","20 July 2017"," Dunkirk Movie Review
","In 2005 Nolan reinvented the SUPERHERO Movie Genre with Batman Begins (and more so with The Dark Knight in 2008). He did wonders with 2014's Interstellar (despite some flaws), Now we are in 2017 with yet another game changing Christopher Nolan Movie – DUNKIRK, The Movie Title as well as its history might be a mystery to many except people from Britain or France or some history buffs. It was something new to me; the only thing that attracted me to this project was Nolan. I am overjoyed to say that I was able to catch this movie before it's official release in India and was blown way with the ambitions this movie has, From the opening scene you're on the beaches of Dunkirk with the 4,00,000 soldiers. There are no front and centre characters in the movie, it is not a movie about that but it is a movie about their struggle to reach Home despite the fact they could actually see it but couldn't reach it because more often than not whenever they tried, they died. Land (1 Week) , Sea (1 Day) and Air (1 Hour) are three intercutting stories that take place. This style of Nolan really works because of his direction and Lee Smith who did the editing. The way they cut to the 3 different stories is perfect; everything works the way they want to. I won't say too much about the whole story of the movie because one should experience this in theatres. Dunkirk was shot with approx. 75% through IMAX cameras & yes it was worth it. Hoyte van Hoytema is The Cinematographer of Dunkirk Movie that did an incredible job to capture some GORGEOUS shots; he with Nolan made it possible for the audience to be immersed when the action was in the air with Spitfires. This movie deserves to be seen in the best possible theatre you can go to. Some people might have an opinion that a movie needs to make us really care about characters so that we are able to feel what they feel, If you are one of them this movie doesn't has that. It doesn't shows you Soldiers talking about them having a family or a child to make us relate to them but it flows with a strong yet a simple idea which is for a Human to reach Home. Dunkirk's cast includes some famous actors of Britain and some newcomers. Everyone does Justice to his role; everyone embodies the best one can to be a soldier in pursuit to SURVIVE. Among many The Shivering Soldier (Cillian Murphy) to Farrier (Tom Hardy) to Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) and also Alex (Harry Styles) impressed me with their acting. Finally coming to the score, as always Hanz Zimmer knocks it out of the park with yet another moving and suspense filled music that instrumental from the start of Dunkirk. The Ticking Clock sound makes this movie an edge of the seat thriller. Can't say enough about the score it is amazing. Thus Nolan redefines this Genre as well of which we will see in the upcoming movies with this Genre. Dunkirk is brilliant might be Nolan's best after The Dark Knight. A Masterpiece in any reality."
"skywalkerhy","10","1","10","6 September 2017"," It maybe not the greatest movie but do describe a great moment of the mankind history
","A famous history was represented with 3 scenes: one week, one day, one hour, 3 scenes consist to a tiny part of the great evacuation. It maybe not the greatest movie but do describe a great moment of the mankind history. Music is also fascinated, serious and stick to the topic, war, it's sound not interesting and it is very loud."
"LCShackley","8","1","10","27 August 2017"," Not your typical war film
","Dunkirk is not a typical ""war movie"" that revolves around a set of stock characters. It's an attempt to tell a very involved historical narrative by creating a few plot ""threads"" that represent the various aspects of the event (the pilots, the soldiers on the beach, the commanders, the civilians). It was helpful to me to have just finished reading Walter Lord's book on the subject. I think a lot of viewers are left stranded because they have virtually no context for what they are seeing, except for a few brief sentences on the screen at the beginning. There are some fine actors (Branagh, D'arcy etc.) who aren't given much to do. Director Nolan once again hides Tom Hardy's face for almost an entire movie (he was Bane in the Batman trilogy), and there isn't much traditional dialogue. The only ""fleshed out"" thread is about the civilian boat owner (Mark Rylance), his two young helpers, and the slightly mad soldier they fish out of the water (Cillian Murphy, alias ""Scarecrow""). That story really helps hold the movie together, and brings out the most emotional response. The movie as a whole is an incredible visceral experience, almost an assault on the senses, between the overwhelmingly noisy soundtrack and the acrobatic shaky-cam visuals. The occasional still shot brought incredible relief after bouncing up and down inside a hull or chasing a Heinkel through the air. Even though the story is not sequential, or complete in terms of the Dunkirk operation, Nolan provides enough ""you are there"" bits and pieces to tell the story from the evacuation beach back to England. The last shot was a little odd: all sound ceases, and we see the face of one of the soldiers on a train for just a couple of seconds, with the sound of him crinkling his newspaper. Hans Zimmer's almost non-stop score was a barrage of scratching strings, moaning brass, and interminable drones and long, half-step descents. It was the audio equivalent of a root canal, and made Penderecki's ""Threnody"" seem like one of the snoozier tracks from a Mantovani LP. When he finally gave us an actual tune (one of Elgar's best), it was such a relief that it triggered a gut-level emotional response. The cinematography was top-notch, and as always, Nolan has an eye for unforgettable visuals. So by all means see it, but you would be well served by doing some historical homework first."
"themanlarry","10","1","10","17 August 2017"," From possibly the greatest director working today, his greatest masterpiece to date
","I've never written a review here previously, but an earlier review has compelled me to write. <br/><br/>To say this film Is devoid of characters is a true misunderstanding of the intent of the film. Nolan has made a movie that had no other intention than to tell a story. There are no developed characters because this isn't a story of one hero, it's a story of 400,000 men defeated and abandoned by their homeland, devoid of hope.<br/><br/>Would Tom Cruise, running slow motion into battle after a short on screen love affair with a British nurse improve this film? <br/><br/>This is the war film that now sets the bar for all to come in the future. If Nolan doesn't win an Oscar for this he never will<br/><br/>By some way the best film of 2017"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","10","14 August 2017"," Seems contradictory, but Nolan's war film is a restrained epic
","Imagine interviewing three different soldiers who all survived the same battle but experienced it from different vantage points, and asking them to tell their story. That's the narrative feel to Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk,"" a technical marvel of a war film with one simple aspiration: capture the feeling of helplessness in one of World War II's most dismal moments and depict within it small stories of bravery and survival.<br/><br/>No one doubted Nolan's ability to make a beautiful, gripping sensory experience of a war film given the visual achievements of ""Inception,"" ""Interstellar"" and ""The Dark Knight Trilogy,"" especially given Nolan's commitment to practical effects and serious stuntwork. What's surprising is his script, which unlike the aforementioned titles, has been nearly stripped of exposition and does not involve an intricate and complicated web of story lines steeped in science fiction, ready to be picked into pieces by skeptics. It's the complete opposite.<br/><br/>Sure, ""Dunkirk"" does weave in essence three major stories together (and he does play with their chronological order a bit just because he can't help himself), but the film has no insane twists or mysteries to be cracked. What we see is what we get: a young man (Fionn Whitehead) tries desperately to get off the beach and rescued; a mariner (Mark Rylance) takes his personal boat across the channel to heed the rescue call at Dunkirk with his son and another local boy; and a squadron of pilots (one played by Tom Hardy) trying to take down German planes before they can bomb more boats and soldiers.<br/><br/>These story lines are part of a constantly rotating carousel and they eventually converge to create a complete and rather stirring picture of this battle/rescue mission. That convergence doesn't have the emotional resonance of a film that dedicates itself to telling one story in a traditional manner, but considering how tedious the rotation of stories gets, the payoff is almost unexpectedly pleasant. Despite never intimately acquainting us with his characters, Nolan manages to tell their stories with enough human acuity that we're compelled to root for their survival.<br/><br/>That's no simple feat, and it's part of what makes ""Dunkirk"" both a great film and a supremely disappointing one. What he manages to accomplish given the non-traditional structure of his film should count for something, though many audiences will surely wish he swept them up in a classic Hollywood war plot echoing themes of human courage and perseverance in a raw, moving way. Instead, he espouses those themes with a quiet, grim dignity that likely honors the survivors of Dunkirk in its own way, one that doesn't entirely glorify them but speaks to their truth.<br/><br/>Like Nolan's previous films, ""Dunkirk"" is big and loud, but artistically speaking. Dialogue gets lost (somehow Tom Hardy delivers lines into an oxygen mask, again) and the gunshots are disturbingly loud and anxiety-provoking. But in the context of a war film that's not reliant on dialogue to be understood (there isn't much talking period), there's value in Nolan's approach. He thrusts us into the scene with this intense sensory experience to the point that not empathizing with the characters to at least some extent is nearly impossible.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" can't claim to be the most emotional or powerful war story ever told, but it can claim to be unique in a genre that has no shortage of clichés and retreaded themes and storytelling devices. Nolan has created a big war movie, but a restrained one. Crafting a movie with gunshots that sound like they're happening inside your head doesn't usually classify as restrained, but his approach to depicting the events at Dunkirk in 1940 has a degree of frankness and perhaps even modesty from a human standpoint. It's not an easy film to celebrate, but it's beyond easy to admire and respect. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
"davidlikesmovies","8","1","10","11 August 2017"," A gripping and emotional viewing experience! 5 STARS!
","From the first frame projected on-screen, I was there! I was experiencing the everyday struggle of these men, trying to survive long enough on a God-forsaken beach to just get home! Hour by hour and minute by minute, one didn't know when to expect the next air strike, or when the next boat would arrive with even the slightest chance of succeeding in its dangerous mission! <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg succeeded in placing us all on Omaha Beach with the American troops on the morning of June 6th 1944, during the brutal and traumatic opening of his Historical Epic 'Saving Private Ryan'(1998). Now in 2017, Christopher Nolan has gone a step further I believe, in changing the movie experience as we know it. With his extremely intense, real and moving motion picture 'Dunkirk', we as the audience are given the best of both worlds. We are still given the safety net of having characters in the film through whom we witness the events unfold, while at the same time truly feeling that we are seeing this horror in action, directly through the eyes of the protagonists! This became so from stunning direction, camera work, sound design and cinematography, creating the next best thing to virtual reality! The clock is always ticking and we are kept on the edge of our seats throughout the two-hour duration!<br/><br/>I have read many reviews and heard many critiques of this film, all sharing the opinion that it suffers from a lack of character and depth in its main protagonists. I understand this viewpoint and see where those of this opinion are coming from. But I wholeheartedly disagree in this particular case! I believe this is one such aspect of 'Dunkirk' that separates it from other war films and in turn, helps it succeed in creating the unique experience envisioned by its brilliant director! Believe me when I say that in most cases, I would lean towards the other side of this argument for most films I see! Well written characters, with brilliant actors to portray them are what I love most about movies and television series!(Hence why 'Breaking Bad' is my all-time favorite series!) But what this film might lack in its exploration of its main characters, it more than compensates with its character! <br/><br/>By giving the brilliant actors limited dialogue and less focused time on their social interactions, we are left to observe what is mostly their physical interactions with each-other and their environment. We as an audience get to watch the character of Dunkirk as an intense environment, with its harsh changing weather patterns and its threatening and vast bareness, open for enemy airstrikes! This gives everything that happens, and everything the characters do in the film, more of an urgency and a realism, as the dreaded clock relentlessly ticks with impending doom! There's no time for us to sit on the beach around a campfire with the characters, to hear clichéd war movie lines about their lovers waiting for them to come home!(THANK GOD! CRINGE!) Unlike the recent Mel Gibson film 'Hacksaw Ridge', which managed to re-use almost every clichéd army film line and trick in the book! 'Dunkirk' has brilliant performances given by talented actors without being a necessarily 'protagonist driven' narrative! It throws the 'How to make a war film' book away and that's what makes it brilliant and unique!<br/><br/>I have nothing but praise for the sound design of this film! If this wasn't produced well, the film wouldn't have had half the intensity it does! Hanz Zimmer did a great job along with all others involved, but I will be careful here! Most people have said ""Hans Zimmer's SCORE is genius!"" People tend to generalize when talking about film soundtracks either because they don't really know what they're talking about or they claim to know better! Being a musician myself makes this point very irritating! I think it more correct to say ""Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is brilliant!"", not his score! Soundtrack can refer to score also of course, but I like to separate these things for obvious reasons! Score refers to music! A musical score! Sheet music! No doubt there probably is an actual physical score for this film, but I can tell you now that it won't have much written on it that is very musical or musically complicated in any way! <br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Dunkirk' is an intense, gripping and emotional film that will make any viewer ponder a thought about what sacrifice is, or the value of life or the value of home for that matter! It's a film that is more than just entertainment. It felt so authentic that it doesn't even feel right to call it entertainment. 'Dunkirk' is based on a real event that took place during WW2, and so Christopher Nolan made the film an event! For this reason, it is probably not very re-watchable in some ways. It is unlike any of Nolan's previous films because Nolan wanted it to be so! Nolan creates films but he does it with a greater intention. He does it to create not just a film, but an experience! He is a man who has a love for traditional film-making while also wanting to progress it! He loves practical effects and the use of actual film and not digital. He wants to keep people coming to cinemas and to do that, he knows he has to make it worth our while. Therefore, he tries to create a film-viewing experience like no other for audiences! We need more visionary directors like him and less CGI mad directors! We need more unique films like this and less Marvel! Christopher Nolan is a masterful storyteller and I look forward to more of his work. """

","I feel very sad for the one's who say Dunkirk a boring movie that lacks depth( lacks depth?!?! really?!?! put the goggles on). Comprehending a Nolan movie is tough, I know. But calling it a hype and accusing Nolan fans, for their own inability to understand a brilliant movie, is just pathetic. Back to subject, Dunkirk is deep, rich and beautiful. And intense too. If academy awards ignores this one, then there is something wrong with them. This movie depicts an epic evacuation as you have never seen before and probably will never see in future. Yeah its a war movie, but no its not like the ones you have seen till now.  A war movie which portrays no enemy, no heroes and hell yeah no blood. Music by Zimmer is so engaging. Cinematography is a notch up in this movie compared to Nolan's previous ventures( Yeah, perfect - I should say). This movie is the one that you shouldn't miss. And please try to get an IMAX screen for the perfect execution. Finally for the shallow people who are cheering for only Harry Styles( 90% of them females ) - ""Go, Get a life people"". You are a disgrace to the equally deserving crews of Dunkirk."
"SAMTHEBESTEST","8","1","10","23 July 2017"," The Mole, The Sea, The Air... The Nolan's Classic. Best Film Of The Year so far.
","DUNKIRK REVIEW : I don't care which genre film it is, i don't care who's the leading actor in it, i don't care about the banner, but if it is Directed by Christopher Nolan then i will watch it in theater at any cost. Memento says Nolan is Great Director, Inception says he's the Master, The Dark Knight says he's the Best, Interstellar says he's not from this planet and now after Dunkirk i'm sure Nolan is not from our Milky galaxy. No Superheroes, No Fictional Explosion, No Action, No long Speeches, you don't even see a single enemy, only Class and strict story telling without any loo breaks, OMG... Only Nolan can do it. You have keep patients to watch Dunkirk because you won't see much entertainment factors, you have to keep your mind steady and wait till film ends and at the end all your efforts worths it.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a simple story of Soldiers evacuation but Nolan has told this ordinary story in extraordinary way. He has made the film as a triptych, told from three perspectives – the land, sea, and air. And he's succeeded like a boss. Hans Zimmer's Background score is something which keeps you hooked from the first to last frame. Sound designing is something which should grab a bunch of awards next year. Cinematography is Top Class, without 3D effects this film is a visual treat and the reason is Hoyte van Hoytema shot the film on IMAX 65mm and 65mm large format film stock. Editing is tight and much better than Nolan's last film because run time is less than 2 hours so film doesn't lose the grip for a single moment, while Interstellar was a longer affair and there's hardly any moment where you can divert your attention. Film is Technically superior hence, better than all previous war films but explosion and repeat value wise, a slight let down.<br/><br/>Overall, Dunkirk is another Classic from Master Nolan and is a Must Watch for every Nolan and Classy Cinema Fan. I kept expectations sky high and film completed all but hasn't surpassed so i won't call it a Masterpiece. This isn't Nolan's Best Film till Date, i found Interstellar much Classy, but Dunkirk is in top 5 of Nolan's. Without thinking much and wasting time, i request you Be a Smart Cinema lover and watch this film in Theater only. Do not even think of watching it on TV because Dunkirk is just not a film, it's ""An Experience"" which has to be experienced in Theater, go for IMAX screen if possible. I strongly recommend this film, and i guarantee your ticket money will worth it. 8/10* stars by me and Salute to Nolan for giving us another Classy piece of cinema, i feel blessed that i'm born in an era where i can watch Nolan's Classics in Theater, keep giving us that, love you."

","Trigger me timbers, sure this movie looked nice, especially the water and those boats but where was the character development?<br/><br/>Somebody needs to tell Mr Nolan that just because the movie was set in an active war zone, this is not an excuse for poor character development. The actors should've spent most of the movie in their safe space and talked about their families/life. This would make it far more compelling when they were shot, drowned or burned alive.<br/><br/>Also where were all the women and ethnic minorities in this film? <br/><br/>They should have replaced that one guy with a female protagonist (like in the Ghostbusters remake) and then that singer guy with an African American guy (like in the Star Wars remake.)

"pranavmaharishi","10","1","11","13 August 2017"," A glimpse into the mind of a modern story-teller !
","There are two kinds of story telling 1. Through words either in written or spoken form and then 2. Through movies. <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan does probably one of the best jobs of telling a story through movies. In movies you have an added advantage of directing the audiences imagination not only through words unlike the first way but also through sounds, dialogues, music and visuals. And Nolan does the best job of utilizing these to engage the audience in the story rather than placing deliberate mindless plot twists ( which seriously have become so repetitive that the audience started predicting the twists in most of the movies nowadays ).<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is Nolan takes a single point in history and stretches it into three separate time-lines weaves them flawlessly into a two hour movie. Natural visuals supplemented by Hans Zimmer's most tense background score ever, adds up to a very engaging experience till the last scene. One can see the honesty in the camera angles and less dialogue that leads to more profound emotions than with more dialogue. The experiment of this movie was instead of choosing a protagonist for this movie, Nolan made entire army his protagonist. Movie as a whole felt like the climax of a much longer movie which would generally have much depth in characters. <br/><br/>Some experiments fail and then some succeed, but just like all of Nolan's earlier experiments this one has crossed the mark ! Proving that he is indeed the modern storyteller for the millennials."

","Christopher Nolan's past work easily reflects on the MASTERPIECE he has displayed.Intriguingly, he has taken a HUGE risk by using new 'reinforcements' but backed it up with the importance of Tom Hardy (Farrier), Mark Rylance (Mr.Dawson). Nevertheless, the young blood of the industry has performed extremely well. Moreover,(brace yourselves 'OneDirection'fans) Harry Styles was just fun to watch. Strong. Technically, the cinematography is just exhilarating. I like it how Nolan uses 3 timelines: The Mole; The Sea; The Air.... The Mole: It represents the struggle and survival of the SOLDIERS on the beach. The Sea: The rescue, the British army orders many local people (people who own boasts)to rescue the soldiers. The Air: AGAIN, rescue & prevention.Preventing the German bombings and maybe even rescue.This unique idea of the 3 timelines previews everyone's perspective. Overall, it's definitely a roller-coaster ride. But, personally, for me, the plot becomes incorrect when it is about the conclusion of 'THE AIR'. SPOILER...SPOILER.....SPOILER....SPOILER... Tom Hardy takes the wrong decision and eventually ends up with the Germans and possibly taken into a war prison. One of my relative, who is a pilot says:"" He(Tom Hardy) didn't use the 'abc's' of being a basic pilot. Anyway, that was the only NEGATIVE. I rank it the best war movie behind 'Saving Private Ryan' Christopher Nolan and his crew: TAKE A BOW!"

","It might have been a colossal military disaster, but in relation to the movie, things change drastically for the better.<br/><br/>All the immersion that the film provides, it makes all the difference for the spectator and, for the first time in my life history going to cinema, I can say that it was the best experience I have ever had, that's for sure.<br/><br/>First things first, it is impossible not to highlight the audio production. I usually play Battlefield (the games), and I keep in mind that it's one of the best ""audio mixes"" in existence and today, the best comes from Dunkirk. Even more so in a session where 7.1 audio is legit, you can be sure that the feeling of being in a war scene can become very real.<br/><br/>And that's all the magic of the movie.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of reviews that say it's a bit lacking in character development, etc., but that's a war movie and not a tale about someone's life and their everyday situations. I've never seen a WAR have personal development of a soldier - do not misunderstand me, please, I speak in a matter of battlefield. It is possible that some soldier or another may do the difference but there, it is practically ""each one by itself"". This is what the film shows us, a scenario of war, bringing the closest possible sensation of reality.<br/><br/>And that, the film provides with excellence.<br/><br/>I think I can say that for anyone who likes Nolan movies, or even does not like it at all, this is his best movie.<br/><br/>And I say more!<br/><br/>He has overcome many marketing films that sell a whole 3D immersion and blablabla, that are all under the feet in this situation.<br/><br/>Its a masterpiece!<br/><br/>And you can still find it in the next cinema Or in a BluRay version"

Christopher Nolan made a movie so good it could give Saving Private Ryan a run for it's money.<br/><br/>This film immediately opens with silence while a squad of soldiers walk through a town, BAM! 30 seconds into the movie most of them are dead except for our first main character who escapes. This unnamed soldier is trying to escape the Dunkirk and get back to England with everyone else. He then meets another soldier who is suspiciously silent throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Next we meet some RAF pilots in spitfires trying to take down German bombers. Not much to say about these guys except that they look awesome up in the air Then the next group of characters we meet are George and peter, Along with their father, Mr Dawson. They are there to rescue any stragglers found in the water. Along the way they rescue a soldier who is suffering from shell shock (Basically PTSD on steroids).<br/><br/>That's all I can say without spoiling anything else. The only criticism I have is that this movie will destroy your ears. In the first 30 seconds when the gunfire came out of no-where, about 50% of people in the theatre dropped their pop-corn.

I knew that this film was directed by Christopher Nolan, who directed films such as ""Memento"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"" and many others. So ""Dunkirk"" had to be something that I need to see.<br/><br/>WHAT IS THIS MOVIE ABOUT?<br/><br/>Dunkirk movie is telling a story about World War 2 battle of Dunkirk in 1940. UK and France solders was trapped by Germany army. This film is telling a story about soldiers who want to escape from these traps. I do not heard about this battle before, so I felt tension till the end.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the sound in the cinema. It maked me to feel that I was somewhere near the battle.

"Will_Harrison","10","1","12","23 July 2017"," Dunkirk is a masterpiece through and through with every single shot meticulously designed to amaze
","Most war movies are about a group of characters dealing with a terrible and frightening situation, but Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is about one thing and one thing only, War. Dunkirk does not focus on having memorable characters with large story arcs but instead focuses on the event of Dunkirk itself and the real and truly horrifying experiences the many men and women faced on that day. Nolan gives audiences a gripping and intense epic with beautiful camera work shot completely with good ol' film and thankfully a complete lack of CGI and overdone blood splatter. With its impressively large and realistic cast, use of real vehicles and stunts, great complex narrative, and possibly one of the best scores from legend Hans Zimmer, Dunkirk is a shinning example of why we love film."
"851222","10","1","12","21 July 2017"," Amazingly Crafted War Thriller
","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>First of all - ""Dunkirk"" (2017) is not the best war film ever made in my opinion. By far. I don't think that there ever will be a better war movies then ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) or even ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), ""Platoon"" (1986) or ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998). It is not even the best Christopher Nolan movie at the moment (the crown goes to ""Interstellar (2014)). That said, ""Dunkirk"" IS something absolutely unique, stunning, kinda mesmerizing movie going experience. It is not perfect, sometimes even a bit confusing (because of the time lines, but its not ""overdone"") movie, but the one which HAS to be seen in a movie theater.<br/><br/>The best thing about ""Dunkirk"" is the craftsmanship and the biggest star of ""Dunkirk"" is without a doubt Christopher Nolan THE director. The script in here is not a great one, and like i said i was a bit confused at some moments, but the story here is so powerful itself that it tells everything. Music is simply astonishing. Hans Zimmer (again) does something absolutely unique with Nolan movie - it transcendence the whole experience. Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is a masterpiece. Sound design and sound mixing are so good, so sharp that it adds more to this movie then just a sound - it makes you kinda grab your seat. So here are the 4 Oscar nominations here for sure - best director, music, cinematography (probably a winner) and sounds (sure winners). Acting was good given the roles, but nothing very memorable except for a great Mark Rylance and Fionn Whitehead which i really liked in this role. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Dunkirk"" is not a bloody or gore war movie. Its ""horror"" is terror. The situation and how it is presented in this movie made me think couple of times about the war that this is a true terror. This is not an ""easy"" movie going experience because you have to pay attention during a whole movie and it doesn't have sharp characters to which you can relate - its about a situation at the moment - right here right now. There are ""time line"" sections / intersections that makes you think about what you are seeing. And it is done so unique, so ambitious that i probably haven't witnessed this kinda movie before. its not a mainstream ""war movie"", basically its a thriller set in a WW2. But its crafted so uniquely that it can not be missed. A sure classic, if not for everyone."

"Dragava","7","1","14","19 July 2017"," He's Coming Back Round...
","Will Nolan ever let up? There was a time when the man was shooting on weekends with friends to produce something on a shoe-string budget to an unknown audience. His audience is now known as one of the widest, well-entertained yet not empty-headed and far from emotionally absent folk. And Dunkirk will meet all their expectations I'm sure. <br/><br/>From the get-go we are presented with a three-sided structure to Nolan's war story - land, sea, air. Men on the beaches dive into the sand for cover whenever an enemy spitfire is heard overheard. We hear it just as clearly. The sound in this film is overwhelmingly phenomenal. Surely the best of the year. It doesn't let up when we cut to the air battle, swirling and tumbling planes guiding us through the open skies - all perfectly shot. Zimmer's score simply adds to the flavour, soaring as spectacularly as the spitfires themselves. <br/><br/>In short, go see the film, you won't be disappointed. I saw it on a pretty big screen and you should do the same. It's a spectacle that must be experienced. I saw Baby Driver last week and this far surpasses that. Brilliantly edited, shot, and over it all, directed. If Chris Nolan doesn't at last get the nomination he's deserved for years at the Oscars it will be yet another criminal injustice committed by those fools."

"philgowers001","9","1","18","7 January 2018"," An event-driven cinematic experience
","There are so many User Reviews here on iMDb for Dunkirk, but after reading about 50 of them after watching the movie, I felt the need to offer some advice.
The ""User"" in the User Reviews is most likely someone who has been brought up watching the MCU movies over and over again. They have an expectation that each movie will run to a formula - character arcs, set action pieces and an ending that promises a bigger and badder sequel. Dunkirk doesn't fit that bill, so the ""Users"" will mark it accordingly.<br/><br/>I also choose not to compare Dunkirk with other WW2 films of note, especialy the US-made films that seem to think Europe was saved by a bunch of kids from Nebraska, who would never get along back home, but here under enemy-fire they find true friendship and respect... Sounds familiar, right?<br/><br/>Dunkirk is Christopher Nolan's view of a single event, so significant in the United Kingdom's military history, that to get bogged down in character development and stories from back home would just add unnecessary minutes to this great film. If the ""Users"" need more understanding of why a character did what he/she did, then they haven't been paying attention and need to open their minds a little more.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is beautifully shot, with another amazing score by Hans Zimmer and is unrelenting in it's tension and constantly threatening atmospherics. Maybe not for the kids or teens or anyone who watches movies with their phone in one hand and a coke in the other."

","In my opinion, one of Christopher Nolan's biggest weakneses has always been his characters.
Dunkirk ""fixes"" this problem by almost completely eliminating the concept of characters.<br/><br/>On the one hand, it lets Nolan focus on what he's best at: the technicals.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunning, the editing and direction are pretty good (althought the constantly changing aspect ratio is very distracting).
And the music is, once again, Hans Zimmer pressing his whole arm on the keyboard.<br/><br/>On the other hand, not having any real character makes many scenes feel like they drag for way too long and makes for a very dull experience.<br/><br/>If we knew something about any of these people maybe it would have been different.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not a terrible movie, but a very unmemorable one.
Like most Nolan movies, it's technically impressive.<br/><br/>The lack of characterization makes it more bearable for me than something like Interstellar,
but it does negatively impact what could have been a very compelling drama, instead of just a series of well shot battle sequences."

","In the beginning of the movie, I thought this will be another movie showing how war is bad and how soldiers suffer. That would be ok with Christopher Nolan directing the movie. But No!
The director himself, being an English and feels like an American, he just wanted to make another World War II movie where UK never gives up and US will come and save you!!!
Stupid! WWII is much more a unique and complicated war than this!
Not long ago, before WWII, British were attacking and colonising everywhere they could. To be honest, WWII gives those colonised countries a chance to be independent from UK. Can our director make a movie about this? I don't think so!<br/><br/>And also, I think Christopher Nolan thought that in order to be in the 'best directors list' he had to make a movie about war. In that sense the movie is also poor. Even the stupid 'Saving Private Ryan' has better action-war scenes.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan, in his most movies, he just playes with time lapse. He is very succesfull in this. Instead of showing things in chronological order, he mixed up the scenes and that is mostly his success. If he would direct this Dunkirk movie in chronological order, it will be much more boring."

"stempaz","10","0","1","1 March 2020"," What the hell was Harry Styles doing there?
","I must admit that war movies are never my go to but each time I watch one I always think afterwards ""what a fantastic movie"" and this one was no different.<br/><br/>It's what I'd expect from director Christopher Nolan, he never lets you down. He's directed ten films I think including great films like The Prestige' and 'Inception' and the Christian Bale Batman trilogy which are arguably the best comic book movies ever made.<br/><br/>I think war films are a lot more common these days because as time goes by technology becomes more advanced. What I mean is I think Demi is left wing but also with updated special effects and visuals these films are able to get the realism of war dead on. The British soldiers were basically sitting ducks, completely helpless against the air strikes but that's where Tom Hardy came in eventually. He was an absolute hero flying that plane and he deserved better than being captured in the end.<br/><br/>My favourite scenes in the movie are when the soldiers are cheering when the rescue boats arrived. War movies are sad, tragic, violent and full of death so it makes moments like this worth while. I also loved the scene at the end when the train stops and they all get a heroes welcome at the station. When Tommy is reading Churchill's speech in the paper it gave me chills just like when I heard it from Churchill (Gary Oldman) himself in the movie 'Darkest Hour.'<br/><br/>I thought the cast was brilliant, the likes of Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy regularly appear in Nolan's movies and why not? They are two of the finest actors of this generation.<br/><br/>I think even though every war movie is very different the message is still the same. No matter how ugly war is, there is one thing that gets soldiers through it in the end and that is the human spirit. There will always be war movies because there will always be great stories to tell. Stories of courage, heroism and survival."

","First Hit: Although many of the camera angles and shots were engaging, the flaws in the storyline kept me out of entirely falling into this movie.<br/><br/>I do my best to ignore hoopla, reviews, and articles about films before seeing them. It causes and creates preconceived ideas that are rarely met along with providing filters that have to be ignored.<br/><br/>Such was the case with this movie. So much noise about how great this film is.<br/><br/>Granted the effect given by the one camera one-shot concept was good, however, it wasn't shot with one camera and it wasn't one long shot and therefore I found myself guessing what was included in the one-shot and moments when they edited to make it look like one shot one camera.<br/><br/>If I'm watching a movie and my mind is dancing with these questions, it just means I'm not fully ensconced in the story and presentation and that isn't good.<br/><br/>Besides the camera stuff, the other aspects that didn't work for me were: A scene when Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) he gets shot at from the German sniper soldier in a building after he crossed a destroyed bridge. Why did they simultaneously shoot each other and Schofield fall back downstairs, as if he were hit, and end up with no injuries? The German, as we expected, was hit and died. Then, how did Schofield not get hit as he was chased through the burning buildings being chased by multiple German soldiers shooting at him? How did the wounds he did received appear and disappear, yet the bandage on his right hand from a barbed wire wound early in the story consistently appear in later shots? How did Schofield and Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) not hear any of the trucks or men marching near the farmhouse where the plane crashed. One moment, the stillness and quiet of the farm is interrupted by a plane crash. Then Blake fights with the surviving German pilot, then within minutes, a whole battery of trucks and men are swarming on the same farm. Noise from the vehicles made in 1917 and the men of the advancing regiment, would have been heard long before the plane crash and certainly after it. However, here they are not, they just appear like ants scurrying around the farm.<br/><br/>When there are this many questions running through my mind as I watch the scenes unfold, It's hard for me to be a fully engaged fan of the film.<br/><br/>The movie's story about two men, Schofield and Blake, being ordered to locate and warn an English regiment that is pursuing the German Army that the Germans have set this pursuit up as a trap to destroy the following regiment. Specifically, Blake was given this assignment because General Erinmore (Colin Firth) has learned Blake's brother is a lieutenant in the pursuing regiment. To me, this was a questionable motivational strategy by the General. Blake was asked to select another soldier to be his companion and he chose Schofield because they were close friends. However, the overall goal and motivation to save some 1,600 men was not in question.<br/><br/>The difficulties that Schofield and Blake endured as they cross the previous battle lines were, for the most part, engaging. However, none of the scenes were pointedly unique when compared to scenes in other films, like Peter Jackson's ""They Shall Not Grow Old,"" or Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan,"" or Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk."" In fact, the section where they pass through the destroyed German Artillery appeared too staged, with each piece being perfectly placed.<br/><br/>MacKay was excellent as Blake's reluctant partner. As we know he would, he showed up with strength and compassion when needed. Chapman was perfect as Blake who was going to save his brother's regiment no matter what happened. His scene after being stabbed by the German pilot he saved, was excellent. Sam Mendes and Kristy Wilson-Cairns wrote this interesting screenplay. Mendes did a terrific job of giving the feel of a single camera single-tracked view of this story.<br/><br/>Overall: Thought that I've seen better films are telling this sort of story."

Then I started counting the actors who all resemble a famous international actor and recognised that they are all family members. At the end was I the low cost amateur watcher trying to copy Hollywood greatness as a consumer. Don't listen to negative reviews of this movie. Alone on an intelligence level and the actor placement is this a must see movie. Which obviously, a view viewers did not get, considering their negative review. Then back to the movie itself. The scenes are nearly all of an immense emotional, dramatic and moral aspect that will stay in mind, they are as thrilling as well as realistic possible in case someone would end in a similar war or conflict position as a soldier. I would nearly say that I had once or twice the feeling that the movie sends an anti war message above everything else, which depends on someones attitude related to war. I personally see war as sometimes necessary to sustain our values and virtues, not to mention for the protection of our freedom. I think that the anti war message was just my emotional reaction due to the perception and how I might feel if I would have been in the position of one of the soldiers.

However, taking into account the relatively limited setting he had two work with (one beach in France during a hasty evacuation), Christopher Nolan has done a remarkable job."

","This film has no human emotion or depth in characters, and the screenplay is non existent!<br/><br/>However my feelings toward the film are generally favourable. Christopher Nolan had to make a film based on a historical event with no novel or story to adapt from, and rather than risk writing a bad story with a poor script, he gave us a masterclass in what he does best.<br/><br/>Private Ryan and Band of brothers, as examples in this genre, are still in a league of their own and it will take a lot to match them. This film unfortunately doesn't achieve it.<br/><br/>If special effects and cinematography are your thing, look no further"
"coneill97","8","0","3","30 October 2019"," A Fresh and Inventive World War II Film
","What director, Christopher Nolan, manages to do with Dunkirk is make a straightforward war movie feel fresh and original, by creating an unusual narrative structure. The film tells three intersecting stories. The stories are told from land, sea and air, taking place over a week, a day and an hour, respectively. This storytelling technique may seem unnecessarily complicated on paper, yet it works tremendously well on the screen.<br/><br/>The film does an incredible job of creating a realistic depiction of war, without the use of any blood or gore. This is done not only with the fantastic practical effects but also by the young actors in the film, who feel like they could be 18 or 19 years old, as opposed to 30-year-old actors who typically play teenagers in war movies. There is almost no backstories or character development for these soldiers, as one would expect from a film of this calibre. Instead, we are in the moment with these young men and do not have time to stop and talk about their lives before the war.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer produces a masterful score once again. Like with his previous collaboration with Nolan for Interstellar, Zimmer incorporates a ticking clock into the music which builds tension and intensifies the action. It is, without a doubt, one of his finest scores.<br/><br/>The movie is very much a visual experience. There are no backstories for the characters and very little dialogue throughout the runtime. It is over 30 minutes before the film's ""lead"", Fionn Whitehead has his first line. The story is told primarily through images, which makes it feel refreshing.<br/><br/>The practical effects are phenomenal throughout the movie, whether it's the fantastic aerial battle or the action scenes that take place in the middle of the ocean. At no point do you question if any of the effects are CGI or if they were shot on a soundstage. The aerial battles, in particular, are jaw-dropping. Nolan, along with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema film these sequences with IMAX cameras, which only increase the scale and make the action even more epic than it already is.<br/><br/>The editing of this movie is outstanding. The way in which it intercuts between the different stories, supported by Zimmer's music, is simply breath-taking.<br/><br/>The movie also borders on horror at some points, due to the intensity of the action. One scene in particular, where a German bomber is approaching the beach with thousands of soldiers running for their lives, is truly terrifying.<br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect, however. While the lack of backstory and
characterisation works, for the most part, you don't have the same emotional involvement as you would in other great war movies, such as Saving Private Ryan, for example. And although this film has minimal dialogue and exposition, one scene involving Kenneth Branagh explaining the situation felt a little forced. Finally, while the sequences shot in IMAX are stunning, the changing aspect ratios can be a little distracting at times.<br/><br/>Overall, however, this movie is an amazing cinematic experience, unlike anything I've seen in the cinema before. From a technical point of view, this film is a masterpiece. It deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible."
"postsenthil","10","0","2","27 October 2019"," A TOUR DE FORCE ! A MUST WATCH (in IMAX) !!
","Ace auteur Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is based on a daring rescue of allied soldiers from the French coast where they were pushed to the brink of annihilation/capture by German army which had surrounded them on the land, Luftwaffe fighter planes that rained bombs and fire from the skies and U-boats that torpedoed any approaching rescue vessels.<br/><br/>With as many as 400,000 soldiers stranded on the shores and hopes of their survival growing slim as every passing hour found the German army testing their weary resistance and every sortie of the Luftwaffe slaughtering these sitting duck soldiers by the dozens. Only a miracle could have saved those men.<br/><br/>Indeed, a miracle did happen and it was made in the way that best of miracles are made. It was made by ordinary men who performed extraordinary feats and dared to push the horizons of the faintly probable into the firm shores of the possible. In narrating this story, Nolan too weaves a miracle of sorts as he keeps us hooked to the suspense and thrill throughout its duration even when we are familiar with the history of this monumental evacuation of nearly 300,000 men which was one of the crucial turning points of the war.<br/><br/>A sense of foreboding permeates every frame like a fuse that is lit with the very first frame threatening to blow everyone to smithereens at any moment. Nolan brings his trademark twist to a genre by bravely desisting from the time tested template tropes of war movies such as creating backstories for characters which help the audience connect to them and root for them, bloody war sequences, tense discussions of a war-room, rousing speeches from leaders and villainous enemies.<br/><br/>Without resorting to any gruesome imagery or ever showing a single enemy soldier, he strikes terror with the perennial threat of deadly attacks and the attacks that strike at the most unexpected moment. Again, despite abstaining from any backstories to any of his characters, he forges a near universal connect between the faceless group of us - the audience - and the group of hapless, near strangers fighting together as soldiers for survival on that blighted beach. We root for their survival through a gruelling battle that spans land, water and air and witness those near nameless boys graduate in the tough school of war and become men.. That is.. If they don't end up as bodies.<br/><br/>Once again, we find Nolan showcasing his mastery in seamlessly weaving together multiple timelines - in a la Inception mode - where he sets these timelines to tick at different paces; a week on the shore; a day on the waters; and an hour in the skies, thereby elevating the sense of urgency.<br/><br/>A cast consisting of of largely unknown/lesser known actors with cameos by Tom Hardy (once again behind a mask for the most parts), Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance and Kenneth Brannagh deliver competent performances. Besides Nolan, the real stars of the movie are the excellent technical crew that he has marshalled. They are lead from the front by music director Hans Zimmer who pounds you with a ticking, thudding time-bomb of a score that at once sees you quivering on the shores, bouncing on the waters and soaring through the skies and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema who cans the stupendous aerial action sequences which make your eyes stretch wider than the IMAX widescreen. Editor Lee Smith comes out with flying colours, in what must have been one of the toughest jobs, as he brings together the multiple timelines into a smooth narrative.<br/><br/>Nolan has delivered another masterpiece that is like no other. Within a few moments, with a masterly sleight of hand, enlists each of us in the audience as a private and transports us to those treacherous shores of Dunkirk, desperate for survival for nearly two hours. And.. that is his successful inception.<br/><br/>A heady cocktail of a riveting suspense thriller, a superlative spectacle, an immersive and nerve racking experience of war as never before. If one looks beyond the gripping war drama and digs a little deeper, we might find some resonance with contemporary issues of Brexit and swelling waves of refugees as well."

The pathos in the Spitfire pilots actions at the end when he still shots down a Stuka without fuel and then heroically, almost mystically flying his last meters on the beach and the wrong depiction of military actions are big downsides of the movie. No Heinkel attacks at such low altitude, no Messerschmitt wastes time to shoot on a small boat and ships don't sink so fast. What strikes me most is the poor out-fit of a movie with a 100 mill. Dollar budget. Not much to see on the beach, not much effort to make the ships look as they did back then (except for the smaller ones) and then they was some stuff to see which is by any means modern, e.g. the trains waggons inside was modern style. When you make a movie playing in 1940, you should be more careful with that. So, for me it looks like sort of an concept movie."

","Putting aside possible (or not) historic accuracies, and I guess about up to 98% of the events depicted here are imaginary, this movie a simple poetic view of the one small (but nevertheless significant) part of the WWII. Nothing more, but also nothing less. Some musicians being 30-odd years in professional business also undertake practice, and so does Mr. Nolan. This is just it. He could have made another Saving private Ryan, but he didn't. He just explored movie making possibilities combining three simultaneous ""stories"" from three different points of view and, also keeping in shape. I like this movie. It's a bit unusual, personal, full of beautiful details and bits, emotional, poetic. No, not a spectacle. If you expect such a thing (with everybody shouting, shooting, running, explosions, screams and the works), forget it. However, if you're in for some delightful cinematic experience, you're welcome to watch and enjoy. Also, mind the soundtrack by Mr. Zimmer, who is not so inspired so often. And the length of the movie is just about right, maybe one shot too much (at the end), but that's a director's editing choice."
"darrenbjones","6","0","3","15 September 2019"," Not the incredible epic I was expecting but not terrible.
","The story of Dunkirk is one of hope against the odds, of the everyman triumphing where government and bureaucracy fails as fishermen, pleasure boats and anyone with a serviceable boat came to the rescue of the British army stranded at Dunkirk as the German army rolled in to wipe out all opposition at the start of the war. It's the story of an overconfident foe who held back on stream rolling across the exhausted and undersupplied troops giving the citizen flotilla time to rescue thousands of soldiers.
There were no individual heroes here, rather a mass of heroism and the film likewise doesn't focus on many individuals. Tom Hardy's spitfire pilot, Mark Rylance's Mr Dawson and a few others weave a narrative that circles back on itself at times as the same event is told from two or three perspectives. There are no rousing moments in a film made for such events and while a good piece of accurate storytelling, Dunkirk falls flat in creating an inspiring epic. I'm glad i've seen it but it doesn't match the hype and isn't likely to get many rewatches."
"questl-18592","7","0","2","12 September 2019"," Dunkirk
","For those that doubt the value of strong directors, I present: Dunkirk.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a war movie that is less about fighting and more about surviving. And after just watching it, that's about all the detail I've got.<br/><br/>Unlike a typical Nolan film, Dunkirk doesn't seem to have interwoven plots within plots. It's basically just a war movie with a different perspective and that's not a bad thing. The plot is straight forward and the characters... I couldn't list a single one of their names right now for the life of me. Which is a bit of a problem because I don't find myself overly connecting with any of them.<br/><br/>What it lacks in story though, it makes up for in the AV department. It looks wonderful, Nolan really has an eye for camerawork and framing that is hard to argue with. His decision to keep switching the aspect ratio up, adding and removing those 'widescreen' black bars, throughout the film was clearly purposeful but I found it distracting.<br/><br/>The sound. Oh my lord the sound. I can't think of any other movie I've seen where the sound has impacted me so. It's not even the score, it's the effects. When a fighter passes overhead, I felt it. When a rifle fired, I could swear I felt the recoil. I don't know how he did it, but it was remarkable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all the technical achievements don't completely make up for the 'meh' plot."

Besides the yellow-tipped fighters, The German army is never seen or heard. Nolan makes a concerted effort to only refer to the Nazis as ""the enemy"".

","The hands of a perfectionist, Christopher Nolan could only have pulled off an intense true story based movie. You know you have seen a gripping movie when your heartbeat skips again and again. Many might find this dragging but make no mistake, this is a glimpse of WW2 and what happened to the souls that were in Dunkirk. It's the most respectable movie of 2017, yet. I'll definitely watch it again.

""We had a screening for the veterans that I had spoken to, their families. Honestly, never felt quite such pressure in a professional setting as standing in front of that audience and about to, you know, show our version of what they'd actually lived through,"" Nolan said.<br/><br/>When 97-year-old war veteran Ken Sturdy attended the premiere of Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" it was as if he stepped inside of a time capsule. So captivated by the film's depiction and stunningly accurate cinematography, Sturdy found himself back in 1940 on that very same French beach where the battle took place. ""It didn't have a lot of dialogue. It didn't need any of the dialogue because it told the story visually and it was so real,"" the emotional war veteran told Canada's Global News.<br/><br/>Peace Out!"

","""Dunkirk"", directed by and written by Christopher Nolan, is unparalleled in its unrefined and inchoate presentation; and the impetus of each character - whether it is Fion Whitehead's ""Tommy"" or Hardy's ""Farrier"" - merely attributes the egregious nature of war, along with its seemingly impromptu and incontrovertible visage. The auteur himself, Nolan, has devised a film in an anarchic way as to generate the true story of Dunkirk and deserves Academy Award nominations in all of the categories probable: will he finally receive the Best Director award?<br/><br/>The 330,000 Allied soldiers, who languished on the beaches of Dunkirk, endeavoured to leave the beaches - and they're unremitting masquerade was the catalyst for their deliverance. The picture itself, irrefutably, alludes to the notion that the war was filled with unknown faces, who faced a nefarious crisis; and, the volatility of war, such as death, despondency or hope.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best films I have seen - if not, the best - and its realism and acute nature offers a rigorous outlook of the events that ensued during World War II.<br/><br/>Rating - 10/10"

"JonathanWalford","8","0","2","18 August 2019"," Yes, ANOTHER review of this movie...
","I am writing this review more for myself than for any readers, as I suspect it will get lost amidst the hundreds of existing critiques. It's a great film - I was mesmerized by the emotions this film created. The desire to live amidst the panic and claustrophobia and orderly queues. Nolan's emotional story was completely absorbing. I give the film a 10 for this.<br/><br/>However, the film has issues. Nolan likes to tell stories out of order, and while I enjoyed how the various parts of the finale came together, the back story about the solder who was found on top of a sinking ship was too confusing to figure out what happened. Another point of confusion was created around a plane that runs out of gas and yet manoeuvres around to shoot down a German bomber while gliding through the sky in opposite directions. Another problem is that the film is filled with uniformed pasty white English boys with brown hair -- they all look alike!<br/><br/>My final criticism is that the props department or the director seemed to forget that EVERYBODY smoked in 1940. World War II was at the apex of smoking. There was a noticeable lack of cigarettes being smoked by the soldiers on the beach, and back in England where hot drinks, jam and bread, and cold beers are being given out to 'the boys'. Cigarettes were also freely distributed - you don't want your soldiers having nic fits...<br/><br/>So I took was was essentially a 10 star film, and subtracted 2 points for unnecessary storyline confusion, and historical oversight."

"bowmanblue","7","0","1","12 August 2019"," Great style, less substance
","'Dunkirk' is a great film. And it's not. I really enjoyed a lot of it. And yet I can't see me ever watching it again. It's a two-hour account of one of the most famous 'retreats' in modern warfare (or, if I'm being cynical... a longer version of the opening credits to 'Dad's Army' - boom, boom!) where British and French troops were forced to fall back across the English channel after a failed attempt to recapture occupied France from German forces.<br/><br/>It's a 'Christopher Nolan film' and he is undoubtedly an amazing writer/director, meaning so much care and attention has been put into every last scene. He chooses a majority of 'practical effects' over computer-generated ones and it really does add to the 'realism' of it all. The overall look and feel of the film really is up there with 'Saving Private Ryan' in terms of how closely it resembles the actual events it portrays.<br/><br/>There were so many moments of real horror when thousands of young men are - literally - 'sitting ducks' for German forces to simply pick off at their leisure. You really do get a sense of how terrible it must have been for the soldiers when faced with such inevitable death.<br/><br/>So, if everything is so atmospheric, why do I feel a little let down by it all. Like I said, it's around two hours long and made up of three different stories, all relating to the conflict. One is about how the war was fought in the air (mainly through the eyes of Tom Hardy's Spitfire pilot), the second is about the boats crossing the English channel to rescue the stricken troops and the final is about Kenneth Branagh's General who is trying to get his men off the beach and onto some sort of safe transport back home.<br/><br/>Nothing wrong with having multiple stories, but - when it comes to characters - it seems like this film is trying to be more of a documentary/recreation, rather than a story with a cast of characters we can relate to. I know there have been other 'historical' films ('Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbour') that have tried to inject a (love!) story into the proceedings and got critisised for that. 'Dunkirk' is the exact opposite of those and you'd think it would be all the better for it. However, there just didn't seem to be any real 'star' of the film to really get behind.<br/><br/>Yes, One Direction singer Harry Styles is in it and actually does pretty well at acting. You could argue that Tom Hardy is the star, but seeing as he spends the film - technically - on his own in a one-man Spitfire, he doesn't get much in the way of other characters to play off. It's also worth noting that there are never any German characters to see. Here, they're just a 'faceless enemy' who we never see, other than the destruction their artillery causes.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a film that really captures the atmosphere of a very horrific battle in World War II then this ticks every box. However, if you're looking for a dramatic cast of characters it does fall a little short. Overall, it's memorable scenes will stay with me for a long time, so I certainly don't feel like I've wasted my times watching it."

","Once again Christopher Nolan delivers an enticing cinematic experience. The telling of three different stories at three different times of the day at the same time requires a delicate balancing act. Although unique in itself, the arc of the characters in each of the stories didn't necessarily stand out. However, even with the minimal backstory, you still feel you understand the characters motivations.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with Christopher Nolan's movies is they tend to get over-hyped. Once the audience see's 'a film by Christopher Nolan' during the previews, they instantly start salivating at what is coming next. This reaction is a testament to the Director's success and skill of directing movies - not taking anything away from him. But at times this tends to cloud people's judgement of the movie, causing them to not be as objective as they can be about the film itself. Again, not taking anything away from Nolan because I have thoroughly enjoyed his films.<br/><br/>This film is one more success of Nolan's, accurately telling a historical event of great significance that majority of the world was not totally aware of (at least the details). Always a fun treat experiencing Nolan's latest movie. You never quite know what to expect, but you are always sure you will enjoy it."

","Here's my review of Dunkirk. So , Nolan is back after 3 years and unlike his other movies , Dunkirk does not have plot twists or cliffhangers . It's a very simple plot about the evacuation of soldiers , but its the cinematography which makes the movie so good . Everything in this movie , feels very real , that you can actually relate to the people in the situation . I couldn't recognise much of the cast except for Cilian Murphy , Tom Hardy and the dude from one direction , but everyone did a great job. There isn't much dialogue in this movie and that's a good thing , because the visuals do the talking. It was a bit annoying when the soldiers referred to the Germans as ""the enemy"" , its not like Hitler is Voldermort or anything. And also , I didn't care when anyone died in the movie , as no character's past is revealed. Hans zimmer's score was really good , but not in the level of pirates or lion king. This movie is very fast phased unlike Nolan's previous movies and cuts to the chase , right when it starts. In the end , Dunkirk is an epic movie with great action , a great soundtrack , nail biting sequences , underdeveloped characters .... What else ? , its a Nolan movie , go watch it !!!"

Full of totally beautiful scenes and technical wonders, it is undoubtedly a film that represents an event in a realistic and intense way. The perspective of the film follows the chronology of the real events in the battle, however it takes the perspective of 3 different characters, a fighter aviator, a civilian sailor and a soldier. Each brings his or her view of the way the war unfolds around them, with solid and convincing performances, although here is one of its most detrimental points. The lack of characters and the development of these; Dunkirk is a film without characters in reality, concentrating rather on the events and the total population that witnessed the events, developing through the eyes of soldiers and civilians, despite the lack of memorable characters or interpresent dialogues, I believe without doubt that the film rewards this with an excellent cinematography.<br/><br/>I can understand the negative criticisms about this justifiable aspect of the film, however, I still believe that this film is incredibly good for the genre of war and tells a unique perspective in the most sublime way possible for the human eye.

"RossRivero99","9","0","1","29 May 2019"," One of Nolan's greatest achievements
","At this point in the century there is no question in anyone's minds that Christopher Nolan has proven himself to be one of the very best directors of his generation after directing great films like ""Insomnia"", ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk"" is a worthy addition to that already masterful resume. The movie is a departure for Nolan because with this movie he treaded into unmarked territory and proved he could direct a masterful WWII movie up there with ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Longest Day"", ""Patton"", and others as well as the best ever made but this movie tells the story of a key British event in that particular war. The film is based on the true story of how the German military surrounded the British, French, and Belgian militaries to the point where they had to be evacuated which amounted to a total of 400,000 people on the beaches in Dunkirk, even though people like me who are fascinated by history already knew how it unfolded somewhat Nolan and his frequent composer Hans Zimmer build up the tension and suspense quite nicely. The cast is filled with mostly unknown actors to show how young and inexperienced the soldiers were, but like any Nolan film it doesn't come without its big stars. Tom Hardy plays a British fighter pilot where most of his scenes are in a plane fighting the enemy, Kenneth Branagh plays a British Naval Commander who oversees the evacuations, recent Oscar winner Mark Rylance (who played the Russian spy Rudolf Abel in Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" a few years back) plays one of the civilians who helps in the evacuation process in getting all of the soldiers to safety, as well as frequent Nolan cohort Cillian Murphy who has a minor role a British soldier who is afraid of going back to battle because he fears for his life. Overall the movie is near perfect but the one problem I had was that the city of Dunkirk didn't even look like a war zone, and there wasn't enough extras to make it seem like there was 400,000 people on the beach, which are only extremely minor problems. The movie is one of the very best military movies that I've seen in a long time and of the very best of 2017."

","Feeling excited to watch when this movie was released back in 2017. My best friend and I, being typical teenagers, were actually being biased since our first intention to watch this movie is because Harry Styles is one of the actor. But as the movie playing we couldn't help to drown into the movie's charm as well.<br/><br/>The actors did a very great job in potraying each character, each image. Some impressed me, some saddened me, and some even annoyed me.
The cinematography and scoring in this movie are amazingly beautiful. With Christopher Nolan as the Director there's no denying that this genius' spell made the movie a masterpiece. The visual, the color, the camera angles are just neatly made. The backsound, thanks to Hans Zimmer, whenever there's bombing or gun-shooting scenes come never fails to thrill me even more.<br/><br/>One scene that I remember the most is the final battle rescue. When the airplane ran out of fuel I was internally screaming and praying (yes I did that) that Farrier would make it--even when i know he'd succeed eventually but still--. And I got goosebumps when he safely landed on the land and set his plane on fire, oh my, what a MAN. Shout out to Tom Hardy for potraying his character perfectly by slaying the battle until I can't move on from the scene even after getting out of the cinema. Also shout out to Harry Styles and his line ""Somebody's gotta get off so the rest of us can live."" when hiding inside a fully crowded boat, attempting to lighten the boat by accusing someone else. I memorize that line even until now, I don't know, it just has that impact on me. Thumbs up for Fionn Whitehead who's going through the most in the movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie only has little dialogue which make me a bit confused. I know the director intentionally focused on the visual, as Nolan himself said:<br/><br/>""The empathy for the characters has nothing to do with their story. I did not want to go through the dialogue, tell the story of my characters... The problem is not who they are, who they pretend to be or where they come from. The only question I was interested in was: Will they get out of it? Will they be killed by the next bomb while trying to join the mole? Or will they be crushed by a boat while crossing?""
<ul><li>Christopher Nolan</li></ul><br/><br/>but there are some scenes that better have conversation in it. The plot is also kind of flat which make me can't help but thinking ""Is this it?"" ""Oh, it ends already?"".<br/><br/>This movie also focused on the survival so when there's minor character death it doesn't take long to go back to the battlefield. It's hard for me to feel the emotion like one second I'm sad because someone's dead and then I'm thrilled because I want them to make it out alive. I don't know how to feel.<br/><br/>But overall this movie is sooo worth watching and I recommend this to watch. But it's a lot better to watch in the cinema to feel the thrill through your body so if you didn't get to watch this back when this was playing in the cinema, your loss!"

","This movie really works because of its non-linear sequence and the lack of dialogue. It's a movie that's quietly then loudly intense and it shifts between both modes, with Hans Zimmer's brilliant work on the score in the background that provides another layer of underlying tension that keeps you on your toes. Dunkirk is an anti-war movie that shows the human spirit to just Survive, that men who get sent to war are just collateral for a few powerful men who started it all. Dunkirk doesn't get into the politics of things and shows us war in the eyes of regular soldiers and their desperation to live another day."

"jadongarcia","10","0","2","4 March 2019"," Not your typical war film, but a film about survival
","Usually when you watch a war film the first thing that comes to mind is a couple soldiers sitting around a campfire talking about how they miss something about home. But this film isn't like that. We get a full emersive experience of what war itself was like. Nolan structured his film on 3 different perspectives which consist of The Air, The Land, and The Sea. The Air perspective is obviously the air force, and the lead pilot is played by noneother than Tom Hardy. The second perspective was The Sea and that story is told by a Sailor and two young adult boys who seek to set out on a dangerous journey to rescue the soldiers from Dunkirk beach. And finally the third and most centered aspect of the film's perspective is The Mole, and this one is probably the most significant because its about the survivors, the ones that had to endure watching other soldiers get killed in action, and towards the end of the film, we see that all three of these different perspectives aren't told at the same time but we see them unite towards the end as they all get rescued and the last pilot in the sky finishes his last mission. Now of course I was confused when watching this for the first time in theaters because it took place at different times and I was a bit confused with the film but then I found out during a second viewing that it was all done intentionally to blend into one long story told at different times to show what would happen to each character as the story was told. Like almost tell the audience each perspective story arc.<br/><br/>This was a beautiful film, especially towards the end when all the soldiers got rescued and witnessed what Tom Hardy's character did. The triumph of being rescued was exhilirating to watch. And don't even get me started on that score from The Great Hans Zimmer that had me and my mom at the edge or our seats for most of the movie especially with that ticking theme, Zimmer was so clever for that. You can never go wrong with the insane duo of Nolan & Zimmer. I honestly wish this film had won best motion picture instead of stinkin' Shape of Water which was far from being an oscar-worthy film, but of course the academies will just look at this film as a typical war film that lacks character development, but thats not what its about."

","I had heard ever different opinion about this movie before I watched it. That it was amazing, that it utterly sucked, that it wasn't anything special, that it only had the attractive cast going for it and other stuff.
I loved the movie. It was a masterpiece for me. Visually, it was like being fed your favorite cake on your birthday, the acting was flawless, the atmosphere was set from beginning to end, and didn't waver for one bit.
Now to the stuff that people have been complaining about. 1. You barely get a chance to get to know the characters. In a different movie than this one, I would agree that that's a bad thing. I strongly disagree on that with this one. I donÃ¤t think you're meant to get to know the characters properly, yet I somehow managed to get an emotional connection with a few of them. And I love that about the movie. There was one very prominent thought in my head as the movie progressed. You didn't get to know the characters separately becuase frankly, they were only pawns in this war. That thought made me realize how realistic the movie feels. There were 300 000 soldiers on that beach, and many more spread out across Europe. The fact that the story didn't focus on how the characters felt about the war , being shot at, or almost drowning in a boat was a necessary thing for the atmosphere in the movie to stay consistent. In the real WW2 there was nothing but cold and harsh conditions that these men had to go through, and I think it'd only be stupid for the movie to romaticize that.
All in all, I really think you'd have to watch this movie knowing that war with the Germans was unforgiving. And honestly, I think you need to be into war movies to be able to enjoy this."

I'm not saying the plot can be better or something. I know about the historical significance of the evacuation of Dunkirk, and I understand the required ways to present a movie narrating the sternness of that age. But still, sometimes while I was watching the movie, my imaginary picture of movies created by Christopher Nolan would contradict in from of my eye with Dunkirk.

","This film is set from May the 26th to the 4th of June, the year is 1940 and it is about a battle placed in World War II. The Allied forces are evacuating from the beaches of Dunkirk and are cut off and surround by the German army.<br/><br/>Unlike many other war films we have seen, Dunkirk is a rare film that instantly puts you in the centre of the terror that was WWII. Dunkirk gives no introduction to characters; no lengthy, mushy, slow back stories; no history of any solider growing up as a young lad only to one day be in war. This movie is all about the Fierce Battle and Evacuation of many men, shown from three perspectives- Land, Sea and Air. This film also surprised me with its gentle M rating (in Australia). Dunkirk doesn't focus on the gross blood bath aspect of war, but has a more suspenseful tone.<br/><br/>It's no secret that we know the film will be worthy of our time when the director's name in the trailer credits is none other than ""Christopher Nolan"". Nolan, whose resume includes Interstellar, The Dark Knight, Inception & Memento, has earned respect on many occasions, impressing audiences and providing plenty of surprise. This is the 1st time Nolan has directed a war film. Has he succeeded or has he finally hit his first brick wall?<br/><br/>Visually Dunkirk is amazing. From the opening scene alone, viewers will be impressed with the stunning, visual creativity of Nolan's filmmaking. It didn't take me long to speak aloud in my cinema, saying the words ""oh wow"". Please understand, this film is not trying to impress it's audiences by being just another classy action film. The director's goal here is to put you right in the centre of the situation and this results in an incredibly real motion picture film. This feeling is enhanced by the film using real locations, planes, ships and an outstanding number of extra cast members.<br/><br/>The audio track is applaud worthy. Many key moments including the sea crashing and sudden explosions make you want to cover your own ears in the cinema, just as if you were on the sand yourself or hearing the raw sounds of a plane turning around to fire its gun. Dunkirk deliveries one the strongest surround tracks I have ever seen in a war film. The audio details and mixing is one thing sure, but the musical score by Hans Zimmer is even more breathtaking. Composer Hans Zimmer has been well known for working with Christopher Nolan and delivers another soundtrack that will keep you in suspense and feeling like you're in a hurry. I noticed very clever use of the sound of a pocket watch during the film's score, continuing to tick, tick, tick, tick, tick as the men try to move off the beach in a hurry. A simple effect, but successfully adding more tension the film.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, Dunkirk gives you zero explicit character development and this factor alone could bother some viewers. For me personally, I was aware that this was a film about the event itself and a moment in time and knew what to expect. Going in blindly might have surprised me. Not only that, this was also a huge risk to take. Because the film is fast paced, the viewer will need to try and keep up. Like any war situation, the film gives you no time to stop and instead the viewer is given little bits of information along the way. With three different perspectives, the pacing and transitions between perspectives was a little tricky to follow at times. More than once I found myself questioning the film's time line and wondering if a scene or character was connected to another at the same time etc, or worse, trying to work out which character we were now following. To be honest this was something minor to me and I feel this will be rectified upon my second viewing. Given the amount of actors and talent it was no surprise that it was tricky to keep up. Also, seeing Tom Hardy a supporting role for this film was fantastic.<br/><br/>Overall, Dunkirk is an outstanding film and will be on many people's top lists of 2017 (including my own). It's a film that puts it's audiences right in the middle of it all in with a blink of an eye. Dunkirk deliveries a war story that cannot be forgotten or unseen. It is a movie with a huge list of talented actors all fulfilling key important roles and a film soundtrack that I must own on vinyl. This is an experience you really need to see on the big screen... and do it today.<br/><br/>9.3/10

"tabuno","6","0","1","10 January 2019"," Disjointedly Disappointing
","21 July 2017. Yes war is chaos, yet Dunkirk was disjointedly and chaotic for the wrong cinematic reasons. Perhaps in times of war, under stress, people do stupid and even idiotic things, but the script entailed focusing on some not so smart, unintelligent behavior that can leave particular audience members shaking their heads in bafflement instead of wondrous awe.<br/><br/>Sometimes its daylight, then nighttime, then daylight, then nighttime all in the seemingly same time frame. There's a scene when instead of posting a lookout, a small contingent of soldiers find themselves trapped in a darkened, confined space. The audience is offered up a less than sympathetic leading character, one soldier in particular who seems to escape death again and again whose actions appear less than honorable and whose connection with the audience seems distant and unattached. The aerial scenes are constantly interrupted with edits back to the other two story lines almost like a hyperactive attention deficit disorder so that the audience isn't able to vicariously experience the full impact of the emotional and mental turmoil of the pilot.<br/><br/>The audience gets to experience the lead character at the beginning of the movie wadding up flyers for a bowel movement behavior which are a little later strangely unused or at least unseen. There is a scene towards the end of the movie where an officer volunteers to remain behind seemingly safe for the moment while another is seemingly in jeopardy of being capture nearby. In between, there are random scenes of destruction and mayhem that almost appear to be inserted not for historical accuracy but to maintain some sort of pace fore the moving along with a musical track that hauntingly is oddly reminiscent of an occult horror movie Under the Skin (2013) with its eerie string tonal sounds. There are the typical almost dying and miracle being saved at the last moment taken straight out of mainstream action adventure movies when instead an armed soldier might have a least used a pistol to try to escape from the surging water. Additionally, there is a confrontation at sea between a rescued soldier and some civilian boatman which comes across awkward.<br/><br/>The movie is so fragmented that the emotional connection with the characters is lost and the storyline jumps so much that there isn't time or extended scenes to allow the audience to fully appreciate or understand the entirety of a scene before they are ripped away to experience some other part of the action. A disappointing movie by a great director. Dr. Zhivago (1965) is able to capture both the human connection and both the appeal and tragedy of war or Black Hawk Down (2001) another military rescue mission offers an more captivating and intimate as well as dirty and rawness of war."
"MendicuttiD","7","0","1","7 January 2019"," Nolan took me there.
","I've written it before: The Second World War is a factory of stories worthy of making a movie out of them. Even if there are those who question and criticize this fact, arguing that the Academy will always pay much more attention to a film whose historical context is this specific conflict, the truth is that if there is a quality standard when it comes to rating these films. We can notice that, even if it is a tendency, the great movies based on this part of human history are in the place that they are in a more than justified way. In 2017, the academy nominated no less than two films located in this era for Best Picture. I already talked about Darkest Hour, what does Dunkirk leave us then?<br/><br/>To begin with, we can once again appreciate the great ability of Christopher Nolan not only to direct a great cinematographic project, but to break the mold of the conventional film. In Dunkirk we can perceive an excellent script. Maybe not enough to get an Oscar nomination, but it does contain incredible details to take into account. In the first place, considering that the dialogue is very scarce (rather it occupies a merely descriptive role) so most of the narrative of the film is composed by actions and body language, which is carried out in a way that is at least acceptable . The actors, even if they do a very good job, occupy a circumstantial role, and their brightness lies more in the value of them as a crowd and in the way they form a whole within the story. While it is true that if there are memorable characters in the film, I am left with the feeling that it is the environment and the situation treated in the production that is the protagonist of Dunkirk. No aspect, both acting and dialogue, seems to be misplaced. Good script, good synergy.<br/><br/>The production design is spectacular, full of remarkable aspects. As I said before, it is the surroundings that occupies the leading role in the project. To achieve this goal, the production design must be at least excellent. Dunkirk is up to it, even if The Shape of Water got the Oscar in this respect. The work of cinematography is superb, with dramatic and precise shots, placing the viewer in the exact place where the director surely glimpsed it in his mind. However, it still had to beat Blade Runner 2049 in this category in the 90th ceremony, which did not happened. Hans Zimmer, although he was surpassed by Alexandre Desplat for his work in The Shape of Water, gives us an extraordinary and reasonably vertiginous musical project, proving once again his quality and talent as a composer. In editing issues and both categories of sound, it got the prize as expected. Good technical aspects.<br/><br/>The film has very noticeable tints of reality. More than referring to being based on real events, Christopher Nolan manages to make the viewer really feel at Dunkirk during that time. It does not seek to be very dramatic, although it has very well-known and genuine dramatic overtones. It raises an authentic war drama, endearing but as if it came straight out of a history book. The conflict, even if it is the war itself, is presented in such a way that the viewer can feel within the plot. The symbolism is also handled in a very clever fashion. It seems that, since the environment is the protagonist, the antagonist of all the characters is the water and the ocean mass that separates the English soldiers from their home. However, these characteristics also make this production a bit difficult to process, and it gives a slow pace unfortunately.<br/><br/>Summing it up, Dunkirk proposes an innovative way of making a film not only of the Second World War, but of war as a movie genre. The technical details of the production are incredible and the acting works very decent. It's a production that, while probably remembered as a great work by Christopher Nolan, was not worthy to take the Oscar home. However, it is perhaps the work of fate that Darkest Hour has premiered and been nominated on the same year, because both sides of the story are presented in each of these films. Even the end of both is a speech by Sir Winston Churchill. And, although these productions are not connected from their productions, the truth is that it raises the interest for what happened in Dunkirk in the year 1940. Good movie."

","I'd be lying if I said I knew a lot about the real events that inspired ""Dunkirk"", but I think the film summed it up just fine.

Sure, you have to have good acting in a film, but in this case it's different. The epic cinematography and tense scenes are what makes this movie. With that being said, I would be lying if I said the movie wasn't a little bit boring and kinda suffers for it at times.

","Set against the backdrop of WWII comes this gripping, tour de force motion picture.

The film chronicles multiple, interwoven narratives of those attempting to flee, those doing their best to aid the effort from afar, and those who would rather stand and fight. From the moment it starts it pulls you in with a vivid, breathtaking sense of time and place, and continually offers new, unexpected story turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.

","The film Dunkirk represents a unique amalgamation of Christopher Nolan's talents as a director. Forsaking his typical character-centric method for a far more technical approach, the production of this film utilized practical effects wherever possible (note the dogfighting scenes). While devoid of any real character development, Nolan's now traditional manipulation of time still manages to maintain a sense of immediacy and tension. Aided by Hans Zimmer's score and a genuine respect for the actual battle, Dunkirk is not Nolan's best work but nonetheless stands as an evocative study of honor and defeat."

We watch the main characters a private desperate to return home, a father & two sons helping out on the sea, and a squadron giving support from the air.

","Inspired by a true story.I've watched a lot of war movies before and dunkirk is definitely one of the top 5 war movies that really impressed me.<br/><br/>Why is it so ridiculous or bad for me in the movie why the frenches stay behind when the English get away.
it is said to be very wrong there are more than 300.000 troops there rather than being open target on the beach is a little better than resistance.
this is not like movie criticism. If it is so in history, of course they can not change it, but it hurts me to hunt into clear target.<br/><br/>
the movie goes on at different time intervals and shows us the events with different eyes, for example we see the fall of a plane both in the eyes of the pilot and also in the eyes of the person using the boat below.war scenes, and even the entire backdrop of the movie, the music that was playing was beautiful, it was full of thrill hits, the battle scenes were pretty realistic, you feel like in the war and you witness those difficulties.<br/><br/>the war is so bad we once again saw it.<br/><br/>I do not know if they are English loves or hate I obviously did not know that they would leave the frenches but in the last stages they helped the soldiers of the people to emigrate them to save them from the beach.<br/><br/>
My favorite scene is Kenneth Branagh saying It is home and the appearance of the boats on the horizon,I can watch this scene many times.our french child, so gibson was freed from all accusations that he was very sorry for his death, but having a very good heart caused his death.<br/><br/>
the scenes of battle planes deserve to be nominated until the end of a truly oscar's movie that needs to be appreciated.If he had won, nobody said he did not deserve it.<br/><br/>a movie that has already been shot on a beautiful story

"dosarf","9","0","2","12 August 2018"," A bold, unconventional narrative about an important event of the 20th century
","I am somewhat surprised to see how many people gave low ratings to this move lately, on grounds of it being ""devoid of emotion"", ""lack of compelling characters"", or just ""plain boring"".<br/><br/>I guess one reason why this movie is divisive is the fact that we may have been house-trained by the good old simplistic good vs evil story lines. (And I am not even an artsy movie lover, I tend to prefer my action blockbuster.)<br/><br/>I suspect another reason is if people were not entirely clear on the importance of the Dunkirk evacuation (Operation Dynamo) - and yes, this movie sort of failed to give that context. I warmly recommend watching Darkest Hour (2017) first, an entirely watchable movie itself with its 7.4 ratings and Gary Oldman superbly portraying Winston Churchill. I actually happened to watch it just before watching Dunkirk, and it may have put me into a receptive state of mind. I would go as far as to say that these two movies from 2017 are twin movies, best to be enjoyed together.<br/><br/>(So the significance of the Dunkirk evacuation, if I didn't get it all wrong, please bear with me, is that it salvaged ""whole root and core and brain of the British Army, on which [..] we [..] are to build, the great British Armies in the later years of the war"" - Churchill. Without his army Churchill might have been forced to ask for terms, perhaps even by his own war cabinet. Without her army, Britain would have been open for a Nazi invasion. And without the defiant British Isles, Continental Europe would have suffered horribly, for a very long time probably. ""Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free [..]. But if we fail, then the whole world [..] will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age"" - again Churchill.)<br/><br/>As a person from Continental Europe, I certainly think that the events of Dunkirk are important enough to be told and re-told. Except these particular events do not lend themselves to conventional story telling.<br/><br/>First of all, Allied forces were soundly beaten. The 338 thousand troops evacuated did not achieve military (or naval) victory in any sense, they merely escaped, leaving tens of thousands of prisoners and immense quantities of materiel behind. At a first look, the Nazi propaganda seems to have been right to present it to the German public as overwhelming and decisive German victory. Even though Churchill was much relieved to have them troops back, he was also quick to point out that ""wars are not won by evacuations"".<br/><br/>So my first point is that no amount of artistic liberty can, or should put a spin of a victory on this tale, not in the usual sense.<br/><br/>My other point is that the topic of this movie cannot even be connected to a single person (or even a well-defined team of persons). The movie is about ""Dunkirk Spirit"" - I just learned about this term myself, go look it up. It is, by definition, not something one person had, it's something the British people had, at least enough of them, therefore it can only be understood by listening to fragmented personal reports. The makers of this movie set out to show hope for humankind, to show how a number of individuals, mostly insignificant by themselves, made the evacuation possible by choosing to go the extra mile, even though not one of them could ever be blamed afterwards for taking the safer and saner path.<br/><br/>So this story is neither about a (clear) victory, nor about a single person (or group of persons), so there goes the usual single good vs evil story line.<br/><br/>If one expects a heroic tale of the troops themselves, and most war movies do tend to focus on fighting troops, then I can see how one feels sorely let down by this movie. Perhaps it's the tagline, with the temporal clause ""When 400,000 men couldn't get home ..."" preceding the main clause ""... home came for them"" that somehow misdirects the emphasis. Or perhaps it's the poster showing one of the troops, instead of showing the ""little boats"" that came for the rescue. The wrong exposition can build up the wrong expectations. I thought the fragmented nature and the editing made it clear enough.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie shook me to my very core: the point it makes with its courageous non-linear structure and its story line unattached to a single person was not only invigorating, it felt somehow right, it seemed the only right way to tell this story. Its cinematography, acting and the soundtrack were all awesome. I didn't find myself bored, not for a second.<br/><br/>The only reason I won't score this movie 10 is that it forced me to go on about WWII here. I wonder if that historical context, the importance of the evacuation could have been made more clear. Still a masterpiece, 9/10."

"Luis_Pineda","7","0","2","3 August 2018"," Brilliant... but not in everything
","Christopher Nolan was one of my favorite directors, I can say that my love for films got stronger with one of his films: ""Inception"" (2010). I was fascinated with that movie, I knew I hadn't seen something like that in my life so then I thought Nolan was one of the best directors of current cinema. Then I realized that I had seen another Nolan film, and it was another one with I was fascinated, based on my favorite superhero: Batman. The movie was ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). Knowing this I started to see his other films and I think the two movies that I mentioned along with ""Interstellar"" (2014) and one of his first ones ""Memento"" (2000) are the best of his filmography. Now he made ""Dunkirk"" and in my opinion this film represents how much he has learned when making movies but also how much he has to learn.<br/><br/>I mentioned my best films from Nolan and my personal experience with these because many people actually think that Christopher Nolan is the best director of our times... but I don't blame them, not because they are right but because the current crisis in cinema has made them think like that, I explain. The movie theaters of today are full (We could also say INFECTED) of superhero movies; the whole universe of Marvel and the recent, and bad, universe of DC dominate cinema listings of every year. Now, the people who see this superhero movies go to see ""the best superhero movie"" that is ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) directed by Nolan and then they go to see his other films and so they begin to idolize him, like a Messiah.<br/><br/>I admit that something similar happened to me but it wasn't because of the superhero movies, I ""fell in love"" with his movies with ""Inception"", in 2010, when Marvel had only premiered three films, I went to see ""Transcendence"" (Wally Pfister, 2014) because Nolan was the producer and in that year I had great expectation for ""Interstellar"", I went to see this film and the movie theater was empty but three years later I see ""Dunkirk"" and it was full as if it were a superhero movie and it seems like everyone liked it but I think there are some aspects in which Nolan fails and I will analyze this.<br/><br/>There's something I criticized from Nolan after seen ""Dunkirk"" and is that he is too true to his ""style"" and when I heard he was going to do a war film I expected him to do a different movie and in this point is were I was very disappointed. The aspect is the management of time in the film. It's totally unnecessary and he does it just to brag, to show off he can do a complicated movie, something we already knew after see ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" and also ""The Prestige"" (2006). The use of time in ""Dunkirk"" with his different stories told in a disorderly way doesn't have any narrative function or even cinematographic, is use only as an visual effect. You also get confused sometimes, no matter how intelligent you are. The concepts of time in films studied in the 20's by the russians are misused by Nolan.<br/><br/>The other aspect that is a little wrong are the characters, maybe we could say that as is a war movie it doesn't about a person or a group of persons but of a ""situation"", an historic event: the evacuation from Dunkirk. But sadly Nolan tries that you feel empathy for some characters and you don't, because they are bad developed for that.
Maybe the movie would be perfect for me without those aspects because except for these everything is incredible, the sound, the cinematography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, the music of Hans Zimmer, all the technical aspects are amazing as Nolan does it always, a very well cared production. The use of silence and no so much dialogue help to create a great experience of suspense and tension.<br/><br/>Despite the problems it has is a very good movie that of course it worth to see. For me, is maybe the best movie of Nolan filmography behind ""The Dark Knight"" and maybe ""Inception"" and shows us that Nolan has learned a lot, his strong is how to tell a story, now he has to learn how to put aside his style and dazzle us with pure cinematographic art."

","For anyone seeking to learn about what happened at Dunkirk in a way that is up close and personal, this is the war movie to see. It is not a pull-back, wide-angle view of the big picture. There are plenty of other accounts that can offer that view. This one is a heavily detailed showing of what it was like to live through that experience, from the points of view of the soldiers, the navy personnel, the medical teams - which included women. Most importantly, it shows us the bravery and determination of the civilian fishing captains who went across the English Channel and into the war theater to retrieve as many British troops as they could get, so as to enable them to live to fight another day. Those civilians knew exactly what they were doing and why."

","Dunkirk is told to be one of the greatest war movies ever made. A lot of reviews here on IMDb are bad ones about christoffer Nolan and expected storytelling a la Batman and inception. Personally im glad that I didn't know about Nolan directing the movie until I started watching. 
I wouldn't be to keen about watching a movie about a war and knowing it was Nolan making it. Nolan is a director who known for dreamy telling and grandiose dark movies with scenes that blows your mind.<br/><br/>This movie, is the totally opposite. Many reviews are about expectations about a movie like the others. And when the movie is finished people found it boring and low-key.
But it's just that. The low-key story about three different places and people (soldiers on the beach, a pilot in the air and a civilian boat crew on the ocean) that Nolan blows me away again. The stories is full of emotions but the actors are amazing playing it so smal and narrow. It never goes to panic, just a feeling it's on the way all the time.
You never see the Germans. A couple of bombs and shootings and you just know they are everywhere. It's a smart move from Nolan to make the movie even more thrilling just knowing the situation is out of control.
Just sounds, the actors dejection and music makes it more terrifying than any horrormovie.
My sister told me about Utoya (in Swedish Utöya) a movie about a terror action from one Norwegian man a couple of years ago. If you don't know the story this man (Anders Behring Breivik) first detonate a bomb in Oslo as a decoy. The plan were to make the Norwegian police focus on the bomb as Breivik went up to the island Utoya. Every year the partie""arbeidernes ungdomsforbund"" (kids active in Norway's biggest political partie) have a camp on the island. As the Norwegian police were in Oslo busy with the bomb Breivik went to the island covered as a cop starting to shoot people. In the end almost 100 people died. 
This is a true story and my sister told me it were the most terrifying movie she seen. The movie is in real time as Breivik were on the island for 93 minutes. In the movie you never see breivik. You just hear the shoots. And just telling me about it made me cry. 
Dunkirk is similar to this. It just meditates feelings and anxiety. I almost stopped watching because the claustrophobia were all over me. My own feelings were triggered in a way not many movies managed to do. 
Dunkirk is a masterpiece and Nolan is a genius again. Even though the lack of Heath Ledger standing in the street with closeups on hes twisted face waiting for the bat mobile in a scene so grandiose your stomach turns up side down."
"aimeewhitling","8","0","3","25 June 2018"," This just might be Nolan's best work yet
","This just might be Nolan's best work yet and I say that as a huge Dark Knight fan. Dunkirk also has to be the best war movie I've seen to date.<br/><br/>I commend Nolan for choosing to use such little dialogue and allowing the story and action speak for themselves, it truly does what it intends to do create intensity and suspense that will have you sitting at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Before going into the movie I was worried about the casting choice of Harry Styles as I was worried it would take me out of the film. All my worries were for nought, his acting was excellent, he did not take me out of the film for one second. Cillian was a stand out for me personally, he did an amazing job of portraying a shellshocked solider that just wanted to get home.<br/><br/>We mustn't ignore the feat Nolan and everyone working on this movie took on board. Six thousand extras were used in the making of this movie. They shot at Dunkirk where the real evacuation took place and filming was contingent on tidal patterns as well as French labour strikes. In place of CGI they used cardboard cutout props of soldiers and military vehicles to create the illusion of a large army. Real or scale model fighter aircraft, and real warships and private boats provided realism that couldn't be achieved from CGI. The mole set had to be frequently rebuilt after being damaged by bad weather. Nearly sixty ships were located and reconditioned for shooting. Not to mention all the other detail that had to be worked out for this movie to be as beautiful, cinematic and epic as it is.*<br/><br/>If being true to the events of Dunkirk are important to you this probably isn't the film for you but if you are in the market for an epic war movie I highly recommend giving this a watch.<br/><br/>* - information from wikipedia"

"jimbo-53-186511","4","0","2","9 June 2018"," Polished, but unfortunately it's also uncinematic and unengaging
","Dunkirk is Christopher Nolan's attempt to tell the story of the evacuation of thousands of soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. Whilst, this film clearly worked for a lot of people (critics and IMDB members alike) I'm afraid that personally I didn't feel much love for it I'm afraid...<br/><br/>To begin with the positives the film looks incredibly good and as director Nolan throws us into the horrors of war fairly well - one could argue that he is perhaps too much in love with the technical side of things, but the jury is out on that one for the time being ; despite this he does give the film a sense of hopelessness and fear which does just about enough to drive the film along...<br/><br/>However, the film, for me, fails in pretty much every other area; for a start, it shunts about all over the place shifting focus here, there and everywhere, and whilst I get that Nolan was doing this to try to show the evacuation from varying perspectives he doesn't really give any focus on one given area which caused a bit of a problem. You can't fault the actors here and I think it's fair to say that everyone does 'their bit' but when you look at the talented ensemble here it's hard not to be a little disappointed by the wasted potential here; the likes of Murphy, Hardy, Branagh and Rylance are all here, but they make so little impact that it becomes barely worthy of mention. The narrative is so thin that it's barely worthy of mention - there is a hint of discussion about the evacuation, but it's so slight that almost seems insignificant.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these things ultimately work against the film and rather than cheering everyone on I found myself rather indifferent to everything that happened - most of the characters feel inconsequential and the lack of me being able to care for anyone or anything here unfortunately held me back from being able to enjoy the film (and believe me it pains me to say this given the vast number of lives that were lost at Dunkirk during World War 2). However, when watching films of this nature, I do need to feel uplifted and at least have a sense of euphoria at the end, but I didn't feel this way at any point whist watching Dunkirk. In truth, it is episodic, repetitive and a bit boring.<br/><br/>In summary, the best analogy I can use is that Nolan had everything going for him here, but much like Beckham's penalty against Turkey he missed the goal by a long way..."

","And that says alot, coming from me, because I hate most of Nolans movie. They're bloated, pretentios and very, very boring. Interstellar being his worst movie., And The Dark Knight Rises, his second worst movie. Because he ruined his own Batman triology with that abomination of a movie. <br/><br/>Dunkirk, however, is a very good movie. Al though not the masterpiece, Im sure all of the wannabe-intellectual movie snobs, here on imdb, praises it to be. <br/><br/>First of all, it's not too long. In these days when pretty much all movies have a run time of at least 2 and a half hours, a run time of 1 hour and 43 minutes, it never got boring. It kept me watching, with its constant suspense. And it was surprisingly brutal, despite, its kiddie friendly PG13 rating. Best acting I've seen in a Nolan movie, since Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. Except from Kenneth Branagh. I cant stand that man. Fortunately, he's not in this movie much. <br/><br/>Also nice, to not see Michael Caine in a Nolan movie for once. I hate that old fart and I widh he would retire, sooner rather than later. <br/><br/>Surprisingly good performance from Harry Styles. I dint expect that. <br/><br/>There wasn't really any leads in this movie. It was just alot of nameless soldiers and a few civilians. And it worked very well. It showed what its like to be a soldier in the middle of a war constantly being afraid and unable to trust anyone, that isnt british, and it does so, without becoming cliche. <br/><br/>That having been said, I hope Christopher Nolan is done using the same actors over and over and over again. Watching pretty much the same cast for the 5th time or so, is like watching movies made in Denmark, where I'm from. Where the same handful of actors appear in movies over and over and over again.<br/><br/>This movie does have some new actors in it. But since there are no leads and all of the young soldiers have dark hair and look pretty much the same, I still have no idea who they are. Except from Styles. And he's not even an actor. But after his performance here, I think we will see him in many more movies in the future, if he wants to continue acting. <br/><br/>This is the first movie I can truly recommend in a long long time."

"andszu","3","0","5","9 May 2018"," Overtalked, underacted, no story to tell and curiosal.
","A history hobbyist, and war movie addict, I was long waiting an opportunity to see this one.. And when I finally did, my eyes were gradually opening wider and wider, but from scepticism rather than amazement.
Not only does this movie not live up to any comparison with ""Saving Private Ryan"", it is inferior to any contemporary movie I can think of. Which is a shame, because Dunkirk story offers really great potential, which in this case was almost totally missed.<br/><br/>The story is childlishly flat and contains so many inconsequences, that one may think all the characters are dumb. In fact, the whole of Expeditionary Corps soldiers behave and even move exactly like zombies (at times I could not help feeling I am watching the victims of it's just another virus pandemy story).<br/><br/>The battlefield shown is just lousy (no artillery, hardly any military action actually happens on land or sea; yes we are hearing the officers talking ""Germans are pressing on the lines"" but we don't actually _see_ it. All that is just in the talks. No smell of gunpowder anywhere. Nor do we see any German presence (other than a few Luftwaffe aircraft overhead).<br/><br/>A few smoke columns over horizon does not suffice to make the epic bettlefield scene feel realistic. And where did all that abandoned equipment go to? I saw a fair amount of documentaries about operation ""Dynamo"" (which by the way, was never mentioned in the movie - maybe too classified ;) ) and the beach looked, felt and almost smelled - totally unlike this one.
No dynamics whatsoever. <br/><br/>Air fight scenes are a bit better, but just a little bit. Where are Hurricanes? What about air battle formations? And anti-aircraft artillery? Has it been introduced after 1940? Why there are no overcast and adverse weather effect shown in the movie? Again, weather is mentioned in a talk, but not really present. All feels like a very crappy TV shows, not a proper movie.<br/><br/>Struggle at sea is no lifebuoy for the movie either. Again, nothing feels real. The warships are there, but not manoevering, and, worse still, they never fire at enemy aircraft (I do not think the whole Royal Navy made a single shot in the entire movie - except for smallarms fire). this is ridiculous, given the really low level bombardment made by the single He-111 shown.
The crews seem at leisure, so look the evacuated soldiers. They wave hands at small ships and generally take up spectators', not participants' posture.<br/><br/>What's supposed to become the spine of the plot - the private small boat venture across the Channel, is disputably the only bright spot in the whole story, but even that might offer more twists, more action and -regret to mention that one- better acting, not to mention seafaring realities.<br/><br/>Finally, the most ridiculously scene of the evening: the arrival of private boats in Dunkirk. Totally unreal, all boats arrive together (although only one was seen during most of the Channel crossing), all feeling of threat is gone, battle suddenly seems over, commanders are smiling, all Navy sailors become spectators clapping hands.. again, naïvety and ridicule. Suddenly nobody seems to recall that there's still a journey home to be made, and for many a ship, not just one! And the movie ends here.
Is that how the movie director envisioned Dunkirk evacuation, really? Come on!<br/><br/>The idea of a Spitfire out of fuel, leaping across the sky jet-speed, its propeller stuck, shooting down Bf-109, doing more flying and then, after a few minutes, finally descending for a perfect beach landing (who knows why over German lines - why not do it next to ""the Pier""?) I leave with no more comments. One has to see it oneself to believe how lousy that was. 
I can not recommend, though.<br/><br/>I am adding one star for Kenneth Branagh acting (although the character seemed tendencious and too much Russian-style state-sponsored movie hero.<br/><br/>Summing up.. one of the worst war movies made since .... 1940 ? ;-)"
"neil-476","7","0","2","9 May 2018"," Good but far from great
","Christopher Nolan's dramatisation of the British rescue of servicemen, stranded on the north European coast, is a good film. <br/><br/>It shows us the scope of the mission by focusing in on three elements. One is the land-based situation and, in particular, the efforts of a single young man to get off that beach and onto a boat to England by any means available. Another is what happens to just one of the small boats which took part in the rescue as it leaves Weymouth on its way to the besieged beaches. And the last concerns a Spitfire pilot, doing his best to protect British forces in the Channel.<br/><br/>We therefore have the spectacle and scale of Dunkirk, together with 3 stories which are small and intimate enough for us to identify on an individual level. There are sequences which, if not so graphic, are nearly as harrowing as the D-Day landings in Saving Private Ryan and, by crosscutting between the segments, the tension is kept at maximum level throughout.<br/><br/>And that is one of my criticisms - I'm not one of those who thinks Christopher Nolan can do no wrong, by the way, The editing is sometimes a bit too fussy for its own good - it's not always clear where you are, whether you've switched narrative strand, or whose viewpoint you're supposed to be following. And this is exacerbated by the fact that weather conditions and time of day switch. One realises that filming a sea sequence means you can't always wait for the sun to come out, but do we have an understandable continuity glitch, or do we have a deliberate editing mismatch?<br/><br/>My other major criticism is of the music. I understand the music choice - insistent, discordant, all-pervasive, featuring a clock ticking throughout most of its running time to crank up tension and to create a dramatic effect when it stops - but dear heavens, it was like being assaulted. I don't think there is a moment in this film without music, and it's loud and overpowering and, with a couple of exceptions - when they factor in a taste of Elgar at particularly uplifting moments - it's not much fun to listen to. I hated it.<br/><br/>But there are those moments - the arrival of the small boats and the final fate of the Spitfire, for instance, which genuinely choke you up. Well, me at any rate. My Grandad was in the navy on one of the ships at Dunkirk, and one of the people rescued by his ship was a soldier who went on to marry my Mum's cousin - we found this out much, much later when they moved to be near my Mum in old age. So there is a personal resonance for me as, I imagine, a lot of Brits.<br/><br/>This is a good film. It is (in my view) too flawed to be a great film, but you can say that of much of Nolan's work."

There's no blood at all. The Germans are never called the Germans (""the enemy""). How are we supposed to believe that over 300,000 got back to England? Apart from the near empty beaches, we almost only see people NOT making it home.

"nairtejas","5","0","1","7 January 2018"," Capsule Review: Dunkirk
","Dunkirk is unarguably one of the most technical sound films made so far, but at the same time the effect it has on you is limited. For starters, it requires its audience to have good knowledge of the infamous Dunkirk evacuation that happened towards the end of World War II, without which you cannot make complete sense of the plot. And even if you are well-versed with history, the degree of repetitive sequences, albeit beautifully crafted, is just too high to make it an epic war film. The score by Hans Zimmer is arguably the biggest character in Dunkirk, which manages to keep you hooked despite the aforementioned shortcomings. Director Christopher Nolan knows how important the score and camera work are for a film that tries to bring events happening in air, land, and sea together, which is one thing that works well for Dunkirk. There is tension throughout the 100 minutes of running time, thanks to Zimmer's ticktock tunes, and one that will make you unable to move. Performances are great since dialogue is scarce and subtle, but it still shows how talented Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead are. The use of numbing score and captivating shots is what hides the hollowness of the plot and what makes this an average watch at best. Director Nolan had set the bar quite too high with his past few films but Dunkirk seems to be missing the trademark. TN."
"leonblackwood","5","0","1","6 January 2018"," Brilliant attention to detail but not that entertaining!
","Review:
This is another movie from Christopher Nolan, which plays with time, and you have to use your head to piece it together. It portrays an evacuation from 3 different perspectives, land, sea and air, during the fall of France in 1940. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers have retreated to Dunkirk, and a young British private, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), is the sole survivor of a German ambush. The movie then follows his amazing journey to reach home, whilst being under severe attack, which kills many soldiers. While all this drama is happening at sea, a small fishing boat is trying to make his way to Dunkirk, so it can help to get some of the survivors back home but the captain Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) doesn't have a smooth ride, due to a wounded soldier that he saved along the way. Meanwhile, Farrier (Tom Hardy), is in the air trying to fight off all of the planes that are trying to destroy the soldiers below but he is also fighting for his life, due to low fuel and no support. I found this movie quite interesting, and cleverly put together but as there isn't much dialogue, and it takes some time to get going, I did find it quite boring in parts. Don't get me wrong, I totally respect Nolan for taking on an important period of English history but I found it quite hard to follow, especially with all of the different time shifts in the storyline. The acting was realistic, and the cinematography was truly amazing but like Inception and Memento, which were also directed by Christopher Nolan, you have to watch it a few times before you truly understand and appreciate his vision. Anyway, from an entertainment point of view, I have seen better and I can't help feeling that my expectations wasn't fully satisfied but it's still worth a watch, especially as Nolan doesn't release movies that often. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
Christopher Nolan, 47, has made some excellent movies to date, and his attention to detail is second to none. He first hit the spotlight in 2000 with Memento, which was a unique movie that was ahead of its time, and in 2002 he brought you Insomnia starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams. In 2005 he put all of his energy into the Batman franchise, bringing you Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and the Dark Knight Rises. In between those movie he directed the Prestige and the brilliant Inception, which I still don't understand, and then he made Interstellar in 2014. He was also the executive producer for Man of Steel, Transcendence Batman vs. Superman and Justice League, so he's been fairly busy, even though he carefully picks what projects to work on. He is definitely a unique director who gives every aspect of a movie much thought, and he directs his movies from an audience point of view. Personally, it does seems like you need a degree to appreciate his final product, and after watching the bonus disk of Dunkirk, his depth is way beyond your everyday director. Although I wasn't that excited about this movie, I still think that Nolan is a terrific director. <br/><br/>Budget: $100million
Worldwide Gross: $525.5million<br/><br/>Genre: Action, Drama, History, War
Cast: Fionn Whitehead, Damien Bonnard, Aneurin Barnard, Barry Keoghan, Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, James D'Arcy, Cillian Murphy and Harry Styles. 5/10"
"lassell","4","0","1","3 January 2018"," Failed Experiment
","Others have already said what I felt, or DIDN'T feel, which is perhaps more the point. Since Nolan eliminated any reason for empathy with his characters, I felt none. I didn't have any investment whether any of them lived or died. There are no Private Ryans to rescue here. Four of my four stars are awarded to the cinematography, which Nolan was attempting to use to carry the emotional arc of his story. This failed. Several reasons: It was actually difficult to tell his characters apart. The three young soldiers all had a similar look (especially when they were covered in oil and shot in the dark). The pilots all had their faces covered with oxygen masks. Among the recognizable actors: The wonderful Cillian Murphy was wasted, and snore-inducing Mark Rylance seems to think the best acting is that which differentiates the actor the least from a corpse. And forget about which plane is British and which is German in the dog fights. I appreciate that Nolan is attempting to find new ways (are they new?) to tell stories on film, but DUNKIRK just doesn't rise to its own challenge, and the climax of the film is bewilderingly underwhelming. DUNKIRK a sketch of a movie rather than a movie itself. I only watched it to the end because, mercilessly, it's not epic-length. Nolan's aim might have been Brechtian, but the result was just distancing. And when you are not involved with the characters, you notice every single thing that is wrong or inadequate. I think the real problem is that there was no one on this project with the clout to say no to Nolan or to challenge him. He wrote and directed it and co-produced it with Emma Thompson, his wife. Usually a collaborative art form works better if there are collaborators."

Hell, I could even watch Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers for the Xth time and still feel the presence of the danger and threat hanging all over the place every minute.

"ednitram","5","0","1","3 January 2018"," There are better Dunkirk movies to watch
","I was bitterly disappointed by this movie, not least by the fact that Christopher Nolan is its director. I expected much more intense engagement with an epic story. Instead I was left barely touched. <br/><br/>The cinematography is good, the acting decent, but where's the reflection of the spirit of the evacuation? The beaches were full of abandoned equipment and not as clean as in this movie. Never mind the small historical inaccuracies like yellow-nosed Messerschmitts or Heinkel bombers firing canons. The Luftwaffe was indeed very present above Dunkirk, and not with lonely bomber sorties. And usually fighters belly-landed on sand and did not use their undercarriage.<br/><br/>I believe ""Weekend at Zuydcoote"" (aka 'Week-end at Dunkirk', 1964) starring Jean-Paul Belmondo captures the sense abandonment a little better and we indeed get to see civilians in Dunkirk who are totally absent in this movie. ""Atonement""'s (2007) single sequence of the beach is a fantastic piece of cinematography which Nolan could have easily matched or surpassed, but he didn't. The BBC's three-part movie ""Dunkirk"" (2004) starring Benedict Cumberbatch re-creates the atmosphere in the read-guard action to reach/defend the beaches and the evacuation through personal stories in a more eloquent manner. The execution of the British prisoners by the SS and Cumberbatch's staunch defence are barely matched in Nolan's movie which, in my opinion, is too dependent on dialogue than action, especially sound. The beaches were indeed very noisy, not as in Nolan's film.<br/><br/>And the 1958 ""Dunkirk"" already provides a good depiction of the role of the small civilian boats in the evacuation which this movies does not build onto.<br/><br/>What a waste of an opportunity but one of the best contemporary movie directors."

Twelve years ago, History channel's Dogfights showed us CGI has improved so much that period correct machines, correctly painted fighters can be simulated in realistic dogfights, and numerous movies showed epic, expansive landscape with soldiers, but this 2017 movie has none of that. The story is bland, acting is so-so and viewers are UNDERwhelmed. If you do watch it and you will agree."

"sjspitts","9","0","1","28 December 2017"," Harrowing but uplifting.
","As a WW2 history buff I already know the story of Dunkirk, and I can still remember the radio version of the Snow Goose from when I was growing up - but I've never seen the 1950s film. <br/><br/>Despite my interest in military history, or maybe because of it, I don't rate a lot of war movies very highly - a lot of people have describe Dunkirk as the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan, a movie I'd only give 5/10, and I've never liked the acting from the classics like Lawrence of Arabia (although I'll watch Zulu if it's on).<br/><br/>People obviously want different experiences, and a lot of the reviews here (ordered by helpfulness) are quite negative, but you've already seen that I've given Dunkirk 9/10 - here's why.<br/><br/>My first viewing of Dunkirk was one of the most emotional movie watching experiences I've ever had. I'll happily admit that I was influenced to a huge extent by the music and the ""moments"" - both aspects of the film that some others obviously hate. I really liked the way the divergent timelines, both in terms of chronology and pacing, gradually came together and how some minor details changed as perspective was added. It was great how land, sea and air were not only paced differently but scripted differently. The land was bleak and harrowing, where survival and escape took precedence over talking. The sea was the direction of hope, a place for reflection and understanding - ""He's shell shocked George, he's not himself. He may never be himself again."". The air was businesslike and decisive - ""He's on me."" ""I'm on him."" - but also unashamedly heroic and uplifting, like when Farrier turns back knowing he will run out of fuel.<br/><br/>Dunkirk obviously wasn't perfect and I was a bit disappointed that the sense of scale was never really portrayed - it never seemed like there were hundreds of thousands of soldiers evacuated, or 800 small boats (mostly NOT crewed by their owners - but why adulterate the mythology) ferrying them off the beach.<br/><br/>But I loved the raw, visceral drama that ebbed and flowed as the stories played out - I was emotionally exhausted at the end of it. Maybe in part this was because I watched it with my grandfather who was a telegram boy in London at the time, so I felt a real connection to the people, time and place (incidentally Grandad didn't enjoy it as much as I did!!).<br/><br/>The key thing for me was that this was an experience, not just a movie, and while I can understand that some people would not have enjoyed it, it hit all the right buttons for me."

","Nolan is obviously a special filmmaker. He can tell a complex war story without words. He can leave you breathless on the edge of your seat even though you don't know any characters' name or stories. And this film is extremely Nolan-y. No voiceovers or triumphant battles here. Just a few characters' interwoven paths through 36 hours of suffocating panic and chaos. Zimmer's score is perfect, and the cinematography is majestic. The movie sometimes feels torn between a classic war film and a classic Nolan movie, but the in between-ness works."

"jernej-fuerst","8","0","1","25 December 2017"," The land of the dead
","First of all this is very unconventional war movie. The movie itself has some stunning imagery and very impressive scenes. The lack of dialogues lets the viewer fills in lines and with that kind of silence Christopher Nolan lets the viewer fills in emotions and this kind of reminds me of the movie Thin red line. It is completely apolitical. And with the style Nolan took I don't resent him that. I don't think this is the question of political correctness. And from this point on the movie differentiates from the rest. The movie feels more like a myth than a record of historical event. Of course it is a record of historical event to some extent. But it is more like watching Greek mythology. Where soldiers are trapped in the land of the dead and shores of Dunkirk are just the entrance of the Hades' underworld where he with his two brothers Poseidon, the god of the sea, and Zeus, the god of the sky, tries to seal the fate of soldiers. And English channel is the only way in and out of the underground. All the small boats remind us of Greek mythology but instead of sailing people into the underworld here were trying so save them from certain death. Because soldiers were on the other side in Hades' realm they were powerless even though there were 400.000 of them. They were half alive and half dead. They seem mostly indifferent. Like most of them were under some kind of spell. Waiting, doing nothing, without true emotions and feelings just some gloomy dark fear was tearing them apart. And from that perspective the movie is again one masterpiece from Christopher Nolan."

"lee_eisenberg","7","0","1","25 December 2017"," evacuation from battle
","When Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" got released, it drew controversy for omitting the Indian troops in British armed forces who were in Dunkirk. That said, it's one intense movie. It focuses on a couple of people participating in the evacuation and how their stories intertwine. Most of it is shot in a naturalistic style to increase the intensity, and there's limited dialog. There are only a few notable actors in the movie, so as to keep the focus on the story.<br/><br/>It's not a great movie, but worth seeing. Tom Hardy's character's flight alone is enough reason to see the movie. From what I heard, Nolan's ""Interstellar"" sucked, so he's made up for it. I do hope that there's eventually a movie about the Indian troops in the British armed forces, though."
"yoninahthecat","9","0","1","24 December 2017"," Threadbare but it works
","I could list a few criticisms of this film and decry the 'unrealistic' images being conveyed through the film *but* the film just works.<br/><br/>Probably the cleverest aspect of the film is its choice to ignore a timeline in which to place events chronologically. It isn't too far in when you begin to realise that one aspect of the story line being told has already taken place - while you visit another perspective later in the film as if it, too, is a present.<br/><br/>It's a superb piece of editing - with little gore. The dog fight sequences alone are worth watching."
"kgprophet","7","0","1","24 December 2017"," Visceral and Original
","The inevitable question rises when a major war movie is released ""does this have anything original to say?"". Astoundingly, Nolan's new film is a yes. If one were to extract a theme from this script is that people will go through extraordinary lengths for survival. Not to take anything away from acts of survival in ""Schindler's List"". This movie needs little dialogue to show the unspoken communication between the vulnerable soldiers, perhaps left to die on the beaches of Dunkirk, France. <br/><br/>Nolan found a great moment to flesh out, and more importantly, deliberately exclude a great deal of side stories that easily could bogged down the pacing and the running time. Turning this film into a tight action film running only 1 hour and 47 minutes. Three primary stories are followed, two of which are filled with surprises. The first is the young English soldier who you sense is essentially lost. You never see him with his regiment or carousing with other comrades. Knowing he must do anything he can to survive, he sneaks his way through the crowd and ultimately must sneak around more to continue to stay alive. <br/><br/>The second story follows a father and his two sons as they heed the call to take their private boats across the channel to help the evacuation. Here some hard drama occurs where you might not expect it. Mark Rylance as usual becomes transparent in his role. You can read with his eyes what is going through his head as one truly appreciates the exceptional circumstances that are taking place. <br/><br/>The third story was somewhat featured in the extended trailers that were shown in theatres. Tom Hardy and his cohorts are on a fruitless mission to try and stop the German aerial assault on the retreating soldiers. In the large Imax format, the flying sequences are much more than showing the dogfights that take place. They put the audience in the air, being able to take a bird's point of view as we get the geography of the action scenes.<br/><br/>The editing is something worth noting, as there are jumps forward and back in time as the narrative follows one character's timeline, and then another character's timeline. It all remains coherent by giving the audience key moments from different perspectives, and again keeping the number of characters we follow down to a handful. It also makes for a quick piece of storytelling when the premise is simple enough to get with a few lines of dialogue here and there."

","I hate everything connected to guns, army, war, so consequently I avoid war movies (after this one I'll get aerophobia as well, and I'm not so eager about swimming in the sea any more). Movie doesn't have specific plot or leading characters, but rather tries to convey the atmosphere of this historical event. This is in itself a risky venture, and when you take into account that it is a WWII, Dunkirk had a tremendous chance of, at least for me, being an unwatchable crap. But Nolan pulled this off. With this film Nolan proved that he can pull off whatever he wants. Although there are no characters to bond to and for whose fate I would tremble, camera, directing and sound kept me at the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end. When I sat to watch this I was sure I'll give up latest at half of it, but instead Nolan earned one more devoted fan.<br/><br/>9,9/10<br/><br/>To me, this is one of the best war movies ever. Still, I won't rate it full ten because its end slightly disappointed me. First, why the pilot did not jump out of the plane above ""safe"" part of the beach, letting plane to crash somewhere in distance?! I supposed he thought he could land it safely so he decided to give it a try and save the plane. But once he succeeds he burns the plain and get captured by enemy. WTF?! Second, that diarrhea monologue in the train was completely redundant. In no way does it contribute to the understanding of the film, but dilutes the atmosphere of the film, which up to that point will not let go not for a moment. Dammit Nolan, you pulled off 99% of the movie in same tempo, why did you have to spoil it in last minute?!"

"jonmccann","9","0","1","21 December 2017"," Be realistic!
","Ok, I kinda see both sides of the critics viewpoints from the reviews (numerous and very divided) already posted, so lets get this in a nutshell...If you want to see blood and gore, you won't, so don't watch, if you want to see statistical scenes backing up facts of an historic event, then don't watch as you will spend the movie picking holes, if you want to see a lead character saving the day...Then don't, you won't get that. <br/><br/>What you will get is a historical dramatisation of an actual event that quite probably spearheaded the morale boost that our Country needed to fight through the war. It is simply a tale of overwhelming odds and overcoming them, at great loss and tragedy, but far less because of the heroic actions of those that may not have been fighters, but were saviours. It doesn't pull punches and the attack scenes are quite unnerving, more so from the soundtrack, but yes it does take a few liberties in scenes for cinematic purposes.<br/><br/>Why is this a problem for people, I can only presume we are so obsessed with clumsy CGI titles that give the earth in terms of visual appeal and have a vague story-line on our 4k ultra hd TV sets, that we forget that historic accounts shouldn't need such dramatisation, they are based on fact, not fiction! I think viewers should remind themselves it is based on real events, when watching.<br/><br/>So in terms of the film review, rather than a review of those critics that hate! It's a good representation of the good old British fighting mentality - if you are one of us, then we have your back, come what may, style of film. It is what us British love, the David versus Goliath, back up against the wall theme. And to be honest, it works really well for me, I liked the aspect of three different story-lines/viewpoints merging to give the overall film and I liked the acting on the whole. If I had one gripe, it would be that despite the great visuals (I only watched in full hd and that was amazing!) and quality sound track, I wasn't blown away Oscar winning film style. But that said, I didn't expect to be, I wasn't expecting to watch this and compare it with Band of Brothers, or Saving Private Ryan. As we like to say these days, 'it is what it is!', it is an historical re-enactment of true events for entertainment purposes (entertainment seems a wrong choice of words, but cinematic doesn't seem to work either!). If you use this is your mindset before watching, I think (as long as historical war based films are your thing) you will actually find the film 'entertaining'. If you expect anything I mentioned at the start, then be prepared to be disappointed!"

"imtiazu","10","0","3","20 December 2017"," Nolan's best writing ever
","Dunkirk is the easily one of the best war film ever made. The reason being it does not portray war in conventional way.<br/><br/>Nolan's screenplay is hands down the best to come from his side. The story takes place in three different point of views, which are separated not only in the spectrum of time, but also in space. One might argue there are not many dialogues in the film which hampers character development. But when the film reaches its climax it gets evident that Nolan is trying to show the bigger picture here (also literally, through his IMAX cameras).<br/><br/>Yet the film is not completely devoid of characters, Nolan has very cleverly tried to put the individual human emotions (which his previous films are known for) too. There are very subtle but precise dialogues which carries greater meaning than any full fledged conversations.<br/><br/>It is also a visual treat, thanks to the cinematography (both 35mm and 70mm shots). It presents a unique way of presenting the tension of war, which is very well complemented by the Zimmer's music. Use of Shepard tones is very much evident. It creates the illusion of approaching doom.<br/><br/>At last this film deserves a 10 any day. I think this film will be remembered in future also for its over all way of narrating the story which is obvious (as most of us already know the outcomes of the event well in advance), yet maintaining the thrill and tension of war."

","Dunkirk follows closely certain characters and it plays with flashback. The music accentuate the tension and is interesting but surely not your typical orchestrated symphony. Even if the dialogues are sparse, you feel there is a very good reason for it. The actors are really good and seems all marked by the war in some ways. The film is more about the action then the strategy that went into the actual event and not war movie that focus on the bloody part too much. The planes scenes were my favorite because they show how hard it was to use them. The sky camera angles are spectacular and gives you the impression of being in the plane. I think the flashback between the planes and the boats can be hard to understand at first viewing. When I saw it a second time I was able to better connect the time line. And in a way it made first viewing an exercise of connecting the dots... Otherwise this movie is intense because it doesn't really stop that much. It's nice to see Nolan getting behind an historical event, and see how he presented this. He did it with a certain form and style, with beautiful photography."

","This film was enjoyable to watch for a few reasons. The aerial scenes were quiet enveloping and realistic. The soundtrack will keep you on edge. The acting performances were good enough to convince. The camera work was accomplished. The problems with this film were its lack of graphic realism. Barely a drop of blood can be seen, almost as if a censor had banned the true horrifying visions of war lest it offend or raise the age limit for audiences. Casting a famous boy band member is always a big no no if you expect to be taken artistically serious. It comes across as a gimmicky cameo which just ruins the scenes when that Boy band guy appears. He does an okay job,, but its like putting Madonna on a ship as a nurse,, you look at her acting but think to yourself, oh look Madonna in a world war 2 movie, and this just cuts you out of the movie if you are in anyway engrossed. Christopher Nolan, cop yourself on and stop disrespecting your audience with such cheap gimmicks.

"treddfurious","10","0","4","7 December 2017"," It's not a film, it's an experience (And a misunderstood one)
","I know that I have been a few months behind writing this review (despite the fact that I watched the film a week after release) but I could find very little time to write a review, so here I am, sharing my experience of what seems to be a marvelous but misunderstood spectacle.<br/><br/>Before I start, we all know that war is banal, and war is hell. It's terrifying, much more to those who have never experienced it. That is what Dunkirk succeeds at. As the first scene rolled, I was immediately taken into the battle, and this is became the entire film, and I immediately felt as if I was there. Take other war films like Pearl Harbor or Saving Private Ryan, and take away such as the first 90 minutes of the former and the soap operas of the latter and immediately go to the direct sequences such as D-Day, Battle of the Bulge or the attack of Pearl Harbor itself. This is what Dunkirk is. Just about the evacuation itself. Nolan's direction, the film's incredibly realistic sounds, the beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's score (although it is not melodic as his previous works, but still a triumph) became the storyteller of this 109 minute spectacle. We can clearly see what Nolan is trying to do here, attempting to create suspense through cinematography and music.<br/><br/>The main criticism it seems I have heard from most moviegoers who had seen this film is that there is no story, which is the weakest part of this film. In my honest opinion, this is what strengthens the film, and most moviegoers have lost the point seeing Dunkirk. Do not expect watching Dunkirk as a traditional war film like SPR or Hacksaw Ridge. Dunkirk is all about being in the moment, living and experiencing what its like in the battle, and Nolan gives us three perspectives of the battle itself, from the land, air and sea. All three scenes were never dull and I was completely riveted in every scene. There is little dialogue in the film here and yes, there are no background stories for the characters centered here in the film. Unlike old war films which is only centered around one protagonist or a group of people, Dunkirk itself is trying to center itself on all 300,000 men that were being evacuated on the beach in the battle. There is no time for heroics here. Dunkirk manages to portray war for what it really is, and from every scene such as the dogfights and where the soldiers were in danger of the next German plane, you will begin to ask yourself if whether these men are really going to make it out of there alive, because people die in war regardless and there are no heroes in real war. Do not bother trying to find a 100% historical accurate film here, for much of it's generally realistic portrayal of evacuation, there are still some historical inaccuracies to be found here. But Nolan wasn't trying to tell the history of this battle, this is still a film. We have to follow the centered characters in each shot and follow what the horrors of war have done to them, even when they weren't fighting any German soldiers. Borrowing elements from films like Alien & Jaws, German soldiers in here were never seen except until the end only as silhouettes. Nolan's idea of making them as an anonymous force works well here. By showing less, they were trying to tell more.<br/><br/>I have never been immersed in cinema before until I watched Dunkirk. Throughout the entire film, I have never felt more scared and horrified what war really is until I seen Dunkirk. Christopher Nolan understands what film was made for, to truly show you how it feels to be there rather than attempting to tell a story. There is no blood and gore here, there are no limbs flying around like Saving Private Ryan succeeded at doing. But Nolan gives enough action here to show you how terrifying and horrific war can still be even if said things didn't happen. War films like Saving Private Ryan are about a group of people reacting to war. Dunkirk itself is ONLY about war, and how horrific, terrifying and it can traumatize you when you are absolutely stuck in the middle of it. <br/><br/>Dunkirk in my honest opinion, is Nolan's best-work since the Dark Knight, and could be even better. Nolan has reinvented the war genre to something different here with his approach. Dunkirk sits above with Saving Private Ryan as one of the greatest war films ever made. Hans Zimmer's score here is his probably his best work with Nolan. Before watching this film, don't expect Dunkirk to be a traditional war film, because it is not. Dunkirk by far is not a film, but an experience.<br/><br/>By treddfurious: Dunkirk gets a deserving A+, and one of 2017's best picture by far."
"mukherjeesubham93","8","0","3","6 December 2017"," A Technical Masterpiece which just falls a tad short of being a classic
","Dunkirk is not easy to watch. It's dark, relentless, & demanding to watch. So that sets it apart from other Nolan movies at the very start. Prestige, Inception, Memento, Interstellar are movies which people keep going back to. However, Dunkirk never intends to be like these movies. Not for a single moment. It's an experience. Once in a lifetime is enough. Nolan's screenplay shows the evacuation in three tracks set in different but close time lines, which come together at the end. There are many characters. Perhaps, more than we would have liked. A plethora of prolific performers, including a unexpectedly good Harry Styles perform their small but significant roles. Dunkirk is a technical masterpiece. Authentic props coupled with excellent cinematography and a ticking time bomb like explosive score by Hans Zimmer are the strongest points of the movie. Given the dearth of dialogues in the movie, these things together create a symphony of sorts which seems to possess a language of its own. As I said, it's a experience which shouldn't be missed. That being said, I can't say I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Given its technical brilliance, it's a must watch. But however, the fact that Nolan doesn't make us sympathize with any one single character, hampers the viewing experience a bit. The emphasis here is on the event itself, and not on who were in it. You will feel the fear, the claustrophobia, but however you will never feel bad for the characters on screen. It sounds strange. But it is what it is. Overall, Dunkirk may not end up being a Nolan fan-favorite, but that doesn't undermine this technically brilliant movie. But surely adds another feather to the much celebrated filmmaker's cap. At least he dares to do dream big. Awaiting his next!"

","Nolan is back, after a hiatus of 3 years from the silver screen. His last work Interstellar has left us desiring for more spectacular fiction, but he chooses to pick a historical event, maybe to experiment or to test his potential of portraying human stories.<br/><br/>The film is based on the small town in northern France, staged in May 1940 when Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. The story is of the struggle faced by English troops during the evacuation of more than 400,000 soldiers; presented across 3 dimensions - land, air and water; under 3 timelines - a week, a day and an hour.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>The movie starts with land, conveying the dire status of troops stranded on a beach with amazing use of visuals, ranging from notices flying around in a street, a vast beach full of army personnel queuing up for a boat back home, a soldier stealing boots of a dead peer and streetsmart cadres scouting for surviving wounded to carry across in a stretcher, which would get them priority access into the barge. All these with the ever reliable crescendo by Mr. Zimmer. Hounded by German bombers, shooters outside perimeter wall and even torpedoes from U boats, the infantry does its best to survive and run, with the help of navy.<br/><br/>The scene shifts to water where citizens across the kingdom are called for assisting in evacuation, and we get to stick with the able Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), his kid and his friend in a pleasure boat, as they journey across the English Channel pulling in survivors from boatwrecks and air crashes while shouting words of encouragement for the spitfires of the Royal Air Force booming above them.<br/><br/>The third parallel dimension of air features Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden in their spit fires picking up dog fights with German fighters, while keeping a watch on fuel guage. We get to see ample views from Hardy's cockpit where he adopts multiple manuouvers to shoot down the bombers.<br/><br/>Although very much predictive, the movie aces in its visuals, the scenes shot in a combination of 15/70mm IMAX film and Super Panavision 65mm film ideal for viewing in IMAX screens, along with the music and real life settings with minimal visual effects, leaves an impression of being in the beach, on the boat and within the Spitfire. The film achieves its fulfilment with the climax scenes where Tommy (Fionn) reads the newspaper headlines after returning home which exalts the humanitarian success of the evacuation while a resident British knocks on the window passing 2 bottles of ale cheering the young army personnel who managed to only 'survive'. <br/><br/>Where it lacks in female characters (understandable considering the war setting), repetitive sequences (like the dog fight and bombings) and story suspense, the director makes up with relatable real life characters, dramatic and horrific situations (like being trapped inside a steel ship when it's sinking) and the back and forth timelines which hold you from blinking.<br/><br/>Recommend this movie to all lovers of the medium of Cinema, who would love to watch a movie where multitude of human emotions are addressed in a true story celebrating human grit and survival spirit. Although this isn't the best of Nolan, it's worthy of being watched at least twice in theatres."

","We have seen directors changing the movie genre from one movie to another. Christopher Nolan's earlier movies (Memento, Prestige, Batman Series, Interstellar) was different from each other but then everything had a common factor - Imagination. The director's imagination to portray a story with believable screenplay was primarily the common factor in his previous ventures.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is entirely a different approach by the director. Being a movie based on the real happenings during the WWII, there is not much to think or understand - compared to his other creations!!! The entire movie is based on only two elements - Visual & Sound!!!<br/><br/>I guess the director's vision of conveying the story was through these two mediums alone. The entire movie is taken based on 3 perspectives - Air, Land & Sea. You will have to be very patient throughout the movie since most of the time, the director has preferred to convey the emotions through music and fantastic visuals covering the land mass, air space and sea!!!<br/><br/>There is no-one to be described as a protagonist or an antagonist in the movie. You may recognize few actors (Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy) and no Nolan movie is complete without Michael Caine (Plays a cameo - actually the voice alone is heard).<br/><br/>The crux of the movie is about survival, how the soldiers endured their time and survived before being rescued. The best segment of the movie, according to me, is the portion where few soldiers take cover in a boat which will float into the sea when the tide sets in. The entire segment is beautifully pictured and shows the emotions of various people at the same time.<br/><br/>It took sometime to come to terms in understanding the movie - not the story - but the time-lines of different perspective that is being shown in a non linear narrative. The most intriguing factor is that the entire movie has very few lines of dialogue but you will not be noticing it until you finish watching the movie. The background music by Hans Zimmer should be given great accolades as the music itself portrays a character in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Dunkirk - Less talk - More Work"

"PeRsOnnnnnnnnNnnnnnnnnnnn","8","0","4","17 October 2017"," Dunkirk?
","Dunkirk is a 2017 war film written, co-produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan that portrays the Dunkirk evacuation of World War II. Taking place on the beaches of Dunkirk in 1940, trapped Allied troops await evacuation in a seemingly hopeless situation. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops slowly and methodically left the beach using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, Belgian and Dutch soldiers safely returned home. While Dunkirk, as a whole, is a splendidly shot and produced movie, it can be confusing for audience members that are not as knowledgeable about the World Wars. <br/><br/>From the very first scene, the audience is immersed in the war zone and senses the imminent danger the soldiers felt at the time. While watching the battleships sink and listening to the generals discussing their predicament as the perimeter shrinks, the audience feels and fears for the soldiers who can only wait on the beach and hope. While this war films lacks a lot of scenes that many war films typically have, for example, conversations about the character or their families, in a situation where soldiers do not have the opportunity to relax, these missing scenes add to the authenticity of a battle during war. Furthermore, from the use of actual battleships to the way the planes are shot out of the sky, the film closely portrays actual war events. Mr. Dawson, played by Mark Rylance, a Tony and Academy Award winning actor, even stated that he piloted his character's boat every day and listened to audio recordings at the Imperial War Museum to be true to the events and ""deepen characterization."" Throughout the film, the audience also does not see a lot of blood and carnage as opposed to the psychological impacts fighting and surviving has on the soldiers. Fionn Whitehead, as Tommy, and Cillian Murphy, as the Shivering Soldier, portrayed the psychological damages of the war particularly well. Overall, by presenting a very different take on a war film, Dunkirk captures the audience's attention and tells the story both simply and authentically. <br/><br/>In addition to authenticity, Nolan utilized an unique way to present the story by showing three different perspective with overlapping time periods: one week on land, one day at sea, and one hour in the air, to create a non-linear narrative. The obvious benefits of such a technique were the breathtaking shots at sea and of the action. This, in addition to the various camera angles, took cinematography to a completely different level, at least aesthetically. Furthermore, the soundtrack added a lot to the suspense and emotions in each and every scene. For instance, just when death seems inevitable back at the beach, the fleet of civilian ships arrive at Dunkirk, bringing the generals too tears. The almost patriotic and jubilant music brings tears of joy to the eyes of the audience as they realize that there is still hope for them to return home. Or when George was praised as a hero in the local newspaper, the audience feels glad that his dying wish was granted. From the plot to the techniques, Dunkirk was well directed and produced. <br/><br/>While Dunkirk was an extraordinary film, the attention put on presenting something new was distracting from the great aspects of the story. The various perspectives and overlapping time period was indeed interesting, however, it was confusing. It made learning about the characters and their significance a lot harder to locate. In addition, realizing that the three perspectives were not taking place at the same time made following the story line harder. Moreover, many scenes were repeated and instead, shown from a different perspective, ruining the suspense. The greatest drawback of this technique is the fact that the audience doesn't have enough time nor information to recognize and understand each important characters. Partly due to the lack of dialogue, not very many names were mentioned and repeated, therefore it is extremely likely for the audience to sit through the entire movie not knowing the name of the character they are watching and therefore, not connecting with that character in each scenario. <br/><br/>While this movie can be a bit confusing and seem implausible to some at times, the cinematography is outstanding and film is an interesting and enjoyable way to be more familiar with the World Wars, especially the evacuation at Dunkirk. Furthermore, the actors, directors, and composers all did extraordinary jobs making this piece come to life. Overall, I definitely recommend this film for audience members that love war films because it is both authentic and a great story. For the general public, I still recommend this movie for the cinematography and history, however I highly suggest that they read a brief summary online so that they may better follow and understand the plot."
"ChrisLStanton","10","0","4","13 October 2017"," Immensely Immersive - need to be watch in IMAX
","Dunkirk is the story of the evacuation of Allied troops from the beaches of... well... Dunkirk, France... from the oncoming German advance during the beginnings of the 2nd World War. Unusual as a film as it follows a story between three different settings, in this case, the bottom line is line, sea and air, between a pilot, soldier and crew of a pleasure boat. Shuffling between the three different environments can be confusing if you don't know the back story or in this case, the history. There's is little to no character development, no back stories, and lucky if you catch a name. Compounded with little dialogue and chronological but mismatching time lines and for a war film, never seeing the enemy close up. So, got the makings of a confusing film? You betcha. And as usual with Nolan films, he will assume the audience can work it out.<br/><br/>So why is it any good? Because it's filmed on IMAX? Even close ups? Makes it gorgeous? Huh?? So what!! No, it's good because it portrays what it wants and it does without the need cf complex characters and back stories. It's a story about people, and their struggles to get off the beaches from an oncoming enemy. The despair, the fear, the despondency, the exhaustion, the madness, the sacrifice of being caught up in a situation like that. And Nolan knew, the only way to catch that is no green screen technology. Real locations, real explosions, real planes. No chaff, no fluff, even strapping a huge IMAX camera to the side of plane for the cockpit shots. All the struggles coming into a climax on the beaches of Dunkirk.<br/><br/>It doesn't have a moral message, just the relief for those who did make it off the beach and pity for those who didn't.<br/><br/>Very fresh, very new way of story telling, and it works. Uninterrupted suspense all the way through. 10 out of 10."

","This movie is truly one of a kind. I would lie if I said I didn't have some concerns due to some members of the cast, but those were quickly thrown away once these ones proved to be good actors (not brilliant, but still). This movie, tho, deserves the 10 stars I gave it due to the way the whole experience lived and felt by the Dunkirk's soldiers was captured. Every single camera angle, speed and close up makes you feel like you're experiencing the same feelings and, even if sometimes it can feel like you need to get some air, you get sucked in again in the movie. It's not a movie that follows a strict story line, but it shows you how different and ordinary people, heroes to us, lived that event. The soundtrack as well, as subtle as it can be, shakes your emotions. I am not joking when I say that when I got out of the cinema I felt like I had to sit down and get some air otherwise my legs wouldn't keep me up.

"poewilson","8","0","7","4 October 2017"," Silent Era War Film that relies on sound
","The P.H. Metric 82/100<br/><br/>Directing: 9/10<br/><br/>The directing takes a hit, not because of Nolan's efforts, but because of the script supervisor who I place in the directing section. Within the opening bombing of the film, (aside from PG-13ing something that should have been utterly horrific) the beach that was just blasted with several bombs does not seem to have taken a strike in any form. The men laying on the ground have no blasts sites near them or anything of that nature and this same issue reappears through out the film.<br/><br/>As for Nolan from the moment we hit the beach and you see that shot taken of those two wooden pillars you can feel the influence of silent era films, which gives Dunkirk a completely different delivery to 99% of the other war films out there.<br/><br/>Acting: 6/10<br/><br/>Due to the film be shot in the vein of a silent film the acting did not need to be perfect and the sheer lack of dialogue presented Nolan with the chance to cast near unknowns which added to the depth of the film and the soldiers naivete, however what little acting was on display did not amount to any grand gesture of the art, but instead more akin to Bicycle Thieves.<br/><br/>Cinematography: 9/10<br/><br/>Superb, not Lubezeki great, but excellent none the less (also I should divulge I am a huge Cinematography nerd) I have been a fan of Hoytema's work since Låt den rätte komma in and he continues to impress with some of his most exquisite work to date.<br/><br/>Editing 9/10<br/><br/>Superb, couple of shots that did not quite gel as well as they should but ultimately the editing is on point and delivers action in just the right manner.<br/><br/>Score: 10/10<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's score is pulse pounding and on point in every frame of the film, from start to finish it will leave you a sense dread that the film itself never truly captilaises on, but that is in no way the fault of Zimmer. Nolan's use of the Shepard tone was brilliant and really gives life to the piece.<br/><br/>Visual Effects: 9/10<br/><br/>Are stunning and capture the world perfectly, but this like many of Nolan's other films are due to his love of practical effects and I tend to agree if they are done correctly, you get a better quality image that does not age near as horribly.<br/><br/>Writing: 5/10<br/><br/>The film takes a heavy hit in terms of the writing, what with the script running a lean 76 pages. I can appreciate the improvised nature Nolan was trying to create, as war is chaos and there are no heroes spewing golden lines of perfection, however the lines that were on display were unrelentingly movie-esque to the point that the sense of realism that he was trying to portray with the improvisation gets washed away in a sea tropes.<br/><br/>Production Design 8/10<br/><br/>Again only for the pedantic but there are host of anachronisms that plague the film and several shots with buildings that should not be there, that really feel like production design and costume design issues.<br/><br/>Costume Design 8/10<br/><br/>Again only for the pedantic but there are host of anachronisms that plague the film and several shots with buildings that should not be there, that really feel like production design and costume design issues.<br/><br/>Make-up/Hairstyle 9/10<br/><br/>Make-up had an easy run on this film when compared to many modern war films, but for what they did contribute they did a great job.

"DrWICClark","9","0","6","1 October 2017"," Excellent but flawed
","In capturing the despair of Dunkirk this film does a good job. That it showed the vulnerability of the ships to attack, it was excellent, and the horrifying scenes inside sinking ships was outstanding. The sense of hope when the small boats arrived was deeply moving, especial to the strains of Elgar's Enigma variation, Nimrod.<br/><br/>This representation is, though, flawed. The beaches were littered with destroyed vehicles and guns; the tidy holiday beach in the film did not exist. The causalities on the beach were few because the sand reduced the impact of the bombs. The real disasters took place on the boats.<br/><br/>But I had a patient who was captured at Dunkirk. His story of survival was documented in a diary, although it was mostly concerned with a forced march back from the POW camp in Poland where he spent five years down a coal mine, completely in breach of the Geneva convention. On every day, if there was nothing else entered, he entered ""Three cigarettes"" or whatever. Did you see a single cigarette in the film? I know political correctness reigns, but almost every single soldier would had had a half smoked fag in his mouth. The streets of Dunkirk in the opening scene were far too tidy, and there is no allusion to the breakdown in discipline with soldiers looting. This depended on the battalion, some maintaining strict discipline but over all it came close to anarchy. <br/><br/>But my main concern is that there is no humour in the film. If anything is true of the British soldier, it is poking fun at a situation, however desperate. The jokes got blacker and blacker the worse the situation, but jokes there were. <br/><br/>My patient died from his terrible lung condition resulting from his capture and enforced labour down the coal mine, but at a good age. He was one of the most positive men I met."
"spencergrande6","8","0","6","28 September 2017"," Stunning majesty
","This is a hard movie to love, at least at first. I appreciate what Nolan did with the overlapping story lines and the nonlinear storytelling, revealing time and perspective to be all-together subjective. I'm just not sure it always works from a pure storytelling point of view. What is achieved is non-stop intensity, but at the expense of character, story and a bigger picture. The chaos of war has never been clearer but at what cost.<br/><br/>I found myself appreciating the ways in which each storyline overlapped and how that changed the perspective of the whole thing more than I did actually watching the film. Maybe it's something that will be rectified with time and more reflection. And this isn't to say the movie doesn't work, because it does and it never stops compelling and drawing in your interest, your mind, and your emotions.<br/><br/>Not up for debate however is the stunning majesty of this film. 70mm Imax at the Grand Canyon two days in a row and it was a visual feast like I've almost never experience before. The trailers leading up to the film looked good and all but then suddenly it was like someone opened a six story window into another world - it was that clear and that dramatic the increase in quality of the picture. Picture quality isn't supposed to get better when it gets bigger, especially this big, and yet there I was experiencing it. Let's hope we don't ever lose this."

","Dunkirk had me on the edge of my seat from the first 30 seconds until the last. All 3 times I've been to see it. <br/><br/>Considering Nolan had done nothing like this previously, for me it just pushed him another step closer to being thought of in the same way as Kubrick etc. as one of the best directors of all time. (I've thought this since The Dark Knight, but I will admit to having a bit of a Nolan-boner)<br/><br/>The 4 main characters of Dunkirk interweave in a story line which definitely took some influence from the time differentials in Inception.<br/><br/>Newbie Fionn Whitehead's Army Private, Tom Hardy's Spitfire Pilot, Mark Rylance's mariner and Kenneth Branagh's Naval Commander give as individual performances as their characters perspectives.<br/><br/>Particularly poignant moments of credit to Mark Rylance's brief break in character, Tom Hardy's decision to help is countrymen over making it home but definitely Branagh's moment of pride seeing the boats appear in the harbour wins for me.<br/><br/>Added special notice has to be given to Hans Zimmer for his brilliant use of Elgar's ""Nimrod"" to compound the moments of pride which we should all feel (if you're English) watching Dunkirk. <br/><br/>This is film making at it's best, quite simply a must see."

","A good movie tells you something you don't know and inspires you to think in a different way. This movie is absolutely a good one. It reveals the other side of wars. <br/><br/>I am impressed by how Christopher Nolan once again present us so many characters while each so differently and so vividly . Patriots sail spontaneously to rescue trapped soldiers; desperate soldiers live like animals and their only goal is to live even at the cost of deaths of their buddies; pilots have sense of honor and duty, fighting till the last drop of fuel. <br/><br/>That's all human nature. Everyone can be any of them given the same experience. Remember how proud one was chosen to be pilot those days and how good education and training they took, and you won't be surprised how they fought in the war. If you live at a time that your hometown will be taken by enemies at any time, you will also do whatever you can to win the war without a hesitate.

","Dunkirk is undoubtedly one of the best films that has so far been released in 2017. I would not go that far to call it one of the greatest war films ever made, as it is yet to stand the test of time, but it definitely is one of the finest made in the 21st century.<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is regarded as one of the most gifted film directors of our time. His greatness lies not just in his own great directorial skills, but also in his ability to pick the right collaborators. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and editor Lee Smith did an amazing job and made this film visually stunning. And what is left to be said about Hans Zimmer? This incredible composer is probably on the way of receiving another Academy Award.<br/><br/>Dunkirk portrays the evacuation of British soldiers from Dunkirk in France during the World War II. It tells the story from three perspectives - the land, the sea and the air - , in a circular fashion that actually creates a unity between three story lines. The actions, the camera work and especially the music compensate perfectly for the lack of proper dialogue, which proves that sometimes you do not need real words to tell a good story.<br/><br/>I have read complaints that Dunkirk has no relatable characters, given that we never learn their backgrounds, but I think that that actually suits the message of the film. For the 'great leaders', who decide on people's fates from their offices, those poor soldiers are just a number they will use in their political games. All those young men are nameless to them. Another powerful message presented in the film is that there is no greatness in war, no glory, no heroism. Survival is all that matters.<br/><br/>The actors all do their roles justice, but some of them I must mention separately, by name, those being Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy. Branagh gives a very touching performance as Commander Bolton, one of those that can make you cry, although they are very subtle. On the other side, you have yet again wonderful Mark Rylance as Mr Dawson, whose stamina and calmness make you believe everything will eventually turn out all right. Cillian Murphy embodies perfectly the fates of so many men that went to war and come back home with severe psychical consequences. I also must mention Harry Styles, who did his job more than decently.<br/><br/>Dunkirk is a striking piece of cinema art. It is a war film with an anti-war message, a definitive must-see at these times of troubles, when the world is on the brink of another world war. If only we could get the politicians to see it and learn a few things from it..."
"JamesHitchcock","9","0","7","5 September 2017"," Nolan Succeeds Where Spielberg Failed
","Films about the Second World War were a mainstay of the cinema in both Britain and America, not only during the war itself but also throughout the fifties and sixties. The genre started to decline after about 1970, and even more so after 1980, but there have nevertheless been periodic attempts since that date to revive it, using modern film-making techniques. These include David Puttnam's ""Memphis Belle"", Mallick's ""The Thin Red Line"", ""Enemy at the Gates"" (which had the unusual feature, for a Western film, of being told from a Russian perspective) and, perhaps most famously, Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" is the most recent attempt to revive this tradition. The events of the Dunkirk evacuation are too well-known for me to need to set them out here. The film has a complex structure, involving a non-linear narrative and three interwoven story lines taking place in three different time periods: one week on land, one day at sea, and one hour in the air. The ""land"" storyline, ""The Mole"", focuses on some of the British and French servicemen anxiously waiting on the beaches for rescue. The ""sea"" storyline tells the story of one of the many ""little boats"" which took part in that rescue. The ""air"" storyline deals with three Spitfire pilots flying to Dunkirk to provide air cover for the rescuers. Christopher Nolan, who both wrote the script and acted as director, deliberately excluded Churchill and Britain's other political and military leaders from his story, as he wanted his film to concentrate on the human side of war, not its political or strategic aspects.<br/><br/>Unlike something like ""Saving Private Ryan"", where the action was dominated by its big-name star, Tom Hanks, ""Dunkirk"" (perhaps inevitably given its division into three stories, each of which is given equal weight) is an example of ensemble acting with no one single star role. The cast, however, includes both well-known names, such as Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy, and younger newcomers such as Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Barry Keoghan and Aneurin Barnard. The use of pop star Harry Styles in a prominent part was criticised by some as an example of ""celebrity casting"", but in fact Styles won the role by going through the normal audition process; Nolan was quite unaware of his fame as a singer. I won't single out any of the cast for special praise, as so many of them were excellent in their roles.<br/><br/>I will, however, point to something I have noticed about Branagh, namely that his gifts as an actor are equalled by a gift for choosing the right films to appear in, a gift which some otherwise talented stars seem to lack. Dismissing the dreadful ""Wild Wild West"" as an aberration, just about every movie I have seen him in has been of high, and in many cases of the highest, quality.<br/><br/>""Dunkirk"" is another example of Branagh's ability to pick only the best, because it is a truly excellent film. Despite the complexity of its narrative structure, it remains perfectly comprehensible and easy to follow. It presents us with a number of well-defined characters with whom we can both identify and sympathise- Branagh's naval Commander overseeing the evacuation, Whitehead's Tommy and Styles's Alex, both young British soldiers, Keoghan's George, a teenaged lad who, on impulse, jumps aboard a friend's boat heading for the Dunkirk beaches, Rylance's Mr Dawson, the owner of that boat, Cillian Murphy's shell-shocked soldier and Hardy's Spitfire pilot.<br/><br/>The fine musical score was provided by the prolific film composer Hans Zimmer; the use of a German composer to score a British war film (in which no Germans actually appear) may have been a deliberate gesture of reconciliation. Zimmer's use of the ""Nimrod"" variation from Edward Elgar's ""Enigma Variations"" may also have been symbolic; he would doubtless have been aware that, although ""Nimrod"" has today become something of an icon of British patriotism, Elgar wrote it as a tribute to a German friend, August Jaeger.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are very well done; one scene of the men waiting on the beaches may have been a deliberate allusion to the famous panning shot in Joe Wright's ""Atonement"", a film which also deals, among other things, with the Dunkirk evacuation. They may not quite have the gut-wrenching intensity of the opening sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan"", but I would nevertheless greatly prefer ""Dunkirk"" to Spielberg's picture. Spielberg creates some great individual scenes, but too often allows our interest to flag and, overall, his film is far too long. ""Dunkirk"", by contrast, holds our attention from start to finish, both as a picture of war and as a study of the men caught up in it. Nolan has succeeded in achieving the goal which eluded Spielberg, that of creating the great modern war film. 9/10"

","If you walk into this movie, you most likely know the of Christopher Nolan's previous filmography, and Dunkirk is something completely new for him, and unsurprisingly, he kills it. Dunkirk is a war movie that is unlike any other war movie. It's main focus is shifted from one central character or narrative, and instead, immerses you into one event (Operation Dynamo), from three separate viewpoints. The chronology is a little jumbled due to these facts, but following the story does not suffer from this choice either. Nolan creates these scenes using the actual beach of Dunkirk, and actual WWII aircraft's and boats. The atmosphere of war Nolan re-creates may be the most spectacular to date. From the props to the environment and the very very loud sounds of the engines and guns does an incredible job of taking you into the shoes of the soldiers at Dunkirk. Although this film is unconventional for Nolan, this film will no doubt go down as a masterpiece in the war genre."

It simply did not captivate me as much as his previous work, which I have given a nine and ten ratings to. My main issue was the lack of a main character, the formula of jumping across different people was interesting, but we are only getting glimpses of each person's experience, none of them are fully developed. I think it would have worked to the screenplays advantage to have had one character who is given a complete scope that we can walk away satisfied with, leaving it more acceptable for us to only catch certain heartache from others. <br/><br/>The cast is absolutely phenomenal, which is no surprise for a Nolan film. Each and every cast member fits in to their respective roles effortlessly, with the likes of Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy being part of an ensemble crew that bring this whole story together nicely, there is not a single lackluster story here as a result. <br/><br/>Filled with pure entertaining intensity. Action packed and well acted, Dunkirk is Nolan's weakest film to date, in my eyes, but this groundbreaking director still delivers stunning work that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or war movie. <br/><br/>The announcement of World War II causes great heartache for a group of soldiers, as well as civilians, in a quiet village called Dunkirk. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Fionn Whitehead"

","I guess when it comes to Nolan or anyone we really appreciate, we may have a different standard we hold them accountable to. So maybe I am being a bit unfair, while I was trying to figure out if I'd give it a 9 or an 8, deciding to go with an 8 in the end. Minor details I know, but I want to get into, why I only gave it an 8.<br/><br/>Let's take the positive: Try to watch it as big as possible (no size matters jokes here please, still this was shot to be seen as huge as possible)! The framing, the quality of the pictures is amazing to say the least. And even critics of Nolans work admit that he know how to frame his movies. Furthermore the audio and sound design in general is on a top level. No doubt it will be nominated for the Academy Award. I actually right now would even say is a strong contender for winning at least one of the sound ""awards"".<br/><br/>So technically speaking this is on a top level. It also has a story that will leave many in disbelief, but this really happened (haven't looked at details, but I reckon we just watch the overall picture - no pun intended). Now why not a higher rating? The fact that it defies certain narratives and goes a bit of a different route is nice to see. What it does have is a repetition in scenes. Which kind of defies certain highlights ... and is sort of a shame ... so maybe I am too harsh on it and maybe I should applaud it for not being too personal about certain things, even though we have tent-pols of certain characters, that we get back to amidst all the chaos ... a very well choreographed and shot chaos that is ..."

As one of the weaker Nolan films I have viewed, Dunkirk strips humanity from each of the soldiers battling for their lives against the ominous and overbearing forces of NAZI Germany. <br/><br/>The whimsicality of any Nolan film captivates most viewers as he challenges their intelligence, and Dunkirk delivers in this department. The film opens with youthful British soldier (Fionn Whitehead) evading German gunfire to eventually arrive at the jaw-dropping beach of Dunkirk to join more than 400,000 other evacuating British and Allied soldiers. Including this soldier's journey, the film follows three distinct and overlapping chronicles- a fighter pilot (Tom Hardy) who remains airborne for the entirety of the movie; and an older man (Mark Rylance) and two boys' journey to Dunkirk to provide transportation less likely to be attacked, <br/><br/>Intent aside, characterization was rather nonexistent in this film, other than for a few brief moments, such when the nationality of a character is revealed and inspires prejudice from other characters in the setting or young boys accompany one's father on a private yacht to rescue entrapped soldiers. The choice to omit much emotional dialogue helps Nolan's cause to present these human lives as disposable to the commanding forces, but the decision also creates a detachment from the viewer who is less concerned when a character is in peril. On the contrary, a NAZI soldier is never seen or given dialogue, which establishes true horror in painting a force only capable of violence. <br/><br/>Visual and sound effects dominate the film's appeal. Never before have I been so entranced by war story. The NAZI attacks are riveting and unexpected. The stark visuals of hundreds of thousands of soldiers hitting the beach sand at once are powerful, and as each bomb falls from the sky, the viewer is on the edge of their seat as we experience where they land. <br/><br/>Though the film was strong, I claimed it was weak for Nolan due to the all-out astonishment that some of his other works have left me begging for more. I likely will not watch Dunkirk again, but the film's context provides leaves it as a well-made, historical drama worth checking out."

"mt-95256","9","0","8","14 August 2017"," A hauntingly beautiful film that succeeds on every level. A classic in the making and one of the best war films made
","Christopher Nolan is a big name in cinema today. A master known for bringing a sincerity to excitement; a man known for amazing and successful films; and a director known for long runtimes. Dunkirk is not a long film however. In fact it's Nolan's shortest film for some time with a runtime of just 106 minutes. However, this isn't something to be worried about; there's still plenty crammed into these 106 minutes with little to no padding. Every minute is absolutely worth it and they all add up to a modern masterpiece of war films.<br/><br/>Set in 1940, allied soldiers from France and the UK are being pushed back to the beach of Dunkirk, where they wait patiently by the sea, hoping desperately to be rescued before the Germans catch up to them. Set around this we follow three distinct stories that converge together as the film goes on. We open with Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), a British soldier, stuck at the beach for a week, desperate to survive no matter the cost. Secondly we have Mr Dawson (Mark Rylance), daring British yachter, who sets off to Dunkirk in his yacht, accompanied by Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and George (Barry Keoghan), keen to save the soldiers stuck across the channel, lasting a day. Finally there are RAF pilots Collins (Jack Lowden) and Farrier (Tom Hardy), protecting the soldiers and ships from the skies against the unrelenting attacks of the German planes.<br/><br/>In many ways, Dunkirk isn't so much a war film as it is a horror film – perhaps they are both equal parts horror and war films (though a more unconventional horror film maybe). While not nearly as gory as many contemporary war films, from Saving Private Ryan to Hacksaw Ridge, the violence here is no less horrific, proving that blood and guts aren't necessary for the horror of war to have an impact. The scenes of war aren't trivialised; there's no violence for violence's sake. In fact as an audience, we almost rather there were no violence; you find yourself biting your nails, screaming in your head for them to run away rather than turn and fight – quite the opposite to your normal summer blockbuster. A lot of this is achieved through the sound. From Hans Zimmer's haunting score (he's on top of his game on this one, though the lack of a noticeable theme tune is a shame) to the scream of the German planes and the thud of the bullets and bombs as they find their unfortunate targets. These sounds are done so well; so loud and vivid, they're terrifying to hear and really strengthens the scenes of war you see on screen.<br/><br/>This does however result in the portrayal of Germans as being a faceless enemy, devoid of any humanity. Although this is realistic in how the soldiers would have viewed the Germans, bolstering the immersion, it means that this film lacks that touch of humanity seen in an enemy which is often a really powerful element in war films (particularly in films such as All Quiet on the Western Front). In fact human touch in general is arguably the only main flaw of the film, with characterisation very muted and subtle. In there being no padding and immersing us in the horrors of Dunkirk, there's very little time for us to get to know the characters and let them grow. This isn't to say the characters are boring and we don't care about them (quite the opposite), but there's no memorable character to emerge from this – with the possible exception of Rylance's Mr Dawson. Despite this the actors do very well with the very few lines they're given. Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden have great chemistry even from different planes as brave fighter pilots. Cillian Murphy in particular stands out as the shellshock soldier you could almost hate at some point, if it weren't for Murphy's terrifically complex performance squeezing sympathy from you. A strong opening film for newcomer Fionn Whitehead with an equally good performance from Harry Styles. Rest assured he's not the disaster many feared. Leagues above singers-turned-actors like Beyonce and Rihanna, he can sit up at the top with the likes of David Bowie and Ed Sheeran (yes, I actually liked his cameo in Game of Thrones). British acting royalty Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton and Mark Rylance predictably are the acting highlights, bringing the patriotism in spades and much needed strong screen presences.<br/><br/>However the reason lots of lines and exposition isn't necessary is simply because Christopher Nolan is an expert filmmaker, realising that the true power of cinema is to show, not tell. This is a visual medium and is always at its strongest when it can show the story better than it can tell it. Again working with his same director of photography from Interstellar, Nolan lets Hoyte Van Hoytema to perfectly capture the horrors of Dunkirk. A single, well-crafted, beautiful but terrifying shot can say more than 106 minutes of pure dialogue ever could; and nearly every shot has that kind of power. This is a quasi-masterclass in cinematography, showing the true power and versatility of film's ability to portray story and emotion simultaneously.<br/><br/>A hauntingly beautiful film that succeeds on nearly every level. What it lacks in lines and characterisation, it makes up for in nuanced performances and plenty of emotion, the horror and realistic portrayal of war coming from the expertly crafted shots and excellently edited sound. Miles away from your typical summer blockbuster, Nolan's Dunkirk is a roller-coaster of fear, noise, war and emotion – already bound to be a classic."

"classicalsteve","10","0","11","13 August 2017"," The Innovation of Nolan Creates the Best War Film Since ""Saving Private Ryan""
","The Director of ""The Prestige"" has made a war film which may be unlike any war film to date. From the beginnings of filmmaking about the Second World War from the late 1940's, most stories were very linear from circa 1946 to 1970. The characters were established, we knew the bad guys and the good guys, and we followed the good guys through a series of wartime events. Even if the narrative was devastating in certain scenes, audiences could more or less follow along and know that somehow things would turn out all right for the characters. Often the Germans were painted as being not quite as intelligent as those among the Allies. Beginning in the 1970's and into the 1980's, war films became less idealized, less heroic and more gritty with offerings such as ""Patton"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Platoon"", and ""Saving Private Ryan"". On the shoulders of Stanley Kubrick, Oliver Stone, and Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan has taken the genre even further away from the linear story to new depths, painting a picture which is not only more gritty but much less predictable. War is not linear at all, and no one knows how everything will turn out. The twists and turns of war make for a ""bloody mess indeed"", to quote Ivor Gurney from his poem about the First World War ""The Target"". And on a personal note, this is the first time I've ever seen a film with Academy Award potential starring an actor with my last name! <br/><br/>A bit of background is necessary, which is the only piece missing from Nolan's otherwise nearly perfect film. Dunkirk was one of the most devastating episodes for the Allies during the Second World War prior to the United States' involvement. How events unfolded at Dunkirk would be one of the most compelling reasons for the US to enter the war. Dunkirk concerns the lost cause of France's War with Germany. Thousands of allied troops were cut off from the main armies at Dunkirk, a port town in the northern middle tip of France close to the border with the Netherlands. The Germans were closing in on this region, and the allied troops were stranded on the coast of the English Channel, essentially sitting ducks. They were in desperate need to evacuate otherwise thousands of troops would be either slaughtered or captured. No ships were being brought in to save the desperate soldiers. While ground troops were holding off the German foot soldiers inland, German aircraft were bombing the soldiers from above.<br/><br/>The film explores three points of view. A British private, aptly named ""Tommy"" (Fionn Whitehead), who we see at first sprinting through the town of Dunkirk avoiding enemy fire. He eventually comes to the beaches where the rest of the Dunkirk soldiers are stranded. We meet Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney), a young civilian and son of an older gentleman Mr Dawson (Mark Rylance) who owns a small yacht. We see them launching from the shores of Britain. And the last is Officer Collins (Jack Lowden), a Royal Air Force Spitfire pilot. Kenneth Branagh has a supporting role as Commander Bolton, the commanding officer in charge of the stranded troops who are hoping for evacuation from France which has become, at this point in the War, a lost cause.<br/><br/>The film begins by introducing the three characters and their points of view concerning how they experience Dunkirk which is how the narrative unfolds. Tommy eventually comes to the beaches but realizes there's little hope for escape or reprieve. Some ships have arrived but they are primarily concerned with transporting the wounded. Peter along with his friend George and Peter's father are on a yacht sailing into the English Channel to help the allied cause in some way. George helps to stock the little boat with life jackets. And finally Officer Collins, the spitfire pilot, is attacking the enemy German aircraft which has been pummeling the allied troops and ships with bombs and gunfire at the beaches.<br/><br/>The brilliance of ""Dunkirk"" is how it shows that war is a very non-linear and frantic business. Events just happen, seeming out of nowhere. Also, when an episode of one character temporarily ends, we retrace back to the end of the view of the last character where we left off. For example, Tommy and another ground solider, ""Gibson"" (Aneurin Barnard), a French solider trying to pass off as a British private, try to board a ship with the wounded by carrying on a gurney a casualty they find on the beaches after a German air raid. We then cut to the civilians yacht and/or the pilot and then return back to the privates carrying the gurney. About a third of the way through the narrative, Mr. Dawson, Peter and George rescue a soldier atop of a wrecked ship, the victim of a U-Boat attack. We then learn that the civilians with their yacht have set a course for Dunkirk. Their first passenger begins to protest their destination, and the protests become violent. Officer Collins is the potential hero of the story, where his cunning and training are aimed at German aircraft.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch, bringing the viewer right into the desperateness of what these soldiers must face. Nothing plays out as expected. At moments when the situation appears to be improving, another lightning bolt hits the characters forcing them to deal with yet more devastating circumstances. War is not only hell. It's bloody inconvenient! Ultimately a masterpiece of war filmmaking which will sit beside others of the genre, such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Platoon"". This is war at its grittiest and not for those looking for a neat and tidy linear story which is what the Second World War should have been but never was."

Most likely, a nomination for Best Picture. Most certainly, a nomination for the directing and probably another for the writing. A guaranteed win for the sound mixing.<br/><br/>It is a spectacular technical feat done to its maximum potential with maximum effect, but nothing entirely special artistically. It is an aptly done film, completed to honor the events of Dunkirk, a goal that was achieved with room to spare. But I would not call it a spectacular feat of cinematic masterpiece. However, Nolan's experimentation in structure was unique and stellar and the film will become a classic for its potential as a blockbuster and artistic piece, its experimentation, its technical production, and its enjoyability.<br/><br/>The casting is perfect for the desired effect. Nobody steps up into the limelight enough to steal the show because Dunkirk was a miraculous feat for everyone as equals. Fionn Whitehead takes the ""lead"" as the young boy lost in a hopeless battle, grasping for every glimpse of light in the dark. His youth and naivety is perfect for the role. Rylance shines in his moments as the stubborn and patriotic citizen captain. Hardy demonstrates a fervent loyalty and patriotism in a role, relegated to only acting with his eyes and small gestures. Murphy displays a brilliantly restrained insanity that triggers small events of dire consequences. Together, they make up the several aspects of Dunkirk.<br/><br/>With timeline manipulation and structure experimentation of his previous films such as Memento (2000) and Inception (2010), Nolan finally puts his filmmaking talent to a significant film. Thus, he produces Dunkirk, a la Saving Private Ryan (1999), but Nolan's is far superior. Where Spielberg stressed the realism of the events of Normandy and got caught up in the battle, Nolan stresses the realism of the events of Dunkirk, but makes every minutiae count for something. The ticking score highlights the importance of time. The quick cutting emphasizes the quickness of the events and the ensuing chaos. The blistering sounds punctuate the silence, creating the sense as if you are there. Dunkirk is not merely a film, it is an experience. What James Cameron did in Avatar (2009) and Alejandro Iñárritu did in The Revenant (2015), Nolan does for the war genre with his camera.<br/><br/>Nolan weaves a narrative of land, sea, and sky, in the style of Magnolia (1999), but puts his own spin on it. However, what Nolan has in artistic taste and substance, he lacks in direct narrative. As I said, Dunkirk is not merely a film, it is an experience. But an experience lacks the substance of plot. Thus, there is nothing that makes Dunkirk extraordinary. Yet, it is one of the best war movies ever made. Because it is the Battle of Dunkirk."

","Released after such gems as 'Weed end at Zuydcoote' and 'Atonement' – to name only two classics of the same genre --, Christopher Nolan's 'Dunkirk' is quite good as a very suspenseful war melodrama, with EXTREMELY loud sounds of machine guns, bombs and torpedoes, etc. – stressed by a thumping, and a sometimes ticking 'music' – if it could be called that ! <br/><br/>According to actor-director Kenneth Branagh (who plays a Commander in the movie), roughly thirty veteran Dunkirk survivors, who were in their mid nineties, attended the premiere in London. When asked about the film, they felt that it accurately captured the event but that the soundtrack was louder than the actual bombardment.<br/><br/>The above being said, I have never felt before, in any other war movie, as totally plunged, immersed, involved by the predicaments of soldiers surrounded by enemies – and facing annihilation or capture.<br/><br/>Maybe I could deplore the lack of any 'personal' involvement with the dozen or so recognizable characters – as we know almost nothing about them. Maybe that was intentional to show the 'depersonalisation' that war imposes on fighting men ? <br/><br/>Most of the photography is absolutely amazingly beautiful. Not so about the scenes filmed at close range : the use of deep focus lenses would have been most profitable.<br/><br/>The fragmentation of the movie in three 'time-frames' – and cutting abruptly from day scenes to night scenes may be unsettling until you grasp the reason behind it. Sometimes, these cuts occur in the middle of a scene only to be continued later on. <br/><br/>Is the very ambitious Mr. Christopher Nolan, 47, striving to be 'original' or 'innovating' at all costs ? What's certain – as he said it himself – is that he wants his movies to be very, very popular.<br/><br/>He seems to be succeeding.... Next ?"

"nataliebaumanndcb","9","0","6","10 August 2017"," Amazing sound effects, great pictures and an honest approach to war
","To most individuals in my age group (20-30), war is just an abstract image of two or more countries fighting one another for political reasons. In the past, Hollywood has done its job and romanticized and cropped the issue to a victor, a loser, a hero and the people in charge. War is dirty, everyone knows that. It is brutal, sure, leaving lots of injured and traumatized people in its wake. But everyone just looks at the grand scheme of things and it always ends up as an action movie where the focus is set on one invincible individual or two people in love getting driven apart, where they overcome obstacles and survive everything against all odds and the actual war is just background noise, to set the stage for the main plot.<br/><br/>Truth is, we don't really know much about war. We know the numbers and specifics; who won, who lost, who lead it, who initiated it and who ended it. We think it is dragged out and decided by politicians. It is not. Its outcome is dependent on the fate of every man fighting in a war he has no control over. Demanding a tribute of blood and sweat, fear and pain of the soldiers actually living through those moments, having to commit atrocities to survive in the mental state of constant anxiety. Dunkirk encompasses all of the above. When I first watched the trailer I was still critical. I know, a movie directed by Christopher Nolan is in good hands, but can he pull off something that is based upon an actual historic event and is still associated with lots of painful memories and losses (and thus a sensitive topic)? I can assure you, he can. And he did. The movie was surprisingly subtle, an honest one, a painful one, one that grabbed me right where it hurt. It does not dwell on blood and gore, it focuses on the living and their struggle, not the dead. It tells a story about war, where there is no victor, where soldiers fight the battle and not the politicians. It is not a fight between countries, it is a fight between humans. Where emotional pain can be just as powerful as physical one, where heroism isn't always merited and good deeds go unnoticed, where safety is non existent and silence can be more disturbing than noise. In those moments of silence before the bomber group attacks, the heart of the viewer skips a beat in anticipation of the horror that is approaching. It is beautifully woven together to one horrifying portrayal of the events that took place. But not from an outside but an inside perspective. In a set- up of destruction and desperation, no one gets off with a clean slate. No one is invincible. The true heroes are those who show small acts of kindness, even though they didn't have to. Not necessarily those who survive, but those who help others to survive. Those who fight with determination to save lives, not to kill. Never have I been more emotionally involved in a movie without actually having had a proper introduction to the characters. It usually takes quite some time to feel a connection with specific characters. Not this time though. We know none of them and yet we get to observe them in different situations, at different times but fighting the same fight. There isn't really a good and a bad side, it is simply about individuals in a surrounding that can't be escaped. We get to experience different perspectives, bits and pieces that all contribute to the story of this war that rages on water, earth and air. It is a very deep movie with excellent pictures, haunting sound effects and amazing acting. It proves once again that violence doesn't require graphic images and that heavy dialogue isn't everything. The suspense is mainly created via sound or lack thereof, the expectation of what is approaching, having to wait for the inevitable explosion. Dunkirk isn't the 08/15 war movie one might expect, it is not the tale of a hero but surely does a great job at capturing the spectator without making him feel like one. I congratulate Christopher Nolan to this extraordinary picture, that shows humanity in the most inhumane situations, that isn't afraid to skip character development for the benefit of the whole ,,collage"" and that brings closer the core aspects of war. It makes clear, there is no glory in war. Which is a reminder the world could definitely benefit from."

","Fine movie, did what it advertised. Nice to watch. HORRIBLE to listen to. I have GREAT hearing, watch a ton of movies that sound fine, but Nolan's films often times have the DIALOG too low to hear or understand clearly. This is another case of that, and I wish someone on his team would find this and start to correct this issue. If Nolan is okaying the final mix, he needs to turn down that studios center channel, because it, apparently is not balanced like real movie theaters.<br/><br/>Also, FYI, I first watched it in a huge, gold standard, 70mm, IMAX theater with like 24,000 watts of tuned audio. Thinking maybe because it was so loud that may affect the live listening, I then went to a top of the line digital XD theater, and guess what? STILL missed a couple of major lines of dialog explaining their situation. Why is this? It is 2017 and mixing audio is not new.<br/><br/>I'm not alone. My friend attending with me also missed some dialog. Also, there is a post where people will MOVIE CHAT at an ORG that discusses this issue, and many others notice it.<br/><br/>Watch the film and enjoy the presentation, but don't expect to understand all the dialog.

I came with big expectation to this film, not only because I read the critics, but also because Christopher Nolan is a director whose work I enjoy, who tries and succeeds to surprise in most of his films, in very different genres. This is why Dunkirk, his tentative in the WWII films genre slightly disappointed me. To be clear, it's a good film on any scale. It's just not the best on Nolan's scale, IMO. I really hope that the race to the Academy Awards is not over (as some predict) and better films will show up in the race for the small statues.<br/><br/>I am lacking in this historical description the element of surprise and innovation that Nolan brought to films like Memento , Inception, The Prestige, or even Interstellar. What we get instead is an almost docu-drama approach to a historical event that is known well enough so that we need not too much background information and we can face the individual destinies of the heroes. I liked the fact that for most of the film Nolan and the authors of the script avoided the heroic or melodramatic approach and presented war as lived by the soldiers, a bloody chaos which found the young men unprepared not only from a military point of view but also from a personal perspective. War is not a collection of heroic deeds but also or mostly a fight for survival. The trap of melodrama is not completely avoided however, and a few scenes to the end seem to belong rather to another film. So does the character of the British navy commander played by Kenneth Branagh - wasted talent. The other actors are less known and it's better so, as most are supposed to be the anonymous soldiers who fought for their own lives, some of them with success, some with less luck. A special mention for the excellent musical and sound track which helps a lot the cinematography which is also impressive at many moments.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, when some of the characters make it alive to Britain, the film leaves the personal contexts of its heroes to refer to the political context of the day, which is for us now the historical context. The trains with the survivors just start to make their ways and the politicians already use the events to push ahead their agenda. Their is a gap between the mess that they just had survived, and the words that describe the facts in the newspapers and in the Parliament. It was a necessary gap, however. Big war stories are built of small personal stories, that sometimes include fear and mistakes. The evacuation at Dunkirk was one of the key moment of WWII. The avoided disaster on the beach at Dunkirk prepared the victory on the beaches of the Normandie in the summer of 1944. The saving of hundred of thousands of soldiers after the 1940 Allied defeat in Europe allowed for the men under arms to be spared the sufferings of being war prisoners, allowed for regrouping of the forces, the defense of Britain and eventually the turn of fate and victory in the war. It was a key moment in the war. That was not enough to make of Dunkirk a great movie."

","While depth of characters is a flaw for a book enthusiasts (such as me), the film work was simply brilliant — a directing masterpiece of a complex story. The soldiers, sailors and airmen in this film were outstanding, accurately depicting the fear, courage and survival instinct on the land, air and sea (but especially in the waters off Dunkirk. A salute to the resolute souls of England and France as they engaged a brutal enemy."
"mcgettin","7","0","4","9 August 2017"," A Loud, Exhilarating Spectacle
","I love movies. Movies have the power to tell a story in a near infinite number of ways. That story can be given a particular perspective, coloured with emotion and told with a style made unique by it's writer(s) and director(s) own vision. I felt that this movie was focused so heavily on style and it's own cinematography, that it fell short on it's characters and depth of story. In the end, when the credits rolled, I wasn't sure I'd seen a film, but rather a beautiful, flashy spectacle. I felt attached to no particular character and even at a certain tension point in the plot involving a dangerous distrust between some characters, I wasn't gripped hanging off the edge of my seat, the scene held no real weight apart from the ear blistering bass that this movie pumps out almost constantly. However, it is only the story and characters that i felt let down my enjoyment of the film, and also the fact that its nearly impossible to hear most of the mumbled dialogue from behind the score/sfx. The cinematography itself as mentioned before is amazing and seeing it in IMAX was a treat. Colours were used to good effect making scenes come alive and helping to set and appropriate mood for different situations. Overall the experience was intense, but a bit empty. I came away without anything to think back on. The ride was over, mind the step. I guess I just crave a good story, told in an interesting way. I don't feel like I'd like to see it again, a roller-coaster starts to lose its thrill when you've already experienced it. But it was fun while it lasted."
"mjplysaght","9","0","5","9 August 2017"," An experience
","So anyone who has seen Nolan's previous films know that he has a particular niche, i.e. everything being displayed and shot on a grand scale, characters delivering sweeping philosophical soliloquys and so forth. He definitely has a formula.<br/><br/>However, while the sense of scale is still present in this film, the character interaction is fairly minimal, which some people may view as a criticism but for me personally, it only allows you to become immersed in the setting that little bit easier.<br/><br/>So, obviously, this film is set during WWII and tells the story of the Dunkirk evacuation, one of the events that took place during the war that was arguably instrumental in the Allies getting back on their feet and fighting back against the Nazis. As I said earlier, while the use of character studies takes a major back seat here, the film is compensated by its utilization of breathtaking shots and stellar sound design that really takes you into the moment.<br/><br/>Between aerial dogfights, capsizing ships and the overall fear of the young British soldiers shown on screen, Nolan succeeds in showing us the general sense of peril and fear felt by those present during the battle.<br/><br/>Once again, the casting in Nolan's film is excellent, although I have to say I was initially skeptical when I heard that Harry Styles was brought on board, thinking that he'd drop a new single mid-skirmish, à la Ed Sheeran in Game of Thrones, but I digress. Styles actually did pretty well in his role.<br/><br/>It was also interesting that most of the characters, particularly the soldiers, are rarely, if at all, referred to by name. Even to the point where I watched the credits and saw Cillian Murphy simply credited as 'Shivering Man'. That being said, given that this was an evacuation mission to rescue around 400,000 soldiers, it's just as well, in a way, that they weren't bogged down in exposition learning hundreds of names.<br/><br/>This film is merely about the event rather than any character story. The composition of shots and sound design pulls you in for the ride, and for me personally, it sucked me in to the scene very effectively.<br/><br/>Definite recommendation from me."
"johnfelice-51633","9","0","5","8 August 2017"," Christopher Nolan has done it again
","Just saw Dunkirk today and it was a nice change in style for Nolan. Nolan, of course, known for his Science-Fiction and bending reality style with movies such as Interstellar and Inception has once again exceeded my expectations with this war film.<br/><br/>This film was shot phenomenally shot from 3 different perspectives in no particular or chronological order. It showed the points of view from the British Air Force, the Navy, and the civilians making the efforts to rescue the soldiers that are at sea. If I had to pick a flaw that Dunkirk has (there really wasn't any) it would probably have to be not quite enough depth in some aspects.<br/><br/>I enjoyed how this film didn't really focus on any specific characters and instead focused on the entire navy and the other perspectives in which this war was seen. The team of Nolan and music composer Hans Zimmer have once again made for an excellent film. Although, I see this film taking home some Academy Awards the only reason I gave this film 9 out of 10 stars is just because of the lack of depth in some parts. But, overall, a great war film and another spectacular job by Nolan."
"rdoyle29","8","0","5","8 August 2017"," A pretty damn good film
","I think this is a really good film. I don't think it's a masterpiece and I don't think it's even Nolan's best piece of work. It's not like any other war film I've seen. Although it has three interlocking stories, it seems more devoted to creating an immersive experience for the audience, and it does that extremely well. It's an impressive technical achievement. Oddly, although I found it to be suspenseful and absorbing in parts, I also found it to be a bit of a distanced experience. I was super aware of all the parts were fitting together, and felt like I was watching a mechanism run more than getting involved in a story. For example, I think Hans Zimmer's score is effective, but it's effect is right there on the surface drawing attention to itself the whole time."
"maurodc","8","0","6","6 August 2017"," It started off very slowly, but at the end worth it.
","Honestly, at first, I didn't wanted to see this movie very much because when I saw that it was rated PG-13, all the interest that the trailer gave to me about it was gone. Why? Because that probably would cause that the movie lack in realistic and bloody battles that are present probably in most of the war films. But however, I left my bloody standards for a while and went to see 'Dunkirk' yesterday.<br/><br/>The very beginning of it is very suspenseful and makes you to get interested in what is going to happen. But then the movie becomes a little slow and boring (I must admit it, I was sleeping a bit). <br/><br/>But anyway, the great cinematography, the point of view which is different from the others of the genre, the descent performances and the whole second half of it made the stressful experience worthwhile. Definitely worthy of the IMAX.<br/><br/>Thanks!"

","Anything that Christopher Nolan puts out there is an automatic must see for me. So I was eager to watch this one on the big screen. I think the thing that excited me most was that on the face of things Dunkirk is completely different to the films we've seen from Nolan in the past.<br/><br/>Nolan has never done anything close to a war film before. But perhaps that wasn't surprising as what we see in Dunkirk is less a war film and more a drama/thriller. It is also the first time we've seen a bio pic from Nolan, which intrigued me more. We're so used to seeing Nolan create amazing original ideas for the screen I couldn't imagine him not only making a bio pic but also remaking a film. Nolan is however my favourite director of all time and I could only respect that he as an artist was doing something different. And with a history like his who was I to doubt his judgement.<br/><br/>I would struggle to be anything but bias in my review of Dunkirk. The way it's filmed as in all Nolan pictures is outstanding. Never before has a director made films so well suited for Blu ray. You really need to witness his movies in the best quality. So if you're able i'd recommend seeing it in an IMAX cinema. A luxury I don't have in my town.<br/><br/>I should also mention the soundtrack. something i'd seen a lot of people rant and rave about. So I payed close attention. It is a sure thing that this film will be nominated for best soundtrack at the Oscars and don't be surprised if it wins. The ticking clock that fades in and out during the film is hauntingly beautiful and being that it's subtle, doesn't distract from the elegant simplicity of the visuals. <br/><br/>The lack of dialogue was another beautiful artistic choice from Nolan. the silence speaks volumes and what you're paying to see isn't a soap opera, it isn't about personality's, characters and relationships. It's about survival, this film is art in it's simplest, rawest form.<br/><br/>The different layers of the earth depicted (Water, Land, Sky) show how the war took different forms but ultimately for the same cause. With the lack of dialogue for long periods of the film it was surprisingly the lack of words that taught us more about the characters and their motivations and struggles. I'm lead to believe the characters are also based on real people which isn't hard to believe given the authenticity of what we see.<br/><br/>If any part of me was disappointed it would be with the amount I actually learnt about the battle of Dunkirk. I fully appreciate what I saw on screen, it was heart breaking to watch and despite a few extremely raw scenes. I'd say it was presented tastefully. But I would have liked to have learnt a bit more about the battle of Dunkirk however there is the possibility i should have read up on my history before watching the film. Is it after all Christopher Nolan's job to educate or is it just his job to entertain. <br/><br/>I'll give the film 8/10 for what was a work of art. That's not to say it's Nolan's best work, but i've seen much worse films win Oscars."
"tranat71","8","0","9","3 August 2017"," A very good movie
","I will watch every movie that Christopher Nolan (and Clint Eastwood) directs.<br/><br/>I think Christopher Nolan and Clint Eastwood are probably the best directors of all times. <br/><br/>With that being said, I prefer movies like The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, and Interstellar over war movies.<br/><br/>I think Dunkirk is a very good movie, but probably only because Christopher Nolan directed it. I think this movie would be be pretty bad if someone else had directed it (Clint Eastwood would have also made it very good).<br/><br/>So what exactly am I trying to say? <br/><br/>I think the story itself is kind of boring. <br/><br/>330,000+ allied troops were trapped on Dunkirk and the Germans could have annihilated them. Somehow the Germans screwed up and allowed the allied troops to escape. <br/><br/>It was a miracle for sure. Of course, I'm glad those evil Germans didn't kill the allied troops. <br/><br/>But other than that, it's boring story, probably because it is faithful to the actual events and not some fiction to make it more exciting."
"nishantbishnoi","8","0","5","2 August 2017"," Nolan does a War Movie
","If Christopher Nolan is attached to a project, you know you will be in for something different. Could be for the worse or better, but it will be different. Dunkirk only reinforces that notion as Nolan puts his unique signature on a genre that has faded in recent years.<br/><br/>At its core, Dunkirk has a simple plot but it is the packaging around it that transforms it into a must watch cinematic experience. For its cinematography, Dunkirk doesn't try anything too flashy but instead uses simple techniques to deliver some of the best photography in a war movie, including the best dogfight shown on film ever. The movie relies on the effect sound has on a viewer. It could be too early to call it, but Dunkirk certainly deserves an Oscar for Sound Mixing & Editing.<br/><br/>The actors don't have much to do, as Dunkirk veers away from the melodramatic tropes of the genre and instead allows each actor just enough room to make their characters compelling. Even though no single actor stands out, the ensemble deserves an Academy Award nomination at the very least. <br/><br/>Dunkirk is a movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen and that, along with its reliance on sound, has its drawbacks as the film will not be able to capture the same amount of tension when seen at home."
"ReelLifeReviews","8","0","7","26 July 2017"," A summer contender
","Dunkirk - Stunning visuals and thundering sound bring you up close to this unheralded event in world history. But a scattered timeline and lack of character development still keep you at arm's length.<br/><br/>This was a story my American ears hadn't heard before. I thought not having Old Glory planted on beaches or painted on hulls would maybe not get me as invested. After all, each war film I'd seen prior to this had that key element of American pride that goes right to my heart. This film, however, offered the opportunity to bring out that same level of pride in the company we keep as a nation.<br/><br/>These Allies are deftly portrayed by both A-listers and new-comers. Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy re-team with Nolan, bringing a presence that we now just take for granted, even in their smaller roles. Christopher Nolan is a master of visual storytelling. This comes in especially handy since what little dialogue is given is often difficult to discern. I had to just take the context of the situation to fill in what I thought they were saying.<br/><br/>I also have to say I didn't much care for the timeline that was used to tell the story. It's presented up front that the three different groups of characters we follow are being shown from different times, but the payoff is minimal. With a runtime of only 1:45, the film could easily afford 30 minutes added at the outset to get you familiar with each crew, and then allow the story to play out in real time from there. So while I prefer my movies to be more character driven, the focus is clear: this was about the mission, not the man.<br/><br/>Will the academy remember a PG-13 war movie that came out in the summer when putting together their Best Picture list? While not as big of a longshot as Best Original Screenplay for June's 'It Comes at Night', Best Director for Jordan Peele for February's 'Get Out', or Best Actor for James McAvoy in January's 'Split', it still does make me wonder. If all Dunkirk sees are nods for sound editing and sound mixing, which it absolutely deserves, it will be a true oversight. From where I'm standing you can forget November. 2017's Oscar season started at New Year's. 8.25/10."

","While I enjoyed this film I was miffed when, as soon as the first graphic hit the scene, the house lights came on. The last scene plays, the screen goes dark, the title Dunkirk appears and BAM house lights. Maybe I'm out of touch but I can't believe that is how Christopher Nolan wanted my experience to be. I spoke to the AMC Theater manager afterwards who informed me that the film comes to them programmed to turn up the lights at the first sign of credit graphics. Is this true? I understand that I'm in the minority of movie goers who actually sits through credits but I feel leaving beforehand is like leaving a party without thanking the host. Why should we, those of us who want the full experience, be compromised by those who want to leave early? Or am I just being a nut?"

","DUNKIRK review<br/><br/>Dunkirk follows three stories – one that takes place on the land, one that takes place on the sea, and one that takes place in the air. Each story revolves around the evacuation of Dunkirk during World War 2. <br/><br/>I'm not a fan of war movies. I know, sue me. It's probably because I've never seen a really good one. I also wasn't a fan of Christopher Nolan's last directorial effort Interstellar. Though he's easily my favorite director, with films such as The Prestige, The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception, my excitement for this film was virtually nonexistent. I had low expectations. <br/><br/>The film clocks in at a brisk 1 hour and 46 minutes, boasting Nolan's shortest run time for a film in recent memory. Due to the short amount of time you're in your seat, the film moves quickly. If it had been any longer, it would have suffered. <br/><br/>It's hard to say what Dunkirk is about, because the film doesn't feature a main protagonist, and definitely doesn't follow the classic Hollywood structure we're so used to. The dialogue is minimal, and at most times indiscernible. It's told with a non- linear structure and never really explains exactly what's going on. All of this hurts the film but helps the film at the same time. <br/><br/>Despite its downfalls, any audience member can tell how good Christopher Nolan is. He has full control of this film. Nothing is out of place. Everything is where it should be. Hoyte van Hoytema is quickly proving himself to be one of the best cinematographers to date. And Hans Zimmer delivers a chilling score that blends so well with the movie, you'll forget it's there.<br/><br/>If this movie doesn't win an Academy Award in any category relating to sound mixing, then something is wrong with Hollywood. The movie is so loud at times that you have to cover your ears, yet can immediately drop to absolute silence without feeling unnatural. <br/><br/>The performances are rich, though I couldn't tell you a single character's name. The movie isn't about people, it's about war. Having grown up in America, I knew nothing about the evacuation of Dunkirk. It was educational. And like any war movie should do, it helped me gain more appreciation for the men and women who serve all countries. Of course, Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy must be mentioned and given a shout of excellence.<br/><br/>Nolan is a brave director. Anybody could tell you that. He trusts his audience to be smart. While most summer blockbuster films tell you exactly what's going on at all times, Nolan expects you to pay attention. A lot of his movies require active viewing, which is what sets them so far aside from other films. Dunkirk, like I mentioned before, is told non-linearly. Everything happens out of order. Some scenes are repeated up to three times. He leaves it up to you, as the viewer, to keep track of our three coinciding story lines and understand how they all relate to one another. <br/><br/>Because of the lack of a protagonist, the movie's emotional beats are nearly absent, save for the resolution of the story. It's not necessarily a bad thing for this movie, though it would absolutely fail in any other Hollywood film released this year. Again, Dunkirk is impossible to explain because it is so different from anything else.<br/><br/>The film earns its PG-13 but definitely doesn't push it. The movie gets you to wince and jump, yet it doesn't feel the need to show buckets of blood pouring from wounds. Aside from a couple F-words, which don't stand out due to the English accents and quiet dialogue, it's appropriate for most people. <br/><br/>It's not my favorite Nolan movie, not even close, but that's to be taken lightly. Like I mentioned before, I don't love war films. Dunkirk is a feat. It's well-crafted, beautifully executed and proves that Christopher Nolan can accomplish anything.<br/><br/>8.3/10"

","Hi,<br/><br/>My first review here. I can't say how long I've been waiting to see this epic. The entire story was structured in a nonlinear way. The air, The Beach, and the Sea. The editing creates a nice pacing without implementing modern and complicated effects. The score was the heart of the film. It doesn't deflect us from the scene and gives us more intense and thrill emotions as we were in the Scene. Hans Zimmer deserves a good appreciation. The production design and the usage of real war ships and Spitfires give us the feeling that the survival has happened in this way.Sound design was excellent. Each and every bullet shells and the bombs give us more beat than it ever would. The cinematography adds an another dimension to the film. Without using so many jibs and cranes and crazy movements, the hand-held camera and gentle dolly movements give us tense and real feel. Every frame has all the detail. The air shots with Tom Hardy were mind blowing. Though Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy had only minimum dialogues, the dialogues they had was precise and the portrayal was bloody BEST! Finally, Nolan nailed in all areas.<br/><br/>One Sentence: It's not Nolan's mind blowing masterpiece as he would have done in Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy. It is a story that has to be told in more precise and meticulous way and he told Dunkirk in the soldiers perspective without injecting complexity and destroying the true source.<br/><br/>I am a die heart, CHRISTOPHER NOLAN fan."
"Neil-M09","7","0","7","23 July 2017"," I think its time for the Academy to give an Oscar to Nolan.
","I'll start with a general look, due to this movie show us a realistic view on a war, starts with a plus. The script was normal, being based on historical facts, it is not the classic Nolan movie with plot- twists, however, he knew how to keep the thrill and suspense of the scenes. Good cinematography and decent performances, considering a young cast where Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy obviously excelled, make this a very good film.<br/><br/>Now, Hans Zimmer's music always gives you goosebumps, we add the sound and film's editing, it makes the film an almost certain option to Oscar nominations, even sound mixing could be included. But the highlight was the direction of Nolan, in previous films had a cast of very popular actors, but this time made the most of some newcomers, even a teen idol, to take the biggest advantage and match the rest.<br/><br/>So far this year, Dunkirk has been the best, so it is a highly recommended option, not only for Nolan fans, but also for the cinephiles in general."

","*Pausing my inner Nolan fanboy-ism for a moment*<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan virtually transports us to the epicenter of Dunkirk like a time machine. This is one of the most immersive films in recent times and I love the fact that it's not 3D. <br/><br/>From the first scene, every gun shot, bomb, engine noise sounds dramatically real, along with that mind altering Hans Zimmer soundtrack the movie psychologically keeps you in a state of fear and panic till the end. Hans Zimmer is on a league of his own. His masterful rendition of creating the perfect atmosphere through sound is second to none. The cinematography too is equally breathtaking!<br/><br/>But this has to be his least Nolanesque film. The movie is not intellectually complex nor is the screenplay nonlinear. You won't remember any character or connect with them deeply except of course Tom Hardy that too only slightly. The full movie felt like an extended climax to a prequel. There is still that elemental mix of black and white, where you've lost even though you've won themes he takes in his films.<br/><br/>Truly worth watching in IMAX if you get the chance.<br/><br/>Cheers!<br/><br/>PS: Hopefully Nolan soon rises..because he can take it, because he's not our hero, he's a silent guardian, a watchful protector, a Dark Knight.<br/><br/>*Nolan fanboy-ism continues*"

","Now I presume the modern-day art house/blockbuster wizard will at last earn his first Oscar nomination for directing his tenth feature film, Dunkirk. He deserves it, as he creates a true cinematic spectacle set around a subject made for a true ""guy's night in."" Unlike other WWII films focused on the inner journey, Nolan utilizes the IMAX screen's visual splendor to grasp the British soldiers' first-person perspective whilst treading through turmoil to get back home.<br/><br/>For you longtime Nolanites, you should be pleased to hear that the Dark Knight director achieves what he promised us in his passion project: a well-researched claustrophobic thriller. Everything he has never been very good at in the past, such as expositional dialogue, is left out, while his true strengths, such as bending the rules, remain. He relies on action, rather than philosophical ramblings, to communicate his message. This project also demonstrates the best of his actor direction; the number of soldiers he directs unnerves you to watch as they line up at the beach and unanimously gaze upon the terror above. His finished product almost resembles real recolorized news footage.<br/><br/>These somehow endless events unravel in three separate narratives, each overlapping over different lengths of time. One takes place on the mole over a week, one takes place on the sea over a day, and one takes place in the air over an hour. (Think: Magnolia with a smaller cast) Each subplot feels truthful in authenticity as they unravel in real time, the clock pressing upon each one. The stories appear disconnected, then soon merge together into a graceful singular conclusion.<br/><br/>Each of these men, whether on the ground, on the sea, or in the air, are not meant to be understood on a personal level, particularly with the older soldiers. Nolan's intention is in fact less for you to connect with the fictionalized war heroes, and more to see how the cost to fight affected everyone involved. Despite whatever little we learn of these men caught in the anarchy, we still believe them as traumatized souls as we watch them gaze upon death at every corner, even in the dry, empty French town behind them.<br/><br/>Aside from the lack of a memorable character study, you still see the soldiers support each other in the heat of their conflicts. Sadly though, a much present father-son relationship misses its open chance at adding some needed heart to give us a breather from the mayhem.<br/><br/>For the intended effect, Nolan's heart-stopping experience must only be watched on the biggest screen out there, with the best quality speakers in the world. In the theater, the ear-splitting gunfire and jet engine hum rattles you from the inside all the way to beneath your seat. As for the visual elements, the impressive dogfights tumble sideways and upside down over the vast ocean. Then on the ground, the seafoam sprays onto your 3D glasses, disorienting your vision as the ship of soldiers loses buoyancy. Inside the interiors, the camera comes in uncomfortably close to the heated action, leaving no space left to squirm in your seat; it gives such a contrast against the massive exteriors, it makes you ponder each sequence's behind-the-scenes process.<br/><br/>The intensity here would be wasted without the urgent music by the legendary Hans Zimmer. His score never stops ticking as the time for the bomb to go off gets nearer, which he achieves by stressing the stiff, harsh sounds of strings. You rarely realize the score's effective prowess, as you're too focused on the revulsion to notice. Heck, you could use Zimmer's new Oscar-worthy piece to motivate your study sessions!<br/><br/>Yet like any great director, people will always find more critiques to press against Christopher Nolan's greatest success. He deserves the already voiced criticisms about the little representation toward anyone besides British men, and he deserves further criticism about lacking a distinct ""so what"" to what is another WWII feature. But as a whole, Dunkirk stands as Christopher Nolan's most thoughtful film to date; it impacts you enough to further research and discuss that dreadful day. Understanding the tragedy of violence is precisely what today's generation needs to understand, and Nolan just put us back on the right path."

","Journalism meets cinematic visual storytelling. Christopher Nolan'sÂ war epicÂ Dunkirk provides audiences with a different kind of war movie experience. Different in that the narrative is nonlinear and highly experimental. From a technical perspective, the film is flawless. The cinematography, sound design, and score all work together to create an immersive experience in which that fourth wall is nearly removed. One of my friends that I saw the film with last night described it as being a fly on the wall within each timeline. With little dialog, the focus is on the various groups of the army, air force, and civilians. The stylistic film reminds me of photo/video journalism.Â Dunkirk demonstrates that an emotionally satisfying experience can be delivered without conventional storytelling. In many ways Norma Desmond would be proud of Nolan's film because ""(he) didn't need dialog, (he) had faces.""Â Dunkirk invites audiences in for a rare glimpse into the reality of war, and the reality of not only the armed forces but the civilian assistance that truly made the difference and just why this particular war story is so remarkable. Be sure to brush up on your knowledge of the events of Dunkirk before watching the film. You're definitely going to need to have a base of knowledge of the theatre before becoming the proverbial fly on the wall.<br/><br/>If you are approachingÂ Dunkirk from a desire to see aÂ Saving Private Ryan, then you may want to rethink going to see this film. With little convention in the storytelling, this film puts you on the beach, in the air, or on the sea alongside the civilians, pilots, soldiers, and officers. The focus is not on the characters, special effects, or the bloody atrocities of war, but focused on highlighting a significant event in WWII history that has largely gone unknown except for those in France and the UK. You are very much like a journalist who is capturing the imagery with your camera. It's a snapshot of war, not necessarily the story of war. War history buffs, this IS a film for you!"

","Every great director has to make a war film at some point. It's like a rite of passage to go down in the books as truly great. And finally it was Christopher Nolan's turn with 'Dunkirk'. I'll admit to being a little disappointed when it was announced this would be his next film, because it isn't playing to his biggest strengths. He's at his best when he's making a complex action thriller that is smarter than any other film out there, and requires multiple viewings to fully appreciate it. A war film is really just that, a war film. They're all different, but at the heart of them they're all pretty much the same (maybe with the exception of Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds' which does stand out as genuinely unique). So I was disappointed by his choice of next film (we only get one from him every two years as it is), but was I disappointed with the end result? I'd have to say yes.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, 'Dunkirk' is an extremely fine film, but it pretty much proved my initial assumption 100% correct. It felt like anyone could have made this film. It's often been said that Nolan's one weakness is directing action, well there's a hell of a lot of action in this film. Maybe not action sequences as such, but still action. And while none of it came across that badly, nothing particularly stood out in that respect either. Also with the story being based around truth, his usual brilliance as a story-teller was somewhat hampered. He couldn't deliver twists and turns and moments of share brilliance that will leave your jaw gaping like usual. Those were the only real let-down aspects for me.<br/><br/>As for the good stuff, man can he create some great characters. My personal favourite on this occasion was 'Mr. Dawson' played by Mark Rylance. Firstly, an exquisite casting choice. Secondly, just a trademark Nolan character. Brilliant in every way. Someone you instantly like, care for and have to know their fate. Also in typical Nolan fashion the pacing is incredible. The film never stops for a second. The 106 minute run time (admittedly short by Nolan's standards) absolutely flies by.<br/><br/>When I review a Nolan film I hold it up to the highest standard, and so any negatives are simply because I know he is capable of perfection (he has achieved it in the past in my opinion with 'The Dark Knight'). Make no mistake, 'Dunkirk' is an exceptional film. But it is not as good of a product as this man is capable of delivering."

","Now don't let the title fool you. I loved this film, but on our way home after seeing it, my brother, father and I discussed the grain on the film stock (we saw it on 70 mm, which was pretty cool), and we joked that it looked dirty and he coined the phrase ""better than dirt"".<br/><br/>But let's get on topic, Dunkirk is an incredible film, and maybe Christopher Nolan's best, it's certainly up there. I think I would have to rate The Dark Knight and Inception higher, but Dunkirk could be in the Top 5 Chris Nolan films.<br/><br/>As you probably would expect from Christopher Nolan, the film is a technical masterpiece. It was shot on 70 mm and IMAX, and boy did it pay off. The picture looked great, shot by the great Hoyte van Hoytema. It was also edited by Lee Smith and scored by Hans Zimmer. I really hope the film gets a lot of awards consideration in the technical categories, because they really deserve it.<br/><br/>The level of suspense in this film is on an awesome scale. You're almost always on the edge of your seat, just waiting for something bad to happen. And when something happens, you definitely hear the noise and the music very clearly. It was actually so high that at one point, my brother who has sensitive hearing, had to hold his ears because it was so loud.<br/><br/>I know the biggest criticism of the film is that people didn't care that much about the characters, because there is very little dialogue and the film starts right in the middle of it all, skipping all sorts of exposition. I can totally understand where they're coming from and that is definitely the weakest part of the film. But the reason why I cared about the characters was because Nolan did such a great job at creating a creepy atmosphere and you're just rooting for the soldiers to survive, and ultimately I think of the film really as an experience.<br/><br/>I also want to give a quick shout-out to the historical accuracy. Now I can't say I Know the entire story of Dunkirk back to front, but I am aware of certain facts. It was really nice to see the French being depicted as the ones that were defending the beaches and many of them were sacrificed to let everyone else live. It would have been easy to exclude them, but Nolan is way too smart for that.<br/><br/>So to conclude this review: Dunkirk is a great movie in a long line of great Christopher Nolan films. Probably the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan, and it was one of the best movie going experiences I've ever had. If you can see the film on 70 mm or on IMAX, do yourself a favor and watch it.<br/><br/>My final score, 9/10"
"yannigk","8","0","8","18 July 2017"," Intense film with excellent performances, but not his best
","Dunkirk: Based on real life events in Dunkirk France in 1940, 300,000 English soldiers were stranded on the beach awaiting help. Meanwhile, the French army (allies) blocks Nazi advancements and both the English and the French soldiers are running out of time and must get out of the beach, or be ""sitting ducks"". <br/><br/>In terms of story, there's nothing to spoil, really, but in the case you don't like reading up about movies at any cost, well.. there would be some minor spoiler ahead. <br/><br/>Dunkirk is a war movie. But more that that, it is a survival movie. There isn't much plot twist or clever reveals like the typical Nolan film. It is simply about men trying to survive, help, or fight the enemy. It's a short and efficient film (only 78 pages of script). There isn't any excessive blood or gore or blown up body parts, no soldiers praying or crying in vain. There is just surviving and escaping death. And death did not come in the form of evil German soldiers. I mean, fact dictates that the German soldiers were trying to kill them, but you see them as planes, unseen bullets, bombs, torpedoes. You don't actually see an actual German soldier. <br/><br/>That is not to say that this film is not clever. Nolan's storytelling technique is still there with intertwining stories that meshes at the end. With little dialogue, the film expects you to pay attention and understand what is happening without too much exposition. <br/><br/>If you think that Nolan films are sterile or devoid of emotions, in this film the choice is made on purpose. Not because there aren't any emotion, but because the emotions stirred in the audience is not manipulated by actors emoting sadness with tears or using sad music. You feel it as you see the things happening on screen. You worry, you fear, you find hope, lose hope, together with the characters. This is not a melodramatic film trying to make you cry. <br/><br/>This movie was filmed in IMAX and if you're not watching it on IMAX at least watch it in a big screen. Aerial shots looked amazing, especially when your eyes are set on the plane body chasing and shooting down enemy bomber planes. <br/><br/>I saw this in an IMAX cinema, and again the visuals looks amazing, but the score needs a mention. Hans Zimmer is again composing for Nolan, and this time there's no melody that you hum to by the end. But the tension is built by this pulsing music that feels like either bombs falling or loud heartbeats of the soldiers when enemy planes are passing.. honestly I can't quite tell them apart anymore, and also because the bass in my cinema is too loud. The screen actually jittered on loud tones. So the loud sound works well in most cases, but in a few cases the over bearing bass kind of ruined the visuals. However I think on a better calibrated cinema you won't see this happen. <br/><br/>Another note was also the fact that I was looking forward to seeing Harry Styles in this film ðŸ˜† I'm not a particularly big fan of his or One Direction, I just thought he has a good expressive actor face and I wanted to see him in a movie. I expected him to die within two minutes (coz cameo roles work like that) but he got more screen time than I expected and his character reveal is unexpected too. <br/><br/>The main character, well.. the first character we root for anyway, I don't know what his name is but he's beautiful! I mean, his facial features are so prominent and just.. gorgeous. Hope to see this young actor in more movies. <br/><br/>And Tom Hardy as a pilot.... my gosh there was one shot where I could feel everything through his eyes only, at one point he changed his face from comfort to worry, through micro expression of his eyes.....! because the rest of his face was covered with his pilot mask. That's how good he was ðŸ˜±<br/><br/>The other pilot is played by a lad named Jack Lowden, a younger and handsomer version of Simon Pegg ðŸ˜‚ sorry<br/><br/>My only complaint: (MAJOR SPOILER) <br/><br/>it's a bit too nice a bow tied at the end. I guess I was expecting a Saving Private Ryan-sort of film where everybody is dirty and downtrodden and hopeless and dying. <br/><br/>(END SPOILER)<br/><br/>Conclusion: enjoyable movie, thrilling and filled with tension. Not my favourite Nolan film, but a good film nevertheless. Everybody was clapping by the end. 8/10"
