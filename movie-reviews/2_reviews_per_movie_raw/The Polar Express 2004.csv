","So it was with much trepidation and even utter fear in my heart that I went to see this movie. After all, the last time I went to see a full-length adaptation of a favorite Christmas story, what I got was Ron Howard's absolutely God-awful ""The Grinch"". Having grown up with the book ""The Polar Express"" (according to my mom, I cited it as my favorite Christmas present when I was seven), I did not want to see this story bastardized in any way. Honestly, I was prepared for ""Polar Express"" to be a complete wreck. But instead <br/><br/>It soared. Completely. What makes the film such a success is not so much even the story itself, but an execution which somehow manages to inject every frame of the film with a feeling of childlike wonder and exuberance. In addition, there are so many clever touches and details added throughout that a feeling of mystery and excitement just fills the viewer. Among these are the waiters dancing and singing while serving hot chocolate to the kids on the train (a very funny scene, as well), the factory where the presents are prepared, and a ghost-like hobo who is never really explained, but is incredibly crucial to the feel of the film. At one point, three of the children wander lost through the empty streets of Santa's North Pole town. As they wander, various old Christmas recordings are heard playing on phonographs throughout the town. The music provides a pleasant and nostalgic ambiance to the scene. It's touches like this that absolutely make the film.<br/><br/>I'll never understand why films seem to be required to be at least 90 minutes long. I would pay money to see a 40-minute film, as long as it were good. And even if it sucked, I would have at least wasted less time. What I'm getting at is I have no idea why a 32-page picture book needed to be a 99-minute movie. What this means is that the original story is VASTLY expanded upon. However, what is added in actually fits quite well with the essence and spirit of the book. Some of it is just sheer entertainment; the train track is like a roller coaster, characters ski on top of the cars, danger lurks around every step of the journey to the North Pole (but admittedly fun danger). Other aspects further illuminate and expand upon the book's basic theme of the virtue of belief in the implausible. So I have no idea why this was made into a full-length, but in the end, I'm glad it was. It didn't even feel too long (and I think everything is too long).<br/><br/>Much criticism has fallen on the look of the characters in the movie. I can agree to a point. While there is incredible visual detail in the faces, they usually seem void of expression. In general, a lot of the motion seems rather wooden, as well. The scenery, on the other hand, is gorgeous. Overall, the minor problems in animation (which really boil down to a matter of taste anyway) are certainly not enough to diminish what is an overwhelmingly successful movie. Score: 8/10"

","On the one hand there are many delightful moments in THE POLAR EXPRESS, not the least of which is the entire look of the film--appealing in a way that great illustrations of children's books always are to young and old. Tom Hanks and the others enter into the spirit of the whole thing with gusto--and all the performances are right on target.<br/><br/>On the other hand, much of the film is an excuse to dazzle with roller-coaster-like rides on the express train that roars across various landscapes making wild leaps and turns, all the while thrilling us with a sense of adventure and excitement. For the very young, the ride might be a scary one, especially when the daring young hero rides atop the train during a blustery snowstorm.<br/><br/>Things barely quiet down once the destination is reached at the North Pole. Still there are dangers lurking and the thrills continue with some amazing photographic tricks that can only be done in this new process of computer generated animation.<br/><br/>And to add a cozier touch to the proceedings, certain famous Christmas songs are interjected at intervals to give the North Pole--and the film--a warmer glow.<br/><br/>All in all, quite an imaginative and innovative achievement--impressive enough to assure its place among future Christmas favorites with unlimited appeal for the young in heart. The message of Christmas is lightly hinted at but when Tom Hanks as the train conductor tells the little boy, ""The true meaning of Christmas is in your heart,"" we can be assured that children everywhere will definitely ""get it"".<br/><br/>Visually, it's a stunner. I didn't see it on the IMAX screen where I imagine it really knocks your socks off, but at a multiplex where picture and sound were impressive enough to convey just how advanced special effects technology has become. There is much artistry involved here, especially when the night scenes of the train's fast-moving travel through a blustery snowstorm capture some rich winter landscapes, including a frozen lake that threatens to demolish train and passengers before danger has passed. The camera-work is continually fascinating as is the artwork involved.<br/><br/>A pity there couldn't have been more of a story in the children's book which is the source--but the artistic visuals are the main source of entertainment here and they are superb. The busy background score by Alan Silvestri is reminiscent of works by John Williams. Although none of the sprightly song tunes are particularly memorable, there is a wistful quality to one of the new Christmas ballads sung by the children.<br/><br/>P.S. - I have just watched it on DVD, a year after writing the above review--and it's definitely a keeper--just as wonderful as you could want, an amazing technological achievement that should delight all ages who can still hear that bell! Tom Hanks, as the conductor, is my favorite character--brilliant job."
"cosmic_quest","9","101","127","20 December 2004"," Will Become A Christmas Classic
","I have to say that I adored 'The Polar Express'. It was just the sort of film I needed to truly get me into the Christmas mood. The story revolves around a young boy, who is coming to an age where he is doubting Santa Claus' existence, until the Polar Express- a magical train destined for the North Pole- takes him and a group of other young children on a journey to Santa and to reaffirm their faith in Christmas.<br/><br/>I had reservations about the use of CGI animation since I felt it really only worked for stories about cute animals but having seen the film, the CGI was the best way to capture the spirit of the film. It really wouldn't have worked as well in live action, the sense of other-worldly magic would have been lost. And as it was, the artwork was beautiful, especially the snowy mountainous scenery that the train passes through.<br/><br/>This film took me back to my childhood and that tingly-feeling every child gets on Christmas Eve in anticipation of Santa's visit. The story was sweet and innocent without being nauseating, and I think every one of us can empathise with the boy who wants to believe in Santa but is growing away from the innocence of early childhood and faith in magic. Much like Raymond Briggs' 'The Snowman', I predict 'The Polar Express' will go down as a Christmas classic. It certainly makes a pleasant change that this year's Christmas film was actually about Christmas and I hope they make the re-release of this film an annual Christmas event."

","Clearly the reviewers who panned this wonderful film can no longer hear the ringing of the silver bell. I am reminded of the know it all kid in the film when I read these reviews. Some said it was too dark. Too dark? It was set at 5 minuets to midnight.....As I recall its dark then. Another called it ghostly; a condition true of a Christmas Carol, the film is in good company there. While I will admit that the computer motion capture in facial expressions is not as strong as it could be it did not detract from the story. Some reviewers did not like the roller-coaster effects. One even pointed out that trains can not do what this one does.....It's a dream...physics don't count. It is a sad commentary that the meaning of Christmas and belief in it's historically documented magic is so lost on those with access to the press. My review...it's good and it is best if you make up your own mind. I could hear the bell ring and I hope you can too."
"KaceyS","10","83","109","19 October 2006"," Engaging and Full of Christmas Spirit
","This film was a glorious explosion of the hope and Wonder that fills the memories of the Christmas of Olde. It was a well-detailed, innovative, thought-provoking piece that reminded me of the magnificence of belief in childhood ideals. <br/><br/>The characters were well-fleshed-out and very easy to ""know"". The animation was amazingly detailed and very life-like. The musical numbers and side pieces (especially on the train roof) brought some very effective morality and life lessons to the superb computer animation, giving it that ""touch"" of humanity.<br/><br/>We all need to hold a piece of the fragile innocence rekindled in this film near to our hearts and spread that unbridled, child-like joy in the simple things in life to remind us of the good we all carry within us."
"sak007","8","101","141","3 January 2005"," Should become a holiday classic
","A simple story . . . beautifully told . . . magnificently visualized.<br/><br/>The IMAX experience was stunning.<br/><br/>I did not expect to enjoy the story as much as I did. Simple but quite heartwarming.<br/><br/>Although it started a bit slow, it continued to gain momentum (no train analogy intended) through its conclusion. I was not a great lover of the animation of the human characters, but the other animation, whether it be the train, the scenery, the reindeer, or the elves (are elves human?) was quite well done. <br/><br/>Perhaps the best review I can provide is that after I watched the Polar Express, I just felt happier."

"steve49er","10","199","298","15 December 2004"," Best Christmas movie ever made
","It was astonishing to read the lead in review. The complaint laid forth by the critic that the director's view of the North Pole and Santa's workshop did not reflect his, too bad. Maybe the critic could do better but it's doubtful. As for the line that the Elven town looked like something out of a German city, so what? Didn't many of the concepts of Christmas begin in Germany? My family (two seniors, a twenty year old father, his 3, almost 4, year old son) loved it. The colors were brilliant. The number of elves dancing, singing, and rushing to create an entrance for Santa was outstanding. Santa, himself, proved to be exactly as he should. Intelligent, sturdy, and kind. His reindeer, just as impressive. Forgetting the North Pole and remarking on the rest of the movie, how well done! The artwork, just great. The excitement, our grandson was out of his chair and standing while holding onto the chair-back of the row in front of us. There were scenes that could have seemed somewhat scary for a youngster, he didn't find them so. He laughed several times out loud, had his eyes glued to the screen when something serious seemed to be happening, loved the entire movie. He wants the DVD for Christmas (he will have to wait a year). He also told us that he wants to see the movie once more before Christmas. Out of the mouth of a three year old, his favorite movie.<br/><br/>How can a critic want to re-design that? All because he didn't like the city at the North Pole.? I guess he was looking for buildings made from peppermint sticks. To each his own. As for the three adults, we too were amazed. We went for our grandson. We enjoyed it so much, we applauded (as did others in the theater). It will be easy to return for a second showing. And, the DVD, this family will be buying more than one. My summary states that this was the best Christmas story ever made (put on film, actually), we think it was more than that. It surpasses other great animated films. Once purchased in a DVD format, Toy Story will be relegated to the back shelf, even during the middle of summer."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","91","134","29 November 2005"," It Just Keeps Getting Better
","""Wow!"" <br/><br/>I found myself saying this over and over as I watched this movie on DVD went it came out just before Thanksgiving of 2005. It continually amazes me how far computer animation has come in the last decade. Each time I think I've seen the most beautiful or amazing artwork, something better - like this - comes along. I couldn't believe how good this looked on my flat-screen TV. I can't imagine how good it must appear on an expensive plasma television.<br/><br/>The visuals are just stunning, scene after scene. The sound ain't bad, either! Those not playing this on a surround system are missing an integral part of this movie and a lot of fun. The roar of train as it comes and goes, for one example, is awesome.<br/><br/>The story is very simple but yet entertains all the way with some very adventurous scenes. There are a couple of roller coaster-type scenes which were especially fun, and actually thrilling. Normally, 100 minutes is a bit long for me to sit through an animated film but this was filled with so many amazing sights and fun action scenes that time was no problem.<br/><br/>The only drawback I found were the kids in the story. Most of them were not anyone you could really warm up to, except for the girl and she was so overtly politically correct it was sickening and an insult to anyone's intelligence. A black girl was NOT in the book but the typically-Liberal filmmakers not only change that character but make her the only one in the film with absolutely nothing wrong with her. She's so sweet she makes Mother Teresa sound like The Grinch. None of the kids in the film, however, were brats or annoying. The only funny kid was the nerd, of course. <br/><br/>PC baloney aside, this was fabulous entertainment. Tom Hanks did a great job voicing over five characters and I've just simply never a better-looking film than this."
"moviemattb","10","21","27","24 December 2014"," A Wonderful Experience
","I think this movie deserves a higher rating than a 6.6 on IMDb. I know its just an opinion to everyone else, but I just don't think it deserves to be ignored because ""The Polar Express"" is one of the greatest experience that I have ever seen, since when it first came out back in 2004 in IMAX 3D. My favorite part in IMAX 3D is where the train starts to go too fast, and we get this awesome experience that you are on a roller coaster ride. I felt like that I was part of that ride, and it was like ""WOW!"" Of course, I am only watching this in 2D which is fine but it will never be the same experience as what the IMAX 3D did. So, with that said, ""The Polar Express"" is about a boy who doesn't believe as he gets on a magical train known as the Polar Express as it leads up to the North Pole so he and the rest of the children are about to go see Santa Claus on Christmas Eve late at night. I don't know if the movie has a message but if it does, then I thought it is well done as we should know that seeing is believing as it for us on what we believe. The animation in this movie is spectacular, and I thought the animators did a great job on rendering these characters to make them look real. Of course, you can argue about on why Robert Zemeckis should have just shot this movie in live action instead of animating it. So, what do I know because I honestly don't know; maybe it is just for that kind of style as they are trying to make these characters to be more faithful to the book. Anyway, I thought Zemeckis does a great job on making this movie, and making this a whole lot of fun. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job to work with motion capture as he is playing each character that he is doing; it is also kind of hard on which actor or actress is voicing these characters or doing motion capture but I will leave that up to you. Nevertheless, Hanks was really good in it. The music by Alan Silvestri is very well scored, and the songs that he teamed up with Glen Ballard are pretty good too. I also don't mind if the filmmakers had to add new scenes that have nothing to do with the book, because folks, the book is short so that is probably why they had to expand the book into a movie that is over an hour an a half long. I was fine with it, and have nothing to complain about. So, enough talking about who or what is having problems with this movie, I just thought ""The Polar Express"" is a wonderful experience and would love if this was brought back into theaters, as well as showing it in IMAX 3D. I give this movie a 10 out of 10."
"AlanSKaufman","10","23","30","17 November 2004"," A Journey Of Faith
","Several years ago on Christmas Eve, I was feeling sorry for myself being single and lonely. After attending church, I waited for a bus home in the cold snowy gloom, fearful about the safety of a past midnight commute. Suddenly a brightly lit bus pulled over with no person present but the driver. Opening the door, he cheerfully bellowed out Merry Christmas and asked me to jump on board. The musical theme from The Twilight Zone played in my head as I entered the warm light.<br/><br/>My driver talked about himself being single and lonely, and how he had been saved by Jesus. His married co-workers did not want a Christmas route, so he gladly accepted this run as a way to share the holiday spirit by buoying mine. Although deeply engaged in expressing his thoughts, he drove expertly with care. I remained the one and only passenger. We approached my stop across the street where I live. Not yet finished with his testimony, he parked the vehicle for several minutes. Shaking hands, I alighted. The driver waved as he pulled the bus away. I stared at it fading into the dark distance.<br/><br/>That night was my ride on The Polar Express.<br/><br/>Thanks to the new movie with the same name, I've been able to relive my journey of faith through the eyes of other witnesses. Presented in a choice of 3D or 2D or Digital, enthralling animation virtually places you on the set, the film opening with an older man narrating his experience as a youngster on Christmas Eve in 1955. His name is never given as he represents any one of us viewers. He lies awake afraid he won't hear the sound he awaits: the sleigh bells belonging to Santa Claus. He's of that age when he's beginning to realize that Santa might just be an illusion, and he desperately needs proof of something out there beyond ordinary existence, something wonderful and inspiring. The Polar Express then arrives, the conductor announcing it will transport him to the North Pole. It struck me that it would take a humongous leap of faith for a child to board this very strange train.<br/><br/>There's a tendency to blame modern science for the abrogation of faith. The beautiful sunrise you admire and give thanks for is said to be nothing more than gases and photons resulting from a random Big Bang. Yet questioning faith is ancient and is illustrated in the Bible itself. The story of doubting Thomas tells us he believed in the resurrection of Jesus only upon touching the mark of the nails in His hands. Paradoxically, we are asked to accept this account as Gospel when we ourselves have no hands to examine.<br/><br/>As the train begins leaving, the lad climbs aboard. Clearly his own decision, he realizes under the surreal circumstances normal rules of logic don't apply. He joins other interesting characters, including a know-it-all kid, a sweet girl, and a protective hobo whose personality is a bit like my bus driver. Most haunting is the lonely boy from the wrong side of the tracks who you sense has been physically abused.<br/><br/>The passengers endure trial and tribulation helping each other grow in understanding themselves and getting to their destination. The scene of the lost ticket flying through the air is profound. How that ticket winds up back on the train mirrors the miracles of real life. Skeptics can explain away the phenomenon, but like the sunrise, is it simply an accident, or is an unseen hand at work? The vast Ice Lake resembles a frozen Sea of Galilee and as in the Biblical reckoning, the faith of those on board gets them to the other side without drowning. Only our youngster remains unsure. It's all a dream, isn't it? His struggles to believe will tear at your soul.<br/><br/>When the train finally reaches the North Pole, I grew anxious about Santa's forthcoming appearance. How could he possibly meet expectations? By comparison, Ben-Hur is the sole movie about Jesus I appreciate because His face is never shown. I think it's too difficult for human actors to portray a person who is also divine or otherwise supernatural. But the superb animation process of The Polar Express enhances actors' features, rendering the encounter of the boy with Santa so provocatively authentic that Santa has to remind us he's only a symbol of Christmas, the real Spirit being in the heart.<br/><br/>Our hero returns home, the train departing without a trace. Was his adventure real or a dream? Viewers differ on the interpretation of the clues offered. Cynics argue it doesn't matter for either way the whole thing is a fairy tale. Well, reconsider the paradox of doubting Thomas. At the end of the day, even he was alone holding only memories of the hands he touched. Had he merely imagined the event? As with the train ticket or my bus driver, you hang onto the mystery of what happened, believing when others doubt. You may even believe the story of Thomas.<br/><br/>I recall the words of the eminent author Ayn Rand, ""When people look back at their childhood or youth, their wistfulness comes from the memory, not of what their lives had been in those years, but of what life had then promised to be. The expectation of some undefinable splendor, of the unusual, the exciting, the great, is an attribute of youth - and the process of aging is the process of that expectation's gradual extinction.""<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor. Step aboard The Polar Express. You'll travel back when you were young and innocent, revisiting the hopes and dreams you have since abandoned. The intensity of your restored faith may prove overwhelming and you may weep as other grownups in theaters have. The movie posters truthfully advertise, ""This holiday season... believe""."
"svivschenk","10","14","17","16 July 2019"," My Favorite Christmas Film
","This film obviously has flaws. A lot of people say that the faces are creepy, and though I don't think this, I get their point. The rest of the animation though is some of the best I have seen, and still holds up today marvelously.<br/><br/>The music should be pointed out as well. It can be big and pompous, but also can warm up a quiet scene with heartwarming Christmas spirit music. It has some of my favorite Christmas music.<br/><br/>The story is like a variation of A Christmas Carol, in which one with little faith in Christmas gets thrown into a supernatural scenario where he has a change of heart. I think it was excecuted well and leaves you feeling the quiet warmth and joy of Christmas.<br/><br/>This film is obviously not for everyone, and if you are not a fan of this film, I can totally see why, but this film is my Christmas movie that I will gush about any season. I definetely recommend that you watch it at around 10 on Christmas Eve night. By the time the film ends the main protagonist is winding down and ready to settle in for what lies next on Christmas Day, like you would."
"sadya77","9","20","26","24 November 2005"," This movie is a great watch, even if you don't celebrate Christmas at all!
","When we watched this wonderful movie, we absolutely forgot where we were. The minute it starts, it gets your attention and keeps it until the very end. You enter a truly magical world.<br/><br/>We don't celebrate Christmas, but after seeing some trailers with the chocolate being served on the train (very funny and cleverly done!) I became so curious about this movie, and even more so because I am a huge Tom Hanks fan. I just had to see it. Any film Tom Hanks is in, is great and this one is no exception.<br/><br/>So when we sat down, I already expected this to be good, but I could never have imagined how wonderful this one and half hour journey would be! From the start to finish, everything is perfect. I didn't mind the facial expressions at all, or lack of them. The rest of the movie makes up for that minor glitch.<br/><br/>I must say, the part in the end where Santa uses his whip to take off, well that whip reminded me of the one the Balrog had in the Fellowship of the Ring, lol! And the engineer was very funny, the children just laughed so hard when the beard was pulled of the assistant of the engineer and his scream actually became a communication with the deers blocking the railway! There is so much in this movie, comedy, sorrow, disappointment, happiness, relieve, suspense. In the end, you are left with a warm and satisfied feeling. And that's what a family movie should provide."
"mcreynolds78","Null","93","142","11 December 2004"," This is one of the best animation features ever!
","The Polar Express delivered me all the way back to childhood and my own faith in Santa Claus at the age of five. I could not only hear the bells, I could see his sleigh in the night sky. Chris Van Allsburg is to be commended for writing an excellent fantasy and Tom Hanks for conducting the wonder tour to beat them all. The special effects are just outstanding, the story line credible and heartwarming. The characters are believable and utterly charming. The children depicted are our own. I would recommend this film to any and all who love Christmas and remember what it is to believe. The experience of watching makes you a participant, breathless to see what comes next. I can hardly wait to view it on IMAX and am taking my entire family, including seven grandchildren to the Tulsa Cinemark this season. Let's hope we see more of this quality venue in months and years to come."
"majikstl","Null","39","56","23 November 2004"," The eyes don't have it...
","There is a fleeting moment in THE POLAR EXPRESS where the title vehicle passes a department store with an elaborate Christmas display in the window. Everyone is excited by the sight, especially the story's protagonist, ""Hero Boy,"" until he sees the mechanical gears that reveal the display's Santa Claus to be a machine. That's the problem with THE POLAR EXPRESS, it is a splendid, wildly inventive machine, but it keeps on reminding us that it, quite literally, lacks a human face. <br/><br/>Based on Chris Van Allsburg's slight but textured children's book, the film attempts to capture that book's subtle, albeit dark, visual tone. And for the most part the filmmakers do a stunning job. The artwork and animation, done largely with computers, is rich and detailed and often about as close to lifelike as any animation that I have ever seen. Therefore it is ironic that the remarkably high standards the film sets with most of the animation and artwork only serves to highlight the other aspects of the art that do fail so jarringly. The train, the snow, the sweeping landscapes and even the animals such as wolves and reindeer are all so incredibly meticulous in detail and movement, that it only makes the failure of the artists to replicate the human characters all the more startling and disappointing. The human beings in the story seem trapped in a limbo, being neither quite cartoon and certainly not quite human. <br/><br/>It is strange that the animators do an outstanding job of recreating skin texture and coloring and even the various subtleties of hair, but can't quite recreate the most revealing aspect of being human, the eyes. The mouth movements are disappointing too, but it is the eyes that are, well, just plain creepy. Like the characters in Japanese anime or the sad orphans painted on black velvet, these characters have eyes that have a cold, spookiness to them. They are a mild, if unrelenting, distraction in some scenes, but they quietly spoil many of the major moments where the film strives for an emotional intimacy. It is a serious problem when you literally don't want to look a character in the eye, especially if the character is a child. <br/><br/>The film uses a technology called ""performance capture,"" wherein an actor actually gives a three-dimensional performance which is recorded digitally by a computer, to then be manipulated into animated art. Performance capture is an extension of CGI and, as used in films like THE LORD OF THE RINGS, further blurs the line between what is animation and what is special effects. The process seems to work fairly well as far as body movement goes; the animated characters move with genuine lifelike grace that is far superior to previous attempts, such as the animated action sequences in SPIDER-MAN or THE HULK. Indeed, a dance sequence involving a band of hyperkenetic waiters is a showstopper. But the process just does not work as far as detailing facial features. <br/><br/>Cartoon humans from Elmer Fudd to Fred Flintstone are more simplistic, yet more human than the waxworks faces in THE POLAR EXPRESS. Their cartoonishness gives them a personality that is missing from the POLAR EXPRESS characters. I suppose that as the technology progresses, the ability to create totally believable human faces will be achieved to some credible degree. But the question is why? It's like making vanilla wafers with artificial flavoring; why seek a substitute for something natural and superior. <br/><br/>The director of THE POLAR EXPRESS is Robert Zemeckis, a clever and skilled craftsman whose work includes the brilliant WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, a film that blends real and cartoon images wonderfully. THE POLAR EXPRESS would have been so much better had they followed the lead of ROGER RABBIT and, like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, merged high-tech trickery with the simple honesty of the human face. Repeatedly throughout THE POLAR EXPRESS, I found myself wishing certain scenes were featuring real actors; I can't think of any other time where I thought a cartoon would be better as live action. <br/><br/>Despite its optimistic Yuletide moral about the power of believing and its child's eye view of the world, the film really isn't a kids movie. THE POLAR EXPRESS has a Twilight Zone quality to it; not unlike the many versions of A CHR1STMAS CAROL or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. The film is dark, and even in its most upbeat moments the story and the storytelling are strangely subdued. Not quite brooding or grim, but far from joyful. While obviously directing the film towards children, the filmmakers don't seem to understand kids. Little things are telling, like failing to give the characters names other than generic titles, like Hero Boy, Lonely Boy, Hero Girl, Know-It-All, etc. Such a lame literary device as reducing a character to a nameless symbolic entity is lost on children; they want to know people's names. Children can't relate to nameless, faceless characters. Neither can adults for that matter. Humans have names, and for that matter so do cartoon characters.<br/><br/>Though it is seriously flawed, THE POLAR EXPRESS is still a remarkable effort, visually stunning and ultimately even emotionally rewarding. But no amount of artistic talent can capture the simple beauty or honesty of a living child's face; it may have been folly for the filmmakers to even try."

The movie is as comfortable and heartwarming as an old Christmas card .The whole concept of looking at a rapid train towards North Pole is creative in and of itself. After watching the movie, you may look at your life from the same enjoyable perspectives . Special effects add a nice little touch , but it is Tom Hanks's interaction with the various characters that really steal the show . Hanks manages to capture pure magic with his stunningly awesome portrayal of main characters , the Hero boy and the conductor , and it is definitely worth a look . It's fun and different approach to the Christmas tale with top notch effects by means of ¨Motion Capture¨ , a technique magnificently developed by Robert Zemeckis who will repeat in other films as ¨Beowulf¨ and ¨Christmas Carol¨ . A highly recommended film that nobody should miss it especially during Christmas time . ¨Robert Zemeckis's Polar Express¨ still ranks as one of the best adaptations of Christmas stories ever. This animated retelling about a doubting little boy taken on a journey of self-redemption and knowledge will appeal to Tom Hanks buffs , computer games enthusiasts and eye-candy fans ."
"Hippiegirl68","10","13","17","18 December 2004"," ...A little Christmas sugar on an open heart...
","Tom Hanks's grip is tight and firm on this new Holiday movie, which is just as charming and sugary as Hanks himself. ""The Polar Express"" is more than a graphic movie, or simply another Hanks movie. This is a new-fangled classic holiday movie! Set to the book of the same title by Chris van Allsburg, ""The Polar Express"" sets to the theme of ""believing is seeing"", of which many previous Santa Claus movies have proved in the past, and succeeds by bringing in a child (Hero Boy) who is dangerously close to being a skeptic in the beginning of the movie when he is whisked away on the Polar Express train, a one-way to the North Pole. On the way, he makes friends with Hero Girl and Lonely Boy, and they find themselves in the scariest of situations. In his ""stunts"" in attempt to follow Hero Girl on top of the train, he comes in contact with the Hobo (voiced by Tom Hanks, with the appearance seems like a run-in between Hanks and Dick van Dyke), of whom seems to play the only role as the antagonist, pushing ""Seeing is believing"". It all works out in the end, as the trip is complete, but the adventure is never over until the little bell of Believing in the Unknown now rings in Hero Boy's ears clearly as he finds himself believing in Santa Claus, as seeing him face to face. But to be critical in some parts of the movie: the visual effects are amazing and are created to certain height. But all of the ""roller coaster"" scenes seem to take away most of the movie. Unusually, they only seem to add onto the emotions of the movie-goer and seem to share the emotional journey of Hero Boy. The golden ticket ""dance"" (very reminiscent of the feather of the Zemeckis/Hanks movie ""Forrest Gump"") seem to go on forever, and seems to be outlandish (yet all things happen for a reason)once mother nature interferes. The second critical point is the use of the score. It does seem to play much too often in the beginning, whereas there is a lot of mixed emotions, but that seems to be my only concern for the movie. Eventually towards the end, it seems that Zemeckis spreads out the emotions against the adventures. The score of ""The Polar Express"" is probably one of the most beautiful scores I have heard, which is up there with ""Chocolat"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"". Even my favorite singer was apart of the music, Josh Groban with the Ballard hit, ""Believe"". Josh Groban's voice is a perfect finish, which warms up the movie and the movie-goers' heart with ""hot chocolate"". This vote should really be a 9 1/2, but I can't find it in me to totally hate the flaws. This movie is a great edition to the holiday movie dynasty, I think the age range should be 7-adult, being the movie is very graphic and can be scary for little kids. Yet, oddly, the movie brings out the child in everyone, of which the little bell of Believing in the Unknown should be resounding in the movie-goers' ear all over again."
"D_Burke","7","12","16","13 December 2011"," ""The Polar Express"" Is A Surprisingly Good Trip
","I try not to have expectations when I go to see films. Often, my problem is usually that I'm excited about a film's opening, and my expectations are usually high. In the case of ""The Polar Express"", my expectations were actually pretty low.<br/><br/>Growing up, I would read and reread ""The Polar Express"", a book written and illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg, every Christmas. It still ranks as one of my favorite children's books. The story was great, the illustrations were amazing, and the book never lost its charm to me as I got older.<br/><br/>Naturally, when I heard they were making a movie out of it, and an animated one at that, I could not help but dismiss it as a ploy for Hollywood to take a sweet, timeless children's fable, and exploit it for a cheap buck. Now that I've actually seen the movie, I can say that it was far better than I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemekis, who also co-produced and co-wrote the screenplay, managed not only to make the film look amazing, but still kept the heart and the main moral of the original book within the movie. There are a lot of parts here that were not in the book, like the train slipping on an icy lake, and the caboose disattaching from the train with some of the kids on it. However, the really important parts of the book were maintained here. The main boy in the story still wants a bell, Santa gives it to him, and . . . you can figure out the rest.<br/><br/>I didn't expect to like many of the additional characters they added to the movie, but I thought they were all characterized very well. I liked how the conductor (Tom Hanks) actually had a personality, unlike in the book where the focus was solely on the boy. I also liked how the boy interacted with other kids on the train, especially an African-American girl (Nona Gaye) whom he befriends. There's also a really sweet song called ""Spirit of the Season"" that she sings along with a boy credited as ""Lonely Boy"". The way the song is sung, and the CGI-imaging of the night sky, are both truly spectacular.<br/><br/>Some of the films excursions that I thought were going to be cheap plot devices actually served the film well. After all, a book that's roughly 30 pages long probably won't amount to a 2-hour movie. Still, these subplots were used in a way to not only cleverly characterize the main characters, but also to give a better dimension to the North Pole. You would never see the elves, how they transport themselves, and what the villages in Santa's North Pole look like if the film stuck straight to the book. Zemekis has consistently been very good at using computer animation to add not only to characters, but make their worlds far more elaborate and interesting.<br/><br/>With all that said, I had some major reservations about the film. While the animation was really good in terms of set design, I hated how it made the humans look. They almost looked like zombies at times, and it was a little scary.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. Motion capture animation is pretty amazing, and probably not as time consuming as regular animation. However, when the main characters are humans, and the conductor looks exactly like Tom Hanks, why not just film them? That would probably cut the $165 million budget down significantly, or at least I would imagine.<br/><br/>Also, it really irked me that most of the children did not have names. The main character is labeled ""Hero Boy"" in the closing credits, the black girl is named ""Hero Girl"", a nerdy boy is credited as ""Know-It-All"", and so on. Why not give them names? What's the harm in naming Hero Boy something like Tommy or Jimmy? It's not hard.<br/><br/>I also hated how the main characters are kids, yet the actors who do the voices for them are not kids. ""Hero Boy"" is actually voiced by Tom Hanks, although he actually sounds like a real kid. Same with Nona Gaye, Peter Scolari, and Eddie Deezen. While their child voices sound authentic, it seems like a lot of unnecessary work to digitally doctor their voices to make them sound like kids. Why not just (Gee, I don't know!) hire child actors to do the voices!?!?! It worked for ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" (1965), and it can't be difficult.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks doing the voices of six different characters felt more gimmicky to me than cutting edge. Hanks is far from the first actor to play multiple roles in a single movie, but Peter Sellers, Lee Marvin, or Eddie Murphy he is not. In the movies those actors were in as multiple characters, they disappeared into their characters so much that their multiple roles showed their acting ranges. Here, every character Hanks voices (except the boy) sounds like Hanks. You can tell that Hanks is the voice of the conductor, the hobo, the boy's father, and Santa Claus. The gimmick is so distracting that it takes you out of the movie for a few moments.<br/><br/>While ""The Polar Express"" has its hang ups, it can and should be considered the first Christmas classic of the CGI-age. It still gets re-released into theaters every Christmas, as it has a renewed following thanks to great 3D effects that are becoming increasingly popular amongst moviegoers. It also is one of the only adaptations of a children's book that adds to its source while also maintaining its heart. My guess is that many generations will return to it year after year, and it will keep ringing just like the bell in the story."
"Sylviastel","10","18","26","18 January 2007"," Classic Christmas Film!
","Chris Van Allsburg best selling children's book is considered by many to be classic children's literature. The film version is an animated which benefits the story further. Tom Hanks plays the narrator, producer, and the train conductor. The animation is first rate, award winning, and breathtakingly realistic as well. Of course, this is a children's story and there are some dark moments like the girl who didn't have her ticket and the main character who found it and planned to return it to her so she doesn't get kicked off the train and the ending. Of course, I am surprised that there was negative criticism. If I had children, I would love a classic film like this about the true meaning of Christmas. The act of being the giver and the receiver is what the story is about. Let's not talk about the nativity, that's for another story. If It's good enough for Chris Van Allsburg, it's good enough for me."

","A wonderful film to be recommended to all who can see beyond their on small lives and maybe still see the childhood wonder that they once had as a child. The makers chose to render the film very close to the original art work in the hardcover children's book. An interesting approach. I am stunned at the amount of comments here who really did not get the point of the film. I guess you hear the bell, or even remember what it was like at one time to hear it or you don't, but the amount of ridiculous hate reviews here on this site is ridiculous.

","A few months ago, I remember walking through the library looking at the movies I could review when I passed by a grandmother and her two younger grandchildren who were about four or five. As I was looking around, I remember one of kids looked in awe at ""The Polar Express"" and I couldn't help but smile. The film had always been a Christmas staple for me. I remember watching the movie almost every Christmas when I was younger loving every frame of the film. Years passed and I had stopped watching the film by then. This year though, I decided to give the film a re-watch and was happy to find out that I still loved it after all these years. ""The Polar Express"" might have some dated elements to it, but the things that have held up have held up incredibly well. Here's why I think this is one of my favorite Christmas movies.<br/><br/>A young boy (Daryl Sabara) is starting to doubt the existence of Santa Claus. He has been yearning to hear one of the bells that is on Santa's sleigh and starts to think that it may not exist. However on Christmas Eve, a train known as the Polar Express shows up outside his house where a conductor (Tom Hanks) tells him that it's going to the North Pole and he decides to get on board meeting other kids including a young girl (Nona Gaye), a know-it-all kid (Eddie Deezen) and a lonely boy named Billy (Jimmy Bennet). Along the way, the boy goes on a magical journey involving a mysterious hobo (also Hanks), a gigantic heard of caribou, a frozen lake, and a crazy ride through the North Pole itself.<br/><br/>Ever since the movie came out in 2004, both critics and audience members have been rather split about the movie. Where critics like Roger Ebert loved it, other critics like Peter Travis hated it. I guess I can sort of understand why people are not fans of the movie, but I really couldn't care less. I love this film and I'll try my best to defend it. Let's talk about the story first. Those that don't like the movie usually say that the movie is padded and filled with too many unnecessary scenes. For those saying that most of those scenes aren't needed, there's a reason why it was included. It was based off a picture book which if properly adapted would be only ten minutes long. The scenes they added I think are pretty exciting and have a lot creativity put into them, but the best part about it was the fact that the message of the film is able to stand tall and is faithful to the book unlike other picture book adaptations. The characters I think are also likable. Usually, I'm against character not having names, but in this case it really works mainly because you at least remember what they look like, have memorable things to say and also stand out. However, the thing that most people are pretty split about is the motion capture animation, particularly on the humans as most find it too unrealistic and sometimes creepy. In my opinion, I don't think that was what director Robert Zemeckis was going for. I highly doubt that he was trying to make the characters lifelike because the technology was, and still is, not up to date yet. Though some areas of it are dated at times, the animation was able to translate Chris Van Allsburg's beautiful animation to the screen perfectly, its backgrounds in particular. I also love the soundtrack of the film. The score by Alan Silvestri is beautiful to listen to and his songs are very catchy and memorable. I also liked the small detail they added of playing old recordings of Christmas carols in the North Pole. As far as flaws go, my only one in particular is some of the dated motion capture, but that's really about it.<br/><br/>""The Polar Express"" is one of my favorite Christmas movie with a fantastic story, good motion capture, memorable characters and some fantastic music to help it stand out. It's one of those Christmas movies that people will just have a soft spot for even if people disagree with you. With that said though, if you don't like the movie, I do respect your opinion. However, I will love the movie for years to come."

"eabakkum","8","3","3","20 January 2014"," This haunts us in our dreams
","The cartoon film The Polar Express is not a conventional Christmas picture. Then the question is: what is wrong, the film or Christmas? I like The Polar Express, because it is a very spiritual story and film. It retells the events, that so often come to haunt us in our dreams. You board a train, although you doubt if its destination is right. You lose your ticket, and when you have found it, you lose it again. The conductor is an unpleasant fellow. During a snow storm you are compelled to crawl over the roof of the train. And after the arrival of the train in a funny town with lots of small alleys, of course you get lost. It is a tale of doubt, loss, fear of failure, and inevitability. As such it revives the old Christmas message, where a Saviour is born to lead the way. Christmas was meant to be a time of reflection on the purpose of life, and an ethical or religious experience. But somewhere in the nineteenth century the message became blurred. Perhaps it started with Dickens, who changed the choice between good and evil into a choice between consumerism and greed. And after WW2 we just wanted to be happy and even this unpleasant greed was wiped out. What remains is a thick hairy old man with a beard and a red suit, a silly fatty, whose sole purpose in life is to distribute gifts on one evening in the year. It is the present that counts! We got films like ""White Christmas"", where Tiny Tim is replaced by a retired general. I welcome every attempt to regain something of the ancient Christmas spirit, with an honest incitement to search your soul and ponder over the road (not) taken. It is the human challenge to attempt to control your dreams. Imho The Polar Express sounds the right chord. I love the remark, that the destination of the train in itself is irrelevant: ""The important thing is to get on the train"" - and make something of it. Some times are good, for instance when the hungry kids can avalanche in the train (pun intended). Upon arrival in the town the train forms a beautiful question mark. But the end misses the point, because out of a sea of light emerges the obligatory fat dad in red. He is an impolite (hint: imp), He gives a bell to X, the main character. Of course X is delighted to avenue one. But the poor reindeer toil and moil to move fatty's sleigh. In the air he dives on the crowd like a fighter-bomber. If he is supposed to portray the Holy Father or the Lord, than it is blasphemy. Let us call these scenes irony, and conclude that The Polar Express is recommendable for those who appreciate a travel to the inner self. I contrite a thing, but perhaps you still enjoy this review. Don't forget to check off the ""useful: yes"" ballot. I love comments."

The movie is a huge spectacle of wondrous imagery. All this surrounds the story of a skeptical young boy who takes a Christmas Eve ride on the Polar Express, in attempt to convince himself that Santa Claus is real. Tom Hanks is the star, providing the performance of several characters, including the stoic Conductor, who plays it strict in one instance, then endearing in the next. Much has been made of the liberties taken with the original story. This is just a case of having to stretch a simple story into feature length. But a lot of added sequences are enjoyable and breathtaking, including the snappy ""Hot Chocolate"" number. You can expect this to be a new holiday classic that will be remembered for years!"

","I'm a huge fan of Chris Van Allsburg, and especially his book, ""Polar Express."" I love Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie ...<br/><br/>Reviewers said that the motion capture technique resulted in freakishly animatronic looking characters. At first that aspect of the film did bug me, but I did get used to it.<br/><br/>But ... I really didn't like this movie. It was too dark, and it wasn't dark because it had a few scary moments; there's more to it than that.<br/><br/>First, what's good. ""Polar Express"" contains some stunningly lovely and/or remarkable scenes. The words on a page are seen from below the page, as if the page were transparent; wolves and eagles follow a slip of paper as it is blown about by the wind; Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby Christmas hits play in a North Pole toy factory.<br/><br/>All very worth seeing, worth, perhaps, the price of admission for hardcore film fans.<br/><br/>But the movie was simply too dark and too PC for me. And it reaches too far.<br/><br/>The PC aspect of the movie is an insertion that doesn't exist in the book. The main character is provided with a companion, an African American girl.<br/><br/>The animatronic look of the motion capture character is unpleasantly emphasized by the animatronic characterization of this girl. The script bends over backward to make her purely good, cool, and admirable, with no negative qualities, and that effort is obvious and alienating.<br/><br/>American audiences are grown up enough that we can accept a flawed -- i.e., human -- African American character. We don't really need a cartoon version of the character Sidney Poitier played in ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner."" There is a Poor White Boy character added, as well. Whoever wrote this character has no idea what it is to be poor, and treats this character with zero respect, and a great deal of condescension. The ""lesson"" this poor boy is meant to learn at the end will have self respecting poor people gagging.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie was just too dark, with none of the redemption richer movies have been able to offer. There are scenes of perilous efforts to walk atop a moving train during a snow storm, and scenes of vulnerable children trying to cross a dangerous bridge.<br/><br/>""Wizard of Oz"" and other classics contain similarly scary scenes, but those films also offer deep and moving scenes of genuine empowerment and redemption. I missed such redemptive, powerful scenes in ""Polar Express."" This film will have its audience for whom it works perfectly. It does offer scenes as stark and striking as anything from German Expressionism.<br/><br/>What I missed were the warmth, the depth, the heart of the best of ""Wizard of Oz"" or ""The Little Princess"" ... or the Chris Van Allsburg book, ""The Polar Express."""

","Many years ago we opened a Christmas present for my daughter (now out on her own) sent from my brother and sister-in-law who lived 1500 miles away. The box contained a book, The Polar Express, and a sleigh bell. I'd never heard the story, and I remember looking at the book and the bell and wondering what they were about. I probably got more out of reading The Polar Express than my daughter did at the time. When the movie came out I made the mistake of reading reviews and put off seeing it. When I did get around to a view I was pleasantly surprised. The dark aspect critics panned to me reflected magical nights in decades past, looking out my bedroom window at snow falling in the street lamplight with that sense of awe, appreciation of beauty and security that only a child can have. While The Polar Express isn't what I would have made of the book it does have for me that dreamy sense of glory and anticipation that is the mark of childhood and what I most miss of those days. Well worth seeing, in my opinion."
"davetex","7","4","5","30 November 2006"," A worthy experiment in animation effects
","I have now watched this film twice and have decided that I like it, although I have some misgivings about the overall message it contains.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the animation is cutting edge and the story works, being the correct mix of wonder, magic and ghosts that are part of Christmas. Zemekis borrows freely from various sources to make up his movie, including Dickens,1984 (check out the Elf Monitor scene), harry potter, old bugs bunny cartoons to name but a few, but somehow it seems to work (despite the scene where Santa finally appears and the elves cheer him like Hitler at a Nuremberg rally which I found just wrong). The animation is strange to my eye, the characters looking often like animated dolls, but the sets and other visuals are stupendous.<br/><br/>The hot chocolate scene is worth price of admission alone.<br/><br/>What I found somewhat troubling about the movie is how the whole Christian basis of Christmas is entirely eradicated (other than preservation of the term Christmas) and it is somehow all about Santa Clause (who, lest we forget, gets his name because he is based upon a catholic saint) and getting presents. Now, I am not particularly religious, but I found that part of the film a little troubling, mostly I think because the film uses all of the Christmas references, glowing candles, Christmas carols and so forth, but the guy who started the whole thing by being born gets carefully airbrushed out.<br/><br/>But then, this is not the first Christmas movie to do that, so one cannot be too picky."

","For the first 10 minutes this film is a delight. The filmmakers and animators must have worked themselves into a frazzle to get this amount of detail and style into the film - the human characters look as if they were both rotoscoped AND computer animated, and all the inanimate or inorganic elements of the film - the landscapes, the houses, the trees, the Polar Express itself - are dazzling. If the movie had been a 22 minute 'short' (a la ""Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown""), it would have been one of the all time classics of Christmas animation. Unfortunately, Zemeckis and company felt they needed to expand ""Polar Express"" into a feature length movie, and the source material can't hold up to the extended length.<br/><br/>Face it, one of the great strengths of the children's book this movie adapts is the brevity and economy of its literary style - supplemented by evocative fantasy visuals that augment, not replace, the poetic resonance of the carefully chosen words. But here, the writers have to add extra plot elements, characters and dialog to the basic 'text' to extend it to feature length, and they just don't have the ability to triple the content while maintaining the magic of the original source. It's as if the Hallmark Card composers tried to expand on the works of Robert Frost - they can ape the style, but they can't get the resonance or the heart. It's well meant and agreeable, but it somehow misses the point.<br/><br/>It's also got Eddie Deezen doing one of the voices, which is always a minus for me. Deezen is still doing voice work after 20+ years in the business, so someone must like him, but all I can say for him is that he must be dependable and reliable...because he turns in his usual sinkhole of nasal suck. Sorry Eddie, I know you need the work, and it's nothing personal, but I hate you as an actor.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, on the other hand, is his usual splendid self, and it's largely due to his efforts that I can enjoy the thinned out content of the various over-extended sequences. He puts so much warmth and dry humor into the various characters he voices that it almost gets this film over...if not for him, I would rate this film much lower.<br/><br/>Another problem: after a while, it is apparent that the animators are running out of ideas. For instance, they use a reverse 'zoom' pull back crane shot shot - that pulls back from a crowd to show the spectacle of hundreds of figures from an eagle eye view - way too much. It was sensational when it was used for the first time in ""Gone With The Wind"", and it's great here the first time they use it, but after a while, you can tell they're doing it again and again because they don't know what else to do. And there are a lot of musical numbers and dance scenes (a la ""Shrek"") that work fine at first, but really don't add anything to the story or the atmosphere. My favorite - the ""Hot Chocolate"" scene - is typical; it's light hearted and kind of clever, but Disney and Pixar do this kind of thing much better, and they integrate the musical numbers into the plot better. <br/><br/>And I hate to say it, but sometimes the art direction slips a bit and the gloriously life-like faces of the children and the train crew alarmingly devolve into the death-masks of soulless zombies. (This happens all the time in the cut-scenes for video-games). This is the peril of making computer animation as 'realistic' as possible - if every aspect of the production is not dead on, humans will look like the walking dead. This may be inevitable when you're doing a feature length animation , even when you are budgeted for 'state of the art', but it really detracts from the charm and sentimentality the movie is trying to instill.<br/><br/>I only rate this as a ""6"", but it's a STRONG ""6"", and there is enough to enjoy about this movie (especially the railway travel and boarding sequences of the Express itself) that I will gladly watch it again with any 8 year olds in the TV room who insist on seeing it during Christmas vacation. And there are times when the visuals are gorgeous enough to make an adult 'BELIEVE' again, if only for a second."
"cohete","1","78","176","23 November 2004"," All Aboard The Polar Express.... to HELL
","The Polar Express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (NO QUESTION MARK AFTER THAT MOVIE TITLE!!). And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. The reviews of this movie were almost unanimous saying that this is an instant holiday classic. Ebert & Roeper give it two ENTHUSIASTIC thumbs up! Even Ebert's written review gave it a full four stars! Wow... OK... this I gotta see! But wait... the motion capture used looks really weird. Hmm... maybe I'm NOT so interested in seeing this anymore.<br/><br/>""Well, you comin?"" says the train conductor to the boy in The Polar Express. The boy is reluctant at first, and the train begins on its course without him. The boy soon changes his mind and jumps aboard just in the nick of time. <br/><br/>Now, most of you have probably decided to not jump aboard this train and wait for the TV Train or Rental Express (hee hee, I'm so witty and clever). I, on the other hand was like the boy who was skeptical at first, but jumped on to see what the fuss was all about. <br/><br/>I just wasted $10 and two hours of my life. <br/><br/>I can't even begin to explain the pain in my stomach. The Polar Express was so painful to sit through it's not even funny. There's no story. There's no pay off. You sit there through these series of events and you wonder ""is there any point to all this?"" It'd be one thing if the scenes were entertaining... but they're not.<br/><br/>This movie is void of any emotion, any soul, any ounce of plausibility, and most of all: any fun. This movie is NOT FUN. <br/><br/>And let's talk about the way these characters look for a second. Saying that it's the same technology (motion, I'm sorry, ""PERFORMANCE"" capture) used to make Gollum is a real shame because Gollum was Believable!!! Photo-realism just does not translate well in this medium. You're using animation, why not design the characters to be more expressive? Or why not just film it all with real actors? They certainly COULD have. We as people know all too well how we walk, talk, interact with things. Seeing it on the screen done unconvincingly is not impressive. Caricatures done convincingly is all the more believable, as The Incredibles has proved. The result of The Polar Express now is as if they took corpses of dead children and turned them into puppets. They're moving and talking, but where's the heart? Where's the soul? That's what we're seeing on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so horrible! <br/><br/>There's a scene early in the movie where the boy takes a girl's train ticket from her seat because she got up and left it. He wants to give it to her but you sit there going ""why??!"" Just leave it.. she's coming back! He of course loses the ticket and ""adventure"" ensues. And then there's a boy who's stuck in the back of the train all the time, and they bring him hot chocolate, but he can't come up and join the rest of the kids? And then there's this annoying ""know it all"" kid with the voice of a 35 year old. It's all so very disturbing. <br/><br/>Oh and there's songs! One girl goes into the back of the train where the lonely kid is. He's singing a song to himself. And then she interrupts and joins in! They end the song as they're holding hands, looking into each others eyes as if they were lovers. Very awkward. I won't even go into details about the song about serving hot chocolate while waiters dance around the train. ""keep it hot keep it hot!"" The one scene where Tom Hanks slides on his knees with his arms stretched up in the air has to be one of the most memorably BAD scenes in the history of bad scenes. <br/><br/>I have to stop now or I'll just kill myself. I need to watch something crappy to cleanse the palette. Yes... crappy is better than The Polar Express. <br/><br/>""The one thing about trains, it doesn't matter where you're going, what matters is deciding to get on.""<br/><br/>Don't get on this one. For the love of God, I have decided for you! This is just another film taken from a children's book stretched incredibly thin into movie form. It happened with the Grinch and The Cat in the Hat and those were horrible also. But who can blame them? I bet if I took the book, The Berenstein Bears' Too Much Junk Food, and turned that into a feature film, it'd probably be pretty dull also. But at least... there'd be a story and a point, which is what The Polar Express is so lacking of."
"nancyb-9","2","42","91","5 January 2005"," Creepy Cold and Charmless
","I'll give this movie three ""C""s for Creepy, Cold, and Charmless.<br/><br/>Someone commented that the movie might be better titled ""Night of the Living Dead"" for the creepy ""possessed"" look of the characters. I'll second that.<br/><br/>The action was typical 2004  something wild and dangerous happening constantly, never a dull moment in which to think or feel. If you've raised your kids on video games, they'll love it.<br/><br/>And the message? Well, at the very beginning the father tells the main character ""Santa Claus is as real as Christmas."" If that's true, then I guess Christmas is truly nothing more than a giant gift-giving extravaganza. The ""poor boy"" tells the other kids that he's always found Christmas disappointing -- presumably because he's never had much in the way of gifts. At the end of the movie, he finally ecstatically embraces Christmas  in the form of a huge present. <br/><br/>The best Christmas show every made, in my opinion, was the less than ½ hour original ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" by Dr. Seuss. The sum-it-up message of THAT show was:<br/><br/>""Christmas Day is in our grasp/ As long as we have hands to clasp.<br/><br/>Welcome Christmas while we stand/ Heart to heart and hand in hand."" <br/><br/>""The Polar Express"" is all about belief  but not belief in the miracle of the birth of Jesus Christ  not even belief in the beauty of Christmas itself. It's about believing in the big fat guy in the red suit and confidence that you'll find a pile of presents under that tree come Christmas morning. That kind of Christmas can easily be stolen by any Grinch."

","I absolutely love this movie. It is one of the best movies to teach children, and adults alike, about the spirit of Christmas. This also might help kids to understand how the ""magic"" of Christmas is possible and how Santa Claus is able to visit all of the good children around the world in one single night. If you truly believe, then you will hear the bell too. Do you still hear the bells of Christmas? What would you do if on Christmas Eve you heard the sound of a train, the Polar Express, outside your window? Would you go and investigate? Would you climb on board? This is exactly what the hero in the movie does. While he feels he is too old to believe in Santa Claus, he climbs on board the Polar Express anyway. While on board he meets several other kids who are going to the North Pole to see Santa Claus as well. While he still does not believe, he finds it harder and harder to keep up with his beliefs that Santa Claus is not real. This is the kind of Christmas movie that families should sit down and watch together."
"ericsinclair3","10","5","7","15 January 2012"," The polar Express rekindles the Christmas magic that us adults lost many years ago.
","Rarely does a movie let you forget who you are and become the main character. This is one of those rare movies.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with a story that every Santa believer experienced. On Christmas eve a boy in Grand Rapids Michigan has reached the age where the statistical impossibility in the Santa story ( the size and speed of Santa's sleigh, the north pole being a barren wasteland) are causing him to doubt the big mans existence. Not knowing for sure the boy drifts into a deep sleep. At 11:55 PM the boy is awakened by the arrival of the Polar Express literally outside his front door. Going to investigate what is going on the boy meets the witty conductor of the Christmas eve train. (Tom Hanks)who informs him that the train is headed to the north pole so the kids can meet Santa Clause. Not totally sure that the train is going to the north pole but to curious to let it go the boy climbs on board. The adventure puts the boy in contact with a girl who is a natural born leader and who's belief in the Christmas magic couldn't be stronger. Other characters include a know it all socially awkward boy, a young underprivileged loner who has never experienced the magic of Christmas and a cast of other more mysterious characters such a a hobo ghost. Through the adventure the combination of great music, flawless animation and fantastic dialog really make you believe you are there and let you relive those days when you thought Santa Clause just might exist. The story ends on Christmas day with a line (narrated by Tom Hanks) about belief that brings back those kid on Christmas eve chills all over again. The themes of belief and friendship are a strong theme in the movie and part of the magic that brings you back to a time when you did believe.Its a great movie for children and adults alike and rekindles the Christmas magic that us adults lost many years ago."

One word of warning to parents of small children: a few scenes might frighten them. Several parents told me that after today's screening.

That's the way he should be presented. Santa is much bigger and taller than you could ever imagine. Of course, he was taller than the elves, but also the adults at the North Pole.<br/><br/>He had that commanding voice and spirit in his face.

"dee.reid","10","6","9","29 December 2004"," ""The Polar Express"" is a fun, magical ride into your childhood imagination
","It was December 24th, 1994; I was 9 years-old. I lay awake anxiously in bed, as the waking hours of Christmas Day slowly approached. My parents were sound asleep two doors down from my bedroom. A bunch of fans we had were still on (the slow setting), but in the otherwise calm darkness, I could pretty much hear everything downstairs.<br/><br/>Now I'm still not quite sure of it, because maybe I was dreaming or my imagination was in overdrive, but I thought I heard the fireplace door in our living room open and close, and the shuffling around of a large, heavy sack. Was that what I think it was? Could be, or could it have been my over-active imagination at its most deceitful?<br/><br/>That's kind of the dilemma that some children face around that age, when the question of whether or not there really is a Santa Claus is open for question. I'm sure lots of children have laid anxiously awake at night in bed for some sort of sign that the jolly fat guy with a beard and a bunch of flying reindeer and presents is flying around in a sleigh out there somewhere. Some may even leave milk and cookies on Christmas Eve and be surprised to find them all gone the next morning. Santa, were you here?<br/><br/>""The Polar Express"" stretches beyond the limits of the imagination and goes out of its dear way to prove to children that seeing is always believing. Robert Zemeckis, who directed the film, which is an adaptation of the award-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, believes in the story the same way that young children do: the ideas presented match their own beliefs that there really is life at the North Pole and that Santa is always keeping a watchful eye on kids all across the globe.<br/><br/>Even though I'm 19 now, this film reawakened my long-dormant curiosity in the subject, and I'm sure that any adult that views this movie with an open mind might feel the same. But again, the notion that there is a Santa Claus and life at the North Pole is just a childhood fantasy; I know this, and most other adults do too, but there's nothing stopping them from rekindling their youth.<br/><br/>Still, however, this film almost brought tears to my eyes on a few occasions because it was a brilliant realization of something that I thought had been lost to me forever. This film does bring back the magic of Christmas, especially during the dark times of the 2004 world we live in today. We'd need something like this to escape into, to realize our dreams and long-forgotten fantasies about a time when innocence still ruled the world.<br/><br/>Van Allsburg's ""The Polar Express"" is one of the best known books in children's literature, and one of the most daring in exploring a child's fantasy. In the late-night hours of Christmas Eve, Hero Boy (we never actually learn his name in the movie) lies awake in his bed, anxiously waiting for a sign - Santa Claus.<br/><br/>And then his father says, who thinks that Hero Boy is sound asleep, ""Only an express could wake him up."" Sure enough, what at first feels like an earthquake only proves to be a massive locomotive called the ""Polar Express,"" which roars down the snowbound street where Hero Boy lives.<br/><br/>Not believing his eyes, he ventures out into the cold night to see what's what. The Conductor (played and voiced by Tom Hanks, in just one of six roles throughout the film, including Hero Boy), ushers him on board, where he's introduced to the other children, including Hero Girl, Know-It-All, and Lonely Boy, who is the last child they pick up on their journey.<br/><br/>From there on, it's a rough, fast-paced journey to the North Pole, a place that Hero Boy once thought only existed in his youthful imagination. Upon arrival, the quartet of children embark on a wondrous path of excitement, fun, and belief as they explore their innermost feelings about a beloved character in their dreams.<br/><br/>Christmas is the most beloved holiday of the year, especially for children, who wait excitedly for the morning hours to see what a year of patience has brought them underneath their heavily decorated trees; I know I used to, and still do.<br/><br/>Whether you're 90, or 9, Christmas has a magic that never goes away because that little kid in you will always be there, eagerly waiting for that sign - that special little detail that's overlooked by others but is caught in your ever-watchful attention - that maybe, the big fat guy you've always dreamed of, is out there delivering gifts to children all over the world.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Rectangular_businessman","1","61","141","16 January 2007"," This is vile
","""The Polar Express "" was an awful movie. What makes this movie worst is the hypocrisy to present itself as a innocent,s sugary and harmless tale for children about the ""true "" meaning of Christmas. I never read the book of Chris Van Allsburg in what it was inspired, but the most disappointing is that it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, the same director who made the great animated film ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"", an excellent movie where he proved that the animation could be appreciated for kids and adults as well, while in this movie it seems that he was victim of his own ambition and he give too much importance to give the characters impressive level of detail and ""realism"" rather than a interesting story. <br/><br/>Everything from this movie seems to be so artificial and lifeless:Despite the ""realistic"" appearance of the characters, they look more like creepy mannequins with eyes made of glass rather than living beings.<br/><br/>But the worst part of ""The Polar Express"" is the ""message"" in this movie, which is just vile. For example, in one scene, where one kid refuses to enter into the Polar Express, the character that looks like Tom Hanks makes a gesture like saying ""you are stupid for not accepting my offering "". There is also the scene where the diversity token girl says something like the toys were so ""warm "" and things like that. All the movie the kids keep talking about how big would be the gifts that Santa would give to them . There is even a song about that.<br/><br/>Filled with lots of irrelevant scenes and annoying characters (Not to mention the horrible songs) the movie ends with the main character finally discovering the ""true"" meaning of Christmas (Or whatever): Guess what it is? The gifts! it is true that many Christmas movies have hidden subtexts and messages like that ,but ""The Polar Express "" it's completely shameless about celebrating materialism and greed.<br/><br/>I don't think that ""The Polar Express"" were a very appropriate film for the kids,because if is that what the kids would learn, I don't want to think how would be our future."

The most amazing CGI is with the Driver and the engineer, in there scenes of hilarity Dreamworks CGI took their time in making sure that this was perfect and it was.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks you can't beat him nowadays, he's made it to an all time great actor, you know that Tom Hanks is almost every voice in this film (over exaggerated) 10/10 great voice work from the old chap.<br/><br/>Personally I doubt a more sense of spirit, magic and feeling of Christmas in a film will occur anytime in the next decade, well done!"

","The movie has excellent computer animation, but it is all kind of cold. I found problems with the story. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how faithful the movie is to it, but expect that since the author co-produced the movie, it is faithful to his book. It's a secular take on Christmas aimed at kids, so it wants us to believe that the true meaning of Christmas is believing in Santa Claus, and that means giving and getting. But the kids in the movie mainly want to get. Presents. Even the short bit from the black girl giving friendship is kind of lost, and that also, while a very good thing, is not the true meaning of Christmas. That was conveyed a lot better in another secular take on Christmas, the 1938 Reginald Owen version of Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol."" Sure a 3-year-old kid would love POLAR EXPRESS. It makes him believe Christmas is Santa Claus and getting presents. This movie does an excellent job of perpetuating the commercialism of Christmas, which is not the right direction for the Polar Express to go."

Too bad the novelty wears off in what, the first minute?<br/><br/>The train is filled with the most annoying bunch of kids you'll ever hear.

","I just watched this with my kids last night. I'm sorry, but I just can't square this Santa and North Pole with a standard like that of ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer."" In ""Rudolph"" it was full of love and humor, forgiveness and humility. This Polar Express version is dark, authoritarian, and punitive. I also can't believe it earned a ""G"" rating with so much excessive danger and stressful suspense (train on the ice, Christmas star nearly killing an elf, etc) - my three-year old got scared and had to turn her head six times! How awful! (She kept coming back because her 6-year old brother was still watching.)<br/><br/>In ""Polar Express"" the conductor, Santa and the elves are humorless and of a ""law and order"" mentality that is prim and schoolmarmish - this is Christmas Eve, guys! Loosen up! And what is with Santa, anyway? He clearly has a messianic complex that is fed by the uniformed cheers of thousands of sycophantic elves at the Nazi rally - er, midnight takeoff of the sleigh - when he makes his appearance. And when Santa confronts the kid who picks up the lost reindeer bell, why so impolite? The boy picks up the bell and then Santa appears out of nowhere and towers over him, and the kid turns around and is obviously scared - c'mon, it's SANTA, people! - and what does Santa do? No introductions, or ""Hello, I'm Santa, what's your name?"" Instead, he says, ""What did you say?"" in a very accusatory manner. What a jerk! But then, he runs a Bushian North Pole that has secret video monitors on every kid alive, conveniently priming tomorrow's kids for a future with no privacy. From saintly divine judgment to a petty spy: that's this Santa. Imagine Soup Nazi mates with Santa (woah), and you have this guy.<br/><br/>So I give this 2 stars because there IS some lip service to the real message of Christmas (what, it's not about just getting stuff?) and the graphics of the train (especially the hot chocolate sequence - that is actually excellent) are good in a Fritz Lang sort of way. But if you want the spirit of Christmas, this is NOT the movie."

","About an hour ago, I got back from seeing the Polar Express movie in 3-D at the new Jordan's furniture in Reading, Massachusetts. I have to say, it was without question the most amazing, monumental achievement in movie-making history that I have ever witness with my own eyes. Up until this point, I would have said the most ""amazing"" movie (and I choose my words carefully) was the Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (even though that wasn't my ""favorite"" movie, I have to admit it was absolutely amazing). Well, Polar Express 3-D blows that away.<br/><br/>I am a 34-year-old grown man. But I have to admit, I got quite teary-eyed during several scenes - not just because the scenes were sad, or happy, or whatever, but because they were just so AMAZING to watch, I literally couldn't handle it. I have never seen anything like this movie before. Even though it was 100% computer-animated, the scenes looked more ""real"" than real-life itself (if this is even possible). The colors, textures, and detail in the characters and surroundings absolutely blew away previous ""wow, this movie is awesome"" films such as Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., and even Shrek 2. <br/><br/>But the catch is, you've GOT to see it in 3-D. You will NOT be disappointed. I will be remembering and talking about this amazing masterpiece of a movie for many years to come."

The book is about fifteen pages long. Stretching it into a 100-minute movie was always going to involve a lot of padding.<br/><br/>What's not to like?<br/><br/>The CG work: all the things that are difficult to model are done badly; the hair, the fabric. The actual faces look creepy and unreal.<br/><br/>The train: when he was plugging the film on 'Letterman', Tom Hanks made a point of mentioning that America doesn't really have trains anymore. What it does have, is rollercoasters in theme parks. This train behaves like one of those, up impossible gradients and round tight corners. <br/><br/>And you can't steer trains: an error not seen since 'The Titfield Thunderbolt'<br/><br/>The plot: the climax in a town square filled with red-suited elves is bearable only because the scene is nostalgically reminiscent of Mayday in Red Square in the days of the Soviet Union, an impression reinforced by the old Communist anthem played on the soundtrack (also known as 'Oh Tannenbaum').<br/><br/>And I think I noticed about nine notes out of Cliff Richard's evergreen hit 'Summer Holiday' sneaked inappropriately in there.<br/><br/>Oh, and yes I did see the 3D version.

","Much like Final Fantasy, if you look at a still shot - it doesn't look so bad. But when the people start moving, it's utterly horrifying. Uneven jerky motions, frightening lack of emotion, and lack of a feel of life in the face gives me the creeps. The characters do not even appear ALIVE/organic.<br/><br/>I saw a preview screening with my daughter, who actually fell asleep! She was not at all engaged. For the record, I thought her to be easily engaged by both Pixar-esque films as well as a number of the 'bad' 2D films like Sinbad.<br/><br/>The lighting is painful, giving the children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin at a campfire. The lip syncing is bad - worse actually than Final Fantasy. <br/><br/>I also seriously question having Hanks play five characters.... this was a major distraction throughout the film. The role of the conductor is eerie - although in a way I just can't pinpoint. It reminds me of my father's fake ""phone"" voice when greeting clients.<br/><br/>I think this is why the multiple roles are distracting - you are accutely aware that the voice is the same, but yet distinctly different. It gives each character the feel of being ACTED, as opposed to being real human characters. The illusion of reality is broken by the multiple role playing of Hanks. I've seen the technique work - a la Eddie Murphy, but Hanks just can't come close to pulling it off with a voice alone, given the horrifying animation.<br/><br/>I would not waste my money on this - wait for the rental."

","I would first like to name the positive aspects of the film, as to make it fair: The characters were wonderfully rendered. Tom Hanks did a good job and, unlike others, I didn't find them to be creepy. The backgrounds were great. You could almost feel the cold of the night while watching. The most delicious eye-candy available.<br/><br/>But that's where it ends. First of all, the message they were trying to pass was one of believing in Christmas. I'm sorry, but it's a rather bad faith you're giving us. The poor boy, who always hated Christmas for not getting presents, finally accepts it - and it's a huge present. They added some completely perfect black girl. C'mon, I don't tolerate racism, but this kind of political correctness makes me just as sick. The nerd kid was amusing, but somewhat a cliché. What I mean is that the message is one of the true meaning of Christmas being presents. That is sickening. Children are already spoiled and materialistic enough, why give them more of that. <br/><br/>The musical numbers were completely embarrassing, and the way they just added and added to the original story made the movie look disjointed. They turned some little Christmas story into a roller-coaster of action sequences, disjointed scenes and a corruption of the true meaning of Christmas. <br/><br/>It's natural that only children can hear the bell, since it stands for the materialistic and commercial aspect of Christmas."
"Pecosa","1","17","42","27 November 2004"," What a disappointment!
","I should preface by saying that I'm a major sucker for anything Christmasy or full of magic - Miracle on 34th Street, most Disney feature cartoons, movie musicals, that sort of thing. So I expected this to be something I would really enjoy. Boy, was I wrong! <br/><br/>First off, the movie wandered, all but plot less. I had wondered how they'd make a full-length movie out of a book as short as The Polar Express. Now I know; they stre-t-c-h-ed out the train ride itself by coming up with event after event that stopped the train or put the protagonist in danger but didn't contribute to the overall story.<br/><br/>Secondly, there was a serious problem in the balance of sound. The sounds of the train and the music were extremely loud - one member of my group watched half the movie with her fingers in her ears - but the conversation was so quiet that we couldn't hear most of it and couldn't understand what we did hear. When we complained to the management, we found out that the movie's sound is recorded in two different ways - train and music in DTS, dialogue in mono. Older theaters don't have the capability of adjusting one without the other, which means they're stuck with extreme balance problems like the one we encountered. If you must see this film, make sure you go to a swanky new facility!<br/><br/>Lastly, what plot there was often proved difficult to follow. I'm twenty-two and was lost a good part of the time (who's that guy? where'd he go? why is the kid climbing on top of the train?). If adults don't get it, how can small children possibly understand what's going on?<br/><br/>Okay, the animation was excellent. I have to give it that; I was really impressed. I also must admit that my party got up and left after about forty minutes, so maybe the movie does redeem itself, provided you're not experiencing the sound problems that we were. But even if it did get better, I'd have trouble recommending any film where I suffered through the first third of it, checking my watch every five minutes.<br/><br/>Instant Christmas classic? You've got to be kidding."
"AFfatwreck13","1","10","22","26 November 2005"," A poorly constructed plot with vague hints at a moral.
","I would confidently call this the worst movie I have ever seen, but unfortunately, I have seen Manos: the Hands of Fate.<br/><br/>But in terms of badness to money spent to make the movie, this takes the cake. The movie starts out with a kid getting on a train by himself because some guy promised to take him to see Santa. That's a great lesson to teach kids. It's like a kidnapper's dream. But anyway, he gets on the train, and they take him to a place where an old guys has video of children all over the world sleeping. Sound suspicious to you? The movie also glorifies ""Man"". Yep, the man, as discussed in School of Rock. The conductor of the train is portrayed as a good guy, but when you look at him, he's really just an uptight authority figure who's constantly telling people what to do. The main character is taught that he should blindly follow what others, namely authority figures, tell him. He freaks out over the slightest bending of rules (such as his friend leaving her ticket at her seat when she gets up).<br/><br/>Additionally, this movie features a poorly constructed plot. The first hour or so consists of wildly UN-entertaining sequences of inaction, mostly to take up time until they get to the main part of the movie. These anti-climactic events are thrown in randomly, and really play no role in the bigger picture. Thrown in is a mysterious ghost/hobo, who, like mostly everything in the first hour, has nothing to do with anything.<br/><br/>The theme of the movie is believing. The metaphor used for this is hinted at in the opening lines, and later in the middle of the movie for a little bit, and at the very end. The rest of the movie is just filler. And completely boring filler for that matter.<br/><br/>Overall, these add up to one of the most annoying and UN-entertaining movies I've seen in a long time. The people I watched it with liked it, saying it was ""cute"". Cute is puppies in a field of flowers. This movie was an annoying excuse to show off some rather spectacular animation (I'll give them that). It's not that I have something against children's movies. There are many great ones out there, namely The Incredibles, Toy Story, The Lion King, and many more. This one however, does not rank up there with them."

As a fan of Tom Hanks, I was not disappointed; he dominates the film in many characters. Though some could see this as a negative excess, each was done with a different touch and sometimes even his voice was not recognizable. There are lessons for children throughout. My only caution--this is not for young children; though dark edges of the adventure and some elements could be scary, there are no villains or horrible creatures. Even so, the topic and scenes are perhaps best for 8-12 year olds, and old codgers like me."

","I will no doubt be accused of being a Scrooge, but I'm afraid that, for me, ""The Polar Express"" was no more than a snow job. Far from arousing my Christmas spirit, the film merely reminded me how much the holiday has been over-sentimentalized and over-commercialized.<br/><br/>The instrumental and song score alone was enough to have me muttering ""Bah, humbug!"" The music was so in your face that I could almost see the orchestra, especially the string section. It was bad enough having to endure Tom Hanks as the train conductor, without having to contend with the orchestra conductor into the bargain. And then there were all those snippets of classic Christmas carols, both as snatches of the instrumental score and as voiced by Judy Garland, Bing Crosby and the Andrews sisters. They may not have been roasting on an open fire, but they were chestnuts indeed.<br/><br/>If I had to sum up ""The Polar Express"" in one word, it would be ""annoying"". Instead of telling a story from beginning to end, it seems to go off in all directions, or at least constantly off on a tangent. The stage business of the train ticket carried hither and thither by the winter wind seems suspiciously like an excuse for the animators to show us how very clever they are (""Look, Ma, no hands!""). I was most definitely NOT impressed by the human figures. To my eye, they looked like nothing so much as wax dummies from Madame Tussaud's, and they moved jerkily as well. I might as well as have been watching the string puppets in ""Team America: World Police"".<br/><br/>There was, to be honest, only one moment when ""The Polar Express"" evoked any real emotion in this reviewer's breast, and that came almost at the very end, when the train conductor punches the children's tickets with a special message for each one.<br/><br/>""The Polar Express"" takes a host of Christmas traditions and milks them for all their worth. But -- for this critic, at least -- the end result is as flat, warmed-over, and even sour-tasting as a glass of milk left standing overnight for a Santa who never comes."

She told me that I probably felt that way since it's aimed for kids. I had to disagree on this one since I noticed a lot of the kids were getting restless while watching this movie.<br/><br/>A really easy way to judge if a 'kids' movie is a good 'kids' movie is simply watching them in the theater. About 30 minutes into Polar Express I noticed that the kids around me (ranging from about 4-12) started doing more then just ask their parents basic little kid questions, they started wiggling around in their seats in that 'I'm bored' fashion little kids do. Then throw in they started asking the really confused questions since they couldn't tell visually what was going on (little kids don't really pay much attention to dialogue unless it's a really funny one liner or mixed in w/ slapstick humor)<br/><br/>Now if you're about to jump all over me stating that this is just what little kids do, since they've got the attention spans of goldfish, I'll have to disagree. The week prior I saw The Incredibles, and the reaction of the kids in that audience was the complete opposite of what I sat thru in Polar Express. In The Incredibles the only thing I really dealt w/ was kids hoopin and hollering to all the excitement, action & slapstick going on. I don't remember any kids breaking out in tears because they started getting bored, or bothering anybody w/ goofy questions because they couldn't tell what was going on. Instead, they just sat back & had a really good time.<br/><br/>So what have I learned from all this My general opinion of this movie fits the general opinion of the audience it was aimed towards. The movie is drawn out and boring."

","This is the movie for our time: In which not Believing, even in the absence of evidence, even in the presence of evidence to the contrary, is seen as a failing, as a sign of personal limitation. A movie in which thousands of male-only elves gather Nuremberg-style in the vast brick factory town in which they are enslaved and cheeringly salute their huge radiant white master as he emerges from his palace. In which the only annoying character, the only source of even the slightest conflict or disharmony, is a big-nosed glasses-wearing wiry-haired know-it-all kid--a classic and offensive representation of The Jew. In which a character actually says, without irony, that the true spirit of Christmas is what's in your heart. It's also ridiculously badly plotted and conceived. There isn't the slightest threat at any time, there isn't even the simplest reason given for why the train has to be on time -- not even an old standard like getting the gifts to the kids to the good children on the other side of the hill. So all the chutes and ladder chases, while fun at first, and gorgeous (the runaway ticket sequence is in itself a classic, exciting piece of film-making), get screamingly boring because A: nothing bad is going to happen if the heroes fall and B: nothing good is going to happen if they succeed. The first fifteen minutes are fantastic--even kind of rapturous--because for that amount of time it works like Van Allsburg's books do: the pure wondrous delight of the images. But what follows is devoid of humor, irony, authentic wonder or compelling storytelling, and also gives us the sappiest most forgettable songs imaginable. Did the filmmakers--who have done such spectacular work on other films--fail to note that Shrek didn't go for 50's greeting card melodies--that Shrek used an oddball, relatively obscure Leonard Cohen song, sung by the ironic, out-of-the-mainstream Rufus Wainright, to back up the love montage? It says something really good about our country that Shrek, with its irreverent humor and authentic sense of wonder, is going to beat the red velvet pants off the box office of Polar Express."

The story and idea themselves are creepy- it's a peculiarly adult fantasy, not a child's -- and the fact that the characters are so realistically rendered only makes it creepier... the kids seem more like the ""not quite right"" zombie children of a Stephen King horror movie, than like book illustrations come to life. As in the first ""Final Fantasy"" movie, the illusion of life is powerful enough that it strains the suspension of disbelief that cartoons normally have, and in its place creates the uneasy feeling of not being sure *what* we are watching.. only that it's *something that was never meant to be alive* which is really disturbing and freaky. And scary, for a kid.<br/><br/>It's a shame because obviously a lot of loving care and technical brilliance went into this very expensive movie.. but as family fare, it's a total misfire."

","Let's not kid ourselves, a children's movie has to have sparkly colors and a relatively short run time. However, this movie contains both, but the writing for an almost wordless children's book tends to be a bit stretched. Moreover, the dialogue is not needed and is detrimental to this movie. This movie should be just a short film that contains no sound, but still beautiful images.<br/><br/>Mentioning images brings me to my second gripe. In the TV show ""30 Rock"" Tracy Morgan mentions the creepy valley: The creepy valley is that animations that are lifelike to a fault tend to be frightening. The movie's characters tend to fall into the creepy valley, which again could be cured by using simple, austere animating techniques.<br/><br/>Overall it's not a bad movie and it's definitely worth a rental, especially those of you who have children. Be forewarned though, it contains a lot of Christian messages and if you are uncomfortable exposing your children to that, stay away!"

","""The Polar Express"" is a magical and distinguish animated film directed by the great Robert Zemeckis.<br/><br/>This is a different kind of animated movie because it looks almost real (mostly the characters and the sceneries). No wonder it looks so realistic because, after all, it is entirely live action using performance capture technology. As a consequence, the graphics are amazing and the movie is technically admirable. Plus, the visuals/sceneries/backgrounds are terrific, the special effects are amazing, the magic is naturally present, the Christmas carols are nice and catchy and the movie has lots of adventure, strong emotions and suspense. A formidable combination of loud sounds is another quality. Definitely approved.<br/><br/>""The Polar Express"" is also a remarkable film for Tom Hanks's career. He plays 5 different roles in this movie (the Hero Boy, the conductor, the Hobo, Santa Claus and the Hero Boy's father). By the way, the conductor really looks like Tom Hanks, except that the conductor has a mustache and is bald. Anyway, as I was saying, if it's already admirable to see an actor playing 5 roles, even more incredible is when that actor is Tom Hanks. Usually I find Tom Hanks a weak actor, but he is very good here.<br/><br/>This is, without a doubt, one of the finest Christmas's films ever made. Has everything to become a classic. Remember when we all used to believe in Christmas's magic and in Jolly Old Saint Nicholas? This movie brings us back this special Christmas spirit and some of the best memories from childhood. It even makes us want to believe again and hear the soft sound of the silver bell.<br/><br/>A curious and original detail about this motion picture it that most of the characters's names aren't mentioned, except for Billy and Sarah. I'd like to talk a bit about the characters.<br/><br/>First of all, the Hero Boy. He wants to believe in Christmas's magic and it's admirable how he ends up believing in Santa and all of the Christmas's magic. He is a nice and interesting character.<br/><br/>The Hero Girl also adds a lot to this movie. Not only is she a sweet character, but above all things she befriends with the Hero Boy and Billy, helping them to restore their faith on Christmas.<br/><br/>Billy is a gloomy and shy little boy who believes that he is «the little boy that Santa Claus forgot» and he has serious difficulties to trust on Christmas's magic at first... but the Hero Girl and the Hero Boy help him through this journey.<br/><br/>""Know-it-all"" is the typical intellectual boy. He is wise, smart and intelligent, but nerdy, funny, very talkative (he speaks very quickly too), impatient and he can be a little boring at times. But even this character changes his attitudes. By the end, he becomes more calm, patient and ""humble"".<br/><br/>The Conductor has amazing talents with the tickets. He writes words on them without even looking at them. Simply amazing!<br/><br/>The Hobo is a mysterious and enigmatic character. He does have a great sense of humor and he is also one of the heroes in this Christmas's tale.<br/><br/>""The Polar Express"" isn't an absolutely perfect film. Its negative side (from my point of view) includes the two engineers who happen to be ridiculous characters. Besides, I don't see what's the point of that Aerosmith's song and Steven Tyler's presence in a Christmas story (at least it's only for a brief moment). The Santa Claus looks okay, but a little... artificial? Could be a little better. But, overall, this is a wonderful movie. It's the movie of the year 2004.<br/><br/>This should definitely be on Top 250."

In fact, this boy, known only as the Hero Boy, has become disillusioned with many things about Christmas. Still, he wants to believe in Santa, so when a mysterious train appears and the conductor tells him that it's the Polar Express, he decides to come aboard.<br/><br/>Once on-board, the Hero Boy is in for a wild adventure. He meets the Hero Girl (an intelligent, confident personality filled with warmth) and the Know-it-All Boy (who's always ready with his opinion and facts that nobody really wants.) However, the Lonely Boy (Billy) that he meets may be the most important character of all.<br/><br/>Christmas just never seems to work out for Billy. He doesn't really have anyone to care for him and Santa has never come to his house. In fact, when the Polar Express comes to 11334 Edbrook Avenue, Billy very nearly doesn't board. The Hero Boy has to pull the emergency brake to stop the train. This greatly displeases the train's Conductor, who runs a tight schedule, but his hardness softens when he learns why the Hero Boy pulled the brake.<br/><br/>The Hero Girl and Billy sing ""When Christmas Comes to Town"" in which Billy expresses why the holidays don't work for him and they both share their hopes and dreams for the holidays. Eventually the train reaches --- you're not dreaming! --- the North Pole. There, the four children get into a wild adventure, that culminates with a meeting with, well, guess-who.<br/><br/>""The Polar Express"" uses motion-capture animation to bring semi-realistic characters to life. Tom Hanks provides the performances for not only the Conductor character, but also the Hero Boy, Santa Claus and a vagrant ghost who haunts the train. The voice cast is wonderful and Hanks's own rich voice adds a lot to the film as well.<br/><br/>To go with its great story, animation and characters, ""The Polar Express"" features a top-notch soundtrack, both vocal and instrumental. Songs include the previously mentioned ""When Christmas Comes to Town,"" as well as ""Hot Chocolate,"" ""Spirit of the Season"" and Josh Groban's ""Believe"" among others. I was pleased that ABC Family retained the songs and music in the closing credits and resisted the temptation to do the ridiculous split-screen that so many networks do these days. One other great thing is that this film also includes classic tunes by artists such as Bing Crosby.<br/><br/>If I had one complaint, it would be that I think the animators were a bit too impressed with what they could do with the CGI at times. There were some extended visual sequences that caused the film to drag a bit and seemed mainly for effect. Otherwise, magical film. Some people say it was only a dream. I say, if that's so, then I hope it was the shared dream of all children or something like that. If that weren't the case, then the journeys of the Hero Girl, Know-it-All Boy and Billy characters wouldn't be as meaningful."

Amazingly, none of the characters (except Santa) have names - but so enthralling is the film that you don't even notice until the ending credits! Tom Hanks gives an inspired performance as the voice of many of the lead characters. Perfect not just for children, but also for adults. My parents (50) and I (18) went to see it and loved it enough to see it again in 3D. I advise you especially to go see it in IMAX 3D - stunning is the only word. The film is made for 3D, with the train appearing to be coming out of the screen at you. Summary: The Polar Express is a masterpiece of a Christmas film. Not too long, but enough so that you feel all of the loose ends have been tied up."

"Malvale","Null","4","7","14 November 2004"," This movie sucks.
","The script is subpar, as you will see in the many awkward silences between the stilted dialogue. It goes to great lengths to impress you, and this movie wastes no opportunity to bombard viewers with that pretentious score. It got old very quick. The most defining trait of classic animated movies, though, is the memorability of its characters. The drones in this movies, though carefully placed into predictable archetypes, are not charismatic in the least. Tom Hank's character is the only one that comes close, and he wasn't even that good. Santa wasn't warm and cuddly, he was a big freaky looking guy. The songs were both of the made-for-TV quality, namely the first one, which was probably played so fast so viewers wouldn't realize how bad it was. The second was empty fluff recycled from countless Christmas films. <br/><br/>And ""believe"" has got to be the most overused word in movies, period.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money. The little kids I was with didn't even seem to enjoy it. Go see ""The Incredibles"" instead."

"psquires26","3","8","19","14 January 2005"," This film was much too violent and frightening for young children
","I attended the movie with my 6 year old twin daughters. One sat mesmerized, albeit with her hands over her ears at times. The other became horrified as the movie progressed into a series of terrifying scenes of near-miss train wrecks, with frightening, ghoulish and decidedly hard-hearted characters who seemed even scarier because they more closely resembled real people than cartoon characters. I was torn because one of my girls was panic-stricken and wanted desperately to leave the theater, but the other was too young to leave alone by herself. I kept hoping the ghoulish scenarios would soon end, but they seemed to continue and continue until I wondered if this was really the warm-hearted magical movie I had expected or some sort of strange, twisted joke. FINALLY, after the climax of horror when a (very real-looking) man with a very long beard was literally tortured into whinnying an unearthly shriek over and over again as his beard was cruelly pulled, the negativity stopped and the ""magic"" I had hoped to bring my children to see and experience began. Thank goodness my daughter was thus able to take something positive from this experience. Had I known beforehand, however, I never would have brought her in the first place. The ugliness and cruelty went on for far too long. I would not take a child under the age of 9 to this film. There is so much callousness in the world, why harden children like this with these type of experiences? It was all so unnecessary. Why take a beautiful book like the Polar Express and sabotage it in this way?"

","Against my better judgment my three-year-old son was taken to see The Polar Express this weekend. <br/><br/>Five minutes into the movie he screamed and begged to go home. And he's not a particularly cowardly toddler.<br/><br/>This G-rated movie is incredibly LOUD, violently kinetic, and a total sensory overload - completely inappropriate for young children. I got to see the rest of the movie after my son was taken home, and time after time I was amazed by scenes that were far more frightening than the one that first terrified my boy. He'd never have made it through without major trauma.<br/><br/>Perhaps a five-year-old could handle it - but they would have to be pretty desensitized. <br/><br/>For myself, the virtual actors were creepy, the elves at the North Pole scenes were disturbingly reminiscent of Nazi propaganda films, and the writing was disappointingly poor. The whole thing felt like a very deliberate, cynical attempt to manufacture a Christmas classic, but throughout the movie it was impossible to miss the set-ups for future roller-coaster theme rides and products.<br/><br/>Why does Hollywood feel it necessary to blast moviegoers into insensibility? And why, why, WHY don't they understand that good writing is the core of a movie? The television version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"" was wonderful and heartwarming. The atrocity that was Jim Carrey's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" was just awful. Why? Writing, more than anything. That, and the apparent belief that loud sounds and abundant special effects are all that's needed to make a good movie.<br/><br/>People in Hollywood need to be chained into a theater showing all the incredible, well-written movies made without seat-shaking audio and computer-generated effects: movies like Casablanca, The Third Man, A Christmas Story, and even relatively lowbrow (but well-written) movies like Used Cars. But of course, Roger Zemekis directed and CO-WROTE Used Cars. What happened? What's his excuse for The Polar Express?"

There are several Derpy kid faces, weird lip sync issues, and several creepy uncanny valley faces.<br/><br/>The story is taken from a children's story book, so I didn't expect very much. However there are several moments of obvious fluff scenes that exist simply to pad the running time. the scenes that come to mind are; the scene where we follow the ticket out the window and in the mouth of an eagle (I'm sure it was cool in IMAX at the time, but it didn't age well and doesn't hold a candle to the likes of the ""How to Train your Dragon"" series), the rooftop train scene, the entirety of the Hobo character, sneaking around the North Pole, the Caribou scene, and the train on ice scene. this movie could've been and maybe should've been a half hour HBO special.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays most of the characters and he carries this movie, the little black girl's singing was great, but her character design slipped into the uncanny valley several times.<br/><br/>Ironically the gimmick-y ""motion tracking animation"" is the very thing that holds the film back. Either it's character's are too creepy because they're real people's movements just overly animated, or it's really boring because of the character's stiff (realistic) movements.<br/><br/>I would love to have Dreamworks remake this movie more cartoony in the style of ""How to train your Dragon"" to make it more visually appealing and entertaining.<br/><br/>As is, it's fine."

The death mask like faces and cold dead eyes of the creatures in this film are soul shrivelling and yet these creatures are the children we take our journey with. Each time one of them speaks their lips peel back to reveal gnashing teeth. Their emotionless faces hold a kind of unfeeling malevolence that is fear inducing. Couple this with the fact each of them has a voice of an adult it takes you to some surreal place where everything seems somewhat sinister and unsafe.<br/><br/>The angular empty world this movie takes place in exists on another plain. Cold and flat and devoid of any believable life. It is somewhere I would dread to wake up in. <br/><br/>The elves are terrifying spindly little legs and goblin like faces.

The big brother of this vacuum world. A puppet master using these automatons for his own ancient devices. But at the same time he is also the voice of our Hero boy.

The know-it-all needs a little humility and poor little Billy just needs some friends and a Christmas to remember.<br/><br/>The action scenes are good and you must remember that the train is also a co-star. Just as the Sharps rifle is a co-star in Quigley Down Under, the train sequences are very important to the story.<br/><br/>Yes, the story was modified from the book to be more inclusive, but remember that the author was a consultant and co-penned the screenplay.

With the motion capture animation it continues giving the film an eerie atmosphere. There is a crashing feeling of loneliness and obscurity throughout the film. It's very interesting to see at night; and be consumed by the excellent atmosphere. I have rare goosebumps at watching this movie, it's potent and envelops the viewer to its dark atmosphere. The technical details are fabulous, the message is rather bleak. But I'll say it's marvelously told and composed.<br/><br/>It's not ordinary.

"Saturday8pm","5","3","5","22 November 2004"," One More Time, with Feeling
","Having seen ""The Polar Express"" with my family this past weekend, I was left with several impressions. First, the negative: CGi works well on backgrounds, much less so on human beings; some characters were monstrous; The North Pole cityscape looked more like Poland during the war than ""Christmastown""; the sound was too loud; the movie would have benefited greatly without the new characters and a shorter running time; some voice talents were totally miscast; the mood of the film is too bleak for young children. On the positive: there's some memorable songs; fantastic use of color; a faithfulness to the illustrations of the Chris Van Allsburg book ( which is the main reason the producers chose to render the entire film in CGi ); breathtaking nature scenes; a real kinetic energy; most of the children seemed to love it  which is the point, really  after all, it IS a movie designed for children.<br/><br/>Consider the source material: I find the book rather bleak in itself.<br/><br/>For me, it's one of Allsburg's lesser writes, though it's not void of charm. It should be for older children who are on the cusp of that basic level of maturity that questions the less logical aspects of life. That age group surely has graduated from pictures books. Or is it more a book for the precocious six year old who's unfortunately been informed by another less impressionable child that Santa Claus isn't real? Which is it? I'll guess the latter is probably the closest to the author's target. If true, the likely truth is that those children are in the minority, and the book's main fault is that it attracts an audience too wide than it's intended audience.<br/><br/>Which is why the movie also is awkward in its approach to Christmas. Children see the Rankin/Bass productions on TV, then see ""The Polar Express"" and begin to think, ""Gee, is The North Pole REALLY like that?"" This modern depiction of The North Pole is a quantum leap from those old TV shows. I suppose that all these disparate depictions of The North Pole only fuel children's suspicions. Children thrive on familiarity, and The North Pole has been depicted, up to this point, thousands of ways. It's no wonder they start to question everything! The CGi people come off weird, unnatural and sometimes downright frightening. Remember that movie ""Westworld""? You've got it! I think the better idea would have been placing live actors in the backgrounds, as in ""Mary Poppins"". The charm factor would have been ratcheted way up. Why wasn't this done? Supposedly the director didn't want to bother with child actors. Huh?!? How can one get that childhood feeling while being surrounded mostly by adults during the production? ""One more time, with feeling."" As for the volume, all movies are too loud today. But the sudden noises and decibel level are totally inappropriate for this film. If I were a kid and saw this movie, I'd be treated to nightmares at bedtime.<br/><br/>What did my six year old think? She loved it! Mostly she loved the train scenes where the movie show the workings of the train and the amazing speeds of which it's capable. Which is the weakness of my review  most kids loved this movie. But some younger children were scared by it. What  Christmas scary? Leave that to ""A Christmas Carol"", which is NOT for young kids! WHY toddlers were brought in to see this at our viewing is indicative of the lack of natural feeling people seem to exhibit nowadays. Have we really gotten so desensitized that ideas and common sense have to be bludgeoned into our minds? So, proceed with caution.<br/><br/>Cheers: Beautiful backgrounds; breathtaking nature scenes; some good songs; a movie that really moves; fascinating animation; faithful to the book; teaches that faith is important in life; a crowd-pleaser.<br/><br/>Caveats: Scary characters; too loud; bleak; awkward; animated dead people; too long; way too intense for impressionable five year-olds.<br/><br/>Match, cut."

","Amazing. <br/><br/>I know that the typical format for a film review is to spend ample time writing about the story, the background, the making of the film and maybe even some history on the actors or the director before getting to your opinion. But in the case of The Polar Express, I wanted to save you a lot of time so that maybe you can use the extra minutes to grab a paper and check out the local play times. <br/><br/>The Polar Express is nothing less than a stellar achievement in film-making that will instantly become a modern day Christmas classic. Based on the book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg, the story surrounds a mysterious train that arrives on Christmas Eve to take young boys and girls to the North Pole to help him again believe in the magic of Christmas. <br/><br/>With a screenplay written by William Broyles, Jr. and director Robert Zemeckis, the film perfectly casts powerhouse Tom Hanks in no less than five separate roles including the conductor, a hobo, a father, scrooge and even the big man, Santa himself. <br/><br/>As a computer animated production, you may raise an eyebrow when I write that Hanks was perfectly cast, but The Polar Express incorporates a new animation technique that allows an actor to act rather than just provide a voice over. This new system has the actor dressed in a suit with strategically placed computer chips that feed back into a computer. Known as 'Performance Capture', this process can capture live action movement, odd angles and even facial expressions that are digitally aped bring us an actor's performance instead of a simple vocal range. <br/><br/>What is most surprising is that the actor's animation works so well that you would think that it has been mastered from years and years of evolvement with the process. From every smirk on the conductors face to every hair on the young boys head you get lost in the incredible detail of the production and by the ten-minute mark you will likely completely forget that you are watching a CG-crafted film.<br/><br/>But it is not just the actor's movement and expressions that are a crowning achievement in this Christmas classic. The special effects and sound are equally spectacular. Two scenes, one including a ticket that blows out the window and interacts with everything from an eagle to a pack of wolves before magically finding its way back into its owners hands and a visually effective scene of the train trying to outrun the breaking ice of a lake are fascinating and more exciting than any live action perils seen in such summer fare as The Day After Tomorrow. <br/><br/>But no highly visual picture can survive without a strong story and The Polar Express stays true to the book in adapting the journey of a group of children to see Santa's lair. The movie focuses mostly on a young boy who has grown older and is at that pinnacle where he no longer truly believes in the magic of the holiday season. His adventure includes meeting a ghost-like hobo that aides him on his quest, a scary cabin car that houses toys to be recycled and three must-be-seen-on-the-big-screen-to-be-enjoyed roller coaster type scenes that are effective enough to have you leaning to the right and left as the screen follows the tracks. <br/><br/>This is not the first time that Zemeckis and Hanks have teamed for some movie magic. They have collaborated twice before on Forrest Gump and Castaway and this newest venture makes them the quintessential go-to team in Tinseltown. <br/><br/>So whether they work together again in the future or not, at least we can savor their latest venture. The Polar Express is one of the best films of 2004 and can stand beside It's A Wonderful Life as a seasonal classic.<br/><br/>Amazing.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

","Good thing I didn't get a chance to see it in theaters, but watched it on TV for ""free"". Otherwise, it might not have been 3 stars, two of which I give for the excellent first try of realistic motion capture. No, it's true - at times I'd forget it's not a live action movie. Until they show the faces up close, that is. The third star goes for the sincere effort of making a good fantasy movie. As one of the characters put it: ""It's the thought that counts"".<br/><br/>Now to the bad parts, one by one:<br/><br/>1. There is hardly any plot. The whole movie is a sequence of unconnected and meaningless mishaps, which are supposed to be adventures, I guess. Take them away and you got nothing left. I couldn't shake an impression that the movie was made specifically to turn it into a theme park ride. I wonder why they didn't? Or maybe they did and I missed it? If so - lucky me.<br/><br/>2. The real miss is that they didn't make it a live action/cartoon combo. The ""reality"" scene should have been done by live action - that's how it's supposed to be! Yes, sometimes you can break traditions, and it works, but this time it didn't.<br/><br/>3. What is the deal with all the broken story lines? That weird hobo on the train (I do mean ON the train) - it looks like there is a damn good story about him. Who is he? Why is he the way he is, and does what he does, and thinks what he thinks? Nothing is ever explained, except for a very vague hint about ghosts, which, of course, reveals nothing interesting. I waited till the end to find out his story, but none came! We never even learn what was that present Billy was making such a big deal about. We are being teased till the end, but never find out. Why?! And what is the deal with the two main character having no names? That was the last straw.<br/><br/>4. But the worst of all are the supposed ""messages"" of the film.

"Eric_in_Cincinnati","1","15","43","12 December 2005"," G Rating? Did anyone else notice the exploding hobo?
","I am not kidding: there's a scene in this movie where a hobo hits his head on a tunnel keystone and explodes (with no fireball, though) into a million pieces! It made some kid in front of me scream in terror! ...In a G-rated film!<br/><br/>This film might serve to convince children that Santa Clause is EVIL! His helpers are ugly, misanthropic, over-the-top and mean! When Santa (here an anagram of Satan!) appears, all 200,000 elves begin singing ""Santa Clause is Coming to Town"" as though it were a Druid war chant. Then, in the reflection of this movie's ""Rosebud"" object (a jingle bell that whispers hints of why you can't hear it ringing: ""doubt....doubt...)), old Saint Nick appears, looking like a stoic Donald Sutherland, his face glowing like Moses' from ""K10C"". When we hear him speak, his thundering voice sounds less like a jolly old elf, and more like James Earl Jones' voice slowed-down about 20%. Frightening!<br/><br/>The syrupy music is out-of-place, boring and repetitive. It doesn't follow any emotional threads (as in ""Titanic's"" very effective score). It just seems thrown in at certain points in order to generate feelings of warmth and magic. It fails to stir, partly because it doesn't match the imagery of the film. There are some musical train wrecks (no pun intended) where, out of nowhere, the eerie, symphonic score slams abruptly into happy, child-voiced POLKA about the title locomotive. It just makes the whole movie sound like it was rushed into production! <br/><br/>Finally, I agree with some other reviewers about how, well... ""dead"" everyone looks. It does seem a little macabre at times. The motion-capture technique is good for allowing the Kings Island-like roller-coaster train sequences to look convincing from a distance, but up close, ""real"" actors should have been used. Overall, nice eye-candy for killing time in front of the TV, but not much else here."
"njwcat7","1","12","33","2 January 2005"," charmless, noisy, and frightening for young children
","In summary, if you have young children this will scare them, if you have older children they'll think its uncool and/or boring (take your pick. As an adult I found it charmless, unengaging, and inconsistent in its approach.<br/><br/>It could have been so much better if the people who made it had thought about the target audience a bit more. It seems to be aimed at younger children yet is very scary for them, my two boys are aged 4 and 7 and they were both scared and wanted to leave. I've also spoken to a few other people who've taken young children to see it they said much the same thing.<br/><br/>When things start to go 'wrong' the whole tone of the film becomes frightening. E.g. when the train starts going very fast the music gets very ominous and the children in the film start screaming, if the music was more 'fun' and the kids started to scream with delight the whole thing could have become enjoyable.<br/><br/>The animation is strange too - the movements are realistic but the faces have an eerily 'wooden' look to them and the overall effect is more like watching a creepy horror film full of zombies than one of children on a magical voyage.<br/><br/>The character on the roof of the train is just downright creepy and i cant see how he (it?) is supposed to fit into a children's film."
"DVDDad","1","10","27","28 November 2004"," NOT a young kids movie
","I must have missed something that happened between the time I was very young and now. A big change, indeed. Exactly when did accepting a ride on a magical train, sent by Santa mean that you're in for a nightmarish trip fraught with peril? The number of times the kids on this train are holding on for dear life is in this nightmarish vision is ridiculous. I mean -- come on! -- isn't this a Christmas story?!?<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong. I'm not someone who sits at home, bitter because the whole world isn't sugar-coated. No way! In fact, I like a good action flick. But this was a betrayal for anyone who's read the book to their kids and thinks it'll be a fun little flick for young children. You see, I can't count the number of times I've read this book to my two girls (ages 6 and 4). It's wonderful! So much so, that I never dreamed I actually needed to read a REVIEW before taking them to see it. Yes, dear reader, I made the ultimate mistake -- I actually trusted Hollywood for once. And I paid for it. My error was figuring that, worse case scenario, it would be really dumb, or not well done, or simply just boring. Boy was I wrong, as only parents of small children can appreciate.<br/><br/>Let me be specific here (*minor* spoiler alert!). The first 1/2 of this film is like one big nightmare with just a hint of sugar-coating: kids that are pretty sure they are going to the North Pole, but not *really* sure; a conductor that barks orders with all the warmth of a drill-sergeant made of dry ice; a little girl who loses her ticket when the not-so-nice conductor comes looking for it (""but it was right here...""); a boy who tries to return her ticket, only to find her inexplicably missing when he opens the door to the next car and suddenly comes very close to falling between the cars to the tracks below; screaming children on an out of control train as it hurtles through the blacknessÂ… I could go on and on. This is not the trip to the North Pole I envision. It's dark, dreary, haunting and lifeless. It's something that might have come out of the mind of Alfred Hitchcock if he ever tried to make a kids' movie. Well done, but definitely not for young kids.<br/><br/>My 4-year-old daughter agreed. While my wife and I looked at each other with that look of ""what have we gotten ourselves into"", she began crying. I kept thinking the movie would lighten up, but it never did -- one peril after another. Unfortunately, I don't know first-hand if it ever got better. I took my daughter out of the theater and spent the next hour killing time while my wife and 6-year-old finished the movie. My 6-year-old said it was scary, but she still enjoyed it. My wife was thoroughly unimpressed. If it had just been the two of us, it would have been fine but, again, this was a G-rated Christmas movie!<br/><br/>In short, if your kids are still young enough to want to make cookies for Santa on Christmas Eve, you might want to think twice about taking them to see The Polar Express. An instant holiday classic? I don't think so. Then again, maybe for Halloween..."
"ironhorse_iv","6","4","8","30 December 2017"," I'm sorry to say this, but Polar Express was somewhat of a train-wreck of a movie. It was not good.
","""One thing about trains: it doesn't matter where they're going. What matters is deciding to get on"" quotes the Conductor (Voice & Motion Capture Performance from Tom Hanks). I'm sorry to say this, but I can't get aboard with this 3D CGI animation kid's movie, about a young unnamed boy (Voice by Daryl Sabara, but motion capture performance also done by Tom Hanks), having to travel to the North Pole, in order to renewed his faith in Santa Claus (Also voice and motion capture performance by Tom Hanks). The disbelief story felt a little too manipulative & force. After all, that part of the story was too extreme, it didn't match the levels of the children book of the same name by author, Chris Van Allsburg, which also happens to be the source material for this film. It's really does seem like that part of the movie, was made for some evangelical religious convicting agenda, rather than fans of the book. For example, there is a lot of padding scenes, in the movie, where a ghost (once again voice and motion capture performance by Tom Hanks) scares and shames the mostly innocent young boy into believing in Golly St. Nick; as if he was Ebenezer Scrooge, a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old moneylender from Charles Dicken's 'Christmas Carol', rather than a child who just thinking straight & coming to age. Who says, not being too naive & gullibly is a bad thing? After all, isn't teaching our children to be smart, better then, teaching them to go blindly into the night with strangers. How is that wrong!? Going with conviction, without asking any questions, is how cults are built. Even if this movie wasn't made to brain wash, anybody, the bright light god-like appearance of the Kris Kringle later in the film giving out the bell as if its first communion, doesn't help, swag the argument away. Instead, it brings the issue, even closer. It's pretty clear, by all the religious overtones, that this movie is in-fact, a faith-based movie, hidden under a capture the holiday spirit, type of vibe. Anybody that says otherwise, is truly blinded by the smoke & mirrors. It's not a Christmas movie. It's a 'Christ'-mas film. In the end, it's still highly exploited. Very unbalanced. Not only that, but the movie has way too much 3D gimmick rollercoaster style actions scenes like the Glacier Gulch sequence, that goes against, everything that Chris Van Allsburg was trying to say, in his calm, relaxing storyline of the book. The film wasn't as slow & whimsical, as it should had been, because of that. Added to that, was the amount of action sequences that was totally pointlessness. Honestly, you can cut away all of the scenes where the child struggles to find, another child, train ticket, with the ghost on the roof; you would still end up in the same place in the end. It doesn't affecting the story significantly. All of this padding, really hurts, the pacing. Its leaves too many plot-holes, such as why the conductor walk over the roof of the train instead of just walking through the train to get to the engine room or what happen to the dancing hot-chocolate waiters? In the end, the 32 pages book that can be read in less than 10 minutes, should had never been made into a full-length 100 minutes movie. It leaves too many unanswered questions. Instead, 'Polar Express' should had work better, as a short animation film. Don't get me wrong, I give the filmmakers for taking a risk, in providing the world, the first live action motion capture animation & doing a good job in the background to preserve the look of Allsburg's lovely oil pastels illustrations from the book. However, I thought, the movie would had work better with the same hand-drawn animation that 1982's short film 'the Snowman' or 2006's short movie 'Little Match Girl' had. Better yet, go live-action. Why, because this movie has fallen in the subconscious effect called the Uncanny Valley. The exaggerated caricatures of human beings in this film is highly creepy. It just doesn't look right. Sadly, director, Robert Zemeckis didn't get the memo as he would directed, two more films with that style, 2007's 'Beowulf' & 2009's 'Christmas Carol'. As for the voice acting, it was mostly alright; yet again, I can do without Tom Hanks's voicing the ghost hobo, as well, as Santa Claus. It was very jarring to see him, do multiply roles and they were way too hammy. Another character's voice that should had been cut, was the know-It-All kid (Voice by Eddie Deezen & Motion Capture by Jimmy Pinchak). His voice got a little too annoying, toward the end. As for the music. I love composer, Alan Silvestri's theme for the film, even if its suite sounds too similar to Danny Elfman's Ice Dance theme to 1991's 'Edward Scissorhand'. As for the songs; it just didn't work with me. The 'Hot Chocolate' number was an awful lazy written song with annoying repetitive lyrics and jazzy hook that comes out of nowhere. Then, there is 'When Christmas Comes to Town', a ballad duet that sounds really generic. It's highly forgettable, along with Josh Groban's 'Believe' that sounds too much of a guy reading the spoilers than singing. The only song, I kinda like, was the 'Polar Express' theme. The tune was catchy. As for the covers of classic Christmas songs. It was nice to hear them, nevertheless, I can do, without 'Rockin' on the Top of the World'; it was lackluster, and doesn't match, with the theme of timelessness. Plus, seeing Aerosmith's Steven Tyler as an elf was awkward as hell. In the end, this movie just doesn't capture the same magic of Caldecott Award winning book. It was just disappointing. Because of that, I can't recommended seeing this film. Just, check out the book, instead. Now's that worth, getting onboard for."

So many of the scenes were enhanced by seeing the 3D effects.

","A young boy doesn't believe in Santa Claus at all. On Christmas Eve a huge, magical locomotive pulls in front of his house. The conductor (Tom Hanks) tells him to get on--they're going to the North Pole. It seems the train is full of kids who don't believe in Santa. Well...that's about to change.<br/><br/>This is not a live action film. The characters look like humans (Tom Hanks has FIVE roles) and sound like them but are clearly computer-generated. In fact the whole movie is like that--EVERYTHING is computer generated. I saw it in an IMAX 3D theatre. I admit the visuals were incredible (if somewhat creepy)---but I really didn't like it.<br/><br/>There's very little plot, no characterization and I was basically bored silly. The ""adventures"" on the express didn't impress me and there's a pointlessly long episode with three of the kids lost in Santa's town (or whatever--we're never told what it is). Tons of characters and situations are left unexplored or unexplained and it gets annoying. The waiters on the train serving hot chocolate had me going ""huh""? Also the meaning of the film (believe in Christmas) is heavy-handed even for a kids movie. They go out of their way to make you cry and choke up---I found it overly manipulative. Basically you just sit there and are bombarded by tons of visual tricks. For some people, that's enough. For me I needed more. The actors voicing the figures do pretty good except for Eddie Deezen--his voice is INCREDIBLY annoying (as is his character).<br/><br/>So I didn't like it--I looked at my watch more than once. Still the kids in the theatre were spellbound--they sat there in silence watching the screen. So--I think kids will like it but, to be honest, I think some kids might get nightmares from this. These CGI characters look so strange. More than once I was feeling very uneasy looking at them. Adults MIGHT enjoy it. I give it a 6--and that's mostly for the visuals."

To see the different objects in the boys room shake when the train comes by for the first time is amazing. All of the animation was very tight. there were times when i thought i was actually watching a live action movie. the storyline is right on with the book and also has a few surprises in it. My parents read this story to me many times as a child and it was great to see such a great film made out of it. Tom Hanks does a great job as the conductor and all of his other characters.

","I was hoping this movie would be similar to the gorgeous animated short film, The Snowman, but no such luck. That film has beautiful, haunting music that would have fit wonderfully into this movie. But instead, there were too many lingering, silent moments that made my mind wander and didn't set a mood. <br/><br/>The movie was beautiful to look at, but like other cutting edge technology films, it feels forced. It's as if a story was built around technology. I felt as if the movie was animated by people who thought they were playing a video game.<br/><br/>Plus, every voice sounded like Tom Hanks. (I wonder why.) Tom Hanks doesn't have the comedic talents to pull off voice-overs in my opinion. And the ""know-it-all"" boy had a voice that sounded like fingernails on a blackboard.<br/><br/>220 million dollars? That could have fed a lot of homeless people here at the holidays. It's a shame really."
"jdesando","Null","4","8","21 November 2004"," Cold like the Arctic
","It's cold above the Arctic Circle, even if you work for a robust, often maligned caregiver. Director Robert Zamekis ('Cast Away) and Tom Hanks ('Cast Away') join forces again to make an animation based on the illustrated Chris Van Allsburg children's book about a seven-year old boy who questions Santa's existence and travels by magical train to Toyland for the ocular proof.<br/><br/>Although the art process of 'performance capture,' which transforms human movements into animation (used also for Gollum in 'Lord of the Rings') is revolutionary in its magic realism, the characters are wondrously almost real, a fact that leads me to question why have animation at all if stylization is not a value for animation. However, the roller coaster like rides and unusual camera points of view (one time it actually looks through a printed page with the letters suspended) satisfy my need for the representational and fantastic in animation. <br/><br/>The movie is cold like the Arctic: There is a blatantly conservative message that Boy Hero (he is not named, presumably for universal application reasons), and by implication everyone else on the train and in the world, should 'believe': believe the fussy and punctual conductor, the hobo, the boy's parents, and even the elves, when they encourage him to accept Santa (sounds evangelical, doesn't it?) contrary to what his eyes have shown him in real life and what his growing analytical mind has determined. With the appointment of Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state, the Girl The obedience motif of 'Express' reminds me of the rationale for the Iraq war and John Kerry's claim about a 'plan for the future.'<br/><br/>Beyond the theme, the art/set design disturbs me as well. While the express is beautifully drawn and moved--when it slides on the ice you know why animation can be superior to old-fashioned photography-Santa's village is patterned after a 19th-century German factory town, which feels cold and vacant, no matter how loud the elves or how benign Santa. This revisionist interpretation appeals to my Christmas-agnostic side while it looks more opposite the spirit of the myth than the myth allows, even if following the spirit of the book. It would be like setting 'The Wizard of Oz' (which 'Polar Express' resembles) in Cleveland.<br/><br/>What I like about the film is that Boy Hero seems a tad skeptical even after the adventure. I also like A.A.Milnes' jaundiced view: 'I find it difficult to believe in Father Christmas. If he is the jolly old gentleman he is always said to be, why doesn't he behave as such? How is it that the presents go so often to the wrong people?'<br/><br/>There's a rumored half billion dollars needed before the company turn a profit, given Zamekis and Hanks reputedly taking a third. With the rather bleak tone of the film going contrary to the prevailing spirit of the season and the softening needs of a war-weary world, I suggest the filmmakers turn quickly to world distribution and DVD sales. Otherwise, it can be very cold even in the warm California sun."
"eljaykay1219","2","12","34","25 December 2008"," I really hated this movie
","I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little. I was very disappointed in the movie. One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard. There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene. There are some characters and scenes that seem scary for little children for whom this movie was made. The North Pole scenes with Santa and the elves could have been cute and charming. There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters. It usually doesn't work to make a short children's book into a feature film. This movie totally grates on my nerves."

It's not a frenzy of action in search of a soul, but a story well told. <br/><br/>This will play for years and years during the holiday season and is the first truly narrative feature quality and length I-MAX presentation that I've seen.

","Polar Express would soon be among the list of Christmas classics like ""Its a Wonderful Life"", ""A Christmas Story"", ""Scrooge"",etc. The reason why it is so poorly rated in IMDb is because, a lot of people have not seen the movie. This was a sleeper hit because of the family crowd. (opening weekend made 30 million, but went on to make 160$, making it one of the biggest hits of 2004). Apart from the technical brilliance, the movie is a heartwarming. The movie maintains an eerie feeling which makes it special than other Christmas movies. Just like how ""Its a Wonderful Life"" is made special by the dark feeling (Jimmy committing suicide, depression, etc), Polar Express' selling point is its eeriness (which a lot of critics didn't expect in a Christmas movie meant for kids) <br/><br/>The movie does not get too saccharine or too sappy. It is just presented. It even works better than ""Miracle on 34th street"" which shares a common main theme with Polar express, that is, BELIEF. Both is based on the theory that Santa exists, and how a kid who doesn't believe in Santa gets to believe in it.<br/><br/>The movie starts with ""On Christmas Eve, many years ago, I lay quietly in my bed. ..."" and so it goes on maintaining the tone of the bedtime story which your mom read it to you. The ending line is more powerful when narrated on screen, so I wont give you the line (as good as the ending line in STAND BY ME). All I can tell you is you would walk out of the theater with a new hope.<br/><br/>A lot of movies spend a big budget and make better explosions, better spacecrafts, better action scenes. But no one cares about starting something new, like the trend-setting T2 or Star Wars or Jurassic Park. Nor does studios utilize the big budget to make something that would cherish your eyes, like the cinematography of Crouching tiger or HERO. Polar Express has done both. SOme scenes are very creative. Some notable ones are the Santa's factory, the Balloon with the elves, wolves following the train, the train crash and the final scene where the coach is disconnected and goes all the way back. <br/><br/>After 50 years maybe the animation effects would be 1000 times better than 2004, but still this movie would hold its roots, just like the way Indiana Jones series in better than a technically superior Mummy/ Van Helsing or Star Wars Original Trilogy is better than the new trilogy. The movie is a very good human drama that is disguised as an animated movie. <br/><br/>NOTE FOR PARENTS: <br/><br/>The Movie does not contain fart jokes (Shrek), double meaning jokes (Madagaskar), references to pop-culture (Shark Tale) or Violence or Scary moments (Incredibles). It is a movie for your whole family."

Your answer to that question will likely determine your interest level in a film that has (in the ten years since its release) become a popular entry into the ""holiday pantheon"" of film.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Polar Express"" follows the adventures of a young boy who is doubting the existence of Santa Claus. When, on Christmas Eve, a mysterious train destined for the North Pole pulls up in front of his house, the boy is taken on a journey that may just change his opinion on the holiday season forever.<br/><br/>""Polar Express"" is an odd, quirky movie to be sure (though not necessarily in a bad way). Tom Hanks is the voice of darn near every character, it is done in the same animation style as ""Adventures of the Tin-Tin"", and it uses a kind of charge-ahead storytelling vibe that calls for some crazy action/adventure at practically every turn.<br/><br/>The main determinant of whether you'll like the movie, though, is how able you will be to completely transforming yourself (while viewing) into the psyche of that young boy.

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","2","3","15 December 2015"," Pure Christmas magic!!
","Robert Zemeckis's The Polar Express is a dazzling gem of a Christmas classic. It's endlessly re watchable, complete fun for kids and adults alike, and contains really impressive motion capture special effects that hold up terrifically to this day. Zemeckis is in love with the medium, having made three incredible ventures into it so far, this being his first. It's a hell of a ride, and at times very interactive with the audience, as the cameras swoop, swish, dive and throw themselves right into the action in exciting ways that wouldn't be possible with live action. The animation itself is jaw-dropping as well, each new sight the train passes more awe inspiring than the last. The train is a marvel too see and feels real to us, with textured surfaces rendered beautifully, and many a hiss, clank and roar melded into the sound design. On a quiet, snow blanketed Christmas Eve in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a young boy eagerly awaits Santa's jingling arrival with great anticipation. What arrives instead is a grand old steam train, right to his front door stop. When asked where it's headed, the energetic conductor exclaims ""Why, to the North Pole, of course! This is the polar express!!!"". And off they go, trundling through the holy night northbound into desolate forests, gorgeous mountains and scenery so well imagined you'll have trouble believing you're watching something made by a computer. It's not tacky or overdone, but rather muted and deep colored, as if the pages of the storybook leapt to magical life in front of us. The boy meets others like him and before they know it they're already knee deep in heart stopping adventure before they even get halfway to the north pole. The train careens and dips like a bat out of hell along impossibly wild roller coaster tracks and even ice skates along a glassy frozen lake at one point. The first half of the film is so packed with precise, visually boggling action that it feels like Need For Speed: Arctic Edition at times. My favourite parts are the haunting pack of wolves that follow the train down a powdery tundra slope, the stomach churning plunge down 'glacier gulch' that plays like Mario kart on steroids, and a comical detour around thousands of wild caribou. It's quite the adventure. And I haven't even gotten to the north pole yet. It is without a doubt the grandest, and my favourite depiction of Santa's kingdom in any movie ever.<br/><br/>The sheer scale, beauty and detail of it makes your heart soar in appreciation. Hundreds of thousands of little elfies parade around (including one that looks and sounds suspiciously like Steven Tyler), giddy with excitement at the time of year, some in hilarious neumatic transit pods. Santas sleigh is a titanic bundle that requires two blimps to lift, and it's all set on a massive frosty dome in the middle of the northern desolation. It's. Damn. Spectacular. Tom Hanks works overtime in six different roles, the showcase one being the conductor, a neurotic loon whose overwhelming compassion and winking, jovial spirit peers through his gruff exterior. He also plays a mysterious hobo who rides the express in style and helps those in need, as well as the big man himself, Father Christmas. The holiday magic that fuels the train along with coal is there to teach every girl and boy onboard a very introspective lesson, which they themselves must come to terms with, with a dose of friendly nudging from the other characters. A true Christmas classic with imagination in spades, dozens of pleasing Christmas carols to sing along to (including a deafening rendition of Santa Claus is coming to town sung by the elfies) and a timeless feeling of adventure and awaiting joy to rival any of the best Christmas eve's that we fondly remember as children."

","The animation is cool, and more cool because the images of the actors were incorporated to create the images of the characters. The effects complimented the animation well and really gave the impression of a polar world. Down to the colours and everything, the animation was well done. Perhaps though, the characters could have been given more facial expression. With the exception of Hanks, the rest of the characters didn't have their emotions portrayed very well.<br/><br/>It was a little weird that they didn't really have names except for Billy, which makes me wonder why. A little random to name Billy when he is not even the protagonist. Also, I liked that they had a girl character portrayed as a leader. Two thumbs up for that!<br/><br/>A fun film with lots of adventure that would keep both children and adults moderately engaged. I thought they would spend more time in the North Pole though, so was a bit disappointed to find out that the majority of the film is spent on the train.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

","This movie has become a Christmas 'must see' every year in our house. I'm astounded by some reviewers stating it's too long or too scary. My son has watched it from the age of 5 and loves it just as much now as then and has never for one moment been scared or got bored by it. It is a wonderful movie capturing everything I hold dear about Christmas, the magic,the feeling of excitement and anticipation. It is not a slushy film but a firm and steadfast adventure with morality that isn't force fed to the audience. I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone young or old who have traditional values of what Christmas means. I have deliberately not gone into technical aspects of the film as some movies should be enjoyed for what they are, not the boring CGI specifications or pixel prattling that neither adds nor detracts to the enjoyment. Enjoy this film for exactly what it was designed to be, a wonderful Christmas time story."

","The Polar Express has the difficult task of trying to take a book that's no longer than about twenty pages and turning it into a feature length film. For the most part some of the stuff they added, like the extra characters and settings, work but there are still some things that feel unnecessary.<br/><br/>The story is on Christmas Eve a young boy hears a noise outside his house and goes outside to see a train named ""The Polar Express"" has just rolled up to his house. He's invited by its strange yet friendly conductor to come with them to the North Pole where Santa will choose a kid to give the first gift of Christmas to. On the trip the boy befriends a girl who has trouble leading others and a younger boy who is incredibly shy. He also encounters a strange Hobo who lives atop the train who turns out to be a ghost. The boy, who remains nameless throughout the film, must learn to believe in things that seem impossible while their journey takes place and even gets a special gift because of it.<br/><br/>Some of the things that work for Polar Express are the characters which are all pretty fun and the settings which are gorgeous. However the film isn't without its problems. One major complaint some might have is the animation itself. A common criticism is that the characters all have blank emotionless eyes which personally I never thought. I will say the way they animated the Elves is pretty uncanny though. There's also the strange choice of having Tom Hanks perform and voice several characters, like the Conductor, the Hobo and even Santa himself. They look a little different from each other but you can tell it's the same person even with slight voice difference. There's also the sometimes jarring adding of some scenarios to lengthen the film. There's a scene where they have to move caribou from the train tracks that seems to add nothing and a scene which explores Santa's workshop which is creative but after they rejoin the crowd it's never really brought up again and there's nothing really new that we haven't seen from other films that have portrayed the workshop.<br/><br/>But the film is enjoyable nevertheless. It's not the best Christmas film but it gives you a warm feeling by the end that every good holiday flick should provide. And that song at the end credits to me is one of the best representations of Christmas in any film."

","Oh the joy of motion capture in films. Christmas movies seem to be getting this treatment a lot. I find it interesting how detailed you can get these days. And this movie was out several years ago! I enjoyed the story and loved the comedic action and the trip there was just long enough to make it feel like it really did take a long time to get there, but short enough not to bore us.<br/><br/>The North Pole itself was interesting. Seeing the secret headquarters and all the high tech and fancy technology was cool. Of course I personally think the elves were a bit nasty looking for my taste. Look at the more classic Christmas stories and you'll see friendly little guys and then you look and see these nasty bug like things.<br/><br/>Anyway the movie was pretty good, rated 7/10."

You have enough 'Real Spirit of Xmas' stuff there to make you think, there's some nice turns by guys like Eddie Deezen and Michael Jeter(his last), the train-over-the-lake-ice esp. well animated and exciting as well. For CGI, this is unusually well-rounded stuff(okay, Mo-Cap, whatever-it's STILL CGI)-and must have played really well in those Imax theatres, hence the high Box office etc. seasonally.<br/><br/>I'll give this one *** just because it works."

At the end my son wanted to see it again and again. The story is very well developed for children and adults and every detail is studied very carefully. There is everything that a child is dreaming during Christmas time. THE POLAR EXPRESS is a great adventure trip with a marvelous train and the audio and the special effects are great.

I am sure the end of the film is very suitable,happy and bright but my children did not make it that far with out being terrified.

","A young boy who doubts the existence of Santa Claus hears a noise outside his window on Christmas Eve and rides the Polar Express to the North Pole.<br/><br/>I waited for this movie just as I waited for Santa Claus when I was younger: full of anticipation. It did not disappoint. There is a new genre out there making humans look like cartoon characters, or making cartoon characters look like humans and I cannot figure out which is which, or the name for this new genre, but it works. Thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>The photography or cinematography was nothing short of spectacular. I will admit sometimes it looked like Kaleidoscope magic, but it worked. There were only two things that I would have changed to make it better (of course). One: there was too much hesitancy when a child character would speak sometimes. I felt like the character was waiting for someone to give him/her the lines to speak. And, second, I would have given this more music. Oh, there was music and for a minute I thought this might be a musical and maybe in some ways it was, sort of, but there needed to be more of it and more upfront with it. You know, really ring it in. You betcha! In the second half the music was muted in the background. I heard Bing Crosby and others, but I kept waiting to hear Dean Martin too, but never did hear him.<br/><br/>Now, this has the feel of a nice family movie, but I would be careful letting really young children see it because there are some scary scenes when the Polar Express goes off the tracks and LOOK OUT! Get it? Now, if the child is used to playing intense sock'em video games then okay. They won't be too shocked with this. Otherwise"

This movie is geared towards younger audiences and kids will love it but it unfortunately doesn't feel as magical as it should. Also the animation, as revolutionary as it was, does not hold up and feels very clunky in spots. But there are definitely plenty of bright spots and the camera work is very good by any standards.

","With the Polar Express Robert Zemeckis has managed to transport me to a land of wonder. The Polar Express is cinematic magic - a delightful tale guaranteed to enthrall viewers of all ages. Does that sound like advertising hype, or the words of a publicist? Perhaps, but it's a reflection of how strongly this film pulled me under its spell. For children, this is a glorious adventure, full of excitement, splendor, and plenty of holiday good cheer. For adults, there are deeper meanings to be found, not to mention the bittersweet nostalgia of gazing back through the years to the point where innocence gave way to the curse of maturity. As I watched The Polar Express, I was immersed in the experience. On one level, I was a thirty-something critic taking notes, but part of me was a seven-year old boy having trouble getting to sleep on Christmas Eve. That's one of The Polar Express' great strengths: for many viewers, it will seem like the movie is plundering their memories. Who knew how universal some things are?"

","The Polar Express really brings the holiday season magic to life. Just the visuals alone are fantastic enough to make anyone feel in the Christmas mood. I love the story, it's every child's ultimate dream on Christmas Eve. The writing is good enough, I will say that it's not quite as good as some better animated movies, but it does the job. The songs are very festive and enjoyable too, almost all being sung by children aboard the train. The characters are interesting and each one different and unique in their own way. And Tom Hanks was a great pick to voice the conductor, Santa, Dad, and the homeless man. If that isn't the most roles ever given to one before..... lol. I will say that some of the middle part of the film does tend to drag a bit, but overall it is a good well constructed movie surrounding the holiday season dreams of millions of children across the globe. If you have younger children in your family then I definitely suggest watching around Christmas time. It comes on television a good bit around then anyways. It's fun, magical, and visually breathtaking. 7/10 for The Polar Express."

","When my movie theatre-working friend offered to let me see this movie for a special IMAX 3-D showing today, I took it! The motion capture images of director Robert Zemeckis are pretty fascinating to watch and it kept me from completely falling asleep most of the time I was watching it. It's told in flashback of a boy who is in danger of no longer believing in Christmas and certainly not in Santa Claus. Tom Hanks voices a lot of the characters in the story, most notably as the train conductor. I wasn't sure I would completely like this but by the end, I was close to loving it! There's also an appearance of a Famous Musician but I don't want to spoil the fun so on that note, I highly recommend The Polar Express."

"DVDDad","1","8","22","28 November 2004"," NOT a young kids movie
","I must have missed something that happened between the time I was very young and now. A big change, indeed. Exactly when did accepting a ride on a magical train, sent by Santa mean that you're in for a nightmarish trip fraught with peril? The number of times the kids on this train are holding on for dear life is in this nightmarish vision is ridiculous. I mean -- come on! -- isn't this a Christmas story?!?<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong. I'm not someone who sits at home, bitter because the whole world isn't sugar-coated. No way! In fact, I like a good action flick. But this was a betrayal for anyone who's read the book to their kids and thinks it'll be a fun little flick for young children. You see, I can't count the number of times I've read this book to my two girls (ages 6 and 4). It's wonderful! So much so, that I never dreamed I actually needed to read a REVIEW before taking them to see it. Yes, dear reader, I made the ultimate mistake -- I actually trusted Hollywood for once. And I paid for it. My error was figuring that, worse case scenario, it would be really dumb, or not well done, or simply just boring. Boy was I wrong, as only parents of small children can appreciate.<br/><br/>Let me be specific here. The first 1/2 of this film is like one big nightmare with just a hint of sugar-coating: kids that are pretty sure they are going to the North Pole, but not *really* sure; a conductor that barks orders with all the warmth of a drill-sergeant made of dry ice; a little girl who loses her ticket when the not-so-nice conductor comes looking for it (""but it was right here...""); a boy who tries to return her ticket, only to find her inexplicably missing when he opens the door to the next car and suddenly comes very close to falling between the cars to the tracks below; screaming children on an out of control train as it hurtles through the blacknessÂ… I could go on and on. This is not the trip to the North Pole I envision. It's dark, dreary, haunting and lifeless. It's something that might have come out of the mind of Alfred Hitchcock if he ever tried to make a kids' movie. Well done, but definitely not for young kids.<br/><br/>My 4-year-old daughter agreed. While my wife and I looked at each other with that look of ""what have we gotten ourselves into"", she began crying. I kept thinking the movie would lighten up, but it never did -- one peril after another. Unfortunately, I don't know first-hand if it ever got better. I took my daughter out of the theater and spent the next hour killing time while my wife and 6-year-old finished the movie. My 6-year-old said it was scary, but she still enjoyed it. My wife was thoroughly unimpressed. If it had just been the two of us, it would have been fine but, again, this was a G-rated Christmas movie!<br/><br/>In short, if your kids are still young enough to want to make cookies for Santa on Christmas Eve, you might want to think twice about taking them to see The Polar Express. An instant holiday classic? I don't think so. Then again, maybe for Halloween..."
"Hilk","2","7","19","9 November 2005"," Christmas equals noise
","This was considerably worse than expected. The fact that it clearly targets an American audience, up to the point where some details become difficult to understand for people who grew up with different Christmas traditions (milk and cookies as a sign that Santa hasn't been around yet, for example - I had to look that one up), is OK, obviously - maybe not as appealing to others, but I can't blame the film for that.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie fails to deliver in nearly all other fields as well. The animation is strangely lifeless. Especially kids and elves look more like robots than like kids - expensive technique doesn't automatically bring spirit into a film. An exception might be the Tom Hanks characters, but I think he just stands out because all the others are so bad. At no point was there any bond between viewer and protagonist, which is a big step towards a boring film. But there are more.<br/><br/>The plot itself is rather thin. Two of the kids on the train don't really believe in Christmas, so they need to learn - but why is everyone else on board? Why does the train have so many cars when only one is used, when there are millions of other kids who stopped believing? What's the meaning of a train in the film anyway? Unfortunately, I know the answer to that: It's in it as an excuse for unmotivated roller-coaster rides that have no meaning for the film at all.<br/><br/>There are a few moments when some nice messages are transported: friendship is important and Christmas is a cool time of the year. As soon as we get to these messages, though, we get loads of kitsch as well, which makes them hard to endure.<br/><br/>The main message of the film seems to be: Christmas is a time for noisy roller-coaster rides and bright lights and for showing off your animation skills. Oh, and it is the time when Santa comes and showers you with gifts the size of yourself. For me, Christmas is a lot more than that."

"CuriosityKilledShawn","7","4","9","5 December 2004"," A non-obnoxious and sober family movie.
","I'm sick of arrogant animated movies that force us into thinking they're great even though they're classless exercises in poor taste and franchise milking. Recent examples include Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and, worst of all, Shark Tale.<br/><br/>Dreamworks seems to be the worst among all this. Their basic logic is 'Let's see what Pixar is doing and copy that'. Come on! Pixar gave us A Bugs Life so Dreamworks gave us Antz. Pixar do Finding Nemo so Dreamworks do Shark Tale. Pixar do Monsters Inc so Dreamworks do Shrek (which turned out to be quite good). But that's beside the point. There are 2 main concerns for all studios involved in making computer animated movies. The first is to make each more realistic looking than the last. I don't care about this. I don't care how fancy the computer you made the film on is. I don't care how long you spent making it.<br/><br/>How about some actual story or dignity? None of these films have that. Sure they have some moronical done-to-death a thousand times before messages that masquerade as a stories and can easily fool a 3 year old but the one thing they all have in common is tastelessness.<br/><br/>The second concern is the merchandising. Where the REAL money from the movie is made! I would like to say the Polar Express is different but I dread the forthcoming Polar Express toys, books, pyjamas, monopoly set, happy meal/kids club meal, rucksack, video games, legal forms, stationary sets, airships, warheads...Christ almighty in 1987 Mel Brooks was only kidding when he mentioned the Spaceballs Flamethrower (a fave with the kids) but merchandising really is going this far. Too far.<br/><br/>If Warner can resist this temptation with The Polar Express it will give the film an everlasting integrity that immediately ranks it higher than all the other aforementioned movies.<br/><br/>The film itself is good, if not great. It borrows heavily from Kenji Mayizawa's Night on the Galactic Railroad in regards to the constant quietness and sense of mystery (oh and the big magical train that comes out of nowhere). My only problem is with the awkward boy the story focuses on. Yes, I know he's only a computer animation but he is extremely ugly and has an inhumanly awful, constantly blank expression.<br/><br/>He's becoming a bit of Scrooge/Grinch. He doesn't believe in Xmas anymore and is even trying to convince his little sister of the physical impossibilities of Santa being real. As he tries to sleep Xmas Eve away a massive steam trains parks outside his house. It's the Polar Express and its final destination is Santa's Workshop.<br/><br/>The train is filled with other kids (the reasons for them being there are never defined) and led by a wise old conductor (Tom Hanks in one of many roles) who is determined to restore the boy's faith in Xmas.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis' direction is mature and well-paced. There is particular attention to the sound design and narrative that no other recent animated movie has. Sound design is not all about chucking in loads of bass, a loud score and zany sound effects as a story is not just an excuse for events in the film to happen. This is something Zemeckis understands and he floods the film with warm colors, atmospheric landscapes and sense of magic that very nearly comes together but does not fully gel. <br/><br/>There's something missing in The Polar Express that I can't put my finger on. Even Alan Silvestri's wonderful, lively and enchanting score falls a couple of notches short of brilliance. It's one of his best but it's just missing...something. Still it's far better than any other Xmas movie for the past 10 years (Bad Santa not included). <br/><br/>Puh-lease Warner, don't sell out this film. I don't want a Polar Express toilet seat. Let this film transcend the common stock. It's already one of those special Xmas movies that you can watch every year and I'll surely buy the DVD when it comes out. But I won't buy the toilet seat.<br/><br/>An important animated movie for sensible grown-ups and well-behaved kids. Braindead adults and hyperactive brats can go see the Incredibles.

","My 7-year-old son and I were excited to see this film, having read and enjoyed the book many times.<br/><br/>While we were both moved by the parts that were supposed to be moving, thrilled by the parts that were supposed to be thrilling, and awed by the parts that were supposed to be awesome, in the end, it missed the mark for me.<br/><br/>I had a hard time getting past how strange and un-real the kids looked and moved. Their eyes were too big, which wasn't cute, it was just ... disturbing. And please, that whiny kid with the glasses... Maybe the director needs to LEARN that flat-out annoying characters are, well, flat-out annoying.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the best bit in the film is the lost-ticket sequence, which brings to life my favorite illustration in the book, the two-page spread of the wolves watching the train pass in the distance. What a great choice to take one of the quietest moments in the book and use it to kick off some of the biggest thrills of the film.<br/><br/>I'm sure it'll be a huge hit, but I doubt that I'll want to buy the DVD...<br/><br/>Maybe we'll just read the book again."

","I hope that everyone likes this review. The Polar Express is an awesome movie that everyone should see at least once. It goes into the basic expressions of belief and doubt and takes it in a way must Christmas movies lacking Jesus seem to do. How hard is it to believe? Must you have to journey all the way to the North Pole and almost miss seeing the symbol of Christmas because you don't believe in him? You made such a long and dangerous journey and you still doubt? I love the message of the film that anyone can believe and as the film says, ""sometimes the most real things that those that you can't see."" It's a message that I hope everyone can enjoy and appreciate it's true meaning. Don't miss out on the joys of life by not believing and watch this film. I'm sure Christians can enjoy the message and I hope you all hear the bell ring."
"bts1984","9","3","6","14 December 2010"," Born a classic
","When this film came out 6 years ago, I went to the cinema for it. I was invited by a family member who wanted to watch it. It took me a while to make up my mind, as I was less than convinced about it. For me it didn't seem to be especially promising. I eventually agreed to give it a try. <br/><br/>Well, both me and this family member of mine adored 'The Polar Express'. I still remember as if it was yesterday how it blew up my mind and my impression hasn't changed with time. Even at the very first time I saw it, I already had the perception that it was gonna be a classic. Or, more appropriately, it was already born a classic.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things to enjoy. It brings fond memories of childhood's Christmases, when we were innocent, ignorant and happy and when Christmas was really Christmas. The graphics are really cool and admirably realistic. Everything looks surprisingly real (the characters, the amazing sceneries and settings). There are lovely Christmas carols, good characters, a nice story that is also a quest to the real meaning of Christmas, magic, colorful special effects, charm...<br/><br/>I am somehow thirsty for adventure films, so the fact that this one has exciting scenes with loud and jaw-dropping roller-coaster effects is fine for me and I welcome that.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks often portrays irritating characters, which harms my impression on him, making me avoid movies with *that* actor. That's the price to pay for this strong reputation of his. But in ""The Polar Express"" that's another ball game. The fact that his participation is vocal helps, but it also helps that he doesn't portray any annoying characters.<br/><br/>Most Christmas movies are silly and annoying for me, even though I like Christmas (well, I used to). But still there are exceptions and 'The Polar Express' is one of them. It is one of the very few Christmas movies that really deserve to be called a holiday classic and one of the only with dignity. <br/><br/>One of the things which this movie disappoints is the Big Man. He doesn't look too bad, but he looks a little phony. Also, there is a line that bothers me a bit: when the Conductor says «One thing about trains, you know. It doesn't matter where they're going. What matters is to decide to get on». I'm sure that his intentions are good, but filmmakers should be careful with the way these ""messages"" are transmitted. They can be badly misunderstood by kids and lead them to very serious trouble and disastrous consequences. Aside these two things, only a few minor cheesy scenes but nothing enough to harm my positive impression on it. <br/><br/>Title in Portugal: 'Polar Express'."

","Wonderous, marvelous, stupendous animation. Like nothing I've seen before, and Tom Hanks playing all those roles. The story is cool, the characters are cool. The ghost hobo is cool. Let's face it almost nothing is wrong with this movie. My only complaint is minor and I think the children would be less creepy if they had names. Look at the credit listing, it says thing like HERO BOY and KNOW-IT-ALL. These are names the script gave them. I would think to make them more well rounded characters the one thing they would been first is a name. I'm just saying. But that is so minor it didn't even effect the grade I'm giving it. The animation and the Tom Hanks is the main attraction and the main appeal of the Polar Express and I hope this new kind of motion capture is around a long, long time. 10 STARS."

","Robert Zemeckis is a film director always on the forefront of cutting edge technology. He started this trend way back in 1985 with Back to the Future. It was a film that was not merely a special effects vehicle, but a decent story of equal heart and humour. Zemeckis expanded upon this in 1988 with Who Framed Roger Rabbit, one of the first films to combine live-action with animation. And now with The Polar Express, Zemeckis takes the animated world to new heights, using revolutionary CGI effects with a new type of technology, motion-capture, to create a magical Christmas fantasy.<br/><br/>Based on Chris Van Allsburg's short story, a young boy at Christmas is at the age when the existence of Father Christmas is in question. This boy is never named but it is his journey of self-discovery and enlightenment we are invited to observe. On Christmas Eve, a steam train appears outside the boy's house. A conductor invites him on board the Polar Express, a train bound for the North Pole.<br/><br/>So begins our journey, and it's anything but straightforward. Perilous mountains, slippery ice-rinks, lost tickets, and crises of faith are all intertwined on board the Polar Express.<br/><br/>The Polar Express has come in for a fair bit of criticism because of the effects used to create this film. Motion-capture is a process where real actors are required to act in front of a blue-screen while their bodies are covered in special dots to acutely mimic human behaviour. And although it doesn't always translate well to the film, it still creates a quite dazzling and beautiful motion picture.<br/><br/>Some of the facial expressions on the characters are so eerily precise that it creates an otherworldly feeling. Something the filmmakers were probably trying to achieve. Although you can't escape the fact that there is an ever-present deadness to the characters eyes that doesn't quite sparkle with life, I suppose it's something you could get used to. But it still feels a little unnerving. The technology hasn't quite got there, but whether it can completely mimic human behaviour remains to be seen.<br/><br/>If the effects can't quite encompass human emotion, it more than makes up for that in the set design. The Polar Express is a really quite lovely film to watch. There are marvellous little details throughout. From tiny things like the frost on the train windows, clearly defined shadows, human perspiration and freckles to grand sights such as the North Pole that appears as a magnificent city. It all quite takes one aback.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, who's worked with Zemeckis in the past, gets to play six different characters. The boy (but voiced by someone else), the conductor, a ghostly hobo who lives on top of the train, Father Christmas, a Scrooge puppet, and the boy's Dad.<br/><br/>I don't think it was really that necessary for Hanks to play so many parts. In fact of the six, I only liked two. The conductor, where Hanks seems the most comfortable, and the hobo where Hanks adopts a gruffer voice.<br/><br/>The conductor is a likable character who is so insistent the train reaches it's destination. The only bad scene for this character was a really awful music number involving break dancing espresso waiters. It's a scene not helped by Hanks' dreadful singing voice. The hobo is an interesting character because he's such a mystery. He helps to restore the boy's faith in the spirit of Christmas. He also reminds me of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland, vanishing into thin air, but leaving certain body parts behind.<br/><br/>But I didn't enjoy Hanks' interpretation of Father Christmas. For one thing this St Nick is anything but jolly, and is played with a considerable solemnity by Hanks that verges on the bored. The fact that the animation renders Father Christmas so flat to look at doesn't help either.<br/><br/>The Polar Express is an admittedly episodic film. Because the source material is so thin, the filmmakers have had to stretch things out and create obstacles along the way. From derailments, caribou on the track and emergency brakes, I suppose the structure is unavoidable. But it does provide some exhilarating sequences like the roller-coaster ride through the mountains that made me feel like I was there.<br/><br/>The children on the train are quite well defined too. The boy who doesn't believe anymore, the lonely boy, capable girl and know-it-all. They all add something, and make the journey seem not as long. The music from Alan Silvestri helps things chug along too, with a quite nice duet from the lonely boy and capable girl.<br/><br/>The Polar Express has a lot of nice touches that even extends to the end credits with a gentle snowfall in the background. Whether or not this film will become a perennial Christmas favourite remains to be seen, but it tells a nice story about faith, and sends the message that maybe it's not the destination that's important. But the journey."

Also if your an adult and you generally don't like kid films find something else to do while the kids watch.<br/><br/>I must admit this film is great for kids that question does Santa exist. Not much of the film is intended for adults only those with more experience at being a kid. ;) It has a lot of wow factor and great scenes. The beauty of some of the scenes is really quite breath taken even your children would say, ""WOW!"". Unfortunately those that don't find much in the child videos as entertaining will find it boring and quit lacking.<br/><br/>The story is a basic Christmas story but it does have some adult lessons and questions that all children want to know and experience. In this movie an adult can re-live through that part in their life where one questions belief, friendship, courage and many of life's other lessons that so many adults forget. As a kid with over almost two decades of experience,(LOL, I'm 29), I felt transported to early childhood when one is just in awe of Christmas.<br/><br/>OK what is Joker approved? Joker is my boyfriend's 10 year old Blue and Gold Macaw. Everything we watch this bird watches. Parrots are very intelligent but are very child like in their behavior. In a nutshell, a perpetual 2yr old! We heard him laugh and react to the movie much like a child would.

I could not find a moral lesson if there was one for it feeds into the materialistic wants of the season which is exactly what Christmas has come to mean to many of us. Believe in your presents, folks, it is all, it is everything. I couldn't find a story anywhere and the beginning has to be one of the creepiest ever. This weird conductor wheedling children on to a train. Right, when every child that is streetproofed would run and scream loudly if such a conductor even beckoned from a distance. The computer animation is extraordinary but wears out quickly as the characters are so downright odd. Huge eyes, dark lips and unemotional and eerily plastic hair. Ugh. Frightening scenes of heads exploding, trains out of control with children screaming in terror, a nazi-like Santa Claus surrounded by mini-Nazis all doing and running frantically, only stopping to sing a Christmas version of ""Hail to the Chief"" as he emerges from his hibernation. Singing and dancing out of nowhere with no purpose, a funny old odd fellow sitting with a fire on the roof of the train drinking his sockwater. A travesty. Avoid. 3 out of 10."

"BelladonnaFatale","3","3","6","22 December 2004"," A Few Good Words.
","The Polar Express has some of the worst *movie* animation I have seen in a long time. When you compare it to works made by companies such as Pixar(Finding Nemo, The Incredibles)and Dreamworks(Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron, Shrek, and Shrek 2), it leaves much to be desired as far as animation goes. Animation is supposed to add to the storyline, not take away from it. I find that this movie cannot hold my interest what so ever because of it's horrible animation, the human characters look as if they have NO bones, they look like rubber when they move. I mean Tom Hanks did Toy Story back in what 1998 and even the animation back then, the animators grasped the concept of movement, true movement, in TOYS people, in TOYS! These are supposed to be people, but god it just hurts to look at. Now little children who don't know any better are not going to care because to them it's all about the story which in a book that is exactly what is should be. In an animated movie it's a partnership, one cannot work without the other. Personally they would of done better if this movie was hand drawn and not 3d animated. As far the book goes, this movie does not do it justice and I certainly wouldn't call this lack of effort ""the best Christmas movie."" It's such a shame."

","All-world film director Robert Zemeckis goes the animated feature route here with this highly interesting, but ultimately under-achieving little holiday picture. A young boy and a group of other children are invited to ride the titled vehicle as they all try to hold on to the belief that there really is a Santa Claus. An achingly simple and pretentious story-line with ho-hum cinematic executions almost sinks the landmark animation and articulate technological innovations. Tom Hanks tries his best by playing the voices to no fewer than five characters, but all the parts are so flat and under-developed that their three dimensional forms seem almost pedestrian. The character generation imagery is so life-like that it toes the line on being down-right spooky and even a bit disturbing.

","Despite its groundbreaking, impressive use of ""motion capture"" technology and its rich gloss, this is a very uninvolving movie.<br/><br/>Its cardinal sin is its main character, the ""Hero Boy"". He's a total bore. He doesn't drive the plot. He doesn't want anything. He simply doubts the existence of Santa Claus. His juvenile cohorts are not much more interesting, either. There is a token ""black girl"" who is, of course, a font of wisdom and strength. There is also a Jewish ""Know-It-All"" who is just an irritation.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, for some bizarre reason, plays all the main characters. Or rather, they used his data to create them. One character, a ghost-like ""Hobo"" who rides the roof of the Polar Express, is the most intriguing, but he's creatively restrained by the film's desire to appeal to the widest possible audience in the universe.<br/><br/>You know you are in trouble when a film's best sequence is a detour well away from the main plot. In this, that sequence involves a ticket that flies out of our hero's hand, flits about FORREST GUMP-style and is blown across several valleys and carried by various creatures across skies and snowy wastelands until it is fatefully returned to its origins.<br/><br/>The storyline is 100% predictable and the 3-D is accomplished but unnecessary.<br/><br/>What burns this costly turd to the ground, ultimately, is its PC nature. It plays safe with everything. Despite one or two concessions to minorities, it depicts a cloyingly middle class, white bread version of Xmas that made me want to vomit.<br/><br/>Alan Silvestri's score shoots its dramatic wad way too early and because Zemeckis uses it so blatantly and shamelessly to make us ""feel"" things that are simply not there, it comes across as gratuitous.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film. I wanted to be caught up in the magic its advertising promised. I wasn't. I was bored.<br/><br/>Consider the difference between this and Miyazaki's SPIRITED AWAY, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO or KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE. Miyazaki's films are about characters who want something first, concepts second. They take risks, they're not consciously PC and they earn every ounce of an audience's trust and involvement.<br/><br/>The same can also be said for THE INCREDIBLES, TOY STORY and FINDING NEMO -- all great movies because their heroes want something badly.<br/><br/>POLAR EXPRESS is a major dramatic train wreck."

It's like Pinocchio, where we think there's a real boy there, but the face is still just wood.<br/><br/>Then there's the story, or lack of same. A boy, at the age when one teeters on the edge between belief and disbelief, takes a magical train ride to reaffirm his belief in Santa. Good for a short picture book, but far too thin for a feature film.<br/><br/>So what we get is mostly filler. Long, boring sequences which might have been good in themselves, but here merely seem necessary to expand the length.

A main character so lacking in appeal that it's hard to care what happens to him. A series of train-in-peril scenes as old as film itself. A North Pole of endless factory-style red brick buildings with piped-in generic Christmas music that is the polar opposite of enchanting. A sea of elves greeting Santa that creepily evokes TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. A chance for its star to voice multiple roles, which leads to Tom Hanks fatigue.<br/><br/>Support from the score includes some ""original,"" forgotten-before-they-finish Christmas dirges.

The supporting cast is a mixed bag, Tom hanks voices the train conductor and does an awesome job in this role and you feel like he is easily the coolest character in the film. Also the other boy billy's journey is really interesting and you see the character grow over the film and in the end he becomes the character you are rooting for. The girl is a pretty bland character herself and the annoying kid is just way over the top and has absolutely no redeemable qualities to him at all. Overall the story is okay with Billy journey being interesting and the discussion about belief or non belief being solid. But when the audience doesn't care about the main characters story then the story definitely misfired. The script is okay mainly because of the train conductors dialogue but everyone else's kind of falls flat. The style of the film though is fantastic the cgi really works to give this film a darker tone and it is sometimes breath taking seeing the beautiful visuals that this film has. Overall though this is just an average film that you can definitely skip on."

","Ever since I was a small child, I've made it a point to watch the stop animation shows like ""A Year Without Santa Claus"", ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"", etc. To me, Christmas just isn't Christmas if I haven't watched these classics from the late 60s and 70s. I used to believe they'd stop making shows like those. Well now, a new movie has been added to my list of must-see holiday animation films. ""The Polar Express"" is an instant classic! I just watched it for the very first time today and was totally overwhelmed with emotion and Christmas spirit. I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I decided to watch it on TV, but I didn't want it to end. I cannot believe that this movie got such bad reviews when it first came out in the theaters. I'm guessing that many of the critics are just traditionalists who don't want to accept new concepts.<br/><br/>I found the characters to be believable, with depth, and sometimes they seemed to be real people. Sometimes the facial expressions of Hero Boy were not as good as the others, but that's the only thing I saw wrong (and this was a very minor issue). The moral of this story was worthwhile and the movie was worth every minute put into it. And the North Pole as shown here....what a glorious place! I feel like a child again and I wish I could ride the Polar Express one Christmas Eve. What a great movie! I was moved to tears by the end."

","This story is a wonderful story and the movie does it great justice! It's a fantasy journey that keeps you wondering where it's going while keeping the kids entertained. In the end, the pay-off is there with a wonderful way to encompass the 'Christmas Spirit'. It has something for everyone because it gives a deep meaning to the spirit of Christmas but doesn't necessarily detract from the true meaning of Christmas, which is Jesus Christ and all the religion that surrounds Him. The first time I watched it, I wasn't sure what I was experiencing because I didn't read the book. I therefore didn't let myself get too involved for fear that it might take away from the true meaning of Christmas. What a wonderful surprise when it didn't! The next year, I couldn't wait to see it again but I refused to watch it until Christmas time. This movie will be a family tradition and will only be viewed during the month of December. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
"Buddy-51","7","3","7","4 December 2005"," beautiful images, uneven story
","""Polar Express"" is an animated film version of the beloved children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. In order to give the film a true ""storybook"" look and feel, the filmmakers used real life actors, then digitally altered them to make them appear more like animated figures to help them blend in with the backgrounds. The result is a frequently dazzling, though often strangely creepy work, depending upon the individual scene.<br/><br/>The movie tells the tale of a boy who is just beginning to question the existence of Santa. One Christmas Eve, while he is lying awake mulling over his dilemma, a mysterious train magically appears in front of his house, carrying with it an enigmatic conductor who bids him enter. Torn between his dual impulses towards both doubt and curiosity, he ultimately hops on board, only to find it filled with other specially selected children all on their way to the North Pole.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the film features gorgeously designed and lovingly detailed backdrops that transport the viewer to a genuinely entrancing world of imagination and fantasy. Director Robert Zemeckis and his many animators and visual effects specialists bring this world to life through a dazzling combination of rich colors and uninhibited movement. Any single frame of this film could be used in an illustrated version of the original text.<br/><br/>The glorious visuals alone help the film to overcome the somewhat episodic nature of the storyline and the built-in repetitiveness that comes along with it. However, the movie runs into its greatest trouble with the look of the human characters. Although they are leagues ahead of the people in two-dimensional animation, there is a certain dead-eyed quality to them that is often disconcerting. Moreover, Santa's elves, creepy enough in close-up, look distressingly like a massive colony of swarming red ants when the camera pulls back. Thus, the movie ends up being at its weakest where it should be at its strongest - in conveying the innocent magic of Christmas. On the other hand, the final scenes posses a subtle tenderness that conveys the spirit of the season without becoming overly mawkish or sentimental about it. And Tom Hanks does first-rate work providing the voices for virtually all the male characters in the film.<br/><br/>""Polar Express"" may never achieve the classic status of the best holiday films, but some of its images will make it worth re-visiting every few seasons."
"omopower","5","3","7","1 May 2005"," 2 reasons why this film is not worth seeing
","1- The storyline lacks of believability and any kind of excitement. It's both the character's and the events which are superficial. I even doubt if children are amused by this uninterrupted happiness and by not having a real hero as a leading character. <br/><br/>2- The way it proves we're still not capable of producing realistic looking facial animation. It's quite frustrating to see pretty nice visual animation being alternated by bad eye movement and less expressions in the face. I'd rather see a less ambitious style with better looking animation. Maybe it's because I've seen too many Pixar films, that makes me compare. But I think their facial animation is just great! With all the motion-capturing techniques used in The Polar Express, I wonder what it needs to create photo realistic character animation."

","The first item that everyone needs to remember about the Polar Express ""This is a KIDS MOVIE  not an adult film!"" Mr. Keith Simanton has a review of this movie here on the IMDb site and he literally forgets this fact entirely.<br/><br/>The film is about a little boy's adventure and about his self-doubt about something he has believed in all of his young life; how this doubt leads him on many adventures within the main adventure itself. It is a film of believing and learning what it means to believe in something and never stop believing  ever! <br/><br/>Mr. Simanton goes as far as to make a statement that the exciting scenes from the movie have ""...all the tension of an elementary school play about a lost little present."" <br/><br/>Mr. Simanton's comments and a few others I have read, compare the movie to other adult films. THIS IS NOT AN ADULT FILM! If you want that type of excitement and drama, go see the ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"". An adult film recommended for children, which will scare the socks & shoes off of any 6-year-old child! <br/><br/>A kid will look at all the special effects in the Polar Express and marvel at the excitement and the adventure. A child will look at the Polar express and see that it is OK to believe in something that nobody else believes in. An adult that understands what the movie symbolizes will watch the Polar Express in their child's eyes and see Christmas as they remember it from long-long past.<br/><br/>My suggestion to Mr. Simanton is stick with reviewing what you know best, adult-themed-films. Let someone that can see the world through the eyes of a kid review the kids movies! <br/><br/>My suggestion to all the adults out their that want to remember their childhood and the happy memories contained there within  GO SEE THE POLAR EXPRESS WITH YOUR CHILDREN, and WATCH THEIR EYES LIGHT-UP!"

The girl's pigtails are so stiff i could snap them like a branch. The homeless man on top of the train defies all laws of physics but not the first newtons law. The train man who tap dances was unnecessary and disturbing. The fact that he got a hole in his pocket was SO rude. I couldn't believe it. Everyone in this movie is stupid and the train was destined to become a movie actor but it ended up sliding all over the ice. I'm so sad for the train. This movie was made in 2004 and train tracks were invented in 1830. The designers of this movie are uncultured and it was appalling that the train had no tracks to ride on. The runners of the train should have overseen the impending inclement weather. NEVER RIDE A TRAIN IN THE SNOW. IT WILL CRASH. This movie gave me the creeps and i have had nightmares for the past 12 years. This movie is the equivalent to a sweaty cow that smells like manure.

"dierregi","3","2","4","6 January 2008"," Depressing
","I watched this movie on TV during the Christmas holiday and I found it boring and slightly depressing. Afterwards, out of curiosity, I read some on-line reviews and I was amazed to see that some critics described it as a ""modern classic"" which will be watched over and over. By whom? I have no desire to go through another session of watching ""Polar express"" ever again. What I did not like about it: 1) the mix of real actors playing one (or more) parts and the half-real, half-cartoon look. It is creepy, even if it allows for some special effects (like the train sliding over ice) which would probably be a lot more expensive if done for a real-real movie. However, movies are not any better just because they are stuffed with special effects. 2) the length. This movie stretches on forever, even if the story is very short: boy discover that Santa exists, because magic train brings him to Santa central. Consequently, one cannot help but notice that most of the adventures are there just to fill time: the ghost, the lost ticket, the carriage that takes the three kids for an unexpected journey through the creepy Santa village, inhabited by the weird elfs... All irrelevant to the final purpose. 3) the believing-in-Santa message. Just why believing in Santa makes you a better person escapes my imagination (unless we want to border into dangerous territory and suggest that believing in anything irrational is better than not believing). Finally, I guess it would have been impossible to do such a movie without the usual ""screaming kids on fast vehicle"" scene, which seems to be beloved by the American public. That scene is so incredibly boring, I think I saw it in a million movies and yet it does pop up over and over again. For that scene only I would have disliked this movie that is not as innovative and amazing as some critics described. In fact, the only innovative thing is the creepy technique. The story itself is two lines and the moral is puzzling."
"Quinoa1984","6","2","4","12 February 2007"," a little creepy in some unexpected ways, though should be a delight for kids
","Maybe seeing The Polar Express would benefit from seeing it again on a big IMAX screen like Robert Zemeckis intended (it's been playing steadily the past few years in limited holiday IMAX runs with good results). But this isn't, if memory serves me, really one of his best films. It does contain that cheerful, strange holiday spirit that's associated with many seminal works (and like Christmas Carol there is a level of much needed darkness, like with the side-character the hero boy runs into on the train who looks like he's been slumming it in coal). There's even some suspense thrown in for good measure at times, like when the polar express comes into the city, but meanwhile our main kid characters are going underground and trying to find another way out to get to all the excitement up above. And it's a daunting task from Zemeckis and Hanks to pull all this off anyway, so as a technical marvel of animation and innovation it stands right alongside Who Framed Roger Rabbit as a grand achievement. But I'd be lying if I thought it wasn't just a wee bit creepy too.<br/><br/>The motion-capture technique which makes up the spine of the picture is sometimes stilted and a little, um, just weird for me, though maybe some kids will gravitate to it more than I. The songs are also a downer, as high-flying as they get in spots (the conductors' song on the train), seeing Steven Tyler was painful in this situation, and the sappy song thrown in at one point reminded me of the lesser songs I heard in animated movies as a kid. And yet, even with the problems I had with the Polar Express, it achieves what it sets out to do with enough confidence to make it a ""treat for the family"", as the cliché goes, and may attract them even more than I or repel them even more-so. It has its moments of ingenuity, and a great chase bit on the train involving lots of ice on the tracks. That it's less than the sum of its parts isn't unimaginable either."
"TribalWarriorPrincess","8","2","4","29 December 2006"," So much is left out
","Let me just start by saying that this is a great holiday movie. I was glad to see it. However, so many things are left out of the movie. First of all, none of the characters (except for Santa Claus and Sarah) are named. Second, there is no back story at all for the boy hero (I don't know this for sure, I didn't see all of the movie). Third, we don't learn squat about the hobo. He's just there and he makes brief appearances. And there's that line he says to the boy hero, ""Do you believe in ghosts?"" Does that mean that he is a ghost? After all, he just keeps disappearing. I think the movie probably would have done better if they did these things."
"Erik_Midtskogen","6","2","4","18 December 2006"," Dark and cold yes, but also vivid and exciting
","Lots of people have noted that this is a ""dark"" or even ""creepy"" film, and I would like to also propose that ""cold"" should be added to the list of adjectives used to describe it, and perhaps that instead of calling it ""creepy"", ""dream-like"" or ""melancholy"" would be more apt. In any case, most of us could agree that this film is most definitely not ""cheery"". I think the underlying reason for this is that this film has an obsession with the not-exactly-Holly-Jolly theme of innocence lost--or at least, innocence in danger of being lost--and then it succeeds in its artistic expression of this theme perhaps a bit too well. This film tends to also be very heavy-handed with its metaphors.<br/><br/>The film starts out illustrating the conflict between the main character's desire to believe in Santa Claus and the rapidly mounting real-world evidence against Santa as anything more than an alluring childhood fantasy used to market toys. And then it illustrates this some more. And some more. After maybe ten minutes of this, you feel like shouting ""OK, OK...we get it already!"" As the film progresses, the boy maintains what would seem to be an unnaturally high level of incredulity for such a young child in what most children would consider such wonderful circumstances. In fact, he appears so distracted by his struggle to overcome disbelief that he seemingly forgets to enjoy himself on what is, after all, a magic train ride to go see Santa Claus.<br/><br/>Did I mention this film goes heavy on the metaphor? For example, if you edited out all the footage of characters attempting to snatch something precious that is either slipping, falling, or blowing away from their possession, the film would probably come out ten minutes shorter. All this footage of the losing of things and uncontrolled swirling of things in icy cold air is effective as a metaphor for the elusive nature of faith in a harsh and chaotic world for about the first minute in total. The remaining nine minutes of it are just irritating.<br/><br/>It's not all bad, though. The cold and forbidding setting of this film is put to good use. Many parts of the train's journey though the frozen wilderness of what looks like northern Canada are exciting and beautiful in an unnerving manner as the monster steam locomotive from a hundred years ago does heavy battle with some of nature's most unforgiving elements in the frigid dead of night in the remote realms of the Arctic. This sequence includes a particularly vivid moment of the derailed train ice-dancing a crack-the-whip on a frozen lake. It's all very entertaining to watch, although some people will probably find the nearly continual, restless, full-screen motion a bit tiring to watch after a while.<br/><br/>But what about the main character? Did he enjoy the journey to the top of the world? Uh, no. For him, the trip contains an awful lot of struggling to inch forward along (or just avoid falling off from) the top of the train as it hurtles at blinding speeds into very realistically animated heavy snowfall (yes, it'll make you squint) through desolate wilderness in temperatures and motion-induced wind-chill that would have frozen a real person solid in a minute or two. My daughter watched much of this film in my lap, insisting that I wrap my coat around her because she felt cold. I can see why.<br/><br/>The main character periodically receives the assistance of a ghost or guardian angel, of sorts. Rather than a beautiful fairy, he's a haggard old hobo-looking type drinking swill out of an old can. I suppose this way at least the film avoids the good fairy godmother cliché, and this character does fit perfectly with the aesthetic of the rest of the film, providing a vivid blending of the realms of fantasy with a sort of real-world, Harley-Davidson grit.<br/><br/>Santa's workshop is a surprisingly dreary affair. You would think that Christmas Eve up at Santa's complex would be like an over-sized, Christmassy version of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, teeming with busy, cheery elves and bright colors. Instead, it looks like a cross between an inexplicably abandoned Mont St. Michel and some large-scale industrial site in Elisabeth, New Jersey. Maybe they were going for realism here, because the vast, gloomy factory spaces probably would have actually been big enough to crank out a toy or two for every child on earth. That's my punt, anyway.<br/><br/>This is a film about the fragile and ephemeral nature of childhood innocence and the magic that such innocence makes possible during Christmas. The message it conveys comes across a bit disjointed to me, but it seems to be that, if you succeed in the struggle to maintain your innocence, you'll be a better person for it. The uphill battle this film faced was to overcome the tendency of the questions it posed regarding faith and innocence to drag the film into a conspicuously minor key. For the most part, it lost that battle, but in the process it became a film that can't be confused with any other. In addition to its uniqueness and the otherworldly beauty that often haunts this film, there is also an excellent and sensitive sound-track that reinforces its salient qualities. Whether or not you like those qualities depends on what you're in the mood for, but this might not be the film to see with the relatives to spread the ol' Juletide cheer."

The storyline was equally enthralling. I enjoyed seeing how one thing always lead to another and then back again. This movie touched me more than I even thought it would. Without a doubt, it is up there on my list as a true Christmas classic, right up there with ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and the 1947 version of ""Miracle on 42nd Street."" <br/><br/>I recall reading the story many moons ago when I was a little girl in school. Although many things in the movie were the book were changed, one thing remained the same: believe."
"KGB-2","3","2","4","10 December 2006"," An hour too long
","The Polar Express is a wonderful Christmas book, and one would expect the movie to be superb. In some ways, particularly the voice work and beautiful animation, it is. Unfortunately the movie is not faithful to the original story and contains numerous pointless elements not found in the original story apparently added only to provide running time; specifically the protracted train ride (I recommend fast-forwarding through it). In my opinion the book has enough material for a half hour TV special. To justify the making of a full length movie around the book, the original story should have been expanded with character development, which is negligible in this movie, rather than adding superfluous elements that do not enhance the story. Children will likely enjoy the movie, and the message is good - although somewhat veiled. To truly experience the wonder of this story, read the book instead. Movie rating 3/10"
"the-evil-cult","7","2","4","18 July 2006"," Movie to Get Children into Christmas Mood
","The Polar Express is about a boy who doubts Santa Clause. This doubter finds a train one night that is going to the North Pole. When this boy gets on the train he falls upon one problem after another. Without giving away too much about the story, in the end the experience teaches the boy to believe in Santa Clause. A parent who wants to indoctrinate his children into Christmas and Santa Clause can try to use this film as a tool to do just that.<br/><br/>Visual effects in this movie are very impressive. It is animated but often the characters look very life-like.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't believe in Santa Clause as most adults presumably don't, but lying to children and then staging an elaborate conspiracy to keep them believing I thought was morally troubling. If lying is bad how is this a good thing? Perhaps the person who said that lying is bad was lying? The lesson I learned from all this is that lying is not bad or good. Lying is just lying and everyone lies to some degree, but most people lie because they want other people to be happy. Lying to your children about Santa Clause may make them happy, so whatever works is okay. This is a very pragmatic approach, one that even politicians can use to justify lies to voters.<br/><br/>In the movie the boy could not hear Santa's bell and he could not see Santa either. However, when the boy wanted to believe he could hear the bell and he could see Santa Clause. I thought maybe the message of this scene is that you will believe if you want to believe.<br/><br/>The nerdy kid in the movie, when the train started moving on ice, believed that everything that happened was an optical illusion. The conductor says that even things you cannot see are real. At the end the conductor gives a ticket to this nerdy kid with the words LEARN on it, but the conductor covers the R, so it reads LEAN. The kid is sure it said LEAN based on what he could see but just because he couldn't see the R it doesn't mean it didn't exist, and so this is something he could learn from.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, when the conductor was asking whether the protagonist kid wanted to get on the train, I was thinking, ""Don't accept rides from strangers."" A message of the movie is that you should believe and have faith in things even if you can't see it. What about faith in the goodness of strangers? Suppose a child molester drives up to a child and asks the child whether he wants to go for a ride. The child asks where the car is going and the child molester tells him he's going to the North Pole. The child might say, ""My mom told me not to accept rides from strangers."" The child molester might tell the child to believe that everything was going to be okay, to trust him. What I am trying to say is that a little doubt is helpful. If you always believed in everything, if you always followed your emotions, then you will likely be the victim of a scam or you will be exploited. So this movie might present some questionable values.<br/><br/>I saw this movie with a friend and the friend told me that lying to children about Santa Clause isn't really lying. You are just presenting to them something that they can understand. He gave an example. Mechanics for example, as taught in first-year college is not the ""actual explanation"" but a simplified model. It is simplified so that less intelligent people can learn it. He argued that Santa Clause is like a simplified model. But if Santa Clause is a simplified model, what is it a simplified model of? Furthermore, my friend argued that these simplified models are substitutes for the ""actual explanation."" Simplified models help explain certain things, e.g. Newtonian dynamics explains how objects move and allows predications to be made. But what does Santa Clause explain? How the presents appear under the Christmas tree? But the person making that explanation (the parent) is putting those presents there so that person knows he is lying. Furthermore, Santa Clause is not a simplified model. It is not simple! Santa Clause flies around the world in a short period of time delivering billions of present to the world's children. This throws up more questions than it can answer and trying to explain all those questions will complicate things. For example, if the doubting child asks, ""How does Santa Clause deliver all those presents on time?"" then the adult can give an explanation like, ""Santa bends time by modifying the universe."" How is a child supposed to understand this? It is much simpler to say, ""No, there is no Santa Clause. Those presents appear there because Mom and Dad put them there."" In summary, if you want a film that will put children in a Christmasy mood then The Polar Express may be good."
"sullibrandon","9","2","4","13 February 2006"," A Christmas Classic
","This movie just recently came out on DVD, and I bought it, not having seen it, but heard good and bad things about it. I wasn't too worried about whether or not it was good...having seen many previews for it it looked like a decent Christmas movie. When I stuck it in the DVD player I was happily surprised to find that it far exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>This is a Christmas movie that everyone should see. It's charming, funny, innocent, overall a perfectly wonderful family film. So many family films out this day and age are full of material that you wouldn't want your seven-year old to hear or see. This movie is the perfect holiday family film, whether you're a little kid or an old grown-up.<br/><br/>The movie is about this young kid who hitches a ride on a steam locomotive named The Polar Express, that supposedly takes him to the North Pole. The ride is filled with dancing waiters, a mysterious hobo who rides on the train, a conductor voiced very well by Tom Hanks, dazzling trips across miles of railroad tracks, and many more. This movie is entirely in CGI, and it is the best looking CGI film I have ever seen, surpassing even Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Though of course it is not perfect, it is the best Hollywood has to offer in terms of quality. The detail in the facial expressions is breathtaking, and the at times dizzying train ride had me feel like I was riding a roller coaster. Overall the special effects are wonderful.<br/><br/>But what really makes this such an amazing movie is the storyline. We follow the journey of this young kid (and I believe his name is never mentioned) as he makes a magical trip all the way to the North Pole. Though the storyline is nothing especially exceptional, its heart and charm overtook me as I fell in love with the various characters in the story. Their perfect innocence and delight in Christmas was a relief to see after so many horrible recent Hollywood films. The imagination in the film overwhelmed me as well. There was a particular scene where the main kid is on top of the train as the mysterious hobo skis along it towards the front. Very amazing, and at times heart-stopping. The ending is also perfectly wonderful, and I was very satisfied when I turned off the DVD player and the TV.<br/><br/>This would be a perfect film, if not for various age-old clichés that are spouted out, like, ""Seeing is believing."" There aren't many of them, though, and they actually manage to fit in quite nicely with the storyline as a whole. They aren't really noticeable unless you're looking specifically for them, or viewing it with a critic's eye like I did.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is almost certainly destined to become a holiday classic. There is nothing not to like about it. The characters are charming, the storyline is captivating and not cliché, it will appeal to young and old, and, well, basically, it's a good story, darn it! It should have gotten more recognition in theatres, but hopefully on DVD it will have a real chance to shine. Go rent this movie, or see it, or something, because if you don't, you are missing out on one of the best Christmas movies of all time."

"Pasafist","8","2","4","26 January 2006"," High Art Aimed at a Young Audience
","Christmas time is here. It's a time of Joy and maybe even a little pain. It's that special time every year I give the cynic in me a little time off. It's also the time I let myself get pulled into the movies of the season. I'm not talking about the fodder for Oscar that permeate this time, or the stupid little comedies created to play off these high class art. I'm talking about those movies about Christmas, the really engage and audience. Films like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, A Christmas STORY, MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, or MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS. Films that on the surface are a little schmaltzy and silly, but have so much heart I can't stand to be pulled in.<br/><br/>THE POLAR EXPRESS follows the adventure of a young boy whom has lost his faith in Santa. He muses the question any growing boy would ask ""Does Santa exist?"" When a mysterious train appears on his front lawn on Christmas Eve it whisks him away on an adventure that could take him to meet the big man himself. Was it a dream? Does Santa really exist? All these question will be answered in 90 minutes <br/><br/>Christmas has a new movie: THE POLAR EXPRESS. A film so sweet, and breathtaking it's hard as a critic to shower it with negatives. Of course I could I could tell you there are moments when the films momentum screeches to a halt, the ending goes on forever, and the tone of the movie is a little to sweet for its own good. I also thought the needless cameo by Steven Tyler completely dragged me out of the film. ""Oh look it's the guy from Areosmith,"" I mused. It took me out of the film for a moment because I thought I was in a much cheaper film. But I will not acknowledge those small trifles anymore.<br/><br/>This film is breathtaking. It's one fueled entirely by imagination. The new computer imaging effects do a great job of conveying a magical aura, without drawing us into reality. I don't believe we'll ever get to the point where a computer generated person will look human, (and that's just fine with me.) Had the creator's of the Polar Express tried to do that it would have destroyed the look of the film. But the characters odd movements, and almost human emotions strike the right chords. <br/><br/>I loved the dancing chef's And waiter's sequence on THE POLAR EXPRESS. It was silly and so full of life. I wondered if they had tried to shoot this film in live action (without green screens and body suits) what would this sequence look like. My thought: Bad Broadway. But the CGI characters could fly through the air, do difficult physical stunts and all without the scene feeling choppy. This is the first big sequence and it sets you up for the even more amazing wonders to come.<br/><br/>The Polar Express also takes us on an adventure in speed over and icy lake, down the steepest hill imaginable, and introduces us to characters that are both vibrant and fun. Tom Hanks fills at least 5 roles, and gives each one their own aura. I especially loved the vagrant Hurdy Gurdy man whom appears and disappears to help out the young hero. The scene on ski's I really don't want to ruin it for you.<br/><br/>THE POLAR EXPRESS is high art aimed at a young audience. If you have a heart of stone, I wouldn't recommend you waste your money here. But if you like to be whisked away to far off lands, if you have a place in your heart for Christmas, give THE POLAR EXPRESS a try. It's so much fun."

","If you haven't seen the Imax big screen 3D version, you haven't really seen the movie. It was fantastic! I've never seen anything like it! I'm a big 3D fan, (House of Wax, It came from outer Space, Kiss Me Kate, Dial M for Murder...) but generally 3D is only used as a gimmick.<br/><br/>Polar Express is the first movie I've seen where the 3D effect is used as an integral part of the movie. The 3D photography takes you over, under, and through the action packed train scenes, and gently falling snow sustains the 3D illusion even during the quieter moments of the film.<br/><br/>The animation is very eerie and arty, true to the illustrations in the book, and the story and music score are overly sweet; but all and all this was a wonderful theater going experience!!!

"hothead6400","9","2","4","25 December 2005"," It bears repetition, repetition, repetition
","My six year old son saw this movie last year and has wanted it on DVD ever since. Today, being Christmas, he got it and stayed up until midnight to watch the whole thing. I've never seen him last past 10:30 PM before.<br/><br/>The sheer joy he got from this movie was an unqualified pleasure to behold. But what's more, I was surprised to find myself drawn in - craning my neck to see the TV screen as it played at the other side of the room. Usually I sit at my computer rather than actually watching the TV. This way I'm with the family, can hear the dialog, participate in any conversations, but still do what I need to do.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Polar Express is an engaging movie and a very welcome alternative to the usual fare around here of Bionicle, Barney, spider man, rubberdubbers, rollie pollie ollie, and many others. I single out Polar Express because as most parents know very well, children will latch onto a book, song, or movie and play it incessantly - until they know the dialog by rote memory. Repetition is important to learning - especially with young minds, so it isn't to be discouraged, however this doesn't change the fact that you, as a parent, can find yourself clinging desperately to the last threads of sanity you possess.<br/><br/>Occasionally a movie comes along that bears repetition. They are few and far between. I believe The Polar Express is one such movie. Your kids can play it over and over again and it won't drive you nuts. Such movies can get boring and even irritating, but not to the extent that you start thinking about how to bury the body of a purple dinosaur and get away with it.. A few other great kids'/teens' movies that come to mind (for me anyway) are Chicken Run, the Toy Stories, the Shreks, the Lion Kings, Nemo, and anything with Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, or Harrison Ford. Ones that definitely don't make my list are Madagascar, movies with guys disguised as women (this is so over done, and yes, Robin did Doubtfire but the same rules don't apply to him), movies with gang members in conflict over petty issues, superheroes (heroism is born of strong character yet humble means -invisibility and endless strength are hardly humble), and older cartoons - the likes of Woody Woodpecker that often championed unprovoked violence against an innocent bystander.<br/><br/>Enough said. See Polar Express and decide for yourself."
"Chibichasechan","8","2","4","3 January 2006"," Another one of Tom Hanks amazing movies!
","I have discovered on this web site, that Tom Hanks plays many people on this wonderful film. Its truly amazing that he can make all those voice changes. From the deep voice of old saint Nick and the higher and more childish voice of the hero boy.<br/><br/>The director of this film I am sure added a lot more stuff than the usuaul book of the Polar Express. Like the Hobo I think. There is hardly anything wrong with the movie goof-wise thats good. Unlike other movies where there is a lot more.<br/><br/>In my opinion this movie is filled with fun,suspense and somewhat funny too This is truly one of Tom Hanks better movies. It has a great story-line and all of the parts of the movie fit into the ending. Like he couldn't hear the sound of the bells unlike the hero girl and the lonely boy. But then when he actually saw old saint nick in front of him he finally believes. And he will believe forever.<br/><br/>Remember everyone: BELIEVE"
"happy_bunny_rulez","2","2","4","27 December 2005"," not very good at all....
","Yeesh. Where do I start? Well, anything other than humans in this movie looks very cool, like the caribou or the roller coaster-ing train tracks, but (as others have commented) the actual people all look undead or stoned or something. And *the words don't match the way their mouths are moving!* i mean if they can send a dang man to the moon, they should at least be able to move animated character's mouths so it actually looks like they're talking! Also, the characters aren't very developed or lovable. I wish we could have found out more about the Hero Boy and the one girl. It would have made the movie a bit more interesting. Speaking of not lovable, I know the know-it-all kid is supposed to be annoying, but they could have at least made him funny. I mean, I had to turn down the volume whenever he talked. He sounds kinda like Big Bird only terrible and devastating, and to top that off, his lines were said with about the emotion of like, a piece of cardboard. The singing waiters (even though they could sing very well) all looked exactly the same and made me a little embarrassed to be sitting there watching the movie instead of doing something cooler. And the end was just kind of randomly embarrassing. Probably anyone under 8 or 9 will be entertained but their parents/siblings will be boreder than bored like me."

","This film is about a boy, who once believed in Christmas, going on a journey on a magical train that leads him and a couple of children to the North Pole.<br/><br/>He doesn't believe in Santa Clause anymore, since he saw the newspapers and news that Santa was a fake. He's doubting everything including the magic train and going to the North Pole. He meets some friends. The animation is great. It's used by actors and actresses playing the characters that are in the film. The movement they do is in the film. Hanks plays four different characters: The Conductor, Dad, the Boy, the Bum, and Santa Clause.<br/><br/>This film is really entertaining. There is major peril all over the movie and when you look at it, it's so amazing to see it. You are in awe and in shock, as you see the amazing visuals. The technology is great today that you can almost do anything with it. This could also be a sad film towards the end. The train is going to the North Pole where the first person will receive their gift before any other people in the world.<br/><br/>This is an amazing film. It might be too scary for small children but it's OK with young kids and adults. Not many people are proud of this film but they should be. This is a great piece of artwork."
"kerrylk1","7","2","4","23 December 2005"," Totally Inappropriate For Young Santa-Believers
","I have searched and searched but have not seen a single comment addressing this and it was my biggest concern about this movie: I have a 5 year-old who believes Santa is as real as Mommy and Daddy and I don't want even the seed of doubt planted yet that Santa might not exist, which is exactly what I think this movie will do. This movie, in my opinion, while thoroughly entertaining and heart-warming for adults and older kids, is completely inappropriate for younger children who aren't yet questioning the existence of Santa. It doesn't even occur to my daughter yet to question Santa and I certainly don't want this movie giving her the idea that she should.<br/><br/>Not only does it clearly show the boy's doubt and cynicism and all the opportunities for them to be confirmed, but when he finally does decide to believe, we clearly see, in the end, that the face of Santa is none other than ... Daddy.<br/><br/>To me, this is the perfect movie to take a child to when they first start asking the question - which shouldn't be until at least 8 or 9. I say unless your child is already questioning, don't take them. If they are questioning (or older) take them to the IMAX-3D. You'll enjoy the experience so much the weirdo movements and empty eyes won't bother you."

It took the animation to a new level.I am sure u would agree with me in this occasion.Although there are some sloppy moments,u have to sit tight for almost 95% of the movie.Its like a joyride into the realm of fantasy.Robert Zemeckis has created a masterpiece here.Tom hanks has been awesome like he always was. Yah i agree with some that it may not be totally made for children as it has some frightful or to be precise ""exciting"" scenes.But in total its a must watch movie. The theme and plot was like a feel good movie at the end.But the movie at each point was not about Christmas only,but like a realistic adventure. The soundtrack was also too good.""Seeing is believing"",""spirit of the season"",""when Christmas comes to town"",""Believe"" was awesome.

","We need more Christmas movies like this. I grew up reading this book and the story is excellent, this is a wonderful adaption. Great for the kids. And as far as people saying it is scary, it is probably those parents that never let their kids see anything and shelter them. It is not scary. And the action is great, it keeps the story going, and keeps you entertained.<br/><br/>As far as the animation, it is incredible. I am majoring in animation so I know what I'm talking about when i say its great. This is some top notch animation. It really couldn't get any more realistic than this. The only character i thought wasn't developed very well was the little black girl. I think they could have made her a little more realistic. Other than that it is amazing and captures the feel from the book.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is amazing in this film too. His voice provided a warm comfortable feel to the movie. I also grew up watching Tom Hanks movies so this was a treat to have him in a Christmas movie.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, and I think they put this movie together very nicely. It also preserves some of the magic of Christmas that is still left."

"AbeStreet","8","2","4","1 December 2005"," I think this will become a Christmas Classic.
","I saw this film during it's original release in the theater. I had mixed feelings about the film. I recently saw it again on DVD and have come to the conclusion that this was a fine piece of work and is much better than I first thought. I'll comment of the film from various aspects.<br/><br/>1. Story/Plot: I have never read the book, although I recently ordered a copy and hope to read it shortly, and so I had no idea what the story was about prior to viewing the film. The story focuses on a young boy and Christmas Eve adventure that he becomes involved in. This young boy takes a train to the North Pole and along the way meets several other kids that he befriends. In one form or another, they all help each other learn more about themselves and each other as they overcome obstacles and face unexpected challenges and dangers. The main character, the original young boy, who is beginning to loose faith in Santa Claus finally comes to terms with what he believes in and reaches a conclusion on the matter.<br/><br/>2. Animation/CGI: Personally I didn't think it was all that great. The non-human animation was pretty good. The train, outdoor scenery, snow, and the village at the North Pole were all well done. However, the animated humans, elves and Santa Claus all seemed a little outdated. Not bad, but something that may have been more in line with the CGI animation of films made 6 or 7 year ago. There movements were a little to jerky and their clothing didn't have the right kind of texture. Actually, the human CGI animation seemed more like the kind you might find in a video game. One thing that changed for me when I watched the DVD was the look the human eyes had. In the theater they seemed large and devoid of life, as many others have stated. At home they seemed much more life like. Now this may be because the screen at my home is much smaller or it could be that the eyes were touched up for the DVD release after so many people commented on the ""dead eyes"" during the films original release. Whatever the reason they eyes no longer seem dead and lifeless.<br/><br/>3. Music: I've always appreciated the score. It's nothing special but it does fit the film perfectly and is pleasing to the ear. The soundtrack is okay. While I don't really care for films that through in musical numbers, I'll have to admit that I catch myself singing the ""Hot Chocolate"" song. Overall the songs are pretty good and don't slow the film down.<br/><br/>All in all it's a good story. The story focuses on just a few of the kids on a train loaded with kids. We grow to car for these kids and actually feel their pain as they say good-bye at the end of the joiner. Tom Hanks takes on so many roles it seems as though he's narrating the film. Personally I would have rather had him portray the Conductor and narrate the rest of the film. Other actors could have supplied the voices for Santa, Scrooge, and the other characters Hanks provided voices for. In some ways this movie reminds me of MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, the story is about charting one characters struggle to believe in Santa.<br/><br/>Lastly, I think dark setting may frighten some kids but for most it will help add suspense, fear and beauty to the various scenes. The darkness was necessary as the story takes place late at night. If the story took place during daylight I doubt the film would have the emotional impact that it does by taking place at night."
"ImperialLeader","10","2","4","25 November 2005"," One of the best movies ever made
","The Polar Express is an incredible movie and is, in my opinion, one of the best ever made. The visuals are fantastic. The movie takes place at five minutes to midnight, so the sky is dark, but everything is shiny, glowing, and beautiful. The landscapes are gorgeous, as is the city of the North Pole.<br/><br/>There are plenty of adventures in the movie which will entertain viewers of all ages, but will not scare most children. The pacing works well; the movie does not drag, nor is it choppy.<br/><br/>The characters are unique and likable: the initially skeptical Hero Boy, courageous Hero Girl, annoying but funny Know-it-all, and lonely Billy. The animation is excellent, and the children are beautiful and innocent. Their mannerisms are charming and realistic: they sing, run around, and bounce in their seats on the train. The characters speak in short, simple sentences, which is appealing and realistic, since many of them are children. Their outfits (pajamas) are cute, simple, and childlike. The adult characters, such as Santa and the Conductor, are similarly quirky and innocent.<br/><br/>The music in this movie is excellent. The score by Alan Silvestri is magical, and the old Christmas carols contribute to the holiday atmosphere. One of the most beautiful scenes in the movie is the duet by Hero Girl and Billy.<br/><br/>The best aspect of The Polar Express, however, is the film's message that one should believe in Santa Claus forever. With so many movies that celebrate change, sexuality, and growing up, The Polar Express is extremely refreshing because it glorifies innocence. The moral of the story is that the best people are those who remain childlike and innocent and never give up their belief in magic and goodness. For some reason, this movie reminds me of the first two Harry Potter movies. These films all have warm, glowing visuals, glorious music, fun adventures, and beautiful, innocent child characters as well as unique and similarly innocent adults. The Polar Express embodies the qualities of childhood and innocence and is recommended without hesitation to anyone."

","I just saw this film for the first time today and I thought that it was absolutely wonderful. I must be honest, I underestimated this film before it even opened in the theaters. I thought that it would be terribly boring, but I changed my mind when I finally saw it. Everything about this film was just amazing. I'm not usually a big fan of animated/computer-generated films, but this movie really did impress me. I must say, I think that this is one of the best animated/computer-generated films that I have ever seen. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages, but in my opinion, maybe people who are at least seven years of age, but I say that because of some suspenseful sequences. I really do hope that many people get to see this film, preferably around the winter holidays. It's a film that everyone can somehow relate to. If you do see this movie, I encourage that you have an open-mind while you view it. It's fantastic! I really do think that this film is underrated."
"redlief","9","2","4","22 November 2005"," Come on people! This is a great movie!
","First off, I give this movie a 10 for production values. Innovative, exciting, stunning visuals. Buy the DVD, but if you get the chance to see a re-release on a big screen, do it. <br/><br/>This movie is a ten for acting...yes, I say, acting. These figures on the screen are computer generated using a live action process with real actors. Sometimes the tone or volume of an actor's delivery is over the top in such quasi-animation movies. Actors tend to want to make their mark vocally when they believe their image isn't on screen. However, Zemeckis must have had the complete trust and cooperation of his cast. A beautiful job of maximizing the fantasy while keeping the characters human. <br/><br/>This movie deserves a 10 for pace, continuity, and music placement. A story is told, action delivered, characters developed, a climax is reached,and an ending brings all the elements together. The writer and director execute the necessary elements that captures the viewer's imagination,makes us care about the characters, and keeps us watching for the conclusion. <br/><br/>This movie deserves a 10 for entertainment value. Don't get me wrong, I love a lot of R rated movies, but I do yearn sometimes for intellectual entertainment as a change of pace to loud action or a few bare breasts. The fantasy does include scenes of suspense and ""action"" but the story line and the visuals are what entertains in this movie, not the visceral stimulation of organs south of the belly button. <br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 because the limitations of a Christmas theme makes things just a little familiar. On December 23, with a few inches of new snow on the ground, a fire going in the wood stove, and a spouse, grandma,and the kinds gathered around the TV and a bowl of popcorn, this movie would get an 11+. But when you slap it in your SUV DVD player as brain candy for the 4 year old in the back seat as you drive to the family 4th of July picnic, it's thematic specificity is the only downside to this movie.<br/><br/>Buy it, watch it, enjoy it, and for those of you giving this movie ones and twos, stick to watching the Blair Witch Project."

","I've just watched this movie (animation) and it's AMAZINGLY STUNNING! Probably when you watched it, you were in a bad mood and your kid may have been sick or tired, or whatever. It's for people from all ages - 1 to 100 - and it carries beautiful messages. The characters are not creepy at all, except the ""guardian angel"". Hank's voice is well-used and it gives life to the characters dubbed by him. You should try and see the movie with your own eyes, not with your ""... 4-year old movie buff..."" ones (that's a strange label for a 4 yo) The animation is extremely vivid and the characters are... almost alive! What about the music? It's brilliant and touching, mainly at Christmas time. Well, people, as the movie says: SEEING IS BELIEVING! Take a closer look at it, with a kid's eyes, OK?

The book's award was for artwork, and that level of excellence was been maintained in the movie. Those who panned it are not looking through the eyes of a child. My daughter was entranced, as was I.

","This is another underrated movie that too many people just didn't get. I haven't read the book (I just ordered it from Amazon.com), so maybe that's a good thing, so I can't compare the film unfavorably.<br/><br/>THE POLAR EXPRESS is a simple but magical tale about faith. The script managed to get some mileage out of it, and you gotta love a movie in which Santa Claus is such a gentle giant, we see thousands of elves all the way to the horizon, one of them is Steve Tyler, and everything else in the movie, including the score, is grand! Why it wasn't Oscar-nominated for Best Animated Feature Film is beyond me, even if THE INCREDIBLES won because it was marginally better. The score should have at least been nominated (at least 'Believe' by Josh Groban was nominated). The title song is a fun arrangement, 'Spirit of the Season' gives me Christmas goosebumps even now that it's the month of May, and the instrumental music conveys the dreamlike quality of going to the North Pole. And how about the 'Hot Chocolate' number, though the song has very repetitive lyrics! The film has many wonderful moments, such as when Hero Boy first comes face to face with St. Nick. Isn't that a kid's Christmas dream?! At the age of 39, I can still appreciate that. That train almost becomes a roller-coaster as it presses on through rough terrain to meet its deadline. Even Tom Hanks' somewhat obnoxious train conductor is ultimately likable.<br/><br/>I can't wait till THE POLAR EXPRESS comes out on DVD. I can understand if it doesn't come out tillChristmas, but whenever it comes out, I'm there! I wish I could see the IMAX version. And remember everyone, 'you have everything you need/If you just believe.'"

","I am a fan of Zemeckis and have seen most of the films he made. One thing I like about him is, in every film he tries something new. Polar Express is no different!!! And the unique combination of Zemeckis and Sylvestri and Hanks takes us into a different world always.<br/><br/>Polar Express starts as a narrative work and the adventures of Tom Hanks is portrayed in a pleasant, funny and breath-taking manner!!! Hanks has played his character in a more thoughtful manner. Seeing the film makes us a child in some scenes and we can enjoy others around as becoming the same. Though I found the background music adding flow to the movie, in some scenes it seem to lag or lead the scenes. The songs are good. The CG is no doubt the most modern thing being used.<br/><br/>May be people with different taste may not like this film. But on the whole its worth seeing the movie.<br/><br/>My rating is 7/10."
"kgprophet","8","2","4","7 January 2005"," 3D Imax version is an incredible experience
","I deliberately avoided the conventional screen version of this film and paid the extra bucks to see it at the Imax in 3D. I'm sure you've read this before, but this is indeed the most fantastic eye-popping 3D movie made to date. Zemekis makes sure every shot has something heading straight for you. But even beyond that, it is almost freaky as you look into a mouth of a character's (very) large close-up on the Imax screen, and you sense the distance from the lips to the throat.<br/><br/>Zemekis must've wanted a make a fantasy movie to be remembered, and it is easy understand the huge budget needed to bring it to life. I'm sure no other movie he has made (including ""Roger Rabbit"") comes close to the complexity of this project. This film was made for the 3D experience, and it reminds me of the first time I saw ""Wizard of OZ"", a spectacle of imagery that I have never seen before.<br/><br/>Now, the story and characters are very tame, and there is nothing horrible about their adventures. I was more flipped out looking at these giant 3D heads on the super-size screen. The 'Hero girl' has a weird drawn face that doesn't quite look right. The eyeballs are more human like, which is why they look graphed on to non-human like animated faces. All the story subplots are designed to deluge the audience in further 3D effects. The elves all look like miniature Vladimer Putins, very freaky.<br/><br/>As an adult, I would not say this film is enchanting, but I was laughing out loud with glee as I would a ride at Univeral Studios Theme Park. There are too many jaw-dropping images to recount, but it is suffice to say this a breakthrough film on par with ""Final Fantasy"". See this film only in Imax 3D, or you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>I give it a 8 out of 10 (for the Imax 3D version only)"

"NoArrow","8","2","4","2 January 2005"," Have an incredible Christmas!
","The problem with Christmas movies is: they're generally  I mean, usually  made to make money. My point is, the producers/directors/writers/actors are often making the rounds on these ones  they don't pay much attention to what they're doing (example: ""Christmas with the Kranks""). They don't care.<br/><br/>""The Polar Express"" really cares about itself. It's got a long, beautiful story that it dares tell children and adult alike about. It is a film full of the kind of simple wonder, joy and magic that I thought was all but gone for years. It doesn't need to tell a story of complexities, violence or conflict for the children to be interested. All it needs to do for that is to give the kids wonder, and does it ever.<br/><br/>The story, though much expanded upon from the book, is still quite simple: a boy (known as Hero Boy) who is losing his faith in the existence of Santa Clause is  along with many other children  taken to the North Pole to see how it's all done. Of course the movie wouldn't be half as interesting if it was without their means of transportation: the Polar Express.<br/><br/>The Polar Express is a massive steam engine which runs on both coal and Santa's magic. It is run by a flesh-and-blood conductor (Tom Hanks) and a couple of engine men, though the rest of the staff seems to materialize in (and out) of thin air when they're needed. For instance, when the conductor orders cocoa for the children a group of waiters leap into the car, pour their drinks, sing and dance, and are gone in a flash. Another instance of the train's magic is when Hero Girl's (Hero Boy's new friend) ticket flies out of the window and various parts of the environment (animals, wind) cause it to catch up with the train. Seeing this in 3-D was amazing.<br/><br/>There are many other scenes of pure spectacle, as when the train skids over ice, or when Hero Boy and a strange hobo who lives on top of the train (Tom Hanks) race to an empty car before being crushed by the oncoming tunnel. These are very exciting, energetic, fun, and visually stunning action scenes, and require no violence either.<br/><br/>The film keeps its supply of wonder and energy for the entire ride of the Polar Express, but when the train rolls into the North Pole, it slows down just a little bit. I think this may be because the Pole is already so familiar to us, too familiar for a few small adjustments to change. The Pole still looks nice, with its thousands of elves and its small buildings and toy factories (it looks more like hard work than jolly fun), but we've seen it all before, too many times. Still, this is probably the best envisioning on screen that I've seen.<br/><br/>And probably also the best envisioning of Santa himself. Played by Tom Hanks, this Santa seems like a real man, warm and kind though with a no-nonsense voice, who reacts to his job and requirements like a real person might. His entrance is one of the most memorable parts in the movie, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed Hanks' ""performances"" in the film. Of his three most significant characters I would say the Hobo is my favorite, just because he's so eccentric and original, but The Conductor and Santa are right behind.<br/><br/>Another thing, my mother said she didn't like how the movie was devoid of spirituality, but I disagree, I think it was all right there on the screen. I mean, when The Conductor says that life's best things cannot be ""seen""well, what else could he mean? So, it was a great film. A spectacle. It should be seen by every family. I suggest you see it in 3-D, because it is amazing that way, and you had better hurry. But I have a feeling they will play this every few years, at least, in the IMAX, so children decades from now will still be able to catch the experience of one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made.<br/><br/>8/10"
"the_usual_suspect","6","2","4","23 December 2004"," A beautiful picture that doesn't speak a thousand words.
","It has taken ten years for Chris Van Allsburg's charming picture book to make it to the big screen, but it has been worth the wait. Mostly.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis has made a leap forward in animation with The Polar Express, the story of a sceptical young boy who gets on a train destined for the North Pole. Motion capture truly does capture the performances of its characters, and the human nuances that have eluded animators for so long are present here in spectacular detail. For this Zemeckis deserves an Oscar.<br/><br/>Now let's talk plot. The Polar Express is a tiny story that can be read in ten minutes. It is numbingly obvious that Zemeckis has tried desperately to fatten up the tale with a barrage of subplots, which eventually all arc back to what is unfortunately a very weak central plot. It is certainly not a bad plot, I'm as much of a sucker for Christmas spirit stories as any five year old, but there simply is not enough of it to constitute a hundred minutes.<br/><br/>The film chugs along at a slow pace, capturing a midnight mood by accident. The excitement is then delivered in gratuitous and all too common roller coaster sequences which would no doubt look so much better in 3D IMAX, the format that this film was made to be viewed in.<br/><br/>In terms of characters, the little boy from the book has been turned into a sceptic in order to encourage some form of tension in the film. It is a good move, as without this, there is absolutely no drama whatsoever. Tom Hanks voices the kid, as he does almost all the male characters. To have Hanks voice the child is a mistake, as although he is good at it, the idea of the boy envisioning the conductor and Santa in the template of his father is lost, not only by this, but also through the underdevelopment of the relationship between father and son.<br/><br/>Hero Girl (Nona Gaye) is the film's best elaboration from the original story, and her moral journey is a well developed one. The message delivered to the Lonely Boy (Peter Scolari) by the Conductor (Hanks again) on his ticket is an ambiguous one that needs further explanation if it is to be heeded by the film's younger viewers.<br/><br/>The Polar Express is a film that will be remembered for its original and visually superb presentation. Plot, character development and pace will of course be (and in some ways, already are) overlooked when this film is labelled a classic of our time. It is wonderful that such innocent and moral driven films are still being made, but Zemecks' latest would have been so much more perfect if it had been made as a short film. There isn't enough to work with, and subplots are forced into place to fatten up the story. A beautiful painting that doesn't speak a thousand words.<br/><br/>Rating: 3/5"
"doc71933","10","2","4","18 December 2004"," If you don't believe, this will stir your doubts.
","This is an excellent movie for all ages. As I sat in the theatre with my wife, son and adult friend, I was amazed at the wide diversity in attendant age. Seniors to small children and even adults without offspring were in the crowd. The realism in animated 3D characterization was excellent. The numerous roller coaster effects are spectacular and not for the feeble of stomachs. There is little laughter, except for the odd subliminal quip, but then again I don't believe that was the intent of this film. There is a message built in for every type of person and you must be ready for it near the end. You can't help but see yourself and at least someone you know in the movie. Be warned that you may even find a tear welling within even if you think you have a heart of coal. The scope of doubtful emotion and the sense to deny the child within builds to the final conclusion that maybe, just maybe there is a wish to believe."

","Ignore the folks who are paid to review movies and know that this Christmas classic will undoubtedly become an enduring favorite for many years to come.<br/><br/>The animation is a wonderful achievement and this is truly a movie where the story comes to life on screen. I was totally unfamiliar with the book, so I read my granddaughter's copy after the movie and realized the movie resonated with me moreso than someone of my granddaughter's age. This movie speaks to those who no longer can hear the sound of the Christmas bell. In many ways, there is something of a peculiar kinship with ""It's A Wonderful Life"" in the use of the bell for the spirit of Christmas as opposed to the sound of a bell for an angel getting their wings. Kudos to Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for a brilliantly conceived vision. Haven't seen the IMAX version, but I can only imagine how much more harrowing certain parts of this movie might be in that format. The instrumental music is very interesting. Nearly a supernatural theme rather than a wistful one, but it works in this movie wonderfully. The individual songs may not be hummable as you leave the theater, but they work well in the context of the film."

I was enthralled with the movie as were 350 kindergarten through 4th graders. The train ride is exciting and feels like a roller coaster. I wanted to ride that ride. At one point in the movie, I felt like I was there following this ticket that floats through the air (it had the feel of the feather in Forrest Gump). There was also another part where some children sing a song and I found the song to be touching. Tom Hanks does a fabulous job in all the roles that he plays. It shows his true gift as an actor.

The Conductor invites the boy to take a voyage up to the North Pole to experience for himself what Christmas is all about.<br/><br/>While The Polar Express is light on a thought-provoking and/or innovative plot, it offers some of the most incredible visuals a moviegoer has ever seen. It is an enjoyable ride through the snow, ice and then some all the way to the North Pole where millions of elves help Santa prepare for his departure to deliver gifts all around the world to those children whom have behaved themselves.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this is a must-see family film!"

"movieguy1021","8","2","4","27 November 2004"," The Polar Express: 8/10
","I don't understand why studios (especially WB) continue to spend massive amounts of money on certain movies. I would think that from Troy (which cost over $200 million to make, got about $150 million domestically and somehow recouped its losses overseas), they would know better than to invest a whole lot of money into one particular movie. But the lesson was not learned for The Polar Express. Using motion-capture animation (how they did Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies-or, even simpler, the animation Homer Simpsons invests a lot of money in), Robert Zemeckis (who last revolutionized animation with Who Framed Roger Rabbit) creates a dazzling world from Unnamed Suburbia to the North Pole. After hearing what the 3-D IMAX experience was like, I would have liked to have seen it there, but I saw it on a measly movie theater screen. Still, I loved it nonetheless.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, being the versatile man he is, does the voice and motion capture for about five characters: the boy (whose voice is mixed with Daryl Sabara's, from Spy Kids), the conductor, the hobo, the father, and Santa Claus. The boy, doubtful about Santa's existence, hears the whistle of a train right by his house on Christmas Eve. He steps aboard to see a bunch of other kids en route to the North Pole via The Polar Express. Along the way, magical things occur as the boy (trying to believe in Santa all the way) figures out the truth (secular truth, that is) behind Christmas.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, being the cynic that I am, I loved The Polar Express. I think it was the simplicity-the book by Chris Van Allsburg is simple, and, although the movie is made out to feature length, it too is simple. The story's easy to follow, and that lets you get caught up in the visuals, which are astounding. All of the animation is astounding-not only is it lifelike, but it's also surreal. Some sequences (such as the ""lost ticket"" sequence) are so, for lack of a better word, gratifying. I'm not sure if it's only me, but when I was watching The Polar Express, I felt like this was almost the culmination of animation. It seemed like we worked for 100 years to get up to the quality of The Polar Express. While that obviously isn't so, it sure seemed like it, which is quite a plus for the movie. For a movie to make me believe that this is the best quality possible is pretty spectacular.<br/><br/>What's even more spectacular is that the movie made an old Scrooge like myself into some little kid mystified by the Christmas spirit. Sure, it's a month too early, but still.... The ability to take most people from nine-to-fivers to five-year-olds gawking at the idea of Santa is probably the most stunning transformation a movie can do to the audience. And The Polar Express does it perfectly. It's more than the ""another year, another advance in animation"" movie. It's a huge achievement in film, and I speak that with no hyperbole. Not only is it the animators, but also Robert Zemeckis who make the movie what it is. Imagine the long hours that Zemeckis, basically overseeing the whole project, would have to work. I'm not trying to demean the animators here, as this was obviously a huge group effort, but if Peter Jackson can win a best director Oscar for making a nine hour movie, can't Zemeckis win one for making a movie of this magnitude?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, having Hanks play four and a half characters means that four and a half characters sound exactly alike. It kind of takes away from the whole feel of the movie, when Santa, the conductor, his father, et al. sound exactly the same. Also, I think some of the situations were a bit childish (like the back-and-forth with the engineer, etc.), but still, that can't really diminish the awesome power the movie has. It's truly an amazing feat for everyone involved, and the fact that it probably won't get its money back is basically a sin.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated G."

Watch it and you'll understand (although making this revolutionary animation didn't come cheap either, at $165 million dollars!). The filming angles, settings, character movements, the Polar Express ride, and the City of North Pole, simply could not be shot in real life with the kind of stunning effects presented in this movie. Tom Hanks delivers yet another (and another, and another... for a total of 5 roles) astounding performance.

Someone doesn't believe in Santa/no Christmas spirit, some miraculous Christmas miracle happens, their love for Christmas is rekindled. It's been done. There's nothing classic about it. My second last sentence basically spoiled the movie for everyone.<br/><br/>I know that's not the point of the movie, it's just supposed to fill us full or Christmas spirit or what not, it failed at that.

That's the first time I've ever hated songs in a kids movie. <br/><br/>I saw it in the IMAX 3D, and it was unimpressive (popping-out-of-the-screen wise). Two times in the whole 90 minutes does something actually come out of the screen, you might as well see it in the actual theatre. I left the theatre annoyed and cheated, even though I got the movie for free!

Why are two of the children on the train the very children who would have the biggest doubts about Christmas: the Jerry Lewis clone (another stereotypical Jew) and the poverty-stricken little boy who had never had a Christmas -- completely ignored and only the WASP kid from Minnesota got a Lesson of some very vague kind? Why was the Black girl there, except to heap more unhappiness on the poor kid by burbling about how Christmas is about parties, gifts, decorations and, in fact, commercialism -- and why does she remain clueless when clearly the poor child is made more unhappy by her burbling? Is she the PC version of the vacuous little rich girl?<br/><br/>And why does the North Pole look like North Philly, with Muzak on a 45 rpm record thrown in?

","I thought ""The Polar Express"" was a wonderful film. Tom Hanks was, as always, wonderful in all of his multiple roles. <br/><br/>The late Michael Jeter was marvelous in his last role. <br/><br/>The animation was nothing short of amazing. It stays very true to Chris van Allsburg's original story and pictures. <br/><br/>All of the acting is superb. There are many touching moments, many involving Billy, the little boy who's never received any gifts from Santa. His ""When Christmas Comes to Town"" song with the little African-American girl actually moved me to tears. Go see this movie. You will not regret it!"

","I loved it and it will definitely become a Christmas classic. One thing that enamored me of it was the Department store name,Herpolshiemers. I was amazed,when growing up in Michigan my best friend and I would ride the city bus downtown and spend our Saturdays at a Herpolshiemers store and I assumed it was the only one of its kind until I heard it mentioned early in the Polar Express. I was absolutely flabbergasted when later on in the movie they said,Grand Rapids, Michigan. Can anyone tell me the connection in the movie and why Herpolshiemers and Grand Rapids Michigan is involved? This just floored me and brought back such great memories,as I am 54 now."
"Theoron","10","2","4","15 November 2004"," Polar Express is more incredible than 'The Incredibles'
","I must admit I had low expectations as I walked into the theater to see Polar Express. I had seen 'The Incredibles' just a short time earlier, and was amazed at how good that film was, perhaps the best film of 2004. I did not think Polar Express or any other movie could possibly top it. <br/><br/>I was wrong. Polar Express may be the best movie of 2004, so far<br/><br/>When creating a film from an incredibly popular and well-know book like Chris Van Allsburg's 'Polar Express,' I had wrongly believed that the Hollywood types could only screw it up, make it boring, and fill it with lots of Jerry Bruckeimer-type special effects that would only distract us from the wonderful story. Again, I was wrong.<br/><br/>The film 'Polar Express' does an absolutely wonderful job of capturing the two best aspects of Van Allsburg's book: the artwork and the message. <br/><br/>The computer techniques used to tell this story are, by far, the best use of computer animation I've ever seen. Nothing that Disney or Pixar has done even comes close. The look and feel of Van Allsburg's wonderful artwork is completely intact, and in some ways, even exceeded. It's like watching a beautiful oil painting come to life. The film, if nothing else, is an absolute feast for the eyes, I was completely in awe from the opening minutes to the closing credits. I truly did not want to watch this banquet of beauty and light to end.<br/><br/>But of course there's more to a movie than visualization, and the simple, but powerful tale of a boy out-growing the need to believe in Santa Claus is very well done. In the book 'Polar Express,' the boy-hero very much still believes in Santa when the train shows up in front of his house. In the movie version, we see a young boy who's begun to seriously doubt the Santa stuff. The change is a good one, in that most of the audience, especially the adults, will be able to relate to this change in perspective about Santa Claus that comes with the coming of age. The visit of the train to this boy's house is more than just the start of an adventure, it is the beginning of a mission of redemption, even if that redemption is only one's faith in a Jolly Old Man. <br/><br/>But that's why 'Polar Express,' first in book form and now a motion picture, works so very well. It' not really a story about Santa Claus at all, but about faith. The film drives home this message in a more heavy-handed way than the book does, but still without the preaching and condemnation that often comes from other Hollywood films that attempt to re-educate their audience. <br/><br/>Polar Express works on a much, much deeper emotional and spiritual level than does 'The Incredibles,' and will fit in very well with those other Christmas classics that are really parables about faith, like 'The Miracle on 34th Street,' and 'It's A Wonderful Life.' And to a lesser extent, even 'A Christmas Story.' <br/><br/>My seven-year old daughter, who saw both films with me, gave 'The Incredibles' a score of 9 out of 10. As we were walking out of the theater, I asked her if she liked 'Polar Express.' She told me 'Yes, I give it an eleven!' <br/><br/>My review of 'Polar Express' is of the 2-D version that will be seen on most screens. I have every intention of going to see it again, but this time making use of the IMAX 3-D version. Roger Ebert (film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times) saw the film this way, and said it was the best 3-D experience he's ever had. <br/><br/>I so wish the Polar Express would stop in front of my house this Christmas Eve. <br/><br/>My rating: 11 out of 10."

","""The Polor Express"" is a wonderful Christmas book by Chris Van Allsburg. The artwork of the book has been amazingly transformed to film in Zemeckis' film. <br/><br/>Many reviews have ridiculed either the quality of animation or the absurdity of the prolonged story. I think that this film did an admirable job at making a short picture book come to life in a wonderful tale on screen.<br/><br/>I know that if I were a child again, this film would capture my heart. It nearly did that and I am an adult. I honestly think that children of all ages will enjoy this story as a wonderful Christmastime treat.<br/><br/>There are so many small details that take the story telling in the film to a greater depth that is not possible in a book. It is a very good companion to the original book but in no way does it take its place. However, the film remarkably does not try to overshadow its source material like most book to screen transitions.<br/><br/>At times the film gets lost in trying to create conflict to prolong the story, but it is worth going to see with family and friends if just to watch the beautiful animation come to life. The story's true essence is still present and it is filled with beautiful music by Alan Silvestry.<br/><br/>Read the picture book with your family this Christmas and also enjoy the film. I know that you will love both."

","My family and I loved this movie. I had heard quite a bit about the animation process and how ""unusual"" it was, and I was prepared for it to interfere with experiencing the story. I was pleasantly surprised at how little I noticed the new animation style. Every once in a while something about a character (usually the mouth) would jump out as odd. Overall, I thought the animation was well done. As for the story, Yes, it had a few elements that felt somewhat incomplete or slightly slow. But my 6-year old son, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found it very touching and full of good messages: ""Children can and should be leaders. Greed isn't respected; confidence and compassion are. You get friends by first being one."" I believe this movie will be a seasonal classic like the animated Grinch Who Stole Christmas and A Christmas Carol. And I hope that 10 years from now, the critics who disparaged Polar Express will be perceived in the same group as those who panned It's A Wonderful Life when it was first released. I believe those critics ""just can't hear the bell"". I'm looking forward to making viewing this movie with my family a holiday tradition."

","I saw this movie two days ago, and I must say that I'm very surprised at the current low rating of 7.0. <br/><br/>I was amazed by this movie. I saw the IMAX 3-D version. I really suggest that you see it this way. I have never seen such a spectacle in a theater. I have never seen a movie more than once in the theater, but I may see this one again, because that experience can't nearly be duplicated at home.<br/><br/>I thought they did a fantastic job with this wonderful children's book. I really am surprised at the negative comments from people. I don't know maybe in a normal theater it would just be a very good movie. Many people are commenting about the lifeless look of the characters, I guess that is somewhat true, but it didn't bother me at all. I think the actors did excellent work with the voices. That brought them to life for me. Tom Hanks is so good.<br/><br/>I went to the movie with two families, 4 adults and six children ages 3,4,4,6,10, and 10. There were some parts that I think can be scary for small children, but none of the ones in our group had trouble with it. My three year old son hid his eyes during the scene where the toy came to life and yelled at the boy, but it was over quickly, and he went back to enjoying the movie. I must say though, that I think it's a shame to have scenes in a movie like this that can potentially scare young kids. It's just unnecessary. Why put doubts in parent's minds?<br/><br/>I think anyone of any age (above 3) would LOVE this movie. Go see it in IMAX. I think it's an instant classic."

","This film is an absolute delight. If you are going to see it, skip the 2D version and head for the closest IMAX theater and see it in 3D. I had seen this process once before on the Titanic documentary, and it's unlike any other 3D process. The depth, detail and bone rattling sound are definitely worth the few extra bucks. I expected not to like this film - there's a lot of negative press floating about. But if you've got a bone in your body that still remembers what childhood feels like, you'll be transported to a magic dimension. The fellow sitting next to me, a father who had brought his whole family, was ooohing and awing and gasping more than his kids. The major complaint on the film - the stiff movements and blank eyes of the human characters - just don't matter. There's so much going on on the screen I never even noticed. Go see it. Take the kids. Or if you don't have any kids, find some childish adult friends."

I liked that two of the characters were from Michigan. I am going to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD and the book! I loved the part where they were pulling the guy's beard to get the caribou off the tracks. The movie was so realistic, I remember feeling that same way at one time.

","This film will probably become a classic, and many people will love it. There are sequences in it that truly honor the spirit of Christmas, but it would have been lovelier and more commendable had people looked at the expressions on the main characters. The children look like they're ""sleepy"" or under the influence of some harmful substance. Why did this happen?<br/><br/>Some of the animation is truly outstanding, there is a couple of catchy new songs, and yet, the payoff is not quite what we expected it. Still, the children will enjoy it.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis did an awesome job before. Is there a chance he can do what George Lucas do and go back and fix it a little bit? Then we will probably have a true classic in our hands."

But before long, you are believing this is real and not animated. Again referring to The Incredibles, I couldn't imagine anyone would have a chance for Best Animation this year. See Polar Express and you'll be astounded by the level of detail.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, so I won't be one of those who complains that this and that weren't true to the original. Whatever.

","I saw the Polar Express last night on IMAX 3-D. I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, the movie didn't deliver. I never connected or felt anything for the main character and the supporting characters were just annoying. The musical scenes in this movie made me want to dig my eyes out with an unsharpened pencil. The only saving grace to this movie was the ghost character. The plot was slow in the beginning and felt rushed in the end. The only people I could imagine enjoying this movie are the under 7 crowd. Don't waste your money or time.

"soccer4life5278","10","2","4","13 November 2004"," A must see for children of all ages!
","I am very critical of most movies, especially ones where I have read the book. This movie out did everything I expected. If you have read the book there are some changes but it only adds to the depth that the book took us toward the North Pole. If you appreciate great artistry you will love the animation in this film. The motion capture procedure they used is nothing short of amazing. To watch these animated characters come to life in front of you on the screen is a real treat for those of us who appreciate the complexity of CGI. If you don't go for the story just go to enjoy the animation. The level of detail in this film is fantstic. I was captivated at several points in the film just looking at the level the creators took the detail down to. Even the smallest parts of the train are finely detailed, the buildings at the North Pole, the way each character moves or runs, how the clothing and characters interact, how the hair moves, well, just about every detail you can think of. <br/><br/>Now for the story. I have read this book to more children than I can remember for many years. I have read it in women's shelters to children who resemble the little boy who thinks that Christmas just doesn't work for him. I have never experienced anyone who was not enthralled with the story and did not want to hear the bell ring when I gave them one. I have worn a bell on Christmas day since the first time I read the book. The movie does the story justice. It actually expands upon the world created by the author. I would suggest going in and letting the ""magic"" exist inside of you for a couple of hours."
"Pulpmariachi","7","2","4","12 November 2004"," See It In 3-D, if You Can
","I'm lucky enough to live in Colorado Springs, which has one of the few 3-D IMAX Theaters. Be that as it may, I hardly ever attend a film there because it's like $3 more than the regular matinée ticket price ($5.25). But I went with my family to see this yesterday and I'm glad this is where I saw The Polar Express.<br/><br/>The Polar Express isn't necessarily a good movie. It shows how difficult it is to adapt something like a 32-paged picture book into a 100 minute movie. There are some pointless adventures on top of the train, with a ticket, and on some ice. Then within the workshops of the elves (I wish that more people would make elves tall, like the ones Tolkien brought to life in his novels). On top of that, there is a rather annoying musical number with, get this, Tom Hanks singing. And then, at the end, the film falls victim to its own sentimentality. It gets to be TOO sentimental, unlike the book, where the whole mood fit right in. <br/><br/>And because of this, I don't think this would have been that great of a movie in 2-D on the regular screens. But in 3-D, Zemeckis's visuals pop out at you. You can catch try to catch the snow, stop the train, slap the Hero Boy in the face, or shake Tom Hanks's hand (my brother tried to do all of these). This is what made the movie cool to me. <br/><br/>So, if you ever get the chance, see it in 3-D at an IMAX theater. But be warned, the lines will be HUGE. At the ticket booth, nearly all the IMAX shows were sold out while there seemed to be a lot of room in the normal theaters. Get there early and bring a book to read. <br/><br/>In fact, if you're taking little kids like your children or siblings, why don't you take the BOOK itself and read it to them before going to the movie? <br/><br/>Again, I'm glad my city has one of these theaters. Oh, one more thing. At least at our IMAX we didn't get those annoying blue and red glasses that came with Spy Kids 3-D. You get those nice black ones, so you can see all the colors the same, but the images still stick out at you. You know, the kind they have at DisneyWorld.<br/><br/>For this film, I would give it 2/4 if I had seen it in normal theaters. But since I got THE IMAX EXPERIENCE, I'll give it 3/4."
"jcw858","10","2","4","11 November 2004"," What a magical ride! (Possible SPOILER)
","The Polar Express is a unique film that other animated features have yet to match. The musical score made this film all the more magical. I'm 21 years old and have admired Tom Hanks all my life. The five different parts that he plays are unforgettable and the song ""Hot Chocolate"" that he sings is probably my favorite scenes because it has Tom's voice and dancing waiters. Watching the movie and the whole ghost aspect to the film made it appear nearly real to the boy,even though it really was a dream,or at least one of those dreams that come true. This movie is appropriate for kids and adults both because the messages at the end of the film constitute what we all could do to be better people in this world. I wish I had my own ticket to the North Pole so I could believe again. This is probably one of the best Christmas movies I've ever seen. ****FOUR STARS****"

","I took my 6-year-old to this movie today. The theater was full of kids and parents, with a few unattached adults. I take my boy to lots of movies and I cannot recall the last time he and every other kid in the theater was completely silent for the entire length of the film. They were all enchanted, and frankly, so was I. While exiting, I heard some teenage girls talking about how they had been crying during the film, and I believe that. There is not much to the plot, but complicated story lines are not what entertains kids. The book on which it is based was thin, and so the lack of plot is understandable. The technology was terrific and the graphics made it quite exciting and realistic for an animated movie. We enjoyed POLAR EXPRESS very much, and I recommend it."
"cobbler88","5","2","4","11 November 2004"," Doesn't quite get the job done
","I didn't really know what to expect when I went to ""Polar Express."" All I knew of it was what I saw in the trailer. While watching it, I struggled with the urge to ask the people I went with, ""What, exactly, is the point of this film?"" I struggled, because the point is obvious. It's your basic ""faith-in-Santa"" story, which is fine. What I later realized was that this was quite a large effort to put forth such a small idea. I would liken it to building a skyscraper to house a newspaper stand. A lot of expense and effort went into the film, but it really didn't make it any better than it would have been had there just been a small cast of actors doing the same story. <br/><br/>The only exceptions to me are the roller-coaster effects of animation when the train is traveling, which is quite nice, but not so over-the-top that it will make your stomach drop. I thought that was well done.<br/><br/>But even the animation was wanting. Having watched ""The Incredibles"" the night before, I think I prefer my animated characters to act animated - not pretend to move as humans. I honestly found the animation a little creepy because things just weren't right. It got downright sloppy when it came to the boy they picked up on the wrong side of the tracks. When he began chasing the train, and was brought on board, the lengths and movement of his arms was very odd.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I didn't really find the movie or its characters very endearing, or anything close to resembling an instant holiday classic. It was a small story that had a lot of generally superfluous action and other crap tacked on to make it last 90 minutes. It seemed much longer."

I liked the scene with the train sliding across the ice. I could have done without the children crawling through the workshops.<br/><br/>I wish Jumanji had been so carefully preserved.

"LG72387","7","2","4","11 November 2004"," Vivid and imaginative
","The Polar Express is indeed a vivid and imaginative film created by Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis. It is a stunning adaptation of a holiday classic that will be cherished by many for years to come. This is indeed the ideal Christmas story about a young boy who doubts the existence of Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve, the boy encounters a massive locomotive known as The Polar Express, which guarantees a round-trip ride to the North Pole. The boy is reluctant at first but then decides to board the train perhaps because he is curious or perhaps because deep inside his heart there is still the belief in the unrealistic. While on board, the boy encounters a variety of characters including the appearance of a ghostly hobo, who teaches him that seeing is believing. However, the boy still has many questions which no one has the answer to except himself. Throughout the film, he goes on a journey of self-discovery and decides at the very end whether or not he still believes. The film has heart and is both touching and magnificent. Tom Hanks plays six characters in the film but does his best work as the conductor, who doesn't need proof that seeing is believing. There is also the appearance of the dead toy car, in which there are various amounts of toys that have been neglected over the years. The scene is both haunting and filled with sorrow at the same time. Yet the most touching sequence comes when the boy receives the first gift from Santa Claus towards the end of the film. The boy receives proof that some parts of life are not fantasy and learns that all of us must have faith in whatever you believe. Not only is the film powerful emotionally but it is also a visual wonder. Robert Zemeckis has used the remarkable technology of performance capture to create a world so genuine and realistic that you begin to question if the film is animated or not. It is a roller-coaster ride of adventure and Christmas spirit that never ceases to amaze. Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis have taught us to believe in the Christmas spirit with this magnificent adaptation of The Polar Express. The film will definitely go down in the annals of such Christmas classics as It's a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street. Terrific, Terrific Film-making! <br/><br/>Lenny's Grade: A-"

The animation of the children's faces was a bit creepy, but aren't a lot of animated characters kind of creepy?<br/><br/>I can't comment on the geopolitical ramifications of how the children were treated at the opening or what the director may have said.

"TheMovieMark","Null","2","4","11 November 2004"," Better than expected
","*removes sunglasses and takes cool guy tooth pick out of mouth*<br/><br/>Have you ever wondered what a midnight trip to the North Pole would look like? No? Neither have I. But that doesn't stop The Polar Express from attempting to capture that journey through the eyes of a young boy. As cool as I try to act, I have to admit that it is a pretty impressive journey. I know I'll catch heat from my friends for praising a G-rated animated Christmas movie starring Tom Hanks, but I'm man enough to give credit where it's warranted.<br/><br/>The Polar Express is definitely geared more towards children. After all, the entire story is told from a young boy's perspective. The viewer is witnessing a dream inside his head; a dream that explores that pivotal moment in a child's life where he must choose to either close the door on part of his childhood, or to keep pretending that he believes in Santa Claus just so he can force his parents to continue to give him gifts from ""Santa Claus."" I'll never forget the fateful day when my parents closed that door of my childhood themselves, resulting in half the number of Christmas gifts in the years to come. It was a sad time, one that certainly put a damper on my 18th birthday, which was less than two months away.<br/><br/>So unlike Johnny Betts, the kids on the polar express still have a choice. Each is on his or her own personal journey, and each has a lesson to learn.<br/><br/>The first hour of the movie is great and moves at a very fast pace as we witness the adventures that occur as the train makes its way to the North Pole. Everything on screen is just impressive to look at - the scenery, the animation, the action, the characters. I especially liked the first-person view of the train barreling down a roller coaster-esque track. Robert Zemeckis wanted to make the movie feel like an oil painting come alive, and he succeeded. Not that I'm an expert on oil paintings and what they would look like if they were given life, but I digress.<br/><br/>The movie does slow down for the last 20-25 minutes. Once the train trip has ended and the destination is reached, the movie starts to *ahem* lose steam. Bwahaha! But hey, prior to that, it was chugging along *snicker* at a great pace. I'm sorry. I was just trying to think of some lame puns that I'm sure plenty of movie critics are using in their reviews. I'm pretty sure I succeeded.<br/><br/>Anyway, I could have done without the little sentimental musical number where three of the kids join together to sing about ""when Christmas comes to town."" And macho guys might start to lose interest once the children begin to learn their individual lesson. Yeah yeah, it's all sweet and good, but it's nothing original. I won't fault the filmmakers for that. A good ""moral of the story"" in a kid's movie never hurt anybody. So if you start to zone out then just pay close attention to all the fine detail, and you'll be impressed.<br/><br/>One of the things that I found most impressive is the characterizations of the humans. The human characters benefit greatly due to a brand new system called Performance Capture. Performance Capture is a process in which the actors wear form-fitting motion capture suits, but unlike regular motion capture, Performance Capture is able to capture genuine emotions and natural expressions. Every single movement by the actor is captured, down to the flutter of an eyelid. The result is the best CG humans I've seen. The mouth movements actually look pretty good! Most CG humans look like they've got peanut butter stuck on the roof of their mouth when they talk, so this is an excellent advancement. I'm eager to watch this system develop.<br/><br/>One of the main points in the movie, as the conductor tells the little boy, is ""it doesn't matter where the train is going. What matters is deciding to get on."" I don't know that I agree with that. What if the train is going to Detroit's inner-city? Or even worse, what if the train is actually on its way to Hell? What small child is gonna want to take that trip? If you decide to get on then you're in trouble, and you've got the conductor to thank. Quite the disturbing message, don't you think, Mr. Zemeckis? Oh well, it's all right to look past this and enjoy this visually stunning film.<br/><br/>*puts sunglasses back on and places toothpick back in mouth*<br/><br/>THE GIST<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie you can take the entire family to, then go see The Incredibles. If you've already seen it, then The Polar Express is a very good second option. It's a little more child-oriented than The Incredibles, and the sappy moments might slightly grate the coolest of cats, but it's an entertaining movie, and at the very least you'll enjoy the visual experience. <br/><br/>Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)"

","Polar Express is the kind of movie that makes you feel young and dreaming of Santa Claus's arrival on Christmas Eve. A young boy who is on the verge of losing his belief in Santa Claus wakes on Christmas Eve to find a train waiting for him. The destination is the North Pole. Tom Hanks plays five characters in this movie, all of them very well. The movie is beautifully animated. I felt I was on this train going to the North Pole. I love the journey on the train, the smell of the coal, and the smoke from the engine. The message of the movie is that for some of us the magic of Christmas goes away as we get older, some never had it to begin with (symbolized by the young boy sitting in the caboose), and a few who has it for the rest of their lives. I know this by experience. I think I lost the magic of Christmas a long time ago. I doubt I will ever get it back. This movie shows me what I lost and wish I still had.

","This is a Christmas movie. The animation It between realistic and cartoon. So it a little bit weird looking. The plot line, storyline, characters, characters development were all really good. I have watched this movie many times. But it not a Christmas movie I would watch every Christmas. But it good to watch a few times. There was a lot of emotions in this movie. It was a fun watch. I never got bored when watching it. I recommend the movie to everyone no matter the age. This is a child friendly movie and family friendly movies."

","Great things about the movie:
1. The visual effects are great, except for the humans and facial expressions.
2. The world building is beautiful and colorful: the train, nature, frozen lake, railway, north pole.
3. The voice cast is perfect, especially Tom Hanks who does perfect job for multiple characters.
4. The music and soundtrack are beautiful.
5. Great lessons: believe in something that is not visible (dreams, spirit, imagination).
6. The character development is great, for the hero boy, hero girl, lonely boy, and the know-it-all boy.
7. The audio effects are well done.<br/><br/>Animations for humans and the facial expressions look unnatural.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1. The way the flying ticket was blown against the wind, got stuck on a window, and formed a snowball felt not so real. It also should have had wrinkles after being eaten by a bird. But for the sake of magic, it worked.
2. The hero boy should have not survived when he was on the roof of the train. But for the sake of magic, it worked.
3. Why and how could the conductor and hero girl use the roof of the train to get to the front of the train?
4. There should have just been one person needed to fix the train lamp.
5. Did the lake get frozen every year?"

","When I first saw clips of this I did not like the phony look of the film, nor did I like Tom Hank's annoyingly grating conductor voice. I was turned off immediately and ignored the film for years. However after watching the entire film several times, I have fallen in love with it. Robert took a cute yet relatively simple and uni-dimensional children book, and added smart embellishments and interesting side stories which really make the film very special. Concepts like a hobo ghost that was killed on the train years ago, yet who helps our protagonist (hero boy) out of many difficult situations is just brilliant. And I love having 'hero girl' as a black girl that the conductor encourages to become a leader. Totally not necessary, but a great addition. And thank God the poor kid from the other side of the tracks was also not black. These decisions were just spot on. Some of the scenes were just stellar - the ""journey of the lost ticket"", the ""roller coaster ride"" on the front of the engine, and the ""frozen lake"" are all classic. To me the film is very enjoyable and perfect for Christmas."

Or his Jewish revenge on Christians. This is not a Christmas classic, this is not heart-warming, this is really crummy. No amount of huge orchestration can make up for a good script. It only proves that good actors (Tom Hanks) are not good without a good script. No wonder it made no money. No wonder I got it for free. No one else would buy it or wanted it. Yachhh.

","The Polar Express tells the story of a young boy who is beginning to lose his faith in Santa Claus. Then, on Christmas Eve, a magical train filled with other unbelieving children pulls up in front of his house to take him to the North Pole. Along the way, the children get into adventures until the meet Santa and learn the true meaning of Christmas. This film is terribly done and butchers the classic children's book.<br/><br/>The book was so simple and great. It was a short length, and yet it covered so much. The boy gets on the train, there's a few pages of the journey, and when he arrives in the North Pole, he meets Santa Claus right away. Turning this story into a 2 hour movie was a big mistake. The film makers had to add so many ridiculous things to make the movie 2 hours, that the plot was too stupid to function. The movie is visually dazzling, I'll give it that, but the pointless additions to the story completely bog the movie down.<br/><br/>As for acting, it kind of annoyed me that every voice in the movie was Tom Hanks. Maybe he could have changed his voice a little to make it unrecognizable. Also, maybe his name was too big for this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie has too many pointless plot points that make it boring compared to the book.<br/><br/>3/10"
"siderite","6","3","8","11 August 2005"," Graphical movie. That's it.
","I didn't like the movie. It doesn't really make me feel Christmasy, nor does it have fantastic animation. The 3D characters have faces emulated after the main actors, probably the movements are also made by a face mesh that translates real actor facial expressions. So, the only things that remain to be appreciated are the story and the non-character graphics.<br/><br/>The plot is one of those ""Seems dangerous, but it's marvelous, so it's OK"" stories. The things that happen don't really make any sense and everything seems not to have any purpose at all. In the end the children do get to the North Pole, but it is nothing compared with what happened in the train. So the movie is about the journey, not the end.<br/><br/>Maybe it's me, but I was bored throughout the movie, and so was my wife. I watched the last half by myself. The musical bits with the dances couldn't have been more out of place. So, no, it's not a good movie. Even for the children."

At the time it was revolutionary but that was 2004. Technology has advanced drastically and this film has stood eerily still. No lip movements, empty eyes, and macabre facial expressions plague the characters in this film and push it over the edge into the uncanny valley.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' voice acting is fine. The children horrifying and perplexing. The music is nice but there is no story. No Christmas magic or spirit. Instead it feels like an immersive Universal ride in all the worst ways.<br/><br/>Zero charm, zero characters, zero plot, zero heart. A hollow bulb of a holiday film that will strike fear and nightmares into the hearts of children generations to come.<br/><br/>You saw this as a child, congratulations. This is still an objectively horrible viewing experience."
"ketutar","2","2","5","15 October 2019"," The Book Was Better
","I don't care much about the film technical qualities - some people like them, some don't. My problem with this movie is the story. It stinks. I understand that they had to expand the story, but they did that very badly. They practically destroyed the beauty and magic of the original story.
Addition of Billy made it a story of entitled children. Poor, lonely kids can't expect anything even from Santa.
Hero Girl was just a reminder of that non-white males just have to work harder and be self-reliant to succeed, they cannot expect any help from others.
Because of Billy and Hero, the conductor seems like an a-hole.
Even Santa looks like a giant jerk.
And on top of it all, the movie says that if children don't believe in Santa, they get a magical train trip to North Pole. So, when children don't believe in Santa, and see this movie and DON'T get a magical train trip to North Pole, it's just further evidence of that the whole story is humbug and stories and just a huge big lie.
It was unfair. It was nasty. It was making injustice obvious and acceptable. Of course the white rich boy would get the first gift of Christmas, EVEN WHEN HE WASN'T REALLY THE MC FROM THE BOOK.<br/><br/>So. no. The only way for a person to think this is a great movie and wonderful and promotes Christmas, is if one is a white, entitled person."
"TheMovieDiorama","6","2","5","25 February 2018"," The Polar Express, despite all of its technicalities, is a whimsical bland adventure.
","Claimed to be the first full digitally captured motion picture, it was one of the most expensive animated features at the time. Giving such a daring project to an experienced director like Robert Zemeckis was a wise choice. Children all board a train called 'The Polar Express' which is heading to The North Pole. During this expedition, the children soon learn and experience the magic and spirit of Christmas which will make all the non-believers change their mind. It's a pretty standard plot, but one that is utterly accessible for the younger audience. However for others, there is a substantial disconnection between the characters and story that it comes across as monotonous. Although we can all agree, the animation and bold attempt for a entire digital movie was excellent. A technically sound film. No question. Despite a few jagged mouth movements and character motions, it's surprisingly fluid for the most part. Snow falling as the train ferociously powers through ice or even a herd of caribou, it all looked realistic and with a huge budget it needed to be. A whimsical tale that is not overly jolly. It doesn't force Christmas themes constantly (until the third act), there is a hauntingly magical undertone that doesn't feel glossy. I admired that, was rather mature at times. The characters themselves, well, were dull. Considering that nearly all of them are anonymous, there is a huge disconnection that prevents us from investing into the story. Therefore, Zemeckis just uses them like puppets in order to showcase the visual effects. From one situation to another, it came across as gimmicky. This easily could've been avoided by introducing some personality within the characters. Speaking of situations, some of them felt ridiculously random in order to evoke a sense of wonder. Singing about hot chocolate, a convenient man who assists the protagonist and then disappears like snow, Steven Tyler as an elf (way too weird!?), it didn't work for me. Style over substance."

","I saw The Polar Express when it was first released with my family. I remember that my dad loved it and I thought it was TOO long. I still dislike it and think it's too long. The message of the story is that you need to ""believe in order for things to happen"" sounds like religious based instead of Christmas based. Believing in something doesn't mean that it's true, it doesn't mean that something or someone exists, and it doesn't guarantee that you will get what you want."

","Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie very much. It is nice to watch around Christmas time. The film respects the book of the same name, which I think is a great one. Actually it was one of my favourites, a timeless Christmas story about the power of belief, faith and hope. Back to the film, one thing that was a definite plus was the visuals. They were phenomenal, colourful and looked as though the animators had gone to extreme lengths to make it neat. The character animation was just as impressive. The music is very good, with sparkling motifs and haunting secondary themes. The end credits song is truly beautiful. Another plus was the voice cast, Tom Hanks stands out obviously. He voices five or six characters here, and he was great as always. However, the film does take a while to get going, and the script is rather simplistic. And while the visuals were outstanding, the story while respectfully true to the book(while adding characters and changing existing ones) just isn't compelling enough, and is made up of disconnected,unexplained and sometimes rushed scenes in terms of story telling. All in all, a nice Christmas film that is well worth watching chiefly for the visuals. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","I don't see the point. It's ponderous. The animated people are creepy (look up uncanny valley). Scenes go on and on and on for very little purpose. The plot is skeletal and must be padded out with lots of meaningless dramatic, screaming roller coaster rides, as if Disney or Spielberg were planning an amusement park ride based on the movie. Most of the characters are annoying and unlikeable. Some of them keep showing up as if they will have something important to add to a climactic scene. They don't. They just vanish with no lasting impact. Somebody summed it up as ""if you don't believe in Santa Claus, you'll be kidnapped on a train on Christmas eve."" That pretty much sums it up."

","Somewhat predictable modern Chrismas fantasy with forgettable songs and rather pat characterizations, but the CGI effects really shine.A good understanding about railroads and train travel is clearly demonstrated. . The Polar Express itself is a fantastically detailed(and completely believable}example of late 1920s-early 1930s American railroading. The steam locomotive is absolutely majestic as are the pre streamline era""heavyweight"" coaches in its consist.It even has the open platform rear observation car. No wonder toy train manufactures went gaga over it. The journey is fun, even though the design of the North Pole resembles downtown Lancaster Pennsylvania-really. A somewhat predictable wrong turn is taken by the kids, but you know it will be OK at the end. Also, the use of non CGI shots in black and white in the monitoring center of the station is unique in its own right. Film does manage to capture the wonder of what this holiday is supposed to be about. On this level alone, it cannot be faulted.Good wholesome entertainment, especially when compared to all the negative ""entertainment"" of todays movies that we are too often ""treated"" to. Tom Hanks as the {cgi} conductor gives one of his best performances, and the multi-racial kids are cute too.Fine family entertainment-especially for model railroad and train buffs."
"acts2120","5","2","5","14 December 2006"," Oddly engaging and boring at the same time
","Unlike so many others, I thought the CGI was amazing 95% of the time. I thought there were times when the people looked real. Except for the Hero Girl; the dimensions on her face created some odd angles, and there were times when she looked as if someone forgot to finish the detail work on her. And the Elves. Besides the fact that several were Jewish (cuz there just aren't a lot of non- Jewish people who use the word 'meshuganna' in casual discussion), the elves were FREAKISH looking. When one of them kicks a kid down off the giant toy bag, and then turns to another and says, ""Trust me""... whoa. I found it disturbing, for some reason.<br/><br/>Aspects which others thought boring and unnecessary - such as the ticket flying out the window - I found absolutely mesmerizing. I really admired and appreciated the craft that went into some of the more interesting visuals - like the ice breaking, and the dance sequence. But I do agree, these were utterly unnecessary for the story telling of the film.<br/><br/>Plot - hmmm??? Oh, plot! Um, yeah, it's here, somewhere,... sort of... maybe one of the many extemporaneous kids on the train - who all seem to believe in Santa, so what are they doing there???? - took it and hid it. Or maybe... there wasn't one!!! The plot 'didn't just work out for me.""<br/><br/>I'd watch it again - just cuz it was so pretty. But unlike ""It's A Wonderful Life"" or ""A Christmas Story"" I don't think I could *listen* to the lame dialouge every year. That's what laptops are for!!!"

","I have to agree with the comments of #57, steve49er. This movie is easily one of the most well done, original movies in a long long time. It's no re-make of the 'classics', like many attempted to do, and ruined, like what they did to Frosty the Snowman, and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. This one is indeed destined to be a classic in it's own right. My only regret is that I didn't take the time to go see it back when it first came out. Thankfully, it's been on Cable this week and I've gotten to see what I'd missed. My Wife and I will certainly be adding this to our library of DVD's. You'd do well to rent it, find it on TV, or just buy it. I'm glad that someone in Hollywood finally got a good story and ran with it."

It has been added to my ""favorite holiday movie"" collection. I also hate to admit that the movie had me holding back tears a few times. It was just so refreshing. It made me miss that awe and wonder that you have as a child during the Christmas season. I remember growing up that I LOVED Christmas.

"jovine76","10","2","5","8 April 2006"," A Journey of Christmas Spirit
","Let's face it, we all can remember the time when we were little kids, and we were full of anticipation of Santa Claus and all the gifts we would get on Christmas. This gorgeous film, reminds us of those times, and reminds us of the true spirit of Christmas.<br/><br/>It's Christmas Eve, and a boy has his doubts on whether or not Santa Claus is real, due to some magazine clippings of regular people dressed as Santa, and a encyclopedia that states the North Pole is ""Devoid of Life"". So, naturally he gets a big surprise that night when a giant train shows up outside his home,its engine roaring, and out comes the conductor telling him it's going to the north pole, hence its called The Polar Express.<br/><br/>The journey will be like no other, full of surprises and thrills, and complete enchantment, and we feel as if we are right there, going along for the ride. The friends that the boy makes are true friends, and the moment he meets Santa Claus, Christmas will never be the same. For those who believe, once believed, or never believed in Santa, and have at any time, imagined what the north pole was like and meeting him, will not be disappointed as the film beautifully captures the look and magic of the north pole and Santa himself. Tom Hanks did a wonderful job voicing the conductor and the hobo, along with the performance capture of the boy/hobo/conductor/and Santa.<br/><br/>The other actors deserve as much credit, and I applaud Robert Zemekis for this brilliant achievement, from the man who gave us ""Back to the Future"" and ""Forrest Gump"", I didn't expect anything less.<br/><br/>Now some have objected to the things that occur in the film and how it is inappropriate for some children because it might be a little too much. While I agree the film has some dark moments, they are certainly not the type that will give your children nightmares, unlike another film like ""Jumanji"". Others have criticized the look of the characters as not being so impressive, thought I found the animation to be better than I expected, and finally some have criticized about the action sequences to be a bit exaggerative, that the whole movie was nothing but a lousy adaptation of the book, spruced up to be the equivalent of a ""big blockbuster action extravaganza"".<br/><br/>This film is none of the above, and it was a downright insult that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Oscars), did not give this film a much deserved nomination and win for Best Animated Film for the year 2004. I know everyone was more excited about seeing ""The Incredibles"" and though I'm not knocking that film, I think its great, and I'm glad it got the Oscar, but I would have preferred for this film to get that honor. It's a shame that it was a commercial failure, because it deserved to sell as many tickets as ""The Incredibles"". Along with being released in theaters nationwide, a special IMAX 3-D version of the film was released, and it is by far, my favorite version, though I am just as happy when watching it on DVD. The IMAX version sold the most tickets, it did so well that IMAX brought it back in Christmas of 2005, the same time the DVD version came out. I really hope they bring it back in theaters Christmas of this year, because it is a genuine treasure, and the moment your hear the bells from Santa's sleigh, the bells will continue to ring in your heart, and in all the other hearts of those that truly believe, so Come Aboard!!!!!"

","The crummy PC story (changed substantially from the original book) is bad enough, but the characters are so creepy-looking in the ""semi-animation"" that I can't stand to watch them for more than a few minutes at a time. This movie is genuinely scary and I can't believe that there aren't quite a few kids who have been having nightmares that are populated by these...whatever they're supposed to be. Thankfully, this movie has not started a trend in this direction and I'm spared having to watch a remake of ""Charlotte's Web, as acted by the patient population of the Home for the Criminally Zombified"".<br/><br/>An experiment with a bad animation technique that turned out only slightly better than it deserved.<br/><br/>Watch ""A Christmas Story"" Instead."

","You know, when it comes to reviewing children's shows, adults should really listen to their children. When I initially watched Polar Express, I thought it was a great movie. The animation style, purposefully made just this side of realistic, was a wonderful change from what is swiftly becoming a standard practice of ultra-realism in the CG community. The story was enough to make even me, someone who hasn't heard the bells jingle for decades, pick up a chime or two. In all, I thought it was great. Certainly not dark, not glorifying in child endangerment, but presenting a compelling story that, while relatively simplistic, has enough humanity about it to catch almost anyone's attention.<br/><br/>But the real reviewers are my two boys, Liam and Jackson (6 and 4 respectively). After the first time watching it, they demanded seeing it again. After the *third* time watching it, they were running around the house, reenacting all of their favorite scenes, including the roller coaster-like actions, the dialog between Santa and the Hero Boy, and other neat moments. You see, they didn't care that a train really can't do what this train did. They didn't care that anyone trying to ski down the roof of a train on an incline would likely end up flattened on the arc way of a tunnel. And they certainly didn't care that tight-rope walking across a perilously high bridge in the middle of Santa Town, in the North Pole, would likely lead to disastrous and tragic results.<br/><br/>What they cared about was the action. They cared that the characters, regardless of their disposition or their CG-simulated race and poverty level, got to see Santa and that they all had a wonderful time. In the end they enjoyed the movie, fully and completely.<br/><br/>And that's what *I* care about."

","I wondered how they were going to get an hour and a half movie out of a 32 page book. It turns out that the key is out-of-place musical numbers, gratuitous chase scenes, and a 10- minute scene where the camera follows a ticket (out the window, around a pack of dogs, eaten by a bird, vomited up, and finally returned to the train). Tom Hanks voices all the main characters, which are differentiated solely by pitch. The one high point is the introduction of the elves, who, based on their accents, seem to be members of the mafia. I guess you need good organized labor to turn out millions of presents each year. If you want to preserve your childhood memories of the book, don't see the movie."
"bendico","6","2","5","11 November 2005"," Where is He?
","I enjoyed this film. The adventure, the fun and the excitement of childhood discovery are wonderfully captured on screen. The viewer really feels like he or she is caught up in it all. Several times during the film I was enveloped by the crisp, clean air, and could almost reach out and touch the rich white snow comfortably surrounding me. I was warm and snug with the children, sipping hot chocolate in the train, I was a ticket flying across the starlit sky, and I was an elf cheering and singing, eagerly waiting to catch a glimpse of Santa Clause. It is most certainly worth watching at the cinema or on as large a screen as possible. I cannot comment on technical merits for I know little about the matter, although the scenery really is breathtaking.<br/><br/>But I simultaneously feel a certain sorrow. I have never read the book so I can only speak about the film. What is Christmas all about? What are we celebrating? I cherish the warmth, the belief in the joys of childhood (that can be 'carried on' to adulthood, as the film portrays), the splendor and the captivating wonder of it all. 'The Polar Express' is a magical, captivating journey and I did feel like a child again. But there is more Christmas than that. Where is Christ? We are after all celebrating 'Christ'mas. Santa Claus is just a dim, finite image of the One who came to save us. With all its beauty and gentleness, especially to the forlorn child who cannot even bring himself to join the merry group, 'The Polar Express' lacks the one reason we even have Christmas."

I have a fairly expensive home entertainment setup and have seen some fantastic graphics, animation and special effects, but the time and technology poured into this instant Christmas classic is unbelievably good. One thing, there is no mention of the real reason that there is a Christmas (Jesus) in the film, which was disappointing. The film follows the standard ""it's all about Santa and presents"" theme that today permeates most aspects of the US version of the holiday, and since we don't want to offend anyone of any other religious persuasion, we'll overlook this point and say that the movie, it's message and it's delivery are fantastic!"

So I'm thinking, ""uh oh....but we like anything Tom Hanks does so let's wait and see."" By the end of the movie I had been swept away, thoroughly enjoyed myself, tasted the beauty of redemption and hope, and thought to myself ""I could watch that again, right now, and certainly each Christmas.""

I never would have thought the story would be created and done in such a great way. Two thumbs up in my book! <br/><br/>I'd certainly recommend this film to anyone, children, teens, as well as family. I personally would take my family out and continue a tradition of reading The Polar Express to my family and children."
"Esperite","6","2","5","22 November 2004"," A Bit Underwhelming (Dang it!)
","Well, the website hooked me...I could hardly wait to take my kids (13,11,8) to see what I was sure would be a definitive Christmas classic. But it didn't live up to my high expectations.<br/><br/>Phenomenal Visuals....and how...<br/><br/>But the movie was too dark in a few places, notably when the old toy's seemed to envelope the boy in the passenger car. My youngest covered his eyes at this point, and did so again during at least one of the 'roller coaster' segments to follow.<br/><br/>The North Pole 'payoff' wasn't enough either...Santa's 'workshops' looked like industrial scenes from a Batman movie, the elves seemed like they were given a personality by someone not that familiar with Christmas, and Santa himself was a bit benign, and certainly didn't have ANY twinkle in his eye...(The fluorescent whip was a little over the top as well).<br/><br/>Aerosmith playing at the end, and the whole sock-hop atmosphere of celebration just wasn't that fulfilling...and seemed really out of place..<br/><br/>I dunno....I'm hoping some talented director someday takes a peek at the George Hinke artwork in the old ""IDEALS"" magazines of the '50s....and see what Jolly Old Santa Claus was 'really' like without any camp values force-fed...<br/><br/>That being said, the theater did break into applause twice, and my youngest two indicated they really enjoyed the movie. There has been no request to see it again, like the Grinch...rather, as the Holiday season starts, they want to go see the 'Incredibles'...<br/><br/>...pity...I think this was, to a certain extent, a missed opportunity."
"jtarver","10","2","5","14 November 2004"," Awesome flick for the family especially young children
","A truly wonderful Christmas movie. Viewing this each year will surely become a tradition. My three year old daughter was on the edge of her seat. The style of the film is gorgeous and some of the camera perspectives were brilliant. (the encyclopedia in particular) A very good score and soundtrack with one exception which I expound upon below.<br/><br/>My only complaint.......what bonehead producer thought it would be ""cool and hit that other demographic"" to animate Steven Tyler and have him sing some stupid trite rock n roll version Christmas song. That was the only gay part of the whole thing, but not a deal killer. Why date an otherwise timeless picture with something like that?"
"Wolf30x","10","2","5","13 November 2004"," Beautifully Brilliant
","I suppose I had initial hesitations about this movie. Considering how another Christmas classic, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, was severely butchered and over-hyped when it made the transition to the big screen, I think many others as well as myself were worried the film could only spoil our memories of Van Alsburg's classic.<br/><br/>Rest assured, this film lives up to and exceeds expectations. First of all there is the look of the film which does a great job of recreating the visual feel of Christ Van Alsburg's book. But more importantly, even though the story had to be expanded, (come on, the book was only about thirty pages, and most of those are filled with pictures,) it fully captures the essence of this holiday classic and adds more to it. The performances are simply wonderful, and the cinematography is beautifully dream-like. I admit there were one or two scenes that were so well done I almost wished I could jump in and join in the fun the characters on screen were having.<br/><br/>Overall this is certainly a film people will be watching every Christmas years from now, and will probably be as equally cherished a holiday classic as the book itself."

","*** SPOILERS <br/><br/>The story begins in the main character's bedroom, a young boy (Tom Hanks) who we later discover that he does not believe in Santa Clause. The movie quickly jumps to the arrival of the Polar Express; a colossal train with dynamic power. The boy meets the train conductor (Hanks) and decides to board and joins a group of other children en route to the North Pole. Throughout the ride, a series of thrilling scenes take place: We meet the Hobo (Hanks) who has a secret of his own, a breathtaking sequence of a lost ticket, and other suspenseful or gentle backdrops to fill in the movie. The train finally arrives at the North Pole and the movie begins its conclusion with the boy receiving the first gift of Christmas, a bell, directly from Santa Claus (Hanks) himself, which he loses by the time he returns to the train directly. The last scene finishes with the boy and his sister opening their presents, and the boy opening his last presentthe bell which he lost and a letter addressed from Santa himself. <br/><br/>I've read the other reviews, and noticed that one of the most frequent concerns the other viewers had was that the motion features and action sequences of the characters bodies seemed rigid and not to the expectations wanted. Personally, I thought the film was breakthrough in movie production. It features a new innovation called 'Performance Capture'; this is where the motions of the actors are filmed, then the studio uses CGI (Computer Generated Images) to layout the images for the film. The fine detail can be noticed simply by the character's hair and the features on the skin. Proceeding, the scene of the adventurous ticket is definitely the crowning moment of 'Express', the sound, camera angle, and quick direction created the perfect blend to create some screen time to extend the film and exemplify the vastness of the studio's art. <br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis did a great job extending the short children's book of Chris Van Allsburg. When 'Express' was first announced, I was worried that it would become another 'Grinch', pointless scenes just to give its story the usual 90+ min. movie. Here, Zemeckis managed to add colorful and thrilling scenes that fit in with the plot sensibly. <br/><br/>My only forewarning is that this movie should not be assumed as a monumental achievement, but a great family/holiday film for everyone to enjoy. As an adult, it made me feel like a kid again, which I think was the primary purpose for Zemeckis; therefore this film is a success. Concluding, Hanks and Zemeckis score again (Cast Away, Forrest Gump), Hanks does an unbelievable job, most notably supplying the voice of the young boy. I think this will be a holiday film for the books along with 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'A Charlie Brown Christmas'.------9/10"
"bill-930","10","2","5","11 November 2004"," IMAX 3D version changes you from an observer of the action to becoming part of the action.
","At least for me, trying to describe the impact of watching this movie in IMAX 3D is difficult because it is such a radical difference from any other movie experience. It is the difference between becoming part of the action versus merely being an observer. The 3D effect is so perfect that you become the third person in a two person conversation, you get that roller coaster feeling in your stomach as the train careens out of control, your heart is in your throat when the characters (including yourself) are in peril. As a result it is not just watching a movie but creating an experience where you personally experience the action in a virtual world. Adding to this feeling is the sound track and high quality audio system which envelopes you in this virtual world. The deep rumbling sound of the train alone causes your heart to start pounding both literally and figuratively. Because watching this movie in IMAX 3D is a totally different experience even if you have seen the movie already in 2D don't hesitate to see it again in 3D. If you have not seen it at all I highly recommend making the extra effort to find the movie in 3D."
"kirkwright","8","2","5","7 November 2004"," Sweetened version of Final Fantasy
","Animation reality is (almost) as good as Final Fantasy though, obviously, not as dark. However, certainly has an 'edge' to the movie. Not your typical holiday fluff. Tom Hanks proves his ranger once again and does another incredible job, especially as the ghostly hobo and conductor - to be honest, until I read the credits I did not know he was the character behind the boy also. Though not with the Hollywood'd theatrics, I am sure this movie will entice many to check out the 'real' Polar Express, a train that departs from Cochrane, Alberta (Canada) and goes north to the Arctic - unfortunate that same does not travel in the winter."

","Let me start off by saying that I loved the book ever since I was younger. I have always thought that it carried a beautiful meaning that needed to be shown in the movie in order for it to be considered The Polar Express. The movie is wonderfully done and quite enjoyable. Of course the visuals were purely amazing and just breathtaking. That was plainly obvious. And I know that additions needed to be made so that this could be made into a movie, but some of them were unnecessary, and I was waiting for those scenes to be over so that the good parts would be shown. Then again, I knew what was going to happen. But judging as a movie, it was great overall. It is not only about Christmas, but about the things in front of us that we choose not to see. The film is great for children as well as adults who carry the Christmas spirit in their hearts =)"

","We of the Western cultures long ago passed a point of no return in how we take to heart the meaning in our various holidays. The big ones that we hold important and channel so much energy into -- namely, Christmas -- were subverted somewhere along the way, transformed into such highly refined empires of commerce and greed that even healthful sentiments such as, ""The true meaning of Christmas,"" are little more than corporate slogans, arbitrary noises sounded to make the trivial holiday-shopping frenzy seem more meaningful. Then there's the whole sticky matter of religion melded with the modern iconography of Santa, et al. True to superstitious nature, everyone acknowledges it on some fundamental level, but only enough so that their cognitive abilities don't bother to contemplate. It's been so long, so sustained, we just feel cozy taking it for granted.<br/><br/>From its inception film has been active in shaping and influencing society's attitude towards this expansive partnership between non-thought and advertising. This ungainly cartoon is just one of the latest advertisements, taken from a children's book similarly devoid of nourishment but rich in vaguely alluring, winter-glossed imagery. A greater sin to me, personally, is that it is a modern animated film that does not exploit the possibilities of its nature, something that should be commonplace now that we have a few fine examples out there. Unlike the artists at Pixar, who understand the importance of visual imagination and give us worlds that exist in fuller dimensions than the ""real"" world of film and its constraints imposed by that physical contraption, the camera, this team puts a tight leash on their visuals so it looks as if we could be watching a story shot in live-action, with all its related limitations of space, but with a candy coating of digital animation to make it ""other-wordly."" How tame. How abominably dismal and lacking in adventure.<br/><br/>There's a lot of action and commotion, sure, most of it involving the train, but observe how it's all blocked. You'll notice it's no more advanced than what we usually see grafted onto a CGI-assisted live-action movie. It's about as dimensionally thrilling as, say, that lousy Grinch movie from a few years back.<br/><br/>Of course, many people will embrace this because marketing forces tell them it is good and such forces are most persuasive at Christmas time, when treacly sentiment provides an attractive defense for ignorance.<br/><br/>Still, I beg of you, if you have children and insist on letting TV and movies help raise them, don't put them on this train. It is a murderer of the imagination, too much an emblem of our Macy's Christmas spirit.<br/><br/>Blake's rating: 1 (out of 4)"

His curiosity gets the best of him and he is off on a roller-coaster adventure that will touch his life forever.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that the only character with an identifiable name is Santa Claus. Even our young hero is called just that, ""Hero Boy,"" in the credits. Other major characters are the Conductor, Hero Girl, Lonely Boy, and Know-It-All.

I did not rustle the sheets. I breathed slowly and silently. I was listening for a sounda sound a friend told me I'd never hearthe ringing bells of Santa's sleigh"" ""At one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as years passed, it fell silent for all of them. Even Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound. Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe."" To sum it up, this movie is a must-see and while the Yuletide season is not yet over, it's good if you can go catch it in the theaters while you still can. I will definitely buy the VCD of the Polar Express when it's released so that I got something to cherish every Christmas."

"tabuno","7","1","2","24 January 2019"," Style Over Substance
","13 November 2004. A tribute to technology, sort of like what the 1968 New York World's Fair was like. There is a lot of dazzle and Disneyland like effects in this special effects/state of the art animation feature film. Most of the movie feels like a retro-animation harking back to the 1960s and the positive memories of childhood, the mom and pie images of our youth. The animation is again gorgeous (though threatening at the same time as to whether it will eventually replace live actors ten years from now). The dizzying spectacle, just like Disneyland rides, the audience is given an opportunity to go on a 3-D version of a two-dimension animation scene along with a one or two musical pieces right out of a Mary Poppins movie. Unlike ""The Incredibles,"" ""The Polar Express"" is more style than content, more flash than serious movie making - it is more an experience than entertainment. Tom Hank's voice is overextended and his familiar drawl creeps up in too many of his characters to feel comfortable and becomes distracting. As a conductor and hero boy are two of the best animated characters around - but as father and hobo, it's too obvious that he's the same character. An incredible Christmas treat, eye-popping candy experience, but just one more of a number of super animated feature films that are setting a new standard in animation for years to come. For one a singular moment, this is the must see family movie of Christmas, of years gone by, of magic and hope using the most up to date computer technology available. Seven out of Ten Stars."

"Screen_Blitz","9","1","2","24 December 2016"," A delightful Christmas animated picture for the whole family
","There is absolutely no doubt that Christmas is one of the most (if not the most) pleasing times of the year: a time to gather around with family and friends and share the holiday spirit. Arguably one of the best family-friendly features to adore the pleasant spirit of Christmas is this computer animated feature directed by visual storytelling prodigy Robert Zemeckis. Based on the classic 1985 children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, the film expands upon the popular source material with Robert Zemeckis adding brighter characters and expanding the story trajectory on a wider scale. Further ingredients added to the mixing bowl is eye-dazzling computer animation supplied with motion capture technology to bring the story in life. And the final product is an appealing holiday showcase that not only feel magical, it's fun. Set in the 1950s, this film follows the story briefly narrated by Tom Hanks of an unnamed young boy (voiced by Daryl Sabara) who's grown up doubting the existence of Santa Claus. At midnight over Christmas eve, the boy is awoken by the roaring sound of the train that comes to a screeching halt in front of his house. Wandering outside, the boy boards the train where he meets a fellow group of children including an unnamed girl (voiced by Nona Gaye), a self-doubtful boy named Billy (voiced by Jimmy Bennett), and an obnoxious chatter box kid (voiced by Eddie Deezen). Together, these children take the trip to the North Pole where they face self-discovery and learn about the true meaning of spirit.<br/><br/>Very few filmmakers in Hollywood accomplish stellar visual storytelling as good as Robert Zemeckis, and this animated picture showcases Zemeckis operating in this cinematic grandeur at arguably his finest form yet. With a hefty hand, Zemeckis proficiently excels in both the visual and the narrative department. The astounding world of the Polar Express along with the North Pole is gracefully brought to life through exhilarating computer animation and stunning motion capture technology used to breath into the human characters. While the cast of Tom Hanks (who also voices the train conductor), Daryl Sabara, Nona Gaye, Jimmy Bennett, and Eddie Deezen provide slick voice work for the characters; the other half of the equation is made up by another cast including Josh Hutcherson who take the roles of the characters in motion capture performances. Combine the motion capture and the top-notch computer animation and you got a beautiful world sprung to life with compelling imagery (especially when watching in 3-D). In terms of storytelling, the movie brightly shines like gold. Following the story of a young boy as he is drawn into a world of self discovery and spirit of Christmas he never knew. The message he along with his newly found friends acquire on their adventure is believing against doubt and how the meaning of Christmas carries something more than just the question of whether or not Santa is real. The concluding result is vastly charming as much as it's deeply heartwarming. The atmosphere is no tearjeaker nor a cartoony comedic fare, but it is deeply riveting especially when you witness the character breaking out in a touching musical number. Don't expect any Pixar material however! <br/><br/>The Polar Express is a delightful Christmas animated feature that boasts heartwarming entertainment for both children and adults alike. This film makes not just for a pleasant surprise but a fine pick for families to gather around and watch during the holiday. Looking for a sweet animated feature for the holidays? The Polar Express may be one you are looking for."

","I never read the Polar Express as a kid. Coming from the UK originally as I do, it was not wildly available there. I believe it is now, thanks mainly to the movie generated from it.<br/><br/>Having said that, I watched the movie at the cinema when it came out in 2004 and was blown away. I've seen many of the comments here and it makes me cringe that all people can think to say is how unrealistic the kids look. This is an animated movie. Anything CGI or the evolved performance capture is never going to look truly realistic. You only have to look at computer game video cut ins to know that.<br/><br/>It didn't strike me the first time watching, but I did watch the movie again a week later as a chaperon to school kids who got to see the movie in the cinema as their final day of school before Christmas treat and then it dawned on me that this movie was a very modern adaptation of the Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" - and this has been remarked on in some other comments where the Conductor represents the ghost of Christmas present, the ghost/hobo on the train represents the ghost of Christmas past, and Santa Claus the ghost of Christmas future. Having seen many renditions of the Dickens' classic, when you are aware that this is the theme that was adopted for Polar Express, then it's instantly understandable that there has to be an element of darkness and the macabre to make that connection and so I have no problem whatsoever in believing that was the message the producers wished to convey, after all A Christmas Carol is all about believing, just as Polar Express is.<br/><br/>I never tire of watching this movie around Christmas time that I now have as part of my DVD collection. The plot line is such that it is somewhat fantastic and ""unbelievable"" to a certain extent, but rather than drawing criticism from me, I feel this was deliberate. The child's faces, sure there is certain something lacking, but then again this was the very first attempt at a feature length performance capture movie. I also feel that the producers and writers were trying to recreate the look and feel of the imagery from the original book, thus not requiring perhaps as much realism as one would ordinarily expect to see. Indeed a lot of the colorful backdrops that you see at the North Pole remind me very much of imagery that was generated by the painter of light, Thomas Kinkade. I am certainly not reminded of zombies, or the walking dead when seeing the characters move on screen. It actually made me laugh when I saw those comments. I am more reminded of how it is to imagine as kid. Bright colors, wonderful backdrops, well defined imagery. All of this was very well done in the backdrops to ""The Wizard of Oz"" and that was a movie made over 70 years ago - with NO computers. Imagine if that same story was made today with the technology at hand.<br/><br/>I was wondering about where so many people have said that this is a pointless movie as there is no plot. I've heard this before. This movie doesn't NEED a plot. It's about the journey of belief and how it doesn't need to be structured, but simply exist. This is mirrored very well in another children's story - ""Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory"" (2005) where Mike Teavee says ""why is everything here completely pointless"" to which Charlie Bucket replies ""Candy doesn't have to have a point - that's why it's Candy"" All in all, this is a fun movie to watch for children of all ages. Definitely one to last the ages."

But this movie tells us that there is a Santa Clause even if our father wear the costumes. This gives us dreams."

","I watch this film every Christmas Eve, so I've seen it now ten times. It never grows old and I enjoy something new in it every time I watch it. I can understand, however, that this film isn't for everyone. It's a little strange in places, which only adds to its enchantment for me. Whether or not you take the Christmas theme (and as they manage to make an entire movie about Christmas without once mentioning Jesus, it's pretty clear this isn't a religious film by any means), you can take the point about believing. That's what this movie is really about, the suspension of disbelief, the giving over to childlike wonder in an alternate reality, a better reality. As an author, who likes to think about creating small and better worlds in novels, this little gem of a movie hits home every time I watch it."

","The Polar Express (2004): Dir: Robert Zemeckis / Voices: Tom Hanks, Daryl Sabara, Nona Gaye, Peter Scolari, Eddie Deezen: Delightful computer generated animation about adventure and destination. A boy lies in bed on Christmas eve is awaken at the sound of a train. Outside he is invited aboard the Polar Express, which is on its way to the North Pole with other young passengers. On board he meets a girl with unearthed leadership skills as well as a boy with not enough humility, and a lonely boy who discovers what friendship is all about. Structure is divided into a series of events that obstruct their journey until arriving at a heart felt ending. Directed by Robert Zemeckis who has collaborated with Tom Hanks before in Forrest Gump and Cast Away, and here again the duo hit a broad note with this holiday wonder. Hanks voices several roles in this film including the conductor who claims to have been never late. This character is animated to the likeness of the actor himself, which adds appeal. Hanks also provides the voice of Santa Claus when he eventually surfaces. The animation is dazzling with detail ranking it among Zemeckis's best work. This is a thrilling landmark full of inventive storytelling as well as a strong message regarding friendship and trust. It is the best Christmas film of 2004, and should rank amongst the holiday classics. Score: 9 / 10"
"Scarecrow-88","8","1","2","7 December 2015"," The Polar Express
","This is certain to be a yuletide classic (if it isn't already) and the magic of digital facial recognition technology along with its startling animation (the train ride, ticket journey carried about by wind, eagle, wolves, and snow, and visit to the North Pole) will undoubtedly lead to a special stature for Polar Express in years to come.<br/><br/>The story isn't too bad, either. A child disenchanted with the holiday, losing his belief in Santa needs reassurance and might just get that when a train headed to the North Pole stops by at his house on Christmas Eve. Each kid on this Polar Express have a golden ticket a certain conductor (voiced and is facially recognized by Tom Hanks) will check before when they board the train. An African American girl leaves behind her ticket to take a cup of hot cocoa to a melancholy kid who almost didn't board the train (without the lead kid's pulling the train brake in order to stop the train which was well on its way), and our lead kid loses it...the journey of the ticket is just one of several dazzling highlights of this nicely realized Christmas film. The train's major stop due to caribou and a derailment on ice (not to mention the lead boy's difficult journey on top of the train as the speed brings snow and wind making it hard to see, a hobo helping him along the way, following the conductor and girl to the front of the train) are thrilling, and the whole visit to the North Pole (which includes the elves making sure all the presents are wrapped in a massive red bag and ballooned to a towering Christmas tree to meet up with Santa Claus) is quite a visual dynamo.<br/><br/>This is all about dazzling you. It is an experience I imagine needs to be truly seen in a theater in the IMAX format to truly appreciate it. Still on the small screen, Polar Express is nonetheless impressive as a visual feast for the eyes. The sleigh bell is a nice touch in its importance to the lead kid and his newfound respect and belief in the holiday season. I think ultimately, the film is at its best when establishing the theme of embracing the holiday during your youth because eventually you lose it to adulthood."

"johnnyboyz","6","1","2","16 December 2011"," Manipultive and with an overriding issue of visuals over all else; the film has, admittedly, a child-like enthusiasm difficult to brush off but it's all fairly pedestrian.
","It is difficult not to pencil The Polar Express in as more style and effects over substance; but boy, what style and effects it's got. Witness, if you will, the sequence signalling the end of the film's set-up and systematic commencement of the protagonist's journey proper; a sequence following that of a magical steam train whisking it's way down into a suburban street and then off again once the formalities have been taken care of. Witness the way in which the many windows to the many carriages wonderfully sync up with the ground as it slowly chugs away from the curb as if it were leaving a station; the way the bright golds radiating from the lighting within each carriage to each window reflects onto the brilliant white lawns covered in heavy snow, each yellow rectangle sticking in perfect tandem as it moves off. Never mind the meetings with Santa Claus and never mind the ""state of the art"" motion capture technology on show throughout, the true beauty of this 2004 piece lies not with the residing characteristics of the beast nor the places it goes, but with the more simplistic little 'events' or 'happenings' such as the aforementioned examples. Therein lie the reasons to feel both good and at-once apprehensive about the film, a film all but indebted to its special effects and therefore often feeling the need to fall back on the sheer spectacle of the world it's depicting so as to get across the sense we've actually gone somewhere.<br/><br/>The film was directed by a certain Robert Zemeckis, whose 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a crisp example of how effects can create a world around a central character's plight whilst complimenting the central tract rather than draw attention away from it. Tom Hanks voices a young boy living in a rich American neighbourhood somewhere in the 1950's , a kid with a loving family; a big house and a little sister. The young boy is growing up, and reading of mall based Santa's striking in the newspapers as well as discovering nuggets of information that places such as The North Pole cannot harbour human beings, his belief in the man is on the slope downwards. Late on Christmas Eve, another Hanks character, on board the titular Polar Express, whooshes down and parks outside the young boy's house – next stop: The North Pole, in what is an attempt by those on the other side to re-instill belief.<br/><br/>In essence, that is as advanced it gets in terms of narrative; the film easing into a grove driven solely by the special effects of getting there and then briefly staying there before completing the circular journey and arriving back to a warm Christmas morning. Along the way, one of the characters has no ticket; the train itself does not have any breaks, it conks out on one occasion and there is an uncanny interaction with a homeless gentleman. There are a number of other kids on board, with them arriving this bizarre class tract to do with people from varying class levels all occupying different class compartments, but each coming together at the end as one happy congregation occupying the same realm, even those of whom come from ""the wrong side of the tracks"". Zemeckis takes the opportunity in working with this technology to recreate certain sequences from his past work, one of which is lifted from Forrest Gump but sees a feather replaced by one of those aforementioned tickets, and he even finds time to pay reference to the daring train cart negotiating that made up the finale of Back to the Future: Part III - complete with ""I've always wanted to do that!"" line once in the engine proper. They do nothing but have us wish we were watching those films instead.<br/><br/>Nearer the end of the journey there is a steep drop in the tracks resulting in the train snowballing downhill, something shot from the very front of the vehicle and instilling this unnecessary roller-coaster aesthetic to proceedings reiterating what little it lacks in most film making departments but excels at in terms of spectacle. For the final final act, the train arrives in The North Pole to a pastiche of that Christmas-time Coca Cola advertisement you get on televisions. Then, it is revealed Santa's workshop is run by elves who sound like they've seen one too many New York City-set gangster movies and, in a creepy turn, have these tiny video cameras in the bedrooms of each kid in the world so as to check on bad behaviour. Admittedly, the 'permanant record' idea is good value and the big spinning globe allowing you access it all is neat.<br/><br/>One is tempted to compare it to the likes of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, or indeed James Cameron's more recent Avatar; films of which did not exist until the time in which they did due to the unavailability of the technology at hand required to build the worlds envisaged. Had one attempted to produce the film twenty or so years previously, the effects will often have looked stodgy; but if they were backed up by narrative and characterisation, those would be the limits of people's criticisms. Here, one is constantly pestered by the effects and how impressive they are, as well as how unimpressive it is to see them essentially act as dressing to weak arcs of self-discovery. I found those other two examples dull and lifeless; similarly, Zemeckis' prior work, in these post-Polar Express domains, have been the often woeful and tonally broken Beowulf and A Christmas Carol – in comparison, The Polar Express has a certain energy to it and is easier to watch. It would be true to say that as the 1910s merged into the 1920s, and audiences demanded narrative over spectacle, so are we going in the opposite direction ninety years on, and it is a sentiment epitomised in films such as The Polar Express."
"Hitchcoc","7","1","2","1 January 2010"," Visually Engaging But......
","I liked the film, but I didn't love it. It is an interesting story with a real holiday message. The animation was well done. For me, I never got that sense of vulnerability among the characters. There are a lot of near misses instead of a true sense of humanity. I never felt that anyone was ever in any real danger, that this was all part of the gig. Still, the visual aspects are remarkable. The North Pole is quite a place. It appears that socialism is working well. It reminded me of May Day in the old Soviet Union. I know we aren't supposed to look at things that way, but do we have a right to wonder what the lives of these masses is like. They appear to be cut from some sort of proletarian mode, doing their things to complete the task. Do they get to experience the joys and wonders their visitors do? Anyway, the trip is delightful, the special effects are awesome, and the story is touching, thought I never knew why that little boy was so depressed. In the great Christmas epics, this character would be much more defined and not so needy (the Tiny Tim influence). This one does nothing to reveal himself other than things never go his way. It's certainly worth the trip just to see the incredible events."
"jboothmillard","5","1","2","6 January 2008"," The Polar Express
","I saw snippets of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and of course, Beowulf, and thought the computer animation looked brilliantly realistic, and then I got the chance to see this one that I had heard about. This film from director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Beowulf) sees the introduction of a new form of CGI that transfers the live actions of actors into a digital format, this is called ""Performance Capture"". Anyway, based on the storybook by Chris Van Allsburg, it sees the Hero Boy doubting the existence of Santa Claus, and Christmas Eve night a magical train suddenly appears in the middle of the street. The train's conductor (Tom Hanks) invites him on The Polar Express to the North Pole, and at the last minute, the boy jumps on. Many other boys and girls have got on the train hoping to see Santa Claus, who is going to give a special present to a child of his choice. The journey sees tickets almost being lost, blizzard, iced over tracks and many other complications. they eventually reach the North Pole, and after a little turn, Hero Boy, Hero Girl (Nona Gaye), Know-It-All (Eddie Deezen, I recognised his voice immediately, he plays Mandark from Dexter's Laboratory) and Lonely Boy (Peter Scolari) get to the ceremony just in time, and Santa (Hanks again) obviously chooses Hero Boy, probably because of his doubt earlier. I don't understand why he asked Santa for a sleigh bell, but on the other hand I suppose it is to help him remember that Santa does exist. Hanks also plays the Hobo and Scrooge. The animation is immaculate in detail, it must have taken them ages to get it as perfect as it is, it is just a shame the story is really, really cheesy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Believe"", which also won a Grammy and was nominated the Golden Globe, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film. Worth watching!"

","I like Tom Hanks, as an actor, I think he has done some of the best work of this generation. I like CGI - as a techno-nut, I think that it is just totally cool what can be done with computers and I love Christmas - that time of year when it seems like it is ""ok"" to put other people ahead of ourselves for awhile. But I gave this movie a low rating, why?<br/><br/>What is Christmas to you? Getting and giving gifts? Does it stop there? We are asked - nay ordered! to believe but not it seems in the spirit of Christmas, but rather the spirit of giving and perhaps they are the same but, for me, the overwhelming message of the season is JOY and joy is mighty hard to come by in this film.<br/><br/>Tom H does all the main characters - interesting but ... interesting. There are some casual ""hip"" social references that are not needed but included nonetheless.<br/><br/>Technically, I have no arguments with the quality - though the effort to create super realistic characters was creepy - was it just me or was the little girl a hunchback? - that much realism, why not just use human actors and use the cgi for effects? IMO, the most interesting characters were the brakeman and engineer - they looked semi-real but unreal enough to add an air of whimsy and other-worldliness to the film - to add a bit of childlike wonder to a pedestrian ""message movie"".<br/><br/>If you are looking for nuance, look elsewhere - the filmmakers determined the message and it is delivered like a pole-ax between the eyes. You know from the beginning how things will turn out and if that is what you seek in a film, this film will not disappoint.<br/><br/>So, how do we get to a three?<br/><br/>Story - 4 Technical - 5 - less realism in a magic movie is a plus Message - 4 - frequency of delivery does not add depth Magic - 2 too much effort to make the characters look ""real"" Fun factor -1"

""The Polar Express"" is a film strictly for kids but it does appeal to the grown-up crowd as well. <br/><br/>I liked this film because it reminded me of my childhood when I used to believe in Santa Claus. It also has a hidden meaning and it doesn't necessarily have to apply to belief in Santa per se. We, not just kids but adults too, should believe in ourselves and in our friends/family/God, etc. <br/><br/>I recommend this film to all ages.

So when I heard my nieces were going to see this, I said I would be happy to attend. The expectation wasn't too high because the word around was the reviews were poor. Once the movie began, even before the story started to unfold, I was already completely drawn in. The animation was absolutely beautiful and so much great detail; I didn't care if the movie wasn't going to be great. On top of that the 3D just added an element that an average movie wouldn't have and I loved it. They should make more movies in 3D. After all that talk the movie's story turned out just fine.

","For those who have so eloquently (read: ridiculously) panned this movie, I ask...did you see the same movie as I did???<br/><br/>THE POLAR EXPRESS is so rich with depth, spirituality and nostalgia, I cannot fathom anyone especially anyone old enough to feel a connection to the past not enjoying this movie. Robert Zemeckis succeeds in capturing what it really feels the first time you experience, and to regain faith in something despite what life hands you to try and prove the contrary. This was a movie made by someone who experienced the joy and then sadness of Christmas (despite the erroneous thought that Robert Zemeckis is Jewish, which he's not. He grew up Catholic, celebrating both Christmas and Easter.)<br/><br/>The animation is true to Van Allsburg's book, with a touch of Andy from Toy Story. The eyes are ""scary?"" Not at all...more like, the eyes are sympathetic, at least in the characters who are on screen for more than 2 seconds. <br/><br/>This movie does lack one thing that runs rampant in ""kids"" movies today: STUPIDITY. You actually have to be invested in the story, and from frame one, I was. When I was a child, I NEVER liked movies that were made for kids. Ever. I always liked being in awe of the story, not feeling one step ahead of it. I liked being scared, because most good movies like this paid it off. Such films helped me to appreciate a deeper meaning, and I appreciated not having ideas shoved in my face or handed to me. POLAR EXPRESS moves, challenges and delivers on all levels.<br/><br/>The movie looked great, touched me to my core, and will hopefully be recognized for the masterpiece that it is.

The CGI is incredible, bringing the characters to life from the moment the snow flurry clears from around the Christmas train and Tom Hank's legendary voice yells out ""All aboard!""

","The word is out: Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis' historic third collaboration, The Polar Express, is making a mark in terms of the incredible computer-generated technology called ""performance capture,"" allowing star/co-executive producer Hanks to take on not just one, but an unprecedented six roles: The Boy, His Father, The Conductor, The Hobo, Scrooge and Santa. The technicians of Sony Pictures Imageworks allow you to experience the story the way Chris van Allsburg's original illustrations permitted you to. ""Derails in zombie land,"" scoffs Newsday's film critic. ""A failure as much of imagination as of technology,"" grumbles the New York Times' critic. People, ignore the mixed reviews. The money and the imagination are up there on that screen --- and more, they're there for one reason: for the first time, you're not just a part of the CGI experience, the experience literally happens to you!<br/><br/>There are several reasons why the popularity of the original book simply had to result in the making of the film, some of those reasons having real life on their side: since the book was first published nearly 20 years ago, several real-life performers have literally staged their own adaptations of The Polar Express, using some of van Allsburg's characters as key elements. The real test, I think, will be in comparing the staged versions, of which, I think, there were some 60 across the country and counting, with the film.<br/><br/>The story follows a young boy who is gradually losing his faith in Santa --- until a mysterious train appears at his front door, its mission being to take him and various other children with similar doubts to the North Pole, where, in celebration of his first Christmas flight of the year, Santa will present the first gift of the season to one person. Who will that person be? And can that person prove himself brave, truthful and unselfish enough to go the distance and make it to the end of the journey in one piece? That is the mystery surrounding this remarkable film, and I would be surprised if the incredible technology combined with the spellbinding story did not earn this movie the Best Animated Feature Oscar, as well as the Oscar for Visual Effects.<br/><br/>The film is dedicated, by the way, to the memory of co-star Michael Jeter, who died shortly after completing his scenes in this film. His contributions will obviously be a lasting legacy.<br/><br/>In conclusion, then, the magic of this awesome adventure is right up there with all the live-action Christmas classic features of the last 30 years. Jack Matthews of the New York Daily News is right: ""If you take one train this holiday season, this is the one."" To which I, being a train lover in one or more senses, must add:<br/><br/>""Get me on this train!"""

Hanks plays about four different characters, both visually and vocal - The Conducter, Father, The Bum, Santa Claus and five if you count the adult Hero Boy.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis has always liked to fool around with the expansion of cinema (check out his other famous animation hybrid, the great ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""), here he probably goes a bit too far but it's nevertheless a fun ride. As a piece of experimental cinema ""The Polar Express"" is breathtaking, as a standard Christmas animation film it's so-so - the story is very entertaining for the first 60 minutes but once they get off the train it goes on a bit too long. Animation is excellent at times, but then sometimes (particularly on the Hero Girl character) it's quite poor and unrealistic.<br/><br/>But for the most part it is a very interesting film and a must-see if you're a daring viewer - it's different, in a good way. It's not a great movie because it has a lot of flaws but I saw it at London BFI IMAX theater and the trip was loads of fun, and a unique experience I'll remember for a long, long time.<br/><br/>Overall, not something particularly memorable as a stand-alone film but if you're planning on seeing it, make sure you go to an IMAX - otherwise it's just an odd little film that'll entertain the kids and probably hold your interest on first viewing.<br/><br/>3.5/5"

","I went to see this film at a digital 3D IMAX theater with vibrating woofers under the auditorium -- the seats actually shook when deep bass sounds (like the train) went by! I can see other reviewer's complaints that this film is not for young kids and as a result, perhaps this movie should have received a PG rating.<br/><br/>Get over the animatronic issue. This is new technology. It'll get better. By the way, though, for 2004 and this film, it's pretty darn good.<br/><br/>Whether this becomes a Chirstmas classic or not, I can't say. Whether it's worthy of praise or condemnation in a regular theater I can't say. But in a digital 3D-IMAX theater, this movie is well worth the experience."

","This was the worst Christmas movie I've ever seen. Hands down. Awful. It's a shame because it's a lovely children's book. I'm honestly shocked that Chris Van Allsburg would have anything to do with this-- excuse the pun-- train wreck. Painfully bad.. The voices of the characters are grating. The music is lame. Nothing else to say. Oh I guess I could add that the screeches and screams were like nails on a chalkboard, The boy was wooden, and I hoped the train would crash to stop the noise. If there's one thing I hate, it's the noise, noise ,noise ,noise. Which leads me to my last thought. Watch The Grinch Or Shrek the Halls or Scrooged or anything but this. Anything. Even the second Frosty is better. Bah. Humbug."

","From boredom of course. This was one banal flick. Just because it's the target audience is children doesn't mean the film has to be a stupid celebration of orthodoxy. In comparison to a clever and largely appealing film like ""the incredibles"", polar express comes up short. There are a handful of scenes where the film could have progressed beyond its preordained mediocrity, but instead it chooses to stay the course, boring all adults in the audience to tears, while indoctrinating the children with thoroughly inane, defeatest ideals. <br/><br/>Yay we can all live outside the cubicle in our fantasy lives, and somehow vicariously survive through our children's delusions. No need to actually effect change, it's all about ""the magic"" of the holidays. One or two days per year are certainly enough for me to enjoy the happiness of being together with my family. Good thing polar express came along to breathe new life into my otherwise stale, predictable holiday tradition of pretending like I have a large amount of disposable time to spend with my children."

","A boy from Grand Rapids, Michigan, is at the age where he no longer believes in Christmas, as far as Santa, his elves and flying reindeer go, but a magical train appears in front of his home on Christmas Eve and whisks him away on an adventurous trip to the North Pole with several other kids.<br/><br/>""The Polar Express"" (2004) was based on the 1985 Christmas book and was the first mainline movie to use motion capture animation for all its characters beginning to end (think Gollum from ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy). Some people think the animation is weak, but I feel it creates its own world and has its own charm. It holds up as long as you can adapt to those creepy dead eyes of the characters.<br/><br/>Some people love this movie while others think it's weird, like a Twilight Zone Christmas flick. Roger Ebert, for instance, loved it and gave it a perfect grade. I'm sorta in the middle. I see its good points and appreciate them, like the haunting winter ambiance, parts of the trip to the North Pole (e.g. the quasi-rollercoaster ride) and the kids' investigation of the Christmas factory. But there are some meh parts and dubious sections like the whole last act with the multitude of elves and the towering Santa who looked like he was modeled after 6'5"" Christopher Lee with a pillow strapped to his mid-section.<br/><br/>The movie's interesting in some ways but also quaint in a cheesy way, as well as peculiar and lifeless.<br/><br/>The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: C"

I am sure that ""Zombies on a train"" could be a fun movie if someone ever made it, but it was a shame anyway, since everything but the eyes and some facial expressions is brilliantly animated.<br/><br/>Even worse: The eyes distracted me from the magic this movie tries to create.<br/><br/>My 4 year old brought the magic back. He loves the train, the songs, the reindeer, the kids, the elves, the action, Christmas and the not so very holy ghost and sort of tolerates scary Scrooge as long as I sit close to him in the sofa when the old guy turns up. My son even loves creepy Santa.<br/><br/>And suddenly my previous opinion makes no difference. If kids love it, then why should I be grumpy and grinchy?<br/><br/>I shouldn't. This movie grows on you, and if you let it, maybe you can feel the magic, too.<br/><br/>After a while you don't even care about the eyes.

On Christmas Eve, he finds himself on a magical journey when he boards an express train with other children heading to the North Pole which may help change his mind. Hanks (Forrest Gump) is great as usual, he provides the facial expressions of the boy and voices of 5 other characters.

Using the Performance Capture technique, the characters sit somewhere in a purgatory where half human and half animation dwells, this is unusual and as amazing as it is at times, the children often look, well, kinda creepy!

"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","8","1","3","19 December 2011"," Robert Zemeckis captures the spirit and imagination from the book as one of the best Christmas films ever made
","Let's just say I feel in love with The Polar Express book from Chris Van Allsburg along with his other precious titles like Jumanji, Zathura, Ben's Dream and more with colorful pictures, perfect writing and wonderful characters, they've become so popular that only three of them were made into films and this wonderful gem is one of them. I was amazed that this was being directed by Robert Zemeckis who made such great classics like the Back To The Future trilogy, Forrest Gump, and Cast Away and since he was chosen to direct such a timeless tale, he did a great job at capturing the spirit and imagination of the book in his first motion-capture animated film.<br/><br/>I'm gonna get to the weakest points first before I could give some praise. Although, there were some great visual details to the characters faces just like the book, there was a lack of expression on them like most other motion-capture films including Simon Wells' ""Mars Needs Moms"" (which we all know bombed at the box office and caused the ImageMovers Digital company to shut down). The story, while capturing the essence and spirit of the book, was vastly expanded into an 100 minute film, but I think it was appropriate since it gave us a moral lesson about believing in what your heart is saying.<br/><br/>With those out of the way, let's get to the strongest points. The scenery is wonderful it was exactly like the book with the lovely sight of the Hero Boy's town, the train, the mountains, the roller coaster scenes (packed with amazing danger), and the beautiful look of the north pole. The voice acting is terrific. Daryl Sabara did a great job as the Hero Boy, Tom Hanks did surprisingly fantastic as the Conductor along with the Hobo, Santa Clause and Hero Boy's father. The rest of the actors did well at their performances with a wonderful script that is faithful to the story. Since most children's films have great songs, this movies does the same thing too. ""Hot Chocolate"", ""The Polar Express"", ""When Christmas Comes To Town"", and the pop song ""Believe"" by the wonderful Josh Groban in the ending credits were such amazing songs to listen to.<br/><br/>Although, not a masterpiece, Robert Zemeckis succeeded in making sure this Christmas gem stayed faithful to the story (with a wonderful music score from the great Alan Silvestri) as one of the best Christmas films ever made. Thumbs up from gavinthelordofthefuture."
"Desertman84","8","1","3","10 November 2011"," Great Technical Achievement But Characters Aren't Life-like
","The Polar Express is a motion capture computer-animated film based on the children's book of the same title by Chris Van Allsburg. It was written, produced, and directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film stars Daryl Sabara, Nona Gaye, Jimmy Bennett, and Eddie Deezen, with Tom Hanks in six distinct roles.The human characters in the film were animated using live action performance capture technique, with the exception of the waiters who dispense hot chocolate on the train, because their feats were impossible for live actors to achieve. Performance capture technology incorporates the movements of live actors into animated characters. <br/><br/>The Polar Express revolves around Billy, who longs to believe in Santa Claus but finds it quite difficult to do so, what with his family's dogged insistence that all of it, from the North Pole, to the elves, to the man himself, is all just a myth. This all changes, however, on Christmas Eve, when a mysterious train visits Billy in the middle of the night, promising to take him and a group of other lucky children to the North Pole for a visit with Santa. The train's conductor along with the other passengers help turn Billy's crisis in faith into a journey of self-discovery.<br/><br/>The Polar Express is obviously visually stunning overall but the animation for the human characters isn't lifelike enough and the story is not engaging from at all.The viewer may find it not to care with the characters at all as the movie lacks energy and vitality.<br/><br/>Overall,The Polar Express is a great technical achievement in cinema but the story as well as the characters are empty and far from absorbing."

","Robert Zemenkis is well known for directing some of the greatest live action movies of all time. Back to the Future trilogy, Forrest Gump, Cast Away, but he has also done a few animated movies, and the one most people will point to first is ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" And while I do really enjoy Roger Rabbit I have to say that I like The Polar Express more, and I'm surprised that a lot of people dislike it, personally, I watch it every Christmas.<br/><br/>Whenever someone critiques this film, they will mention how the animation on the human's is creepy, almost zombiish. And they are technically right, the eyes are a little weird and the skin is a little too pasty. But remember, this was the first time a full motion capture film was made. Plus it may try a little too hard to be a Christmas classic, I don't really think they needed a song, it's just there to make it more wimsical. Other than that, it's all nitpicking.<br/><br/>Any piece of animation that isn't a human is amazing, it still looks fantastic, the colors, the detail, the amount of stuff going on at the same time. And even though the characters look a little zombieish, I still like them, they're likable, they're funny, and the fact that Tom Hanks plays like half the characters makes this one of the most likable movie's ever made. It's also a really good adabtation, everything from the book is mentioned but they also add fun little additions. Some of it may feel like filler, but I still enjoy it. And it's got a great feel to it, this movie feels like a Christmas movie, and not some cash grab.<br/><br/>I watch The Polar Express every Christmas, I know it's a mixed bag with some people, but if you can get over the aged character design than it's a very enjoyable Christmas film that adds to the book it was based on."
"abrown975","7","1","3","6 February 2011"," Not my first choice for a memorable Christmas movie, but still good
","When it comes to Christmas movies, some will always go down in history (i.e. Christmas Vacation, Home Alone, Charlie Brown Christmas, A Christmas Story, How the Grinch Stole Christmas...). The Polar Express, being a memorable Christmas book, has brought delight and holiday spirit to countless families across America, and maybe even the world. That being said, the movie isn't as memorable. Don't get me wrong, it's still great, but it's just not memorable enough. The special effects and animation are definitely top notch. Robert Zemeckis always astounds me in this field. The scenery will stun you. You will almost feel like you are at the North Pole. The music and songs are amazing as well. The song, which is however very memorable, ""Believe"" is always and will always be a treasure. And even some of the characters, mainly the ones Tom Hanks plays, are entertaining, and for a movie that talks about going to the North Pole, even believable. Now onto the flaws. Some of the characters are either quite annoying, like the kid with the big glasses (although that is of course on purpose, so I can't really be upset at that), or quite forgettable (like Billy or even the nameless main character himself). Perhaps if some were given names and more development, they would have been a bit more appealing. And then you have the story. It's not a bad one, as it manages to always get me in the Christmas cheer, but it is rather clichéd. The kids get on the train, and the main character doesn't believe in Santa. They get to the North Pole, and he decides he does believe, and he is chosen to get a gift of his choice. This story has been done numerous times (however, maybe they were based off the book's?). Whatever the reason, it does seem to be very clichéd and maybe even a bit lagging at times. But again, that doesn't make this a bad movie. It's a great movie, and everyone should see it at least once. It's just not the kind of movie I think one should buy because it's not as memorable as a lot of other Christmas movies. It is one you should rent though. But whenever you watch it, as an adult, as a kid, in the middle of July, it will always manage to get you in the Christmas spirit!"

"cowman57-1","3","1","3","1 February 2010"," Too dark to belong in the Christmas movie cannon.
","I feel like Scrooge or the Grinch for giving a kids' Christmas movie such a bad review. But compared to the classics in the Christmas film ""cannon"" (like A Christmas Carol, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, A Christmas Story etc.), Polar Express just didn't stack up in my opinion. This puts me at a minority, since most people seem to enjoy it.<br/><br/>For one thing, I thought the animation in Polar Express was somewhat elementary in comparison to other CGI films, lacking the finer touches of Pixar or of Dreamworks or even of some of Zemeckis' other films (like Monster House or his version of A Christmas Carol). I guess I found the relatively poor quality of animation, of the characters' faces especially, distracting.<br/><br/>Another thing is that both the story and the physical setting of the plot were dark and kinda gloomy (literally and figuratively) for a kids' movie, especially for one about Christmas. Sure kids' movies can get dark as the characters encounter difficulties in the story, but there just didn't seem to be many bright or happy moments here to counterbalance. I wanted to experience more of the magic of the train and of the North Pole instead of getting bogged down in the foggy, eerie, and dark roof of the train or in the abandoned inner-workings of Santa's shop. There was plenty of opportunity to show us some neat Christmas excitement and I felt let down.<br/><br/>Finally, I didn't like the Oscar-nominated original song. It was too much like the storyline and setting and animation in that it lacked zest for the fundamental joy and exhilaration of Christmas.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks certainly did a great job doing so many diverse voices throughout. I'll bet he enjoyed doing something like this, something quite unique for him. But Hanks could not keep this film afloat all by himself (like he did in Cast Away, another Zemeckis film, one which I liked). Overall, I wanted and hoped for more than I got with this movie. Zemeckis has done better."

","The Polar Express might be trying to encourage kids to believe back in Santa Claus, yet you might even believe in the characters of Robert Zemeckis' film, such is the astonishing feat of CG animation. When a young boy stops believing in the jolly old red man, a magical train comes to visit him in the night, promising to take him, as well as several other children, to the North Pole on Christmas Eve. What then ensues is as fun a ride as any kid could hope to have, as we are treated to a whole host of action-packed sequences, which have double the effect if you are watching The Polar Express 3D. There might not be much depth or characterisation in this film, and the elves are about as annoying as anything at Christmas can be. But there is far too much magic on screen for the full 90 minutes for anyone to care."

","In short, this film tells a great story. I would give some weight however to the gentleman that put forth the theory about population control and fascism when the train arrives at the north pole. That argument at least sounds interesting. But my problem with this film lies along a different path. I had a difficult time watching the film without becoming nauseous. My principle reaction to the look of the characters was revulsion. This is a fantastic example of when not to use computer animation. It would have been fine to turn the people into cute animals or caricatures, but photo real looking CGI people that talk and act in medium shots and close-ups are nothing more than animated cadavers. At least that's how our brains see them. I saw the film in 3D, which I'm sure amplified my natural and innate instinct to reject the characters, as one would reject a fresh corpse."
"Trangor","2","1","3","13 March 2006"," Say Cheese
","his is one film whose producers had a vision, a combination of spectacle and play. But their reach exceeded their grasp. <br/><br/>The animation is cheesy at best when characters of any sort are present. It almost works when they are not. The animators took the not new idea of converting the human form to an animated one and forced it to new lows (IMO). The faces are somewhat repellent. This contrasts with The Incredibles, for example, which had attractive, amusing, and interesting faces and figures.<br/><br/>The film tries hard but fails in its goal of entrancement. Hanks does a fine job as the voice of the conductor. It doesn't save the film however. It is an inconsistent mishmosh of events and imagery that lends the impression of being thrown together. The scenes involving the train's engineers, who appear in Disneyesque slapstick, seem almost to come from a different film.<br/><br/>This is not to say that random elements of the film don't work. There is one sequence where the film follows the path of a lost ticket through a series of unlikely events as it progresses back to the train. Although disjoint, it is interesting. Many of the train scenes would work well with my young locomophile (3 1/2), but otherwise there's not a lot here for him. Many of the film's scenes come across as more nightmarish than fantastic. This is why (IMO) the film is not suitable for young children. For example, the scene where the acrobatic waiters are jumping around and throwing hot chocolate around the train car seem manic rather than entertaining or fun. And, the scene where the conductor is making the engineer scream in order to communicate with the caribou can only be described as bizarre. <br/><br/>The film has a limited age range of appeal, perhaps 6 to 8 year olds who have been exposed to a lot of popular programming and therefore can tune out the nonsense and the junk from experience. Older kids would be bored and younger kids appalled (your mileage will vary of course). In any case, the 'nice' story (and it is) will bypass most.<br/><br/>In short, this is a nice story but a poor movie. There is certainly no Christmas classic here. But it's not so very bad that I would say avoid it. It is just not good enough to recommend."
"jllees","5","1","3","4 December 2005"," Meh. It's okay.

That said-- I probably would have liked this movie better if they'd spent a little more time developing the characters and a little less time careening around like a roller coaster. I also thought the Mick Jagger cameo towards the end was a bit much. Overall, it wasn't painful to watch, but I'm not sure I'd want to watch it again if I wasn't required to. I'd rather they'd have added to the existing plot instead of trying to stretch a twenty-five page book into a feature-length film."

","THE POLAR EXPRESS is a delightful holiday film that is a sight to behold. Robert Zemeckis directs and Tom Hanks stars in this sure-to-be-classic filmed in a technique called performance-capture animation based on real actors. A young boy finds it hard to sleep on Christmas Eve for he doesn't want to miss hearing the bells on Santa's sleigh. Right before midnight there is a thunderous roar. The sound is coming from a magnificent, magical train that is bound for the North Pole and Santa's house. Dancing waiters serving hot chocolate and a conductor(Tom Hanks), who wants the children on board to enjoy themselves, but also wants the Polar Express to stay on time. My favorite scene is the sequence where the big yellow ticket flies out of the train and returns. Hanks plays six characters and even sings. Others of note in the cast: Eddie Deezen, Peter Scolari, Nora Gaye and Leslie Zemeckis. Besides Hanks, the soundtrack features holiday tunes by Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Kate Smith and the Andrews Sisters. This movie will be one of those you'll want to watch every Christmas."

The Polar Express is a magical fantasy about the spirit of Christmas, self discovery and friend ship. I will say that the sound was absolutely fantastic. The train sounded thunderously real. The music is sweeping and wondrous as well. The animation is of a new technique that looks almost life like. I think both children and adults will enjoy this. The media has sadly turned the holiday movie season in to nothing more then a 'who made more $$' wrestling match. If you have seen the incredibles do your self and family a favor, don't fall into the medias deception and go see Polar Express as well.

","How very disappointing. I was hoping for a Christmas movie with a ""spirit of Christmas"" type story about heart & warmth & spirit and instead I got a mechanical look at people riding a roller coaster. I've never read the book so I can't say how the story compares, but in this film there is no story. None, nada, zero, zip. Not one iota of plot at all. <br/><br/>Here it is: kid gets on train. Train is a roller coaster and goes up down around trough over under left right etc. Kid winds up on roof as tunnel approaches. Somewhere in the middle of this there is a weird dance sequence where hot chocolate is served. The train arrives at the North Pole and main kids get lost and wind up in Santa's gift processing machine which is yet another amusement park ride, this time a slide. Kids meet Santa and go home.<br/><br/>There are no characters in the traditional sense, thus no character development. The dialog is minimal as most of the movie focuses on the roller coaster's ... I mean train's ... trip to the north pole using stunning visuals and impossible camera angels. I suppose it's all very exciting but it leads up to... nothing.<br/><br/>The ""BIG MESSAGE"" at the end is simple ""believe in Christmas."" Nothing revelatory here. And given the not-quite lifelike people populating the film, it's hard to get any kind of human message. The visuals are stunning, but the people are still not quite there yet. And this too-smooth, glossy mechanical look kills any ability to empathize with the characters. This might have worked better as a traditional 2D animated film or using more stylized human figures. <br/><br/>Overall, a maddeningly disappointing film from one of my favorite directors."

","Being a professional film buff (I work for the Library of Congress, Motion Picture Conservation Center and have seen 7k+ films so far) I went to see this 140 million dollar holiday feature with mixed expectations. My conclusion is that the critics that don't like it don't get it. My girlfriend and I got it big time on a 30ft tall IMAX screen using polarized (the good kind) 3-D glasses! I can only image that seeing it in 2-D would entertain, but also make you want to see it again in that stunning third dimension. There are some good, some bad and just a few excellent films made in 3-D or IMAX. This one gets everything right and like Christmas STORY, may only be appreciated as the word of mouth gets out.<br/><br/>From Robert Zemeckis, the same director who made WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT (1988) which mixed live action with animation and FORREST GUMP (1994), another film that combined levels of reality and special effects.<br/><br/>Heart touching characters include: Hero Girl, a gentle African American child; Lonely Boy, representing the poor from the wrong side of the tracks; Know-It-All, whose observations are insufferable; and Hobo as the spirit of the lost and forgotten.<br/><br/>Most of the action is variations on a thrill-ride like the Polar Express train careening down a 179-degree grade, then racing through tunnels with a half-inch of clearance. Another sublime scene of eye-candy dances before us as a lost ticket flutters through the air with as much freedom as the famous floating feather at the start of FORREST GUMP. A temping tasty scene has hot chocolate being served on the train with waiters materializing in an acrobatic song-and-dance. <br/><br/>A Fear Factor scene explodes when the giant bag of Christmas toys being helicoptered into the sleigh accidentally knocks the star off the toy of the giant Christmas tree sending it plunging down towards the defenseless elves. A crack team of bungee jumping elves leap down from the copter racing the star to the ground and grab it just in the nick of time to save the day!<br/><br/>When Santa's helpers hitch up the reindeer, they look not like tame cartoon characters, but like skittish thoroughbreds. Other unique moments are provided by a reflection in a hubcap and additional pieces of business that add sparkle to this gem. You'll want to see it twice as this film will keep on giving throughout holiday seasons to come.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Like most truly great films this one has a 'gotcha' scene, where you get hooked and can't wait for the ride to continue. In STAR WARS it was the giant space ship coming from behind and cruising amazingly overhead. In POLAR EXPRESS the first 'gotcha' for me was in the opening scene in a young boy's bedroom on Christmas Eve as he wonders about the reality of Santa Clause. In this beautifully detailed sequence (similar to TOY STORY) he opens a book and the camera rotates around him and behind the reversed (and floating giant type) print on the page to show his wondering face. This vivid point of view was magical. There are many scenes with snow, more realistically shown than in ANY other film, floating deftly around this super deep world pallet. <br/><br/>The dancing waiter's scene rivals and nearly beats similar action in SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS or Fred Astaire's dancing on the ceiling in ROYAL WEDDING. Later in the story a prized golden ticket blows out of a window and travels from a pack of wild wolves to a soaring eagle's mouth, then plunges down a monstrous waterfall only to pull up and rest on the edge of the eagles nest: again magical and breathtakingly believable.<br/><br/>The army of elves at the incredibly detailed North Pole city, the giant bag of toys on the sleigh and the performances of the ghost-like hobo, the semi-stern but more big-brotherly train conductor and finally the big man, Santa, add depth to this fairy tale.<br/><br/>Some critics have said this film was 'cold' or 'detached.' Well maybe they didn't identify with the intelligent young black girl who becomes the leader of the children; maybe they were more like the 'know-it-all' kid who questioned everything, believed nothing and took a negative spin because they think it makes them appear smarter. I don't want to spoil the sweet, inspiring story but it deals with the wonder of childhood, the mystery of the unknown and the magic of imagination and dreams which Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis thankfully still are in touch with. Through their talent we too can take this wild ride and be dazzled with child-like exhilaration!"

","First of all, there's not really much to say about the plot. It's bloated and largely aimless for the majority of it's run time, as the source material was only a picture book. They should have left it alone.
At least, though, if they HAD to make a film of it, why did they use this animation style? It was painful even in later films such as the screwy adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" or the mystifying absurdism of ""Mars Needs Moms"". Here, as it's an older film, the noticeably older motion capture technology is all the more demented in appearance. This is not, and will never be, a regular part of my Christmas movie schedule."

","This is the movie that started off the whole thing with mixing CGI animation with motion capture software, and it's still at the top of the CGI movie totem pole. After all these years, the effects and imagery still blows me away. Employing a mix of real world physics and the unique properties of a cartoon universe, the movie shows us the scale and details of what looks like a real train, but at no time is anyone ever at risk of danger. The train slides around and crashes through ice, but it also careens down mountains at top speeds without getting swept off the train tracks. Another thing, frequently the distances and horizons keep shifting, and this is exceptionally obvious on the frozen lake whose size we see on arrival, but as the Polar Express speeds back to the tracks, the horizon keeps popping back from getting closer to much further away. I also noticed the train length and number of train cars keeps varying, and that Santa's North Pole village seems much larger than its population seems to require. They're small bloopers for a movie whose whole purpose is to stun and stir awe in the watcher. The story is simple and sweet: a boy travels to meet Santa at the North Pole and get a secret tour with two other children. It's remarkable and utterly magical, but still, I can't help but want to add in the mythology of the ""Santa Clause"" movies with Tim Allen. Maybe everything we're seeing is under the ice as in that movie and this Santa is the man in the suit before Tim Allen. Wouldn't that be cool? It's a good movie that stimulates our imagination, and ""The Polar Express"" is definitely a good movie, ranking in the top ten of my favorite holiday movies with ""A Christmas Story,"" ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" ""Harry Potter,"" ""Scrooge"" and ""The Shining."""
"StevePulaski","10","1","4","29 December 2012"," Cinemagic
","The Polar Express is a rare exercise in pure cinemagic, where everything is dreamlike and exists in a world run on the motor of whimsy. It's a beautiful looking film, with every shot so mindbogglingly detailed and every action sequence so paralyzing in its charm and excitement. I can only imagine the everlasting impact an IMAX experience would've had on me as a longtime cinema-goer.<br/><br/>I have major sympathy for the parents of America, who year after year, are likely subjected to the lowest common denominator of family entertainment at home and at the cinema. When rating a family film, I ask the question, ""is it fun for the kids?"" and then ask, ""is it fun for the adults?"" They pay the ticket price; don't you feel they should share the enjoyment of what is being on screen and not just hope to see something resembling the beginning of a long line of end credits? Bless the fact that Pixar films have begun to take the attention of anxious kids and parents, and at least during the Christmastime in 2004, The Polar Express lurked in theaters for weeks so that the masses could be treated to the beautiful qualities imaginative cinema had to offer.<br/><br/>I'm positive everyone knows the story to the beloved children's book, penned in 1985. On the night of Christmas Eve, a young boy, skeptical about the idea of Santa Claus, is taken on a journey after seeing an enormous train pull up to his front yard with the train conductor (one of the five characters Tom Hanks voices in the film, not including the narrator) proudly shouting, ""all abooooooard,"" before taking the young boy and several other nearby children on the ride of their life. Their destination is obviously the North Pole, where the kids can hopefully meet Santa Claus and receive a present for their good behavior this year. During the long ride, the young boy (who remains nameless, along with most of the others on board) meets a young black girl and a young boy named Billy, and the three children wind up having the ride of their life, as they not only avoid several scenes of uncertainty, but challenge the perilous conditions brought on to them by using quick and wise judgment. Not to mention, these three kids are just absolutely lovable. You're Scrooge if the children's beautiful song at the back of the train doesn't summon a tear to your eye.<br/><br/>The film exercises our unalienable right to imagine and dream. What kind wouldn't have wanted to take a ride on The Polar Express at age eight or nine? When I was small, my town held a little ""Polar Express"" event where children go board a train and cruise through nearby towns. It was a less than memorable experience. The singing was mild, the people weren't as fun, and the rule about hot chocolate wasn't in place because it was already broken by the time we received it.<br/><br/>If I would've seen something like The Polar Express in IMAX theaters, say, nine years ago, I would've been delighted. The kids who appreciate the most will be between seven and ten because the film gears itself to more mature children, who are still possibly clinging to that last bit of childhood innocence that is believing in Santa Claus. This picture shows that magic continues to exist long after your beliefs are over, and paints the most lavish and awe-inspiring portrait of the holidays that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis, the laudable visionary of Back to the Future, provides us with one of cinema's many landmark, this one being for the digital age. This is the first film in history to utilize the motion-capture style of animation for the entire length. Motion-capture animation is when actors are fitted for special suits and proceed to act out the motions of their character, which will be converted to digital animation using computers. In recent times, let's take for example, Mars Needs Moms, a later picture by Zemeckis that left loads to be desired, the medium was gimmicky and unnecessary. Here, it's extremely enchanting. The inherent zombification of the human characters isn't explicitly found like in other motion-capture animation films, and it provides for nothing but smoothness in the sequences when The Polar Express flies off the train tracks and on to a bed of ice. Even the scenes with Santa's sleigh, zipping and zooming past a crowd of thousands looks beautifully enhanced thanks to this medium. This is one of the most detailed and great looking films ever made.<br/><br/>The Polar Express is a magnificent cinematic achievement in terms of look and feel. The action sequences are brilliantly staged, offering up the feeling of placement and depth instead of giving us indistinct location shots and messy editing skills. Everything is clear, broad, and vivid, and the characters are innocent and easy to love. The film has been compared to a roller coaster ride in a derogative manner, but turning that around to fit a positive connotation, the picture gives us one of the most fun cinematic rides in recent history, visually and emotionally.<br/><br/>Voiced by: Tom Hanks. Directed by: Robert Zemeckis."

Stripped of its visual ornamentation the story reveals itself to be, like all good children's Christmas stories, timeless in its simplicity. Its overall effect lingers for a bit after viewing; like being in a childlike fugue of Christmas spirit.<br/><br/>As years go by and it continues to age I imagine what many criticized it for upon its release, it's singularly unusual visual style, will become, or continue to become, one of its more endearing traits.

","I put this one off for a long time because of mixed reviews and happenstance.<br/><br/>I just finished it on HD ON-Demand and I was very impressed.<br/><br/>I had read some reviews and such that talked about ""a shallow story"", ""poor animation"", and other ""issues"".<br/><br/>Great Christmas fare here! ""The Polar Express"" is an immensely exciting entry into the genre. I watched the film in 2D/HD and it was a true visual spectacle. The action sequences and train shots stood out as some of the best visual animation I've seen to date.<br/><br/>It's going to be hard for many purists to take what I'm about to say. It won't help the ""who found this helpful"" percentage, but frankly I don't care - it's calling it how I see it.<br/><br/>I watched Hugo a couple of weeks ago at the theater, and I truly believe that the Polar Express is as good or better. Where Hugo lacks in charm and adventure - The Polar Express excels. Where Hugo over-stays its' welcome - TPE tells a quick, basic fantasy storyline with no hidden agendas and no bows to anyone EXCEPT the audience.<br/><br/>This film wasn't made for critics - it was tailor-made for someone like me - someone looking for a new Christmas classic to watch during the Holiday season. The first in a long-time, to line-up and put next to ""Miracle on 34th St."", ""A Christmas Story"", ""Rudolph The Red-nose Reindeer"", and others.<br/><br/>The visual details during certain train sequences are jaw-dropping. Some people have talked about the ""eyes"" of the characters. It's not perfect, but it is the most realistic attempt at a human face that I've seen in animation. For that reason, it is going to be criticized. You can compare it say to any Pixar film, and the pixar films(like all animated films save this one) still show the old-fashioned human animated face-shapes, that succumb to conventionality instead of innovation. The Polar Express may have bitten off more than it could chew in this aspect, but I don't think it took anything away from the movie. Besides, the rest of the film is as visually spectacular as ANYTHING FROM PIXAR or any other production company - that includes modern marvels like Tekkon Kinkreet, to timeless classics like Fantasia and Snow White. Visually, this animation doesn't take a back-seat to anything.<br/><br/>So the story had to fall short, right? Maybe a little. It's a Christmas fantasy. The storyline isn't anymore complex than any other film in this genre. It's about the heart of Christmas, and all the joys of the holiday. Every Christmas storyline(save Christmas Story) falls short. I wasn't looking for a deep storyline when I hit play. I was looking for something that embodied the spirit of Christmas. I got that and more.<br/><br/>Catch this if you've put it off like me.<br/><br/>80/100 I never like to say to people that they didn't ""Get"" a movie, or ""understand"" a movie. People take offense. But, this film does have some neat little concepts and nuances that could be over-looked by some. THose that put those little pieces together, and feel the magic of those moments, will take more away from this film.<br/><br/>You'll like this if you Liked: Toy Story 2, Hugo, and Monster House."
"CineNutty","10","1","4","12 December 2011"," Under-rated by whom???
","I cannot believe that ""The Polar Express"" has not received ""more traction"" (pardon the pun) than what has been reflected in current voting. First, while it is a Christmas tale which does not tell the true Christmas story, it captures what is important to children regardless of individual religious affiliation - belief in something good. Second, all you need to do is look to two quotes:<br/><br/>Santa Claus: ""This bell is a wonderful symbol of the spirit of Christmas - as am I. Just remember, the true spirit of Christmas lies in your heart.""<br/><br/>""At one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as years passed it fell silent for all of them. Even Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound. Though I've grown old the bell still rings for me, as it does for all who truly believe.""<br/><br/>Production values were very high. It was nominated for three Oscars for good reason. The remembrance credit for Michael Jeter is appropriate. I seriously doubt that Jeter would object for being remembered for his contribution to this film. It is the magic of any child who wishes for something or WANTS TO BELIEVE IN SOMETHING and gets the gift of the ability to believe in something, anything worthwhile. See this picture with your heart and don't tear it apart with your head."
"MajorFilmFan","10","1","4","9 November 2010"," A simply magical, holiday classic.
","While it doesn't stick very closely with it's source material, Chris Van Allisberg's 1988 novel of the same name, The Polar Express is a simply remarkable cinematic experience.<br/><br/>The plot, much like the book, centers on a young boy living in Grand Rapids, MI in the 1950s (Which happens to be the same time Van Allisberg grew up, meaning that the main character may very well represent, or even BE Van Allisberg at a young age), who doubts the existence of Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve, he has the remarkable experience of riding a magical train, called the Polar Express to the North Pole. The film features a cast of very eccentric characters, many of which are voiced (the film is made in Stop-Motion animation) by the film's executive producer, and the main reason the film exists, Tom Hanks (Hanks enjoyed reading this story to his children when they were young, and he came up wtih the idea to make a movie out of it, and then proposed the idea to the screenwriter, and director Robert Zemecis, who has since gone on to make the stop motion animated films Beowulf, and one of my other favorite Christmas movies, 2009s A Christmas Carol, with Jim Carrey.) Hanks provides the voices for, Hero Boy, the boy's Father, the train's Conductor, a mysterious, almost angel like Hobo, a puppet version of Scrooge (which is ironic seeing as how Zemecis later made A Christmas Carol in Stop-Motion), and Santa Claus. The film also includes one of Michael Jeeter's last films, and in this one, he plays the comical engineer and fireman Steamer and Smokey. If you've never seen it, it is truly a beautiful film about believing in your dreams."

","The Polar Express is a film that has so much there. There is so much involved in the making. Tom Hanks plays a bunch of characters, there was a 165 million dollar budget involved. It's from director Robert Zemekis(Back to the future, Romancing the stone). Also, the film is pretty neat to look at. But in all, The Polar Express is a mediocre attempt that is more original than Zathura but far from being as good as Jumanji. I loved Jumanji. Which was also written by Chris Van Allsburgh. The Polar Express isn't really that exciting of a film. In looks, The Polar Express would be great. There's something about it that just rubs me the wrong way. I also find it kind of irritating, or at least some of the characters. Tom Hanks tries to keep the film together. It's not his fault I don't think it's that good of a film, there are many reasons. I just think it's an overrated film that is good on neatness, but bad on most things. I hate to say it but The Polar Express is a thumbs down. Robert Zemeckis made up for it with 2007's Beowulf. Which was neater and far more entertaining than this. I hope he can recapture the magic with A Christmas Carol coming out in November.

Maybe we were too used to the amazing animation from studio's such as Disney's Pixar? We loved CARS, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc etc. The bottom line was that the animation for Polar Express was just too odd to keep us interested and we turned it off after 20 minutes and switched over to watching ""Cars"" from Pixar.

There are also screenwriters that write things to fill in the movie to make it longer.

So we went again with their parents. I have it on DVD. I suspect that, as is so often the case, kids are scared because they pick up from their parents or adults with them who ""think"" kids will be scared. But then, my grandchildren have sat through the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"", and we're off next week to ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"".<br/><br/>The movie wasn't intended to be ""real"" - so scenes with trains flying down roller-coasters, caribou on tracks, a wild ride on a frozen lake, all are believable in the overall story. This is a story from a child's point of view, where anything is possible. Never once were those children in real danger - it wasn't intended that way. It *was* intended to be a spiritual journey.<br/><br/>Note to those who say Tom Hanks ""changed"" things and added to the story - Chris van Allsburg, the book's author, also was part of the team which wrote and created this. The sound of the train was really the sound of the real train upon which it was modeled and which still runs in Michigan. The homes were modeled after Robert Zemeckis' childhood homes.The whole look of the movie, and its use of light and warmth was amazing, not to mention the performance-capture technique. Look closely - eyelids move, eyebrows move, faces frown or smile. There is an African-American child, but there are also Asian children on the train - and the recreation of life in those days (I remember it well) was pretty accurate, which makes sense given that it was modeled on Zemeckis' own childhood.<br/><br/>The scenes with the elves are a hoot - the main elf obviously comes from New Jersey, and caricatures of real people abound in a light and humorous way. The town at the North Pole was reminiscent of some of the old buildings in Helsinki and Tampere, in Finland.<br/><br/>For me, the best part of the movie was Santa. He combines the aura (he glows) of a not-human, probably angelic being, but somewhat Nordic looking. Tales of Santa and elves abound in Finland, and I'm betting the creators drew on that history and look - even to some of the detailing in his costume. He isn't the jolly fat old elf (although a few ho-ho's are 'de rigueur'), but is tall and imposing, sturdy and strong, capable of being firm without anger, wise, compassionate, and with a sense of humour.<br/><br/>This is not a movie about reality - it's a movie about faith and belief in the unseen. As a theologian, I've recommended this movie to my congregation as way of indulging in a little childhood fantasy, and grappling with issues of faith and disbelief in the things we can't see. Tom Hanks, Chris van Allsburg, and Robert Zemeckis, and the whole team in this movie have done a wonderful job of creating a beautiful movie with a message not only for children but for adults as well."

","If you do not see this in 3D, and if you are a movie fan, you are leaving out a historic film, and a wonderful experience at the same time..The 3D experience in IMAX, is beyond anything I have ever seen. Snow is falling, and you feel as if you can touch the snow. It is there in front of you, one other very minor, not giving away anything, there is a scene in the living room, the couch looks so real, that you think you can go sit on it. ..I believe that this type of film will not be made again..It is too expensive, and it number of IMAX theaters I think is shrinking...I am not sure..This medium, offers so much, but if it does not make money, it will be gone, just like 3D left, (this is the third time they have tried it, and this film is clearly the best) and so did 8 track tapes. ..The film itself is upbeat, the longest 3D Imax movie I think was ever made, or one of the longest, over an hour and 30 minutes, the story is meaningful, fun, and of course about Christmas. There are many special uses of the Imax and 3D experience, that are just fun, and spectacular.. ..Go see it, it will be gone very soon, today is Jan 9, and there is not much time left in this releases..But more important. ... Real professionals with credentials made this, just for the doubters.. ..Directed by Robert Zemekes, who specializes in mixing in animation and specially effects, he did ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" another true classic, that has not been equaled.. ..It was financed by someone named ""Tom Hanks"" a lad with some minor experience, and some deep pockets..I doubt that the 3D experience could not have been completed without ""deep pockets."" I do not know if the costs, of the extra 3D effects have been made back yet. ..Finally, the story, while it's total background is ""Christmas"", I believe ,that the real meaning of this film, has nothing to do with Christmas. Hanks changed some from the book. But I will leave that up to you to decide. But no matter what you believe, please believe enough to see this in 3D soon, as possible.. ..I suspect the medium will be around for another release next year, but , that is something we do not know. The manager at the theater I saw it at, said the ""Harry Potter Imax version"" was clearly out drawing Polar Express. I saw it at an early morning showing with 6 people in the theater. So it may not be back,who knows? But I urge you to see it no matter what. In my area, one IMAX has shut down, and another has stopped advertising in the newspapers..It is in a museum...Not a good sign for IMAX.. ..Well, it is a great ride, truly unique, and warm, wonderful, and fun. I hope you get a ticket soon..."

","Have to say, I find it unbelievable that Bad Santa which is film making at it's worst, is averaging 7.2/10 on here and this great and I do mean great film, is only 6.9/10... Wwhat the hell? This film is incredible to watch, good story, heart warming, everything Xmas and family is about... come on guys and girls... this is one of the great Xmas films!!! The only thing I'd say against it, is the lack of expression on the faces. Plus, Father Xmas isn't the best, he needed to be fatter and more detail on his chubby face.

"JoshtheGiant","9","1","4","17 December 2005"," Amazing
","The Polar Express is truly amazing, you have never seen anything like it and I'm not just talking about the animation. The way it is put together is just so original and so perfect I think I can easily say this is the third best Christmas film ever right behind It's a Wonderful Life and The Bishops Wife. The Polar Express book was my favorite as a kid and after seeing the movie I read it again and still liked it, thats pretty darn amazing because I usually don't like that kind of thing. They extended the story from the book a lot, but they had to to make a full length film. The story from the book is magical and wonderful but the one from the movie is even better fleshing it out more and making it seem more real. The story is also really helped by some great dialogue and character development. The only flaw I can really come up with is the acting which is a little cheesy and should have been more grounded some cheese is great for this film but not quite that much. But it is greatly directed by the same man who brought us Back to the Future and Forrest Gump, he is a great director. The visual effects/animation are some of the best ever filmed, they are just perfect even the way the clothes move in the wind looks real. The cinematography is perfect but a little jumpy so be warned it feels like a roller coaster even on your TV at home. You will love it I am almost sure of that, I loved it more than I have of a film in a long time. Everyone should see this magical film on and around Christmas day. It is sure to become a Christmas classic and will last years from now, my grandkids will likely see and love this movie if I'm not mistaken. Okay I rambled a bit I'll shut up now, just watch the movie."
"ryan_kuhn","7","1","4","30 November 2005"," ""Sometimes the most real things in this world are the things we can't see.""
","The Polar Express is a beautiful movie based on the children's picture book of the same name. As wonderful as the paintings that occupy the book are, the movie looks just as good. The movie follows a young boy who finds out on Christmas Eve that he will be going to the North Pole to watch Santa take off on his worldwide trip to gift giving. He had doubts that he will see Santa at all, but goes on the trip and meets up with a know-it-all kid with a terribly annoying voice (voiced by Eddie Deezen) and a girl who has a song in her heart (voiced by Nona Gaye) on a train that goes directly to the North Pole. The Arctic Outback provides the backdrop for the train ride, as we see quiet forests, howling wolves, and interesting terrain that supplies most of the suspense in this movie. The most daring part of the movie comes when the train goes through a roller coaster of tracks, ending by skating across a glacier. This scene is a wonder to watch, expertly crafted by director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future movies), though may scare a few of the young ones out there. Tom Hanks supplies the voices to six characters, including the train conductor, Santa Claus, a hobo riding on the train, and the young boy in which the story revolves. The movie was made by capturing the movements of the actors and running those movements into computers that animated the movie action. The final scenes of the movie take place in the North Pole, where the viewer will see more elves than they may ever want to admit to. The story of the movie is as simple as the book that it is based on, but is still fun to watch. Adults will like the simple story with a positive message, and kids will like the pretty scenes and the subject matter, though some of the perilous situations could scare a few kids. A holiday classic for years to come."
"gradyharp","5","1","4","24 November 2005"," Too Much, yet not Enough, of a Good Thing
","In 1985 sculptor Chris Van Allsburg published his first children's book, THE POLAR EXPRESS, which became an instant classic, especially appropriate for family reading during the holidays. The beauty of the book was not only a simple story about a lad's discovery of the real meaning of Christmas, but also the power of Allburg's glorious art - which was awarded with the Caldecott Medal in 1986.<br/><br/>Some of that book is retained and some of that is lost in this grossly overproduced, extravagantly expensive, film transition of the book. For reasons only known to director Robert Zemeckis, who also adapted the story for his film, and to his long time friend Tom Hanks, the decision was made to make not just an animated feature and not a computer enhanced film using actors, but a strange amalgamation of the two. We are seeing puppet-like characters morphed to resemble real people - and that must have caused the animators headaches but earned big money! But despite the bigger than life extravaganza version of basically an intimate story, the theme comes through and the message is sweet. Whether the 'fillers' heavily frosted on this version are additive is up to the taste of the viewer. But it is a tour de force for Hanks who plays almost everyone in the film, and it is evident that the film's heart is in the right place. Grady Harp"
"Caliann","7","1","4","13 June 2005"," 3-D IMAX impressive
","Having seen POLAR EXPRESS only in 3-D IMAX I can't comment on the complaints about ""dead eyes"" and other technical disappointments of the 2-D version. What I can say is that as an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed the tyke tale and oooh'd and ahhhh'd along with all the other kids in the audience. In 3-D, the eyes were strikingly real and expressive, right down to the nuanced squints, the mottled colors of the iris, reflections off the cornea, and apparent depth of the anterior chamber of the eye. The most notable technical achievement was the translation of subtle body movements that elevated the animation from cartoon to simulation. The application of motion-capture technology succeeded and the many producers who spent tons of money on this film should be praised rather than nitpicked to death by those expecting to see real people marching around on screen. To me, the subtleties captured in this technical tour de force are a huge advance and someday will be recognized unequivocally as such, without all the carping. On the other hand, the story could have been written better, edited more aggressively, tighter, less of the floating ticket, more about the sad poor kid in the caboose -- that is, there could have been better character and story development. They got a little too caught up in the techie tricks. But no matter what your age, there's plenty of entertainment if you just relax and let your imagination ride on the POLAR EXPRESS."

This was a great adventure for all ages, and anybody who went into it with an open mind.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1-10, I definitely give it a high 9 and letter grade of A.

We saw it in 3D IMAX and can't imagine seeing it any other way. At one point it's almost like being on a roller coaster. I kept waiting for the seats to shake like they do at Disney World. The story is touching and has a great message for kids. Although, the kids in our party were 19, 40 & 65. Tom Hanks is amazing as always. It was hard to believe all the characters he plays. The animation was so life-like, my father had a hard time believing they weren't real at first. So, don't wait for it to come out on DVD, go today. Greatly entertaining and well worth your time and money."

Many of the characters looked odd in the theatrical version and were fine in the 3D version. I will warn you not to put on the 3D glasses to soon. My eyes adjusted about 3/4 of the way through the movie. I wish that I had not seen the 3D movie previews in the theater.

","Are human actors expendable? Are we witnessing the beginning of their replacement by animated characters no matter how much ""human"" they can look like? Why? Is it cheaper? Or does it avoid directors the trouble of directing them and having so often to deal with their whimsical behaviour? Well anyway it's indubitable that my vote of 7 for this movie could be 2 or 3 points higher if the characters where human and not mere computer made puppets. Because it has all the ingredients to be a great Christmas movie conveying everything good that's contained in Christmas spirit and message: a good and original story, beautiful images (some of them breath-taking) and a well shaped team of characters, everything totally adequated to the beauty and fantasy of the Christmas atmosphere as we all have always imagined it mainly when we were children. And don't tell me please that if the movie were made with human actors it could not have the amazing and fantastic scenes it portrays. Today computer techniques allow to combine the most audacious special effects with human acting including that of children. And no computer can replace real human acting, real human gestures and expressions. Thus this movie left me a bit disappointed."
"BaronBl00d","5","1","4","29 December 2004"," Fasten Your Seatbelts, It's Going to be a Bumpy Ride
","Robert Zemeckis teams up with Tom Hanks once again in this children's fantasy film about children being taken to the North Pole to see Santa and his world via a magical train called the Polar Express. This is definitely geared more toward the adolescents than the adults. The film has some outstanding animation process which creates a reality out of animation if you will. I personally found the process quite fascinating, but I must confess that I must have looked at my watch at least six or seven times during the course of the film. Never a good sign. At a running length of 99 minutes, The Polar Express seemed more like the Pony Express than Amtrak. There is nothing individually that I can pinpoint as a major, upsetting problem with the film. The animation was terrific, the voices(with exception of Eddie Deezen's which really got on my nerves as it was undoubtedly suppose to)were well-matched to their graphic counterpoints, the song and spirit of the film were nice, and the action scenes leading to the North Pole were exciting and suspenseful - yet, the film for me was rather boring. It really didn't do anything for me . It didn't cause me to hate it, but I said right after seeing it that I had no desire to see it again. Not much really happens in terms of concrete plot. Tom Hanks does some nice engineering as several different ""roles"" if you will. I think I liked his conductor best. I found Santa to be rather bland - as much of the film chronicling the adventures of the three ""lost"" children in the village at the North Pole."
"katydid4819","6","1","4","28 December 2004"," New Animation Technology Overshadows Story
","How do you adapt a 15 page children's book into a two-hour movie? You are going to have to stretch some parts and take liberties at others. The problem with adapting such a beloved book is that some people may have problems with liberties such as adding characters and dance sequences. With The Polar Express, Robert Zemecks and Tom Hanks, a dream team of sorts, do just this. Maybe their intention had nothing to do with bringing this magical book to life but was more about breaking boundaries with new animation. Because of this, they found it easier to add what they liked here and there because, after all, it's not hard to add anything from a shadow to a person with the new technology they employed for the film.<br/><br/>The book tells the tale of a boy who has lost his Christmas spirit. On Christmas Eve, he boards the Polar Express when it pulls in front of his house. The train takes its passengers (all children) to the North Pole for the first gift of Christmas to be given by Santa to a lucky one of them. The film stays true to each of these aspects, but if it were to have only this, the film would be over in thirty minutes. So, a couple of side characters are invented. There is young black girl, a know-it-all boy, a boy who won't sit with the others, and hobo who is as mysterious as the Christmas spirit. Some of their adventures are cute and add to the story. There is a wonderful scene where the main character climbs on top of the train and meets the hobo. Of course, there are other parts that could have been revised. When the train skids across ice, the two main characters have to stop the train and even though the girl has been told which is the brake, they second guess things for a while culminating in a cringe-worthy gesture by the little girl; she quickly gives up and buries her face in her hands.<br/><br/>The animation has been what's driven the buzz for The Polar Express. It's the latest form of motion capture, first used for Gullom in The Lord Of The Rings. The performance by Tom Hanks as the conductor (or one of his other six roles) is done by Hanks himself and then, using CGI, is animated and blended with the completely computer generated background. It is because of this that Hanks is capable of playing more than one character. There are many moments where he is the only actor in the scene although there are many characters. Some of his performances are recognizably him, such as the conductor or the hobo to a lesser extent. Others show the magic behind Hanks and the technology. He plays the main character without a trace of himself.<br/><br/>There are down sides to the animation too. The people have an unnatural air about them. Perhaps it's the eyes, which are the only part of a performance that cannot be captured by the motion capture system. The eye is often the entirety of a performance in some scenes and is also often said to be a window to the soul. Without ""souls"" the characters are lifeless. Although the images from the movie are able to sometimes almost able to mirror those from the book, the effect it has on the people is still problematic. ***/*****"

","I found a movie that is a perfect family favorite. Based off of the 1986 children's book, the Polar Express follows a boy whom feels doubtful of Christmas hopping on a magical train, meets new friends and go on a railroad journey of a lifetime.<br/><br/>This movie is exciting, touching, cute and admirable. A lot of work went into this movie and it is well worth your time. It is not an emotionless G rated movie (like most in this PC era), it was full of twists and turns and you could feel both sympathy and relief for the characters (especially the Lonesome little boy in the back of the train).<br/><br/>I wish there would be more family movies like this instead of plot less toilet humor flicks."

"Leafsman_69","7","1","4","13 December 2004"," The Spirit of Christmas in High Technology
","Tom Hanks rarely chooses a bad movie project to undertake, and the Polar Express is no exception. Motion capture is a developed technology that is presently being implemented into the cinema world. Those who have read the book will certainly enjoy this work of visual art. Of course there are some differences, the most obvious being the length of the feature, but the movie remains entertaining. One of the few shortcomings of the film occurs once the Polar Express arrives in North Pole City. At this point the film comes to a bit of a halt. Some scenes were pointless also, but adds for entertainment value nonetheless. Hanks plays numerous characters and fits well into all of them, this clearly demonstrates how flexible and ambitious of an actor he is. The movie takes place over the course of one night. The Polar Express takes children to the north pole who have questioned or lost some faith in Santa Clause. The journey to the destination is spectacular, with jaw dropping special effects. The movie is dark, however it does add to the mysteries surrounding the true meaning of Christmas. This film has reminded me and I'm sure as well as others, how fun it was to believe."

It took me a grand total of 3 times to truly absorb it all. It's not confusing... it's all just so... curious. A ghost bum on a train, show stopping musical numbers and possibly creepy animation ; how does all of this fit into the picture book narrative of Chris Van Allsburg's picture book?

On more than one occasion my girlfriend told me she felt sick, which I thought was great. The reason why is she gets sick on rollercoasters. So therefore the effects when the train was shooting up hills and down steep drops seemed very real. There was one shot of the train skidding to a stop that caused me to tilt my head back to avoid a head on collision.

"Geoffreylebowski","10","1","4","27 November 2004"," I haven't seen a film this good in years
","I absolutely adored The Polar Express. It's been over a decade since i described a film as ""magical"" but any other word seems to fall short of capturing the essence of the film. The film was so beautifully designed that every shot looked like a scenic photograph. I am I have to say a large Zemeckis fan and this is easily one of his best. It's beautifully shot, the script is enchanting and calmly knowing (in the way that A.A. Milne's 'Whinnie The Pooh' novels were). I thought Tom Hanks gave six magnificent performances and managed to make some very difficult lines potent and easy. (He was also rather good at doing multiple voices).<br/><br/>The score from Silvestri was delightful and catchy but soft and sentimental at the same time. The songs were also lovely and they matched the mood of the film well. But the loudest applause must go to Zemeckis himself. Ranging from roller-coaster sequences, to creepy ghost monologues, to action sequencing the film embraces that which is entertaining and fun only. And what's this? Child performances of a professional callibre? (Although Hanks steals the show in every sense).<br/><br/>What I really liked about this film is that there was absolutely nothing sinister about it. If you watch any child's film, there's usually a dark, crisp adult edge to it, most Disney films have wit aimed at the adults, but this film does not have this cynical undertone. It certainly has some moments for the adult audience but only in a soft and calm way, in a sense I suppose I valued the film's nostalgic quality; it has been far too long since I've seen a film that is just about childish fantasy. Some may criticise the film for being too sentimental but I don't think it was too sentimental at all, it was designed as a sweet Christmas movie and is just that.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong I'm not a soft-hearted fan of children's nonsense, my favourite films include Apocalypse Now, The Exorcist, Aliens, Naked Lunch, Citizen Kane, Brazil & The Piano, none of which are renowned for charm, but I just felt with this film that it touched a part of my viewing mind that has not been touched in a long long time. I think it is a great shame that this film has not received more acclaim.<br/><br/>Thank you Robert Zemeckis."

The computer animation or digital images of the scenery were just simply gorgeous! The facial expressions were so good they were scary. The music was well written and chosen. I rushed out to buy the CD after the movie. We felt the magic build as the movie went on. At the end, even adults sitting with me sat a moment just to ponder what they had seen. Go see it. For children of all ages! Even those of us over 30! :)"

Also I liked the fact that after the movie he asked me if we could get a present for a child that never has much. This was worth the entire price of admission to have a child understand and feel for those who don't have as many blessings as others.

"Robert_duder","Null","1","4","22 November 2004"," The most unique film of the year
","The Polar Express could probably be debated about for a good long time. Funny for an animated Christmas film!! Robert Zemeckis is not new to the idea of a unique film idea. I mean Zemeckis is a master director. He's the mastermind behind The Back To The Future series, three of the best films ever made. But granted this is new territory for him and yet he takes it and makes it his own. Zemeckis and superstar Tom Hanks team up again (the first time being the over rated but not bad film Castaway.) This film puts the final nail in the sign that reads ""TOM HANKS MOST TALENTED ENTERTAINER ALIVE."" There is nothing this man can't do or make us believe or act his way into. This is no exception, animated or otherwise. <br/><br/>The film is about a young boy who is reaching that age where you start to realize that perhaps there is no Santa Clause. He is looking into the cold hard facts of the idea of Santa Clause and he's coming up with the realization it doesn't exist. The night of Christmas Eve when everyone else has gone to bed, the young boy stumbles outside of his house and smack into an enormous steam engine. The conductor steps down and invites him onboard to The Polar Express...the train that goes to the North Pole. The boy journey's through treacherous mountains and landscape, meets some other children who become good friends, and finally arrives in The North Pole to meet with Santa Clause himself and receive the first Christmas Present of the year. <br/><br/>Story sounds pretty straight forward doesn't it? Nothing overly unique about that? The uniqueness comes from several things. The first is the graphics. The computer animation is brilliant, stunning, beautiful, and jaw dropping. The movements of each character are just flawless and captivating, you can't take your eyes away. The voice overs are so immaculate and Tom Hanks as several different characters breathes incredibly personality into them specifically the train conductor who is a mysterious, yet fun character to enjoy. He's protective of the children but by the book running his train. <br/><br/>The actual film making is the key here though. If this were not a Christmas film with a lesson behind it to learn it would almost be too scary for children, it would almost be downright frightful to them. These kids have a harrowing journey through the frozen tundra, there are some extremely nail biting moments. The landscape, Christmas town, and everything in this film is just hauntingly beautiful and a little scary at times. It's different than anything I've ever seen in a film. Even Santa's elves come across as strange and scary at times. I don't think there is anything wrong with this new twist on the Christmas story. Certainly scare tactics are not new to a Christmas story. Take A Christmas Carol for example, almost a horror story at times. The Grinch, and other stories like that. But this story goes even deeper into an underworld of Christmas. One of Hank's characters in the film is a train jumping hobo who helps our hero several times but only to disappear in the snow like a Ghost. It never explains who he is, why he's there or whether or not he is actually a Ghost. <br/><br/>The musical score for the film is also beautiful although perhaps only slightly overused at times. As I first began watching the film I thought of what a wonderful achievement it would have been to see this film in live action but as it continued I realized that it's whole heart is in the animation of it. They set up Santa Clause as this hero, a larger than life persona that for the most part we have forgotten about because he has become such an icon of Christmas. <br/><br/>The beautiful Christmas music, the original score, the animation, the incredibly story, the action and nail biting sequences, the lovely Christmas lessons learned and the amazing acting voice overs by Hanks this film is timeless and finally a classic worthy of keeping around. I will add this to my Christmas viewing list every year!!! Although short, the film is wonderful for anyone. I insist everyone sees this Christmas classic. If your children are young, be prepared for a little scare but I think they will grow to love it!! I hope this film gets some Academy attention of some sort. 9/10"

","Polar Express has just opened in Australia and we saw it the other night. It is visually the most amazing thing I have ever seen. (We saw Final Fantasy just to see the CGI). It was also refreshing to see a movie where somebody actually understands how a steam locomotive is operated. Now you tell me there is a 3D version?<br/><br/>Fundamentally it is like one of those beautifully illustrated children's books, but it moves and it talks. Ostensibly it's about Christmas and the Santa Claus thing, but it's really about the wonder of childhood - those who have it, those who don't and those who missed out. There are flaws, and you can be PC about some things - it ignores the Christian background of Christmas - which is fine by me (let's not get into pagan roots, shall we?) and it's PC about other things, but I am happy to overlook this, because I can hear the bell! <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, don't be put off by other user comments - they don't hear the bell.

"kewlmatto","5","1","4","19 November 2004"," Lifeless and spread ridiculously thin...
","Wow. I never thought Zemeckis and Hanks could produce something so...boring.<br/><br/>The Polar Express is not only predictable (which can be forgivable, but not here...), it has no likable characters, and besides some eye candy, it really has nothing going for it at all. What initially appeared to be a visually spectacular film was actually lifeless. The characters look awkward and dull, and nothing great is really done with the scenery (besides a small handful of moments on the train). Most of the action ends up being theme-park driven POV action. Fun, for a couple of seconds, but without a motion simulator, it tires easily. The fact that it is repeated throughout some three to four times does nothing to up the ante.<br/><br/>I'm sure the book had much charm, but as a fully fledged feature film, it is such a small story that is spread so thin that really, it becomes apparent that this should have been a thirty-minute short film - made for holiday TV viewing. Sure, it somewhat captures the ""spirit of Christmas"", but certainly not in any fun way. They really needed to take a page out of Pixar's book - develop a story which doesn't bore and characters that are well-rounded, FUN and likable.<br/><br/>Forget this turkey and watch the Grinch again..."

"Norwegianheretic","5","1","4","13 November 2004"," A jaded movie from the jaded enchanters
","Robert Zemeckis, in the worst tradition of Steven Spielberg, has made an easily forgettable Christmas movie that brings out the vapid nature in us all. This story is so old and so poorly told that the filmmakers obviously, though not to them, no doubt, were doing it by rote. Zemeckis, who has brought us truly brilliant fare like Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? must have had his brain cells on ice during the Polar Express scripting. I call he and John Williams the jaded enchanters because the film has no soul. It's a formulaic film of 'family magic' and inspiring people to 'believe' who have been at the top of their game (and pocketbooks) for so long that they've lost any touch with the reality that is experienced by actual human beings who live in the real world. The whole feeling of the story is artificial, the characters that are supposed to represent the poor and/or the disenchanted have no ring of truth to them. Again, the sense I have is that these believers have been either too far removed from reality for too long - or, more likely (since I'm sure they are well meaning), they have begun to trust their movie instincts too easily because those close to them aren't going to point out that the emperor is naked.<br/><br/>I mention John Williams, incidentally, because he seems to have phoned in the score - his dreadful overuse of crescendos that have been borrowed endlessly from his own work manages to make nothing seem special and of crescendo importance until the crescendo that brings up the credits of those who are guilty of kidnapping our minds and dragging us through this experience."

","Awesome! After a flood of R rated or PG-13 rated movies lately, it's just a pleasant surprise to see a movie with a G rating that still keeps the audience interested. Especially a movie based upon such a holiday-based classic story. Having read the book thousands of times to the attentive young children on the local tourist train, I am quite familiar with the story background. It's nice to see that the movie maintained the storyline while sensationalizing, or filling in the gaps. After all, it takes 5 minutes to read the book aloud. So to go from 5 minutes to an hour and 40 minutes, that's a lot of filler! When you watch this movie though, you have to keep in mind that it's a dream. The train scene does get a bit wild, but it's just an illusion played by the young boy's imagination. Definitely take the kids to see this movie! I still hear the sleigh bell! :-)"
"texasguy11363","8","1","4","13 November 2004"," Feel Good Holiday Movie
","This is one of those movies that showcases the good side of people through a little boy who is doubting the existence of Santa Claus. It's been done before, but the storyline formula of ""believing"" in something to make it ""real"" is tireless and heart-warming. I give it an 8 because it gets a little slow in the middle, but I recommend it highly to all family viewers. I liked the story more than ""Shark Tale"" but not as much as ""The Incredibles."" I will say this for the movie: computer generated characters have come a long way. I foresee the future of movie-making in my lifetime where any actors can be portrayed in this ageless fashion. While that may make the high-priced megastars shutter, just think of all the avenues that will be opened for actors who may not have that ""look"" so desired by Hollywood today...."
"bix171","10","1","4","11 November 2004"," Timeless
","Robert Zemeckis' self-indulgent, narcissistic masterpiece is entirely computer-animated and the enormous expense is all right up there on the screen, every penny of it. It's consistently in your face and (at least when seen on an IMAX screen in 3-D) frequently overwhelming--it's presented in a relentlessly showoffy manner. But it's also completely heartfelt and as moving as Zemeckis' best work, the sublime 'Cast Away' (itself one of the finest American films of the decade). The specialized CGI bravura is clearly the thing here, with well-thought, exciting and cleanly realized set pieces that take the nascent technical form to the limit. (A short section involving a floating train ticket is one of the most brilliantly realized examples of animation-any animation-ever created.) Based on the cherished children's book by Chris Van Allsburg in which a young boy who has ceased to believe in the magic of Santa Claus is whisked away on the titular train to the North Pole to restore his faith, it will delight and dazzle children of all ages and religious persuasions. But Zemeckis has become one of cinema's most sincere seekers and he concludes the film with a bittersweet questioning of the faith he has asked his audience to accept, noting that time--his primary passion in 'Cast Away'--and adulthood require the magic of innocent conviction to fade and be recalled simply as one of the components necessary to shape a life. Tom Hanks plays five roles that have been animated and they're some of the best he's played in quite a while, particularly the loving, no-nonsense Conductor that allows him to layer a humorously transparent veil of gruffness over the honest compassion he has styled his career upon. The magnificent Deco grandeur and elegance of the Polar Express itself and the North Pole workshops, by Rick Carter and Doug Chiang, fits effortlessly into Zemeckis' design of remembrance of things past. 'The Polar Express' should have no trouble being accepted as a holiday classic but time will reveal it to be what it truly is: the efforts of a master craftsman not only at the forefront of scientific methods to create art but with a yearning to explore the timeless qualities of being human."

"The_Master_Critic","7","1","4","11 November 2004"," A fun, wholesome, holiday film
","It's so tough to review a film made for kids. I'm far enough removed from my childhood that I won't necessarily enjoy all the same movies that I would have enjoyed when I was young. Unlike the Pixar films, this is one aimed straight at the kids; there is little concern given to whether the adults enjoy themselves at the same time.<br/><br/>The Polar Express tells the story of a boy who is struggling to retain his belief in Santa Clause. On Christmas Eve, a train shows up at his house on its way to the North Pole. The young boy lets his curiosity get the best of him and he boards the bus hoping to meet Santa Clause and regain his belief in all things magical. The film is based on the children's book of the same name.<br/><br/>First of all, isn't it dangerous to lead kids to believe it's OK to get onto a train with strangers? I don't care how much the engineer looks like Tom Hanks, or which Pole is the final destination, or which mythical being the child hopes to meet. We preach to kids that they shouldn't talk to strangers, and here is Robert Zemeckis reprogramming our children. Obviously I doubt this movie will really encourage kids to hop onto trains with strangers, but it was fun to mention.<br/><br/>The animation here is a mixed bag. At times it is frighteningly real, while at other times it is frighteningly creepy. The environments and animals are all stunning. The human characters are much harder to animate in a lifelike manner. A few of the kids look quite real and the emotion they are able to show through simple facial expressions is very impressive. That said, a couple of the kids are downright scary looking. As they would speak, half of me would listen to what they were saying as the other half waited for their head to spin around 360 degrees. Overall, the art definitely doesn't distract; there are far more jaw dropping moments than there are concerns over characters looking scary and stiff.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis has made a career out of opening our imaginations and reintroducing us to our inner children. He is the creative mind behind Back to the future, Roger Rabbit, and even Forest Gump. This film will feel right at home on his resume. The vivid world he creates in The Polar Express is a pleasure to explore. The train ride in particular is often spectacular as it takes us through mountains and over cliffs at an often breakneck pace. The North Pole is also a fun locale that kids are sure to love. I always enjoy movies by Robert Zemeckis (with a few exceptions) because they are original and imaginative.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is good as nearly every male voice in the film. The rest of the voice talent does a fine job, never detracting from what's going on. The problem I have with the movie is that the story isn't complex enough to warrant 110 minutes of my time. Much of the film is spent on the train encountering various obstacles that could keep the train from being on time. There are quite a few sequences that felt thrown in simply to extend the runtime of the film. These sequences are validated by the conductor's obsession with being on time. Everything seems to go wrong on the train and the audience is supposed to worry that time is running short. As it turns out, time at the North Pole is much different than time elsewhere. The train arrives 5 minutes before midnight, but the next hour of elapsed film time happens without a single minute ticking away. In fact, a big deal is made of how the time at the North Pole stopped until everyone arrived safely for Santa's appearance. If this is how time works at the magical North Pole, then why was the train in such a hurry? I'll tell you why Â– we needed an extra 40 minutes of filler to reach a nice theatrical runtime. Most kids probably won't mind the delays, but the adults in the audience will be wondering what Zemeckis is waiting for.<br/><br/>In the film, those who believe in Santa are able to hear sleigh bells while those who have lost their belief somewhere along the way can not hear the bells. I think that those who are able to hear the bells will have a great time with The Polar Express. Other, more cynical moviegoers may find that the film drags a bit at times. If you have kids, take them to see The Polar Express. It's a fun, wholesome, holiday film. If you don't have kids and you're craving some animated fun, go see the Incredibles again.<br/><br/>mastercritic.com"

","So I went to see the first showing of the Polar Express today.BUT, I shelled out the extra money to go see it in 3-D at Imax and it was amazing. I mean I almost can't even put the experience into words. Every year since I was born my mom has read me the Polar Express at Christmas. I can't even tell you how high my expectations were for this movie. I was actually scared to see it because I was so sure I was going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>I can't even describe how much I loved it. That is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen. Not only was the CGI amazing and in 3-D, omg I was actually reaching out trying to touch the falling snow. But the story was magical and heart breaking and inspiring. When the little boy stood on the back of the train singing about Christmas not working out for him I wanted to cry. When the young boy finally hears the the bell on Santa's Sleigh I actually laughed out loud. I had the biggest smile on my face the entire time. It is so rare that a movie can you make you feel so much.<br/><br/>I have been so stressed lately and I've been dealing with so many knew things. There's just so much going on. But when I was watching this movie I literally felt like a child. It was like Christams morning and going to Disneyland and all those wonderful things all at one. I forgot everything and it was just about the magic of the movie. I'm willing to admit that my connection to the movie runs much deeper because of my love for the book but I just have to say that everyone MUST see this movie at least once.

","The film is based on a short, beautifully illustrated children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The film extends the book significantly by adding characters and events that add more drama and nostalgia to the story, many new elements reminiscent of Dickens' A Christmas Carol.<br/><br/>By contrast, 2018 saw The Incredibles 2 and Wreck It Ralph 2, both heavily tainted with sexism and overtly nasty politics intended to hurt young children. How rapidly the world has deteriorated for the worse at the hands of Disney!<br/><br/>If you're looking for a meaningful children's story that stands the test of time, that isn't nasty or sexist and isn't designed to hurt children, The Polar Express is your film. However, I would warn that this film may be frightening for very young or extremely sensitive little ones. If they could watch Dickey's classic, they could comfortably watch this film.<br/><br/>If you're looking to escape the unprecedented nastiness of Disney that escalated in 2018, this is the film for you. The film is politically correct free. There is no divisiveness, no ridiculing social groups, and no sexism.

","Transparently forced Christmas ""magic"" that can't even lean on its CG visuals for support. Despite the wide variety of gaudy, jolly ghosts, elves and Christmas nicknacks flittering about the screen, this movie has no spirit, no zeal, no life. It sure goes through the motions, producing overly-familiar shapes, sounds and colors by the shovelful, but that never translates to more real emotion than the pajama section of a Sears catalog. It's mostly a one-man show, with Tom Hanks providing voices for a good ninety percent of the cast, but he's unable to work any holiday miracles with such flat source material. The wealth of bad, empty computer graphics do the film no favors, either, somehow managing to bridge the gap between hollow marionettes and the unnerving denizens of the uncanny valley.

As for the animation, most of it is excellent. I love the train stuff. But the people are still a little mannequin-like. But, after repeated viewings I hardly notice anymore.

The unusual nature of the super-realistic animation technique employed took a little getting used to for me but once we get on board the train, it's full steam ahead for thrills and heart-warming sentiment.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is just right in his main role as the genial train conductor while the late Michael Jeter in his last filmed role is effectively, if sadly ironically, cast as a helpful ghost. The detail and vivacity in the animation compensated for the too-real appearance of the characters and there's a pleasing selection of older-style Christmas songs, that is until Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler makes an unnecessary and unhelpful cameo appearance.<br/><br/>While not the most original Christmas story ever, the time-worn tale of a growing child's wavering belief in Santa Claus eroded by maturity with even the device of a magic train transporting children to a magical land having echoes of ""Harry Potter"", nevertheless I have no hesitation in naming this amongst the best Christmas movies I've yet seen. <br/><br/>In fact my only major regret watching it was that it wasn't the 3D version which I'll make a point of donning when I watch it again as one my Yuletide perennials next year!"

In fact I fear there are few good surprises left in the world (Abba won't be reuniting, Olivia Newton John will never be number one in the charts again and Showgirls 2: Cristal's Revenge is out of the question.)...so my hopes weren't that high walking into this Christmas flick in the middle of March. Boy was I wrong! I was completely transported out of my body and into this wonderful world for nearly 2 hours. I looked on with childish wonder at each set piece played out in front of me.The scene where the little girls ticket blows away was amazing especially when it goes under the train.There was a row of little kids in front of me who were waving there hands in the air trying to catch the ticket.Thank-you to all involved in making this film.

","""The Polar Express"" truly was a wonderful movie. It had a great plot, good animation, and beautiful songs. My favorite song from the movie was ""When Christmas Comes To Town"".<br/><br/>I decided to go see ""The Polar Express"" in theaters because it looked very good in previews and the animation looked very interesting.(The characters looked real!). I was also playing the songs from the movie in my band class at school. I loved the movie so much that I saw it again a week later in an Imax theater. That made the movie even better the second time. I also brought the soundtrack from the movie because I really love the songs from it.<br/><br/>Overall I give this movie 10/10 stars and suggest everyone to see it.

"warnerclassic","4","1","6","18 December 2004"," Stop the train, I want to get off.
","Christmas may come just once a year, but there are always more than one festive movie that is thrown down the great chimney pot of Hollywood every year. Of course, some Christmas movies are instant classics, like James Stuart in ""It's a Wonderful Life, to Edmund Gwenn as Kris Kringle going to court to prove there is a Santa Claus in the classic Miracle on 34th St (not the remake starring Richard Attenborough , don't get me started on that) And so that time of year is here once more, and using some nifty animation , 3D motion capture techniques (where the actor on film is changed to an animated figure), The Polar Express has pulled into town. Set in America on Christmas Eve, a boy lays awake in his bed, trying to listen for Santa Claus. When he gets out of bed, he sees his parents leaving presents for his sister, and then later, for himself. Saddened that there is no Santa, the boy goes to bed. But when he tries to fall asleep he is awakened by a vibration that signifies the arrival of a huge locomotive train outside his house. The child ventures outside and meets the conductor who tells him that the Locomotive is heading to the North Pole, and then to meet Santa Claus himself.. Unsure at first, the child gets on the train, joining other children as the train speeds to its destination. However, an icy night, a flying ticket, and a sad little boy guarantee that the journey will be anything but simple. Shown as a 2D version or a 3D version (if you are lucky enough to have an IMAX cinema near you) The Polar Express is a film that tries to catch your heart while taking your breath away at the same time, yet ironically fails due to the films own golden ticket. This being its special effects that try to recreate human actors and only manages to get the features perfect but misses out on whatever makes them tick inside. The children in the film are rather like those in Village of the Dammed (1960, directed by Wolf Rilla) , attractive, normal looking children with a light behind their eyes that flickers strangely enough to make you know they need rewiring. The voices, most of which emanate from Tom Hanks (he plays no less than 6 characters), are good but not staggered enough to avoid collision. The sequence concerning a flying ticket is a wink at Forrest Gump (flying feather), a pattern that was followed in the other Hanks film Catch Me If You Can with a floating dollar bill. The plot travels like the locomotive at a quick pace, with the story taking some twists and turns that give rise to some good lines, most notably from The Train Conductor, a man who is always on track to meet his deadline. The characters, a sad white child and a heroic black girl, all play their parts well which leads the story forward, and there is even an obligatory annoying 'know it all' kid (imaginatively entitled ""Know it All"" in the credits) who asks all the annoying question that the viewer would given half a chance. Voiced by Eddie Deezen, he has long been a hero of mine due to the nerdy roles he has played to perfection. If you want to know what ""Know it all Kid"" will look like when he grows up, check out WarGames, where Deezen plays Malvin, a computer nerd giving Matthew Broderick advice when he almost starts World War Three. The Polar Express is a nice film for the family at Christmas, but it may have left its heart at the platform."

Not much. A happens, then B happens, then C happens, and so on. Their on a train, then there's a ticket, then a guy on the top of the train, then caribou, then the carriage comes off, then they're in a factory, then this, then that. <br/><br/>The message:
Believe

In what? Santa? He's been on a magic train that skates on ice, with a weird disappearing man who doesn't do anything but sit there and disappear seemingly at will, and we're supposed to think that he doesn't believe in SANTA?! What?! I'd believe in anything at that point. 
Then there's a bell. Then they go home.<br/><br/>But it's a kid's movie. Why complain? Of the tiresome sequence of events, none of them are fun; they are mostly about going really fast. (This movie is really about people going fast, because that looks good in 3D, apparently).

The town is like some depressing little English industrial burb with lots of strict rules and short-tempered workers; it's like having Christmastime at a brick-making factory. The children characters are annoying, especially the kid with the glasses. Not to worry, the film is overlaid with jolly old muted colors where blue becomes gray, bright red becomes maroon, and Santa himself is seen through the darkest sunglasses you've ever worn.

That did wonders for the roller- coaster camera effects, but on the small screen, it's apparent that that coaster ride is the frame on which the movie hangs.

And the schmaltzy ""message"" heaped on top of the event film that this was engineered to be just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>And in the interest of admitting personal bias, the songs are what really drag this movie down for me. I'm not a musical guy, so they were tolerable back in '04. The bad news is that they've tended toward the grating in the ensuing years. <br/><br/>The good news is that Hanks still shines. Let's not kid ourselves, he carries this movie, playing most of the main characters and lending the film its heart and soul. <br/><br/>But Ebert was wrong when he said this is destined to become a holiday classic.

","Unlike Robert Zemeckis's subsequent Christmas-theme film, ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""The Polar Express"" relies rather more heavily on shine and dazzle than on substance to get itself across to its audience. The message is as functional and useless as ever invaded the genre: little boys and little girls must ""BELIEVE"" for Christmas to be real. Of course, in life, one would be loath to hear this sort of prescription to happily accept matters without any evidence, but, in the realm of children's holiday fantasy, the MacGuffin adequately propels its hero and his companions across an attractice world of snow-laden excitement.<br/><br/>Accordingly, I'm sure a good bit of the appeal of watching ""Polar Express"" is lost in translation from 3-D-enabled movie theaters to thirty-inch television screens running a D.V.D. of the picture. Indeed, much of the merriment â€” involving high-speed roller-coasters, dizzying air-rides, and treacherous frozen lakes â€” obviously were conceived with 3-D technology in mind, and watching them via traditional means, one is oddly more aware of what one's missing than enthusiastic about what one is seeing.<br/><br/>Altogether, ""The Polar Express"" does satisfactory work of filling the ever-increasing library of American Christmas cinema. It's mostly an empty candy cane with lots of glitter plastered on top, but there are much worse ways to kill an hour and a half in December."

Especially these days with the advance in computer generated effects. There used to be a time when clay-mation was the rage, and how realistic was that? How about considering the message - I for one would be darned upset if there was no more magic left in the world. It's evident every time my little two year old granddaughter runs in the room and tells her gaga (that would be me), to 'sit' so we could play or watch a movie like this together. This one got around to showing 'Santy', and you have to marvel when a mere child sits enthralled by the spectacle of color and motion the way it's presented here. For a while during my adult life, there was probably a time when I didn't hear that bell, but as I get older the sound is coming back, even as my hearing diminishes.

I figured it was going to be one of those films that you cherish as the years go on. The story is pretty simple but for a holiday movie it's to be expected. The film starts out with a boy who doesn't believe in Santa and the magic behind Christmas. As he lays his head down, only heard by him, a huge, magical locomotive comes down his street. He decides to climb onto the train(for if he didn't there'd be no movie, it's like in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, if Brad and Janet hadn't gone through those gates, there would have been no movie) and we are sure glad he does. It is on the train he befriends an optimistic little girl and Billy(a kid who comes from the lower class side of town) who help our hero on his journey. When they finally reach the North Pole, our hero is determined to see if Santa Claus is real. When he finally does meet Santa, it is at that point does he truly believe in Christmas. The film has a great message: in order to believe in something, you don't need proof, you just have to look inside your heart . As the years pass, I know this film will become a classic. What's a plus is that ever since it's release, IMAX has been showing the film in different cities. Here's hoping they will continue the tradition. Either way, I always make a point to watch this movie every year and every year I am reminded that the holiday is magical and that there are people like Hero Boy. Do you believe....?"

","I read a review by another IMDb user who compared the look of the film to illustrations in old children's books, the ones that, for certain generations, bring back warm and much- cherished memories, and while The Polar Express didn't exactly knock my socks off like I expected it would, this is exactly what it looks like, and that kind of aesthetic appeal can go a long way. <br/><br/>The story involves an urgent Christmas time emergency. A young boy lies quietly in his bed on Christmas Eve, as the story begins, and pores over doubts in his mind about the existence of Santa Claus. Enter The Polar Express, a magical train designed for just such an emergency. The conductor, in the film's defining moment, calmly urges the astonished boy, ""I think you should get on the train."" <br/><br/>There are definite roller coaster moments which, for all of the movie's thematic cleverness, remind us periodically that this is meant to be a good ride, thrilling us with the stomach- turning train travel as much as with the brilliant animation and entirely new form of acting. <br/><br/>This new kind of acting and animation is done through something that I believe is called performance capture, where the actors really act out the scenes that they are in, and using a gigantic number of sensors placed over the actor's face and body, the performance is then entered into the computer, and Tom Hanks can be turned into a whole host of characters in the same movie. I believe he plays five parts in this movie.<br/><br/>What I love about the movie is that it doesn't give us a sugary confection when we get to the North Pole. Santa is not jolly old St. Nick here, he's a businessman with a lot of employees. Tiny employees, but also not cute little elves either. Even the reindeer look like real animals, that grunt and snort and, gasp, may even have bodily functions!<br/><br/>There were some points where I felt that the character of the conductor was a little too abrasive, even mean. I appreciate that the movie doesn't shoot for your traditional Christmas movie, opting instead to add some excitement and even be a little scary, but at some times the effort to do this became a little transparent and we get something where the conductor just comes off as a jerk.<br/><br/>Then again, I should mention that it is ironically because of things like this that the movie is so watchable, and re-watchable. I've heard some people worry about what this new method of capturing performances will mean in the future (I know that some people are, for some reason, worried that actors will some day literally be able to ""phone-in"" their performances), although that doesn't exactly strike me as a valid concern. It seems like an addition to the art, rather than a corruption. Either way, it's a pretty exciting ride!"

With the mystery of what awaits him at the back of his mind, the boy and his new friends get into a series of adventures on the rails.<br/><br/>This is a family film designed to be watched at Christmas in front of a warm fire with a family including young children. Some reviews have forgotten this and have made a big deal out of the weaknesses inherent in it. The fact that the animation was so cutting edge seemed to also suggest that perhaps these weaknesses were because the majority of work was put on the computers and not the writers but personally I do not believe this is the case. Lets be honest though, the plot is a simple one where a boy goes to the north pole to meet Santa (maybe), that is essentially it. On the way there are several train-based adventures and lessons learned.<br/><br/>It is quite fun though and I enjoyed the sense of wonder and adventure that it produced. OK I'm not going to watch it with a group of my peers on a Friday night but that is not the point. The simple story fills the running time really well with the journey structured around mini-adventures to good effect. The message is a little bit sentimental but again it comes with the territory I suppose. The animation is impressive though. I think the claims that real actors will be redundant within years is nonsense but then nobody really thinks this will happen  it is just a way to get publicity through headlines. What it does do though is shore up the wonder by producing some great sequences and shots that would not be possible without computer technology. The cast is mostly solid although this is the same as saying that Hanks is good since he does most of the voices but Gaye was pretty good as well.<br/><br/>Overall then an enjoyable little fantasy that delivers a sense of wonder across the story and animation. OK it is probably only going to work while on the home turf of Christmas but this is what it is for and I didn't have a problem with it working just as it proposes to work."

","""The Polar Express"" is a great accomplishment for Castle Rock and the Warner Bros. The animation and detail is incredible, the sound is perfect, and all the characters are realistic and believable (excepting, of course, Santa himself). My favorite character was the Hobo on the roof of the train - he was very funny and strange, and Tom Hanks was perfect for his voice. The soundtrack is beautiful and fits the story very well.<br/><br/>As for the plot - Sure, they added a few characters and events to make it a better movie, but it really adds to the quality. The book is a classic, and this film honors it rather than ravaging it.<br/><br/>The only reason I give it 9/10 rather than 10/10, is the know-it-all boy on the train. Everything about him is irritating, especially his voice, which sounds like it came out of South Park (one of the worst TV shows ever made), and doesn't even remotely sound like a child. And the worst part about him: he just won't shut up.<br/><br/>Other than that, this movie is absolutely fantastic!! I recommend it to everyone."

","This movie would scare young children and be viewed as lame and boring to older ones. So, I have to assume the audience for this is adults. It's a rather dark Christmas film which, as others have pointed out, seems to emphasize the belief in getting gifts as the main point of Christmas. All the characters never come across as happy (maybe they're tired after being awakened for a late night train ride), except the main character's sister the next (Christmas) morning. The best developed characters (and best animated ones), the hobo and the conductor, seem to play little role in the main plot line of the film ... particularly the conclusion. The main child characters are poorly animated and uninspired.<br/><br/>So, what's left? The scenery is gorgeous, the train ride is exciting, the North Pole is clever, the conductor and hobo characters are well developed and engaging ... unfortunately that leaves us with great background scenery in a movie with a weak plot line and uninspired main characters. I doubt the book suffers from these same issues, and maybe if you've read the book, the weak main characters would not be as obvious. With so many good, fun Christmas films out there, I can't recommend this one."
"slymusic","Null","0","3","16 June 2007"," ""One thing about trains: It doesn't matter where they're going. What matters is deciding to get on.""
","Directed by the great Robert Zemeckis, with an outstanding music score by Alan Silvestri, ""The Polar Express"" is a superbly enchanting motion picture for the Christmas season. Featuring its own unique brand of ""live performance"" animation, this movie boasts an excellent screenplay that is filled with excitement, warmth, and good humor. (If you have not yet seen ""The Polar Express,"" please DO NOT read any further.) The main character, played by Tom Hanks and voiced by Daryl Sabara, is a little boy (known as ""Hero Boy"" in the credits) who, on Christmas Eve night, is invited to join a large group of other children passengers for a ride on the Polar Express train. Destination: the North Pole! Over the course of this exciting (and sometimes PERILOUS) train ride, the Hero Boy befriends a pretty African-American girl (""Hero Girl,"" played by Nona Gaye) and a poor, shy, lonely boy named Billy (played by Peter Scolari and voiced by Jimmy Bennett), who claims that Christmas has never been a happy time for him. Together, the Hero Boy and Hero Girl help Billy to understand the joy of Christmastime, all the while the Hero Boy finally learns to permanently put aside his own doubts about Santa Claus.<br/><br/>My two favorite characters in ""The Polar Express"" are the Hero Girl and the train conductor. The girl is such a sweet, lovable young lady with a joyful, generous spirit. She particularly has a deep affection for Billy and truly wants him to have a wonderful Christmas. The conductor (marvelously played by Tom Hanks) is also someone I consider highly admirable, particularly in his interactions with the Hero Boy & Girl. True, the conductor may need to be a stern disciplinarian at times, but I never have any doubts about his warm heart. This is a man who truly cares about all the children passengers and their safety on the trip.<br/><br/>And now, here are my favorite highlights from this very charming movie. The lively song ""Hot Chocolate,"" sung by the conductor, accompanies a group of waiters & chefs performing some of the most unbelievable acrobatics as they serve hot chocolate (without spilling one drop!) to all of the passengers; even the conductor gets to join in on the acrobatic fun! The Hero Girl's train ticket does some rather extensive travelling all by itself; after flying out the passenger car window, the ticket flies in the air, lands on the snow-covered ground, flies again with a pack of running wolves, gets snatched by an eagle, gets spit out by a baby eagle, lands on the ground where it becomes a giant snowball, flies underneath the locomotive, and winds up back inside the same passenger car! Terrible danger strikes the Polar Express train as it travels at uncontrollably high speeds up and down what is, in effect, a very steep roller coaster, with the conductor and the Hero Boy & Girl at the very front of the locomotive! A little later, the train swerves and slides dangerously across a massive glacier that has completely frozen over the train tracks! My absolute favorite scene in the entire picture, and one that never fails to bring a little tear to my eye, is that of Billy and the Hero Girl together singing ""When Christmas Comes to Town."" Shortly after that, we hear a children's chorus singing the lively ""Polar Express"" theme as the train merrily chugs along; the conductor becomes a little teary-eyed when the train arrives at the North Pole with five minutes to spare! For a light touch of humor, as the Hero Boy, Hero Girl, and Billy explore the town where Santa's elves live & work, the threesome becomes aware of a few Christmas phonograph records that keep skipping. When the Hero Boy meets Santa Claus (again played by Tom Hanks), Santa tells him that although a sleigh bell is an important symbol of the spirit of Christmas, the TRUE spirit of Christmas exists in the boy's heart. And for one more little humorous touch, several instruments in the elves' rock-and-roll band require two or more elves to play each of them.<br/><br/>""The Polar Express"" is a magical movie full of joy and delight for the Christmas season. The Hero Boy ultimately learns that all people who truly believe in Santa Claus will hear the ringing of the symbolic sleigh bell."
"Boba_Fett1138","5","0","5","19 April 2006"," Not entertaining enough and the movie lacks a real point.
","For a Christmas movie- and a children movie in particular, this movie is really lacking in entertainment and likability.<br/><br/>It's very simple to say why this movie is not entertaining enough. It's too artificial. Sure, the computer effects are beautiful looking and it's a really big achievement but it makes the movie also very artificial looking and therefor the movie has absolutely no magic feeling in it at all. Because of that very same reason, the characters are too shallow and the story itself is not involving or entertaining enough. I really don't understand why this movie had to be made entirely with the computer. The movie totally lacks human emotions because of this and the whole 'magical' feeling feels forced and fake.<br/><br/>To be frank, I just don't see how this movie is much good as a children's movie. There is nothing to enjoy in this movie for the kids. There aren't really many jokes present and the characters that are in the movie are not really likable or easy to relate with for the kids. They even have no names. The story also has little entertainment value because it's not consistent enough and the events in the movie are just only highly unlikely and are not made to look believable at all. And in general, the movie is more creepy and dark looking than cheerful and happy. What an odd choice for a children Christmas movie. The movie relies too much on its 'magic' feeling...a feeling that is not present in the movie at all. Therefor ""The Polar Express"" is nothing more than a beautiful looking failure.<br/><br/>The story is extremely simple and is told way too weak in the movie. Basically the story is one unlikely and even odd event after the other without them making an obvious connection. I'm also still puzzling what the message of this movie exactly was. I'm pretty sure of it that it's; Believe in Christmas. But it is never explained in the movie why. Other Christmas movies with these kind of messages also have a morale and explain why it's so beautiful to believe in Christmas and how it makes the world a better place. Not in this movie. The message of the movie is basically muddled in the effects and visual look of the movie. It also helps to make the movie a very forgettable one.<br/><br/>And really, did Tom Hanks had to play basically every male character in the movie? I really like Tom Hanks as an actor but to be honest he is not good enough as a voice actor, in terms of putting diversity and character into the different characters through his voice. Every character he plays sounds the same and maybe because of that the movie also gets too distracting and for some confusing to watch.<br/><br/>All of the characters in particular also aren't much special. Most of them are totally obsolete and some of the characters are also highly peculiar portrayed in the movie. For instance all of the elves aren't nice at all in the movie and they didn't exactly made a friendly impression on me. They were even a bit villainous. The way Santa Claus is presented in the movie is also totally wrong. In the movie they made him look like a sort of tribe leader that is treated as a king and is worshiped by all as if he is some sort of God. He is not a friendly, cuddly, cheerful guy at all in this movie.<br/><br/>The musical score by Alan Silvestri also got highly annoying after a while. Basically it's the same 'magical' main theme being played over and over again.<br/><br/>The motion capture techniques work out pretty good in the movie and also the animations themselves are really good looking most of the time. There also is some good action, so obviously the movie still has some good things to enjoy. It's of course far from the worst movie ever but also far from the most entertaining one. More was to be expected from a director like Robert Zemeckis, who before this gave us entertaining movies like ""Romancing the Stone"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and the Back to the Future trilogy.<br/><br/>OK maybe it's because I'm European that I don't like this movie. I mean, the whole magical feeling around Christmas and the whole Christmas spirit is not really a that big thing here. So perhaps if you're American you can still appreciate some of the elements handled in the movie, although I stick to my opinion that it's still lacking in entertainment- and a real good point.<br/><br/>A failure of a movie that is from a technical point of view is interesting and good looking.<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","So, there was this popular book, ""The Polar Express"", and a group of wealthy and famous actors, writers, and directors decided to make it into a movie. But how do you translate the magic of the book into a magical movie? You use cutting edge technology, along with very versatile actors.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays 4 or 5 different roles, from a small child to a parent and a hobo, to Santa himself. Yes, his voice is different for each, but that's the easy part. They used a technology with large numbers of sensors around important facial areas, hands, arms, legs, and torso to later generate computer animation. So the animation looks very real, while the characters are obviously not real. Adults are used to model children, but the result is the form of a child. Great things, these computers are. I wonder what we did before we had them? Maybe draw each cell by hand??? <br/><br/>The DVD has a beautiful presentation of the movie, with superb surround sound. The train sounds like a real train, if you have a good subwoofer in the system.<br/><br/>The whole story is about believing. When the train gets to the North Pole, just a few minutes before Christmas, we see Santa's workshop is more like an industrial city, big enough to make all those gifts for kids around the world, with not a few, but thousands of elves. I liked the celebration that occurred, when the very large bag was loaded onto the sleigh, and Santa exited through large doors into the courtyard where everyone waited for him, cheering and dancing as they celebrated another successful preparation."

","Here's the problem with many feature length kid's films - they take up 90 minutes or so when they only have at best an hour's worth of material (see Finding Nemo). But instead of resulting in filler material, here the problem infects the entire movie, with everything that happens dragged out to an absurd degree. I mean, really, how many times can we see kids reaching for something fluttering maddeningly just out of reach? And how many times can we see something waft unpredictably for two or three minutes before lighting just where it should be? During editing didn't anyone say, hey, we already did that twice? I have to admit, I didn't hang around to the end (the Hanks character was bizarre and the North Pole looked pretty strange to me). My 4 year old who loves both trains and Christmas had checked out long ago. For once he had better judgment than me."

","Aside from occasionally choking on moments of excessive sentimentality, I found this movie a glorious, enrapturing, imaginative, goose-bump-provoking experience. Simply the ride on the splendid train, with the astonishingly-faithful rendition of the glories of a large steam locomotive, and a brightly-lit passenger train flying through the night, would have been worth the time and the ticket price. But then there was Tom Hanks the slightly prudish but paternal conductor, Tom Hanks the world's most classic King of the Road, able to feast upon the freedom provided by computer animation; Tom Hanks the Santa Claus with dignity palpable without even seeing his face. Moments of the acme of zaniness, imaginativeness and humor, such as the crazy scene on the lake, or the nutty exchange that clears the caribou. The reindeer, and the departure of the sleigh from the North Pole, was more dramatic than anything I had ever imagined during my days of believing in Santa Claus. Let those who sniff at the plot or the roller-coaster rides go get lives - and then come back and enjoy this richly delightful holiday film."
"Sinnerman","Null","0","3","5 January 2005"," Of Condoleeza Rice and very short men...
","Saw The Polar Express a few weeks back. Below some rambling thoughts then.<br/><br/>The Santa in this flick had a magnetic glow about him. He reminded me of Hitler. The elves resembled his mind controlled sex slaves. The way these red coloured minions assembled in a square, pregnant in anticipation of the old man's coming, is very touching. I sat riveted in my seat, completely spellbound by the most arousing rendition of ""Santa Claus is coming to town"" ever. So when Santa's well endowed figure sauntered into view, when he made his momentous entry, I experienced a near orgasmic euphoria. This is especially so after the pleasure delaying 5 minutes to midnight, which were suspended for like three hours (I did not bring my watch). Why couldn't Santa come any sooner? What's with the time paradox plaguing our desire for immediate gratification (to bask in Santa's presence that is). Guess he does work in mysterious ways then.<br/><br/>If you asked me, The Polar Express should also have been re-configured for screening into those literally ""rollercoaster"" theatres found in theme parks. Would have had oodles of fun letting my spine get severed by those rocky jerky seats. I BELIEVE I can take the pain, since my eyes were already cocked by its wildly dizzying visuals. And guess what, I think people who read deep into this flick might be on to something too. I hope someone can psychoanalyse on what motivates the millions of height-challenged ugly people and their fascination with red costumes. And why the insect-like, collective fixation with an old and overweight white man, also dressed in red? Does size really matter? Is red the new black? So many questions, so little time. Where is Carl Jung when we need him? <br/><br/>OK, besides psychoanalysis, I shall attempt to tread on an even trickier issue brought up by this movie - faith. Awww, faith....this Bob Zemeckis, his film sensibilities certainly appeals to the agnostic in me. Nice.<br/><br/>Notice how the boy with those lifeless eyes never truly utter the word ""believe"" (in the ""expected"" context of the word anyway) to anyone; not to Hitler, not to sour mopey wrong-side-of-the-tracks boy, not to OTT train man masquerading as Tom Hanks, not even the future Condoleezza Rice! You know, that fiercely determined black girl who's always touching and hugging boys that half second longer than is comfortable? But I digress. Instead, the boy imbued the true spirit of the word (believe) into an inanimate object, a bell. What could this mean? Does it mean more by not saying out loud the one word which ""Neo"" espouses? Is it enough to embrace faith, ideas and all such pontificating concepts within your internal shrine? Tricky questions indeed, and not recommended for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>With all said and done, I have only one man to thank, Bob, for he has yet again celebrated the wonders of indecision. He may not have succeeded in soliciting that connection I got from Forrest Gump or Contact with the Polar Express, but at least he is consistent. Thank you Mr Zemeckis. Know that I was on your ""train"" long before this meandering thrill ride. Hopefully, you will graciously offer me that cabin top coffee strained from (thoroughly washed) socks. Can't wait for your next picture. Surprise me! <br/><br/>P.S. I'm seeing my ear doctor tomorrow. I can't hear them sleigh bells ringing' either. I need help."
"Victor Field","6","0","2","27 December 2004"," It might have been better as a TV special.
","Robert Zemeckis is one of the few filmmakers, along with Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton, whose movies I make a point of seeing - and though his efforts as a producer have been weak (""The Public Eye,"" ""The Frighteners""), he's never directed a movie I hated, although he came really close with ""Death Becomes Her."" ""The Polar Express"" doesn't sink to that level, but it's still something of a misfire.<br/><br/>It's not the animation that's a problem - for all the complaints others have made about how creepy the characters are, the only one who truly qualifies is Hero Girl (imagine Queen Latifah if she was a dwarf), and this movie is the kind that could probably only be done with some kind of extraordinary animation... for the genuinely unnerving kind, see ""The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb."" The trouble is that Zemeckis and co-writer William Broyles Jr. have taken a source that by all accounts (I haven't read the Chris Van Allsburg book) is a quite simple story and blown it up without adding much of any real help; a boy who's not too full of the Christmas spirit is picked up by the Polar Express to go to the North Pole to get it first hand - sounds like it should be full of wonder and emotion. But for some reason it isn't.<br/><br/>A lot of the time the movie's pretty cold for reasons beyond it being snow-driven; the characters don't get much to build them (unusual for a director who often fills his movies with so much warmth and appealing characters), and some moments that should be show-stoppers like the ""Hot Chocolate"" number somehow fall flat. While the movie does get better as it goes along and it's certainly impressive to look at (and some of the vocal performances are fine, especially Tom Hanks and the late Michael Jeter - to whom the movie's dedicated), ""The Polar Express"" may have been better served by being a half-hour TV special; ""The Snowman"" and ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" didn't need 90 minutes to tell their stories well, and they're still on TV 20 and 40 years after their first airings.<br/><br/>And in spite of the movie's attempts to make the Josh Groban song its main musical element, for my money it's the title track that's the real standout song; it's not only good to listen to, but also brings back pleasant memories of the old Rankin/Bass specials, which have tons of genuine Christmas feeling and are also fun. Something that ""The Polar Express,"" for all its good points, ultimately doesn't qualify as - but there have been far, far worse Christmas movies over the past 10 years (""Jingle All The Way"" and the remake of ""Miracle On 34th Street"" come to mind). I don't regret seeing this, but where's Frosty the Snowman when you need him?"

","Going to see The Polar Express might be a nice way to escape any holiday blues you could be suffering from. If you don't go to movies much, you will be amazed at how far computer animation has progressed. During a good portion of the movie, I sat mesmerized by all the life like snow, animals, machinery and, of course, characters, all of whom, except Santa himself, appeared as one would expect for a movie of this genre. Otherwise, expect a rather weak story with predictable dialogue and a pretty heavy dose of morality thrown in just in case you were contemplating being a bad boy or girl this season.<br/><br/>A trip to the north pole, heh? Substitute ""Oz"" for ""the North Pole"" , and ""The Wizard"" for ""Santa"" and what have you got? No, on second thoughts, don't even try to compare this movie to the Wizard of Oz, which was far more entertaining in every respect - story line, character development, music and last but not least -drama/suspense. (Yes, anyone who has reservations about taking their 4 year old to see ""The Polar Express"" should remember how scary the Wizard of Oz was.). Anyway, I was amused when the train got to the North Pole to hear music that sounded suspiciously like the music that plays when Dorothy first arrives in Oz. Look closely and you will find many other parallels, especially towards the end of the movie. But despite the breakneck animation and train misadventures through snow and ice, Dorothy's journey down the yellow brick road was far more harrowing. All of this was made possibly by Dorothy's misdeed - killing the Wicked Witch of the East, which hung a death sentence around her neck.<br/><br/>No death sentence hung around the neck of our hero in ""The Polar Express"", though, who's only crime was not believing. And he was just one of many - who knows why the other kids were on board. I guess to me thats were the story line kind of faltered, in that it gave insufficient cause for these kids to be getting bused to the North Pole in the first place. Without that, all of the misadventures and morality lessons they encountered along the way seemed a bit contrived. <br/><br/>Which is not to say I didn't enjoy the movie. I did, but my expectations have been lowered substantially over the years. What I regret most of all in movies these days is the way that gimmicks and high tech action have replaced real suspense and drama that develops naturally from the story line itself. I was happy not to see sea monsters snapping at the train in ""The Polar Express"", so I should give the director some credit for showing restraint there. Still, the movie in my opinion needed a convincing story outside of the dream - one to lend urgency to the train ride and likewise make the return home more meaningful. With that, I would have given it two thumbs up."

This movie and the animation has a haunting, magical wondrous quality, the stuff of dreams. Even the music is memorably haunting. At least two of the original compositions, the Josh Groban-sung tune and ""When Christmas Comes to Town"" are as good if not better than any of those overplayed Christmas classics you hear on the radio during the Xmas season. Yes, sections of the film are on the dark side and, based on some of the other reviews, has scared a few young viewers. But this ""dark aspect"" is true of all family classics, such as The Wizard of Oz, the Disney animated films, i.e. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, etc.<br/><br/>Like life itself, classic literature and film chooses not to be all fluff and happiness. And like life itself, the darkness is necessary to ultimately support the overriding positive themes. The Polar Express' powerful, overwhelming sense of wonder forces adults to recognize what they have sorrily missed since childhood. Children will be left awe-struck, their imagination left stretched to unlimited bounds. The message of the film: the importance of retaining throughout our lives the hope, belief and optimism once sensed at childhood -- even after it all has worn away upon having moved into cynical adulthood --hauntingly lingers long after leaving the theater. These kinds of powerful impressions can only be accomplished by the greatest of movies. To add to the magic, see, as I did, the IMAX version."

","I went into The polar Express with some doubts I really wanted to go see Christmas with the Kranks but ended up going to this one. While I did on the whole enjoy the film I felt in a way I have seen it all before The sentimental lala the the Santa Claus is real thing. After leaving i felt like i have seen this all before. I think that we have enough sweet Christmas movies like It's A Wonderful Life and miracle on 34th street. The film makes up for its recycled script by amazing computer graphics and the amazing talents of Tom Hanks. I really truly believe Hollywood should just stick to Christmas comedies like jingle All The Way and Elf and stop the sentimental stuff"

","What a wonderful film! Having seen this in all it's IMAX 3-D glory, it is hard to imagine how this film would play out in plain ol'2-D. I assume that most everybody know the story: kid is just at that age where he's pretty sure Santa is an elaborate deception, yet his little sister and presumably some of his friends haven't yet stopped believing. Kid spends Christmas Eve on a magical train and encounters all sorts of characters and experiences which ultimately reaffirm the power of friendship, innocence, and faith.<br/><br/>Now you've seen these themes explored before: Miracle on 34th St, A Christmas Carol, even E.T. However, The Polar Express manages to approach its subject with so much energy, freshness, and wide-eye fascination, that you will find yourself wishing you were eight years old again, climbing aboard that powerful locomotive along with Hero Boy, if only for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>A word or two about the animation. It is truly amazing, creating an almost dream-like quality that, will have you examining every aspect of a scene: the reflections on the windows in the passenger cars, the steamy breath of a young boy waiting in the snow, the brown bubbling of a mug of hot chocolate, etc. This effect is unlike anything that I've seen, and in it's own way rivals the painstaking composition and attention to visual detail you'll find in a Franco Zeffirelli production (or in a more whimsical fashion, Fellini!) <br/><br/>This film is not doing well commercially. Partly it is due to production costs, partly because of poor marketing decisions. Perhaps it is also because the film lacks the ambiguity, relativism, and ""edginess"" that seem so prevalent in popular entertainment. In the IMAX theatre that this film was playing, the performances have been consistently sold out. The audience consisted of parents and their young (five to eleven-ish) children, teenagers, and aging baby boomers, like yours truly. I was expecting the worst experience: crying toddlers, wisecracking teens, and bored, restless adults. I was shocked at what I experienced. Although the crowd was a bit skeptical at first, within 20minutes the audience became completely captivated by the film and I swear there were tears on not a few cheeks by the time the credits were rolling.<br/><br/>So do yourself and somebody you love a favor and take them to see The Polar Express (IMAX 3-D!!!). You will believe again."

","My biggest and most harsh criticism is with having Tom Hanks play so many parts. He is without a doubt talented, however he has an unmistakable voice and having the dad, the hobo and the child all with basically the same voice ... you see where I'm going don't you? Also grown ups, no matter who childlike THEY think they are, they are not children! The two main children, a little boy and a little girl. especially the little girl, their facial expressions are just NOT childlike. It may be easier to work with adults, it may save costs, etc., but sorry, there is no recapturing innocents. It was so apparent that all the children, with the exception of the last child on board, that the actors were adults trying to recapture their youth. I do wonder how this generation of children will accept the original book now that it has been altered... and come on, why such a stiff SANTA? Where was his happy loving face and warm disposition?

The one I liked the best was that a single Silver Bell would have such a great meaning. The spirit of Christmas the way it was long ago is lost today. All we can think about is how much can we spend. How many gifts will I get. That's not what Christmas is. It's helping people a little worse off than you. The feeling you get from that is a gift alone. You saw in the movie a boy who had nothing and when he received his first gift for Christmas he was so excited. It was just one gift, but it would bring him so much joy. The little girl who wanted to help everyone showed what Christmas is, giving of yourself for others. Then there was the Boy who only asked for a Silver Bell for his Christmas gift. The sound of that bell brought joy to him. Even the boy who wanted everything had his eyes opened to what Christmas really is. Be thankful for what you have and help a friend in need.

","Many of us look fondly back on the holiday evenings when the CBS Special Presentation logo would spin and then reveal such puppetoon classics as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer or Santa Claus is Coming to Town.<br/><br/>Yet, all the bad reviews for The Polar Express state how poor the animation is. How the eyes don't look quite right. That the North Pole looks like a fascist regime. Yet, we can't remember how the Munchkins or the Oompa Loompas acted around their guardians. Did the eyes in our puppetoon favorites look real? Did any of our favorite Christmas specials ever have tons of characterization?<br/><br/>The Polar Express is a sterling movie. The 1940's/Victorian feel gives it what I call ""creepy warmth."" The Hobo on top of the train. The industrial city that is the North Pole with the 30's/40's scratchy Christmas music playing through the loudspeakers. All this gives the movie an unsettling atmosphere that is comforting, yet at the same time, makes you shiver. This is the atmosphere of Charles Dickens and Norman Rockwell.<br/><br/>I was amazed at how much I was touched by the messages in The Polar Express.<br/><br/>These messages were obviously lost on the cynics panning it.<br/><br/>As I sat there watching the picture book coming to life, I put it in the perspective of the holiday specials I enjoyed as a kid.

It may not be real enough, but by the time it is, most of us would be dead. This is something I've learned to look past and enjoyed the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>The IMAX 3D was breathtaking! Watching on a regular screen wouldn't do it any justice. I've seen it twice with a sold out crowd, and there were many oohs and aahs, and innocent giggles throughout the film.

","Get ready for the Holiday season. I've seen this week's movie twice now and it hasn't even come out in theaters. The second Christmas movie to come out this year, after the poorly marketed Ben Affleck movie 'Surviving Christmas,' that came out in October, is the third collaboration between Director Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks; Polar Express. Polar Express is the new animated movie inspired by the book of the same name written by popular children's author, Chris Van Allsburg, the man who also brought us Jumanji.<br/><br/>Polar Express tells the story of a young boy who's struggling in his belief of the big man upstairs. By upstairs, of course, I mean up north, and by the big man, I mean, of course, Santa Clause. On Christmas Eve, this young boy lays awake in his bed, pondering the question of his existence hoping to hear the jingle of his sleigh. He soon hears a noise, not of sleigh bells, but of a train whistle; the Polar Express. After meeting the train's conductor, played by Tom Hanks, the boy goes on an adventure of a lifetime to meet Santa along with several other great characters.<br/><br/>Polar Express is a superb, innovated animated film. They use the technology used for sports video games, attaching sensors to the actors' body to capture their facial features and body movements, making the animated characters look like the actual actor. Now, I, personally, have been getting sick of this computer animated movie fad. However, this movie is completely different from any other animated film. The feel of the entire film is as though it's live action. The animation in this film perfectly captures the soul behind the story and illustrations of author Chris Van Allsburg.<br/><br/>It's safe to say that the acting in this movie is very well done. I know, its weird to say that regarding an animated film, but it actually is acting.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks does a fantastic job lending his voice to, and becoming the character of not just one, but five different characters. I won't ruin the surprise as to the different characters that he plays, because I found it fun trying to figure out which characters are, in fact, Tom Hanks. However, his acting for each character is unique and rather flawless. Look out, also for a cameo by an animated Steven Tyler, lead singer of Aerosmith, as he puts on his daughter's shoes and becomes and elf. The children characters are beautifully created and, while watching, you're really able to remember what it was like to be a child having these grand feeling for the holiday season. <br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis, director of other Tom Hanks films, Forrest Gump and Cast Away, does a fantastic job at turning the popular children's book into a fun, inspiring movie. It is beautiful to see his vision come to life in this movie. The film is animated with gorgeous scenery and awe-inspiring shots. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in recent films. It is simply beautiful. Zemeckis is able to capture the spirit of the holiday with wonderful vigor. He takes us into the mind and heart of the child and recaptures what if felt like to be a child and have such wonderful excitement about Christmas. <br/><br/>Polar Express is an adventure ride that not only keeps the heart in suspense, but warms it as well. At its heart, Polar Express is a film about believing, as the conductor says, 'Sometimes the most real things in this world are the things we can't see.' This film is beautiful as it warms the heart and inspires us to return to our childhood attitude toward the upcoming season. It truly is a beautiful film, and is one of the best Christmas movies ever made. And, it certainly gets my nod for best animated feature of the year come Oscar season. I can only wonder if Tom and his wife, Rita, are going to argue about who has the better Holiday movie; her Jingle All the Way or his Polar Express. While I love Rita Wilson and the Governator's Jingle All the Way, my vote goes to you, Tom. Please, I beg of you, see Polar Express. It will certainly inspire all who watch it whether you are the youngest of children or oldest of adults. Coming to theaters and to special 3-D Imax theaters this Wednesday, Polar Express gets all 5 bright Christmas stars and three Christmas season 'Ho Ho Ho's!'"

","Mother and I have now seen the preview for this movie, and I just have to ask, IS EVERYONE BLIND?!!! TOM HANKS LOOKS AWFUL!!! Dead staring eyes? Skin like a tailor's dummy? Jerky uncoordinated movements? Are these signs of good health where he comes from? They certainly aren't down our way. Gone is the physical and energetic chameleon who won our hearts with Bonfire of the Vanities, where he played Sherman McCoy opposite that blonde woman whose breasts GREW BIGGER as the story progressed (it can happen btw). Now, though, he's but a shadow of his former self. Is this one of those big public secrets - like Michael Jackson or George Bush - that everyone knows about but no one mentions? HE IS OBVIOUSLY VERY, VERY ILL!!! We sensed something was wrong when we heard his attempts at speech in 'The Ladykillers' and thought things had gone from bad to worse when 'The Airport Lounge' came out. Mother said he was on the way out then('obvious irreparable brain damage' were her exact words) but he seemed fine afterwards in interviews - dribbled a bit, but he's at that age - so we thought he was on the mend. Thinking back, though, everyone was always very, very nice to him, as you are with someone who's been ill or is a bit simple, so I suppose that was a bit of a giveaway. So. America. LISTEN UP!!! I realize that he has a lot of friends in Hollywood, but I think the kindest thing to do surely, rather than to cast him in lead parts in multimillion dollar movies, would be to send him home and call the doctor. Surely none of us want to risk losing this brilliant leading actor when all that is needed is a kind word, some bed rest and possibly some sort of enema? I'm tired of watching this great man suffer just so some studio exec can set fire to yet another five dollar bill and shove it down some stripper's g-string. Have some compassion, PLEASE!!!"

They all have New York City accents and they use Yiddish words, and they all have trade mark noses. (I am a Jew). Why are two of the children on the train the very children who would have the biggest doubts about Christmas: the Jerry Lewis clone (another stereotypical Jew) and the poverty-stricken little boy who had never had a Christmas -- completely ignored and only the WASP kid from Minnesota got a Lesson of some very vague kind? Why was the Black girl there, except to heap more unhappiness on the poor kid by burbling about how Christmas is about parties, gifts, decorations and, in fact, commercialism -- and why does she remain clueless when clearly the poor child is made more unhappy by her burbling? Is she the PC version of the vacuous little rich girl?<br/><br/>And why does the North Pole look like North Philly, with Muzak on a 45 rpm record thrown in? Who would relate to that?<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie for the visuals, but I would not take a child over the age of 8 to see it. They will ask way too many questions and you wn't be able to give them any answers."

","I don't have a lot of reviews but I'll review this movie. I can see why audiences like and don't like this movie. I like this movie because I saw it in 3D and I like a lot of the scenery. Also, the boy believing in the end was kinda nice. I read this book about 25 years ago or so, and remember that I liked it. I can see kids liking this movie in general, regardless. But things I didn't like about this movie: 1. Most characters were flat, aside from the conductor. They didn't have a lot of uniqueness to them, and there was not a lot of character development. There was not a lot of strong character dynamics going on. And the annoying blond boy w/ the glasses, was just so over the top, he overwhelmed the main characters. A lot of the characters were creepy, like the quiet boy and the black girl. But animation is very difficult, so I can overlook some aspects of the way the characters creepily move. But even besides their movement, they were still creepy, like that quiet boy. 2. The movie had a cheeseball effect to it, like how the quiet boy and the black girl are singing that cheeseball song outside of the train, while they're looking into the night sky. I also thought Aerosmith singing in the end was out of place w/ the whole movie, and was the cheesiest of cheeseballs. 3. The elves were creepy and seemed mean. If I would have made this movie, I would have made the elves cute, jolly, and spiritedly. And I would have had one special elf pop out from the crowd that is memorable. 4. The whole movie is this journey to the north pole, but when they get there, the place is all empty and desolate, that is creepy and depressing. I would have made the place ""happening,"" w/ elves walking around, doing things, etc. 5. There are too many superfluous things about the movie, like the lost ticket, the homeless guy having coffee w/ the kid. Just things like that to stretch the movie out. But I understand this was good for 3-D reasons. 6. The movie was often creepy, like when the main character the little brown haired boy was trapped in that dark room full of puppets. 7. tom hanks playing 6 characters didn't work for me. 8. I wish santa was better looking and more jolly looking and nice looking. Well, if I made the movie I wouldn't have made it creepy, and I would have done more character development, and involvement, and get more of a plot going, and lose all the superfluous stuff, or not spend so much time on it, but still be able to get a good 3d effect. I would have made the friendships more meaningful and special, like the kids in the movie, stand by me, or something. I would have done anything to this movie to make it a good movie, whether it agreed w/ the book or not. sometimes i don't think you can literally translate a book to a movie, you can easily end up w/ a bad movie. i would definitely have not given it the cheeseball effect w/ aerosmith. well things are easier said than done, but that's what i would have done. regardless i was glad i saw this movie, and like i said, i loved the 3/d and the scenery. if u wanna see good plot, character development, script, and animation, go see the incredibles."

","As a firm believer in movies being able to ruin a perfectly good book, I worried about what might happen to my love of Polar Express after seeing the film. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did the film recreate the feeling and overall emotion of the children's story, it captured the entire aura of Christmas and created an almost completely believable world. I absolutely loved it. I recommend that everyone go see Polar Express this holiday season. I don't think you'll be disappointed. The imagery gave me chills and the characters completely drew me in. The music was both classic and inspiring and I think 3D animation is the only way in which the magic of the tale could possibly be portrayed.

","I have read the comments of some who claim that this movie contains no story or that the script is weak, etc. I can only say that there are a few things you need to consider: 1) the plot of the movie comes from a children's book (not War & Peace people) and therefore the creators had to add a good amount of ""filler"" for lack of a better term. The title is almost self-explanatory. It's a children's movie. For some of you, no one, expect maybe your own sense of intelligence or ego, is going to be bruised. 2) don't let the plot fly UNDER your head. This isn't a high-brow Henry V and it doesn't contain as many plot twists as The Lion in Winter. If you are looking for a deep plot, this isn't the film for you. <br/><br/>3) the plot relates to both children and adults who can still remember the excitement of Christmas Day, however faintly. If your children can't think (I don't mean that negatively) maturely enough, then they might miss the entire, but not all, of the experience of the movie. If you or your children are only entertained by explosions, then you or your children might be bored with the film. Perhaps you or your children will get it when ""you get older."" 4) the film isn't a comedy. See The Incredibles if you are looking for that. <br/><br/>Summary: I think this film will begin to do better in the box office once children are done seeing The Incredibles. This film may even become a holiday classic. I won't comment on the animation since that's been done. The film asks you to have faith. In the United States, you don't have to have faith in God, government, your neighbors, or anything for that matter. But why not at least have faith in yourself? <br/><br/>P.S.= This review refers to the 2-D theatrical version."

The tale of new friendships and simple faith - a belief in something which others may doubt is so appropriate at this time of the year. I was crying by the end of it.

","I must say I was looking forward to this film since I heard of its existence. The night before my wife and I were scheduled to see it in the cinema I went through the Polar Express movie homepage and discovered the IMAX 3D version of the film. We(I) decided that we had to see it in the full glory of a 5 story screen and in the 3D. It being my first such movie I was astounded, the visuals are amazing, although that word alone does not do it justice. The best way to describe them is that toward the end of the film, I tried to brush away a snowflake falling on my leg, only to realize, AFTER I had done so, that it was not real. The locomotive and different railroad elements are spot on. Being trained as a volunteer steam locomotive fireman/engineer I know a lot of the equipment and how it should behave. I found not one error, and their inclusion of railroad slang was perfect for the situations/time they were in. The story is remarkable and I will not ruin any of it but I must say that I fought tears through several parts of the film. My only complaint is the ""Rockin' On Top of the World"" song by Stephen Tyler, it just doesn't fit the feel of the movie, however, the rest of the score is again superb. With this one fault there is still no way I can describe how fantastic this film is in the 3D and most likely out.

To paraphrase my 14-year old daughter and her friend with their own slanguage: It was totally without a story. It was like all specially effecty and stuff, and that was cool, but it was no story. Little kids liked it, but it was so boring for older people.<br/><br/>I think that gets to the heart of why I rated it a 4. Success in animation has grown, mostly through Pixar, by offering up movies that have appeal across the age spectrum. Toy Story, Nemo, Shrek 1 and particularly Shrek 2 thrilled little kids while giving plenty of laughs and enjoyment to older kids and especially parents who would otherwise be struggling to stay awake in movies like Polar Express."

","Hopped aboard the Polar Express last night at a media preview at the IMAX in Chicago's Navy Pier. I can't honestly remember the last 3-D movie I went to, but the effect in this marvelous film is nothing short of jaw dropping. With my Harry Caray-sized specs on, it took a few minutes to adjust to the dazzling 3-D presentation, but once immersed, the amazing imagery never failed to deliver. <br/><br/>Obvious highlights are the lost ticket sequence, the runaway train in the ice field, and the hobo skiing sequence. I had a visceral reaction during these intense scenes, but there are many other subtle moments where the depth of realism will draw the viewer into the action. Watch as snowflakes waft within reach, ticket snips shower seemingly within inches of your eyes, or try not to reach out and grab onto a caribou antler as they argue with a red-bearded engineer in their native language. <br/><br/>I've read a few mediocre ""professional"" reviews of this film's treatment of the original story, including one which found the children's faces disturbing. I found the screenplay to be a wonderful upgrade to the book, but I confess that the technical visual achievement(and audio, for that matter) overwhelmed my appreciation of the plot. <br/><br/>I'm certain the standard 35mm print will look terrific, but to see it 7 stories high in breathtaking 3-D is unlike anything I have ever seen in a theater. Drive the few extra miles if you have to, but find this on the BIG screen and put on the goofy glasses. You'll never forget the experience."

","Tom Hanks plays the train conductor of a magical train heading for the North Pole. Based on a storybook written by Chris Van Allsburg, the Christmas story tells of a boy who has reached an age when he begins to have doubts believing in Santa. Late one Christmas Eve, the young boy is lying awake waiting for the sound of sleigh bells ringing from Santa's sleigh. Five minutes to midnight his room begins to shake, and he hears a thunderous sound outside his window. The boy jumps from his bed and sees a train in the middle of his street. The boy grabs his robe and rushes out the front door to look at the train. The train's conductor asks the boy if he is getting aboard. The boy asks, 'where are you going?' 'To the North Pole, of course, this is the Polar Express!' At the last minute, the boy jumps on the train and finds other young boys and girls going to the North Pole. Their adventure begins.<br/><br/>The Polar Express movie uses a new animation technique known as 'Performance Capture' that allows an actor to act rather than just supply the voice. The actor is dressed in a suit with computer-chips placed on it, and the computer captures the actor's live action movements, including facial expressions. The animation looks so real that you almost forget it is Computer Generated (CG). For example, when the three children are in the back of the caboose, you can see their hair moving in the wind. With CG, Tom Hanks was able to play 5 parts: the train conductor, the ghostly hobo, Santa Claus, the boy's father, and the boy. I didn't know that Tom played the boy until I read the credits. The film will become a Christmas classic, and I highly recommend this movie for the whole family. I want to see it again just to see what I missed the first time. CG is not cheap; the movie cost $165 million to make. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Run time 1:40, Rated G) (10/10)"

","When I was a child, my parents would read The Polar Express for my brother and I (and later my sister) on Christmas Eve. It was a magical story, and it'll stick with me for years. <br/><br/>So in 1999, when I read about a CGI Polar Express movie,I was psyched and couldn't wait for it. For 6 years I'd waited for signs of it coming, feasting on all the rumors and information that came out about it.<br/><br/>Today, thanks to my school, I went to see and advanced screening of the film with my family.. It was worth the wait. <br/><br/>The film retained the magic of the book while still adding enough original elements to make it a feature film. I give this movie 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, 10/10, whatever rating system you use. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of the book, or a Christmas lover, then I highly recommend this film. If your looking for a good family film, I still recommend it.<br/><br/>In fact, I'm waiting for the release date so I can see it again. *****"

","I took my 3 1/2 year old to a preview screening in Broomfield, Colorado. Not being particularly enamoured of either trains or children's movies, I had steeled myself for an indifferent 1 hr 40 mins. How wrong I was...<br/><br/>Putting it bluntly, this film is magical - an instant classic. A must-see this Christmas season. The animation, reminiscent of Rotoscoping, is an absolute joy, with the imagery and atmosphere lifted seamlessly from the book. The book has been fleshed out with some interesting, mysterious - at times scary - and hilarious characters. The dialogue is top-notch, and the story riveting. Surprisingly, this film contains a great deal of action. The scene crossing the ice floe is masterful and your pulse will race on numerous occasions. There are some musical interludes, and an interesting cameo by an elfin rocker...<br/><br/>While covering familiar territory, the film somehow avoids sentimental clichÃ© so typical of movies in this genre. I challenge all of you cynical nay-sayers to see this movie and remain unmoved. My son was transfixed, as was the entire auditorium, and I noticed several guys in the Men's restroom after the movie blowing their noses... myself included.<br/><br/>Kudos to Tom Hanks and the crew. I rate this a 9/10 and recommend without reservation. Fantastic, wholesome, fun entertainment. Raises the bar and establishes a new benchmark in festive fare."
